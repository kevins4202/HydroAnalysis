12565,dyes and organic matters which are highly toxic to marine life and form a large part of industrial waste are commonly used colorants in textile and other related industries extractions of methylene orange dye and humic acid organic matter solution were investigated by using polymer inclusion membrane pim pim was made of poly vinyl chloride pvc and cellulose triacetate cta as base polymer trioctylamine toa as a carrier and methyltrioctyl ammonium chloride aliquat 336 as a plasticizer the composition of the components was changed to determine the optimum composition of the membrane with better extraction ability 10 ppm methylene orange and 100 ppm humic acid solution were passed through the produced membranes synthetic solutions prepared in the feed phase and hcl in the receiving phase were added in the system and the experiment continued until the system came to equilibrium the pim 6 membrane containing 40 wt pvc 40 wt a336 and 20 wt toa had the highest removal efficiency of dye 93 57 and the highest organic matter removal efficiency 86 03 when the performance of pim was examined it was observed that it was an excellent method for the removal of dyes and organic substances from industrial wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cellulose triacetate extraction methylene orange dye organic matter polymer inclusion membrane wastewater treatment data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction accessibility of water which is of vital importance for all living things has declined in recent years 1 for this the treatment and reuse of wastewater are very important 2 in particular the wastewater of industries that consume too much water needs to be treated and reused in processes the textile industry which uses a lot of water and chemicals is the most significant of these sectors it s known that various dyes and chemicals are used in textile industries for cleaning bleaching dyeing printing and finishing 3 the dyes used in these parts include various structural dyes such as acidic reactive basic disperse azo diazo and metal complex dyes these dyes have different chemical structures according to the substituted functional groups cationic dyes dissolve in water and produce colored cations in solution 4 overuse of dyes will produce a significant amount of colored wastewater that affects water quality therefore its discharge with wastewater is an important problem because color is the first pollutant to be recognized in wastewater and even a small amount in water is undesirable 5 6 water pollution from dyes will affect downstream beneficial use such as recreation drinking water irrigation and others it is particularly difficult to remove by conventional wastewater treatment because it is stable to the substance and resistant to aerobic bio oxidation 7 when wastewater methods containing dyestuffs were examined many physico chemical methods such as adsorption 8 photocatalytic processes 9 coagulation oxidative treatment 10 electrochemical treatment 11 and membrane separation were developed 12 14 also chemical precipitation oxidation reverse osmosis ion exchange and liquid liquid membrane can be used 15 however these methods and techniques have limitations due to high energy consumption and expensive synthetic chemicals 16 also these methods produce large amounts of toxic sludge and are ineffective at lower dye concentrations to overcome this problem membrane technology has become an attractive alternative option for industrial water and wastewater treatment in recent years membrane technology has been known as an important process for water and wastewater treatment this is due to its high productivity high capacity cost effectiveness easy scale up simplicity of operation and no chemical additives 17 among membrane technologies liquid membranes have gained an important role for their use in separation purification or analytical application in various fields such as biomedicine ion selective electrodes waste treatment and hydrometallurgy 18 among these membranes the polymer inclusion membrane pim has better mechanical properties good chemical resistance and low preparation cost 19 20 it is a type of liquid membrane that has been successfully used for the removal and recovery of metal ions and organic solutes pims are more preferred than solvent extraction method because they do not contain large amounts of organic solvents and are more environmentally friendly also the operation of pims is more suitable where extraction and stripping occur simultaneously with high selectivity of transport ion 21 three materials are primarily used in pims these are the plasticizer carrier and base polymer one of the most popular polymers is cta it is really strong with hydroxyl and acetyl groups cta a polar polymer may generate strongly orientated hydrogen bonds it is mildly hydratable and has a highly crystalline structure studies have demonstrated that cta is more hydrophilic than other polymers and that it performs better in transport applications 22 the second most popular polymer is pvc which has a high degree of flexibility and strength and is stable in both basic and acidic conditions 23 24 additionally it is an amorphous polymer with little to no hydration and low crystallinity however the performance of membranes is impacted by pvc s molecular weight metals for instance are transferred more readily than membranes made of low molecular weight pvc 25 examining the pvc investigations it was shown that the generated membranes were less hydrophilic and hence slower to transport 26 28 additionally pvc made membranes are more stable a plasticizer a different substance is used to soften and increase the flexibility of the polymer additionally it enables the transfer of metal species across the membrane and boosts their chemical and mechanical stability according to studies a rise in plasticizer concentration leads to an increase in transport rate 29 the carrier is the last substance to be utilized the target material with membranes containing polymers is typically transported via carriers additionally the selectivity and stability of the polymer containing membranes have a role in controlling the transport rate for these carriers 30 aliquat 336 is a commonly employed carrier in the creation of pim because of its adaptability and cost 31 in this research pvc and cta were chosen as base polymers and the effect of both aliquat 336 and toa on membrane performance was investigated the main focus is the examination of the removal performance of methylene orange mo and humic acid both separately and also the selected membrane which has the best results was used for extracting the mixture of them for this the effect of the polymers carriers and plasticizers was examined to date many studies have shown that pims are promising and successful in removing various metal ions however the pim study for dye removal and organic matter is still new and has rarely been reported this research aims to establish a new method for the simultaneous removal of dye and organic matter using a batch reactor consisting of pim 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals the base polymers were cellulose triacetate cta and poly vinyl chloride pvc mw 80 000 g mol arkema was the provider of the base polymers also these polymer s solvents were chloroform and tetrahydrofuran respectively trioctylamine toa 98 and mw 353 67 g mol and methyltrioctyl ammonium chloride aliquat 336 97 0 and mw 404 16 g mol were utilized as carriers and plasticizers hydrochloric acid 37 was employed in the experiment s transport and was acquired from sci the 10 mg l dye solution and 100 mg l humic acid solution were bought from cpa chem fig 1 additionally sigma aldrich provided all the ingredients needed to make polymer inclusion membranes 2 2 membrane preparation different types of membranes were created using pvc or cta aliquat 336 and toa first of all the base polymer was dissolved in 10 ml of chloroform for cta and tetrahydrofuran for pvc and then the plasticizers and carriers were added to the solution at room temperature the solution was mixed for 2 h then the mixture was poured into a 9 0 cm diameter glass ring that was set on a flat glass plate a filter paper and glass were used to cover the mixture which allowed the solvent to slowly evaporate for 24 h leaving behind a clear and flexible circular pim to make the glass plate s peeling off easier it was submerged in water all membranes were shown in table 1 2 3 h cell device set up a h cell device was used to see the effect of produced membranes on dye and organic matter extraction fig 2 this system is divided into two parts the feed part and the receiver part 10 ppm mo solution 250 ml was prepared for dye experiments in the feed part and 100 ppm humic acid solution 250 ml was prepared for organic matter experiments hydrochloric acid solution 37 250 ml was placed in the receiving part for the dye and organic matter ions to pass from the feed phase to the receiver phase homogeneously they were kept in equal volume 250 ml in both phases and mixed at the same mixing speed 600 rpm samples were taken from both parts at the beginning of the experiment every 15 min and then every 30 min for a total of 3 h and the extraction was examined using a uv vis spectrophotometer then the absorbance of mo and humic acid were determined by the uv vis spectrophotometer at 462 nm and 298 nm wavelength respectively the percent of extraction efficiency e was calculated as the following eqs 1 2 32 1 extraction efficiency influent dye effluent dye influent dye 100 2 extraction efficiency influent organic matter effluent organic matter influent organic matter 100 the following equation can be used to predict the kinetics of dye and organic matter transport across the pim 33 3 ln c c i k t where k is the rate constant s 1 t is the time of transport s c is the metal ion concentration m in the source phase at a specific time and ci is the initial metal ion concentration in the source phase the plot of ln c ci vs time was used to determine the value of the rate constant k following that the permeability coefficient p was determined using eq 4 33 4 p v a k where a is the membrane s effective area and v is the volume of the aqueous source phase the initial flux value ji was subsequently calculated using 5 j i p c i eq 6 was used to obtain the recovery factor percentage rf 32 6 recovery factor rf c i c c i 100 3 result and discussion in pim the transport was mainly carried out by a carrier which is either a complexing agent or an ion exchanger the complex or ion pair formed between the ion and the extractant becomes soluble in the membrane and facilitates ion transport across the membrane the presence of carrier and plasticizer in pim assisted dye transport to occur in this study pims containing cta and pvc as base polymers with different ratios of carrier and plasticizer were produced table 1 experiments were carried out using both mo and humic acid as organic matter using the membranes 3 1 dye extraction performance this section examined the dye extraction tests on all manufactured membranes after 15 min removal effectiveness dramatically enhanced with high extraction efficiency values 93 57 cationic dye forms were removed through the hydrophobic membrane as seen in fig 3 the dye extraction of the pims without the addition of carrier and plasticizer is very low compared to other pims the reason for this is that the carrier or the plasticizer must be present in the pims and in this way they can transition from the feed phase to the receiving phase in addition it was observed that the performances increased considerably as a result of the addition of carriers and plasticizers according to this study the best removal efficiency was shown by using the pim 6 membrane 3 1 1 effect of the base polymer recently although pims have been produced using different polymers the base polymers that give the best performance are cta and pvc the dye extraction performances of the membranes produced with these two polymers were investigated the performance of pims without carrier and plasticizer gave the lowest result among both polymers as explained in section 3 1 however the performance of membranes containing pvc pim 6 is slightly higher than that of cta pim 3 the same trend was observed as a result of the addition of carriers and plasticizers this proved that pvc polymer gave better performance than cta polymer especially in dye extraction 3 1 2 effect of plasticizer typically aliquat 336 uses an ion exchange method to remove mo ion transport through the pim is made easier by the complex or ion pair that was created between the ion and the extractant and was solubilized in the membrane mo loses one positively charged atom in water solution and acquires a negative charge so3 22 aliquat 336 acts as a plasticizer because it is used with toa in this study in membranes with cta based polymers as the ratio of aliquat 336 increased dye extraction decreased and in membranes with pvc based polymers as the ratio of aliquat 336 increased dye extraction increased 3 1 3 effect of carrier in this study toa was chosen as the carrier which is the most important factor in the transport of the desired substance in dye extraction studies when the pims systems are studied the transport occurs as chemical interactions between acids and toa at both aqueous membrane interfaces diffusion of acids through the aqueous stationary films of the feed and strip phases diffusion of toa and acid complexes in the membrane phase 34 when the studies in the literature are examined it has been stated that toa used in membrane production is a promising material for volatile liquid solvent separation through the pervaporation process 35 in addition as a result of the complex formed with ions as a carrier it facilitated the ion extraction from the membrane by being shuttled from the feed solution membrane interface to the membrane stripping solution interface 36 examining the viscosity of the extractants alone the viscosity of toa is 7 94mpas while the viscosity of aliquat 336 is 1176 5 mpas however as the exact mechanism of action of the synergistic toa aliquat 336 system is still unclear it is difficult to relate this extraction to specific reactions unlike single extractors such as toa this highlights the synergy phenomenon that occurs with the two extractants used together the extraction mechanism mainly involves toa which extracts the undissociated form of the acid therefore toa will play a leading role compared to aliquat 336 34 it was observed that the transport rates increased as a result of increasing the concentration of toa 37 an increase in dye extraction was observed in membranes with cta based polymers as the toa ratio increased and a decrease in dye extraction was observed in membranes with pvc based polymers as the toa ratio increased table 2 shows the variation of the rate constants the permeability coefficients of dye and recovery factors rf after 3 h versus different types of membrane the recovery factor of dye was the highest above 93 6 at pim 6 according to the table the initial flux of dye was approximately the same by using only base polymers after the addition of plasticizers and carriers the flux of dyes was increased the highest recovery factor and the initial fluxes of dye transport were obtained by using the pim 3 and pim 6 according to experiments pim 3 and pim 6 were approximately the same results for dye extraction 3 2 organic matter extraction performance in this section organic matter extraction experiments of all membranes produced were examined removal efficiency increased significantly after 20 min in this section organic matter extraction was carried out using the produced membranes according to other membranes as shown in fig 4 the organic matter extraction of the membranes without the addition of a carrier and plasticizer is quite low the carrier or plasticizer must be present in the pims for them to pass from the feed phase to the receiving phase which is the reason for this additionally it was noted that the combination of the carrier and plasticizer significantly improved the results 3 2 1 effect of base polymer as explained in section 3 1 1 cta and pvc are the main base polymers with the best performance the organic matter removal capabilities of membranes made with these two polymers were investigated according to section 3 2 the performance of membranes without a carrier or plasticizer produced the poorest results of the two polymers the performance of pvc however is somewhat better than that of cta the addition of the carrier and plasticizer caused the same tendency to be seen this shows that pvc polymer performed better than cta polymer particularly when it came to organic matter extraction 3 2 2 effect of plasticizer when aliquat 336 is used alone it serves as both a carrier and a plasticizer however when aliquat 336 is combined with another carrier it serves simply as a plasticizer 38 in this investigation it serves as a plasticizer in membranes with cta based polymers as the ratio of aliquat 336 increased organic matter extraction decreased and in membranes with pvc based polymers as the ratio of aliquat 336 increased organic matter extraction increased 3 2 3 effect of carrier the most crucial element in the transfer of the desired chemical in organic matter extraction research toa was selected as the carrier in this investigation in membranes made of cta based polymers organic matter extraction enhanced as the toa ratio increased but in membranes made of pvc based polymers organic matter extraction decreased as the toa ratio increased table 3 shows the variation of the rate constants the permeability coefficients of humic acid and recovery factors rf after 3 h versus different types of membrane the recovery factor of humic acid was the highest above 86 03 at pim 6 according to the table the initial flux was approximately the same by using only base polymers after the addition of plasticizers and carriers the flux was increased the highest recovery factor and the initial fluxes of humic acid transport were obtained by using the pim 6 the all pims removal efficiency of dye and organic matter and also the view of membranes after experiments were shown in table 4 3 3 both dye and humic acid extraction performance in this section an extraction experiment was performed using the best pim pim 6 with a solution containing both 10 ppm methylene orange dye solution and 100 ppm humic acid synthetic solution removal efficiency increased significantly fig 5 shows the extraction performance of pim with the addition of carrier and plasticizer this is because the pims need to have a carrier or plasticizer to move from the feed phase to the receiving phase during this experiment it was observed that the dye passed from the feed phase to the acceptor phase and the membrane surface in organic matter since the molecular weight of humic acid 227 17 g mol is lower than that of the methylene orange dye 327 33 g mol humic acid was preferred 3 4 comparison with literature data the primary purpose of this section is to compare the studies on the production of pims and the extraction of both dye and organic matter solution a summary of the studies carried out in the related literature is given in table 5 below this table shows pim studies for different dye removal but does not include studies on humic acid as there is no pim study for humic acid in the literature this study will be the first study of humic acid extraction using pims when our study was compared with the studies in the literature it was observed that the dye removal efficiencies were close to each other however in studies in the literature different materials were used in pim production and dyes with higher molecular weights were transported in our study both fewer materials were used in membrane production and higher results were obtained by using dyes with lower molecular weight in addition there is no study in the literature in which both dye and humic acid are prepared and used in a mixed solution when these studies were examined it was observed that the studies on dye extraction were new and could be improved it was observed that there was no study on organic matter and therefore the study in this article was innovative and pioneering 4 conclusion as a result of this study it has been demonstrated pims are an easy and effective method for the extraction of dye and organic matter from wastewater the present study has shown that the extraction process has been carried out successfully in this method cta and pvc were used as base polymer aliquat 336 as a plasticizer and toa as a carrier the extraction process was carried out in the form of transporting the dye and organic matter in the feed part to the receiving phase by pims in this study the change in membrane content is one of the parameters affecting membrane extraction the membrane containing 40 wt of pvc 40 wt of aliquat 336 and 20 wt of toa pim 6 provided the best result in methylene orange dye solution and humic acid extraction with 93 57 and 86 03 removal respectively for further studies both synthetic and real wastewater experiments can be carried out by changing the type and concentration of dye and organic matter used in the feeding phase in addition the performance of the membrane can be increased by adding different types of nanoparticles to the membrane content declaration of competing interest the authors have no affiliation with any organization with a direct or indirect financial interest in the subject matter

recovery factor and the initial fluxes of humic acid transport were obtained by using the pim 6 the all pims removal efficiency of dye and organic matter and also the view of membranes after experiments were shown in table 4 3 3 both dye and humic acid extraction performance in this section an extraction experiment was performed using the best pim pim 6 with a solution containing both 10 ppm methylene orange dye solution and 100 ppm humic acid synthetic solution removal efficiency increased significantly fig 5 shows the extraction performance of pim with the addition of carrier and plasticizer this is because the pims need to have a carrier or plasticizer to move from the feed phase to the receiving phase during this experiment it was observed that the dye passed from the feed phase to the acceptor phase and the membrane surface in organic matter since the molecular weight of humic acid 227 17 g mol is lower than that of the methylene orange dye 327 33 g mol humic acid was preferred 3 4 comparison with literature data the primary purpose of this section is to compare the studies on the production of pims and the extraction of both dye and organic matter solution a summary of the studies carried out in the related literature is given in table 5 below this table shows pim studies for different dye removal but does not include studies on humic acid as there is no pim study for humic acid in the literature this study will be the first study of humic acid extraction using pims when our study was compared with the studies in the literature it was observed that the dye removal efficiencies were close to each other however in studies in the literature different materials were used in pim production and dyes with higher molecular weights were transported in our study both fewer materials were used in membrane production and higher results were obtained by using dyes with lower molecular weight in addition there is no study in the literature in which both dye and humic acid are prepared and used in a mixed solution when these studies were examined it was observed that the studies on dye extraction were new and could be improved it was observed that there was no study on organic matter and therefore the study in this article was innovative and pioneering 4 conclusion as a result of this study it has been demonstrated pims are an easy and effective method for the extraction of dye and organic matter from wastewater the present study has shown that the extraction process has been carried out successfully in this method cta and pvc were used as base polymer aliquat 336 as a plasticizer and toa as a carrier the extraction process was carried out in the form of transporting the dye and organic matter in the feed part to the receiving phase by pims in this study the change in membrane content is one of the parameters affecting membrane extraction the membrane containing 40 wt of pvc 40 wt of aliquat 336 and 20 wt of toa pim 6 provided the best result in methylene orange dye solution and humic acid extraction with 93 57 and 86 03 removal respectively for further studies both synthetic and real wastewater experiments can be carried out by changing the type and concentration of dye and organic matter used in the feeding phase in addition the performance of the membrane can be increased by adding different types of nanoparticles to the membrane content declaration of competing interest the authors have no affiliation with any organization with a direct or indirect financial interest in the subject matter

12566,metal organic frameworks mofs based on amino acids and their derivatives are biocompatible and environmentally friendly and have excellent practical application value in wastewater treatment in this work four mofs based on aspartic acid derivatives were synthesized using zr iv as the central ions and aspartic acid succinic acid fumaric acid and malic acid as organic ligands these were used for the simultaneous removal of phosphorus and arsenic from wastewater the results showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of the aspartic acid based zr asp mof for phosphorus and arsenic v were 88 30 mg p g 1 109 75 mg as g 1 respectively in a single system and 32 00 mg p g 1 and 59 75 mg as g 1 respectively in a binary system of coexisting phosphorus and arsenic these capacities were over a broad ph range of 5 0 9 0 also zr asp can be recycled at least 4 times the langmuir isothermal adsorption model and pseudo second order model can be employed to describe the adsorption behavior of phosphorus and arsenic v well on the mofs based on aspartic acid derivatives in both the single pollutant and two pollutant systems the mechanism of phosphorus and arsenic v reaction on mofs was mainly electrostatic attraction and coordination reaction accompanied by ligand exchange and the hydroxyl group on the surface of the material plays a key role all the results indicated that the synthesized mofs based on aspartic acid derivatives are ideal eco friendly candidates for phosphorus and arsenic v removal in complex actual bodies of water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords eco friendly metal organic frameworks aspartic acid derivatives phosphorus and arsenic v removal adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the past decades excessive discharge of phosphorus and arsenic into water bodies has aroused great concern worldwide although phosphorus is an essential element for the growth of all living things 1 it is also a key factor that causes the eutrophication of freshwater bodies 2 the phosphorus in water mainly comes from human metabolism fertilizers and sewage treatment plants 3 excessive phosphorus discharge leads to the eutrophication of water bodies this results in algal blooms lower oxygen content in water and death of aquatic microorganisms which directly threaten aquatic ecosystems it has been reported that lake eutrophication is accelerated when the concentration of phosphorus in water exceeds 0 02 mg p l 1 4 5 arsenic is widespread and mainly exists in trivalent and pentavalent forms these are highly carcinogenic and extremely toxic they have seriously endangered the health of the world population and they have been reported as a high poison all over the world 6 natural processes such as the weathering of minerals volcanic activity and forest fires as well as human activities such as mining smelting and oil burning are all responsible for the accumulation and release of arsenic 7 the agency for research on cancer iarc has claimed that arsenic is a human carcinogen 8 long term exposure to high levels of arsenic poses a great threat to the human body and can cause cancers such as the skin liver kidney and lungs 9 to minimize the threat that arsenic poses to human health the world health organization who limits the maximum concentration of arsenic in drinking water to 10 μg l 1 10 at present there have been many cases of phosphorus and arsenic jointly polluting water bodies and yangzonghai lake is an example in 2008 the water quality of yangzonghai which is a large plateau lake of 31 km2 and with 600 million cubic meters of water in yunnan province of china was reduced from class i to the inferior class v because of arsenic pollution that was caused by the illegal discharge from a fertilizer enterprise this poses a great threat to the lives and property of coastal residents from 2009 to 2019 our research team reduced the arsenic concentration in the lake from 128 μg as l 1 to 26 μg as l 1 using iron salt flocculation 11 however there are still a large number of springs that contain high concentrations arsenic v and phosphorus along the yangzonghai coast and these still pose a great hazard to the water quality of yangzonghai therefore it is urgent to further control the concentration of phosphorus and arsenic v in spring water to date many methods have been employed for the removal of phosphorus and arsenic v from water 12 13 among them the adsorption method is considered to be one of the preferred approaches because of its advantages of low cost simple design and operation excellent efficiency and a good recovery effect 14 15 adsorbents that are commonly used for the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v include carbon based materials resin ldhs and minerals 16 18 however because of their weak binding force with anions the use of adsorbents leads to poor selectivity resulting in low overall adsorption performance and they are not suitable for large scale application in practical engineering 19 metal organic frameworks mofs are crystalline porous materials composed of metal nodes and organic ligands that bond through coordination bonds 20 21 mofs have outstanding performance such as their remarkable competitiveness in terms of their large specific surface area adjustable pore size good porosity large topology difference and good hydrothermal stability thus mofs also have possible adsorption capacity for phosphorus and arsenic v in water 22 23 recently various mofs have been used for the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v from wastewater e moumen et al reported that the phosphorus adsorption capacity of an al based mof with trimesic acid as the ligand was 23 17 mg p g 1 at ph 8 24 a renewable metal organic skeleton of mof 808 was prepared in a microwave oven and the maximum adsorption capacity of arsenic v was 24 83 mg as g 1 25 despite the rapid development of mofs there are still opportunities and challenges to some extent in terms of their safety impact on the environment and human health toxicity is one of the important factors that restrict the mass commercial application of mofs 26 the metal sources organic linkers and solvents selected in the synthesis of mofs may have an impact on the toxicity of mofs 27 examples of heavy metal ions that have frequently been used in mofs included mil 100 cr 28 cadmium based mof 29 and pb mof 30 excessive chromium can damage the skin and respiratory tract cadmium absorption can cause osteoporosis in humans and serious damage to kidney function lead poisoning is a serious health problem most organic ligands used in the synthesis of mofs are carboxylate phosphonate sulfonate imidazolate phenolate and amines the degradation process of mofs will show the characteristics of raw materials for instance human contact with terephthalic acid can cause mild respiratory irritation and exposure to bp can stimulate skin eye and respiratory contact 27 in addition because of the good porosity of mofs solvents become trapped inside by various means during synthesis these retained organic solvents may cause toxic side effects the previous report has shown that exposure to chloroform can lead to liver and renal toxicity and exposure to dimethylformamide dmf can cause nausea and vomiting 27 these effects hinder the synthesis of biocompatible environmentally friendly mofs meanwhile the water stability of mof materials is a decisive factor in determining whether or not materials can be used 31 stable mofs have large steric hindrances and strong metal ligand bonds and thus they can maintain their structure in the presence of water molecules 31 following the principle of hard soft acid base hsab theory 32 the metal carboxylic acid skeleton composed of oxygen ligands carboxylic acid ligands and high valence metal ions results in a stable mof formed that forms via the combination of a hard base and hard acid and this is the type of mof that is receiving wide attention at present at present developing mofs that are highly stable and have no or low harmful environmental effects and superior performance is one of the major challenges both inorganic metal and organic ligands exhibit minimal toxicity and this is beneficial to the synthesis of environmentally compatible mofs high valence metals such as al3 fe3 ti4 and zr4 have a large natural abundance and their complexes have long term stability thus they are harmless to humans 33 particular attention has been paid to the use of zirconium which is an attractive metal in the composition of mofs because of its attractive properties great water stability nontoxicity and low cost commercial availability 34 also designing environmentally compatible mofs with bio ligands has become a hot topic l α amino acids are ideal ligands for the preparation of mofs because of their harmless and abundant natural resources and because of their excellent coordination and bonding ability to a variety of metals under a wide range of chemical conditions 35 however to date there are few examples of mofs that have been constructed with pure l α amino acids using only major group metals transition metals or rare earth metals as metal sources 36 there are fewer three dimensional mofs and this is mainly because the l α amino acid chelation coordination pattern is common among the twenty standard l α amino acids among them aspartic acid is the smallest one aspartic acid consists of two carboxylic acid groups which have a desirable separation distance for a robust bridge connection that is suitable for favorable inorganic nodes crystal structures of a few metal aspartate mofs have been developed so far but they show limited water stability in all cases the zr mof based on the amino acid group named mip 202 zr has 12 zr6 μ3 o 4 μ3 oh 4 nodes and an l aspartic acid spacer that were constructed in water to form a three dimensional framework with a structure of uio 66 type 37 mip 202 zr is prepared using a green and environmentally friendly synthetic method but it is the only reported amino acid based mof that has great water stability and chemical stability however there are no reports on using mip 202 zr for phosphorus and arsenic removal in this work a series of zr mofs based on aspartic acid derivatives were prepared using zr iv as the central metal ions and aspartic acid fumaric acid malic acid and succinic acid as organic ligands with the utilization of water or aqueous non aqueous solvent as the synthesis medium these zr mofs were used to simultaneously remove phosphorus and arsenic from polluted spring water on the coast of yangzonghai lake the characterization of the zr mofs included scanning electron microscopy n2 adsorption desorption analysis x ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis at the same time batch experiments such as isotherms kinetics thermodynamics ph ionic strength coexisting ions and elution cycles were conducted in addition the potential mechanism of zr asp aspartic acid as a ligand was investigated using xps and ftir finally the feasibility of zr asp for phosphorus and arsenic v removal was evaluated through removal experiments of phosphorus and arsenic in actual contaminated spring water this work opens new avenues for developing and using more environmentally friendly and reusable mofs to remove phosphorus and arsenic v from water 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals all of the chemicals were listed in table s1 and fig s1 in supporting information 2 2 preparation of mofs zr aspartic acid zr asp zr fumaric acid zr fum zr succinic acid zr suc and zr malic acid zr mal were synthesized with zr4 as the metal resource and aspartic acid fumaric acid succinic acid and malic acid as organic ligands all of the synthetic methods were discussed in text s1 in supporting information 2 3 characterization of mofs the relevant characterization details for zr mofs were described in text s2 in supporting information 2 4 batch adsorption experiments batch experiments that occurred on the zr mofs discussed the effects that equilibrium concentration reaction time temperature ionic strength ph and coexisting ions have on the adsorption capacity of phosphorus and arsenic v in single or binary coexisting systems each experiment was done three times and the average value was calculated moreover except for individual experiments all of the batch experiments were conducted at an adsorbent dosage of 0 20 g l 1 all of the phosphorus and arsenic v solutions were prepared from phosphate and arsenate except for the isotherm experiment which used an initial concentration that ranged from 5 to 100 mg l 1 the concentration of other properties of batch experiments was 60 mg l 1 of phosphorus or arsenic the mixture of adsorbent and phosphorus or arsenic v solution oscillated periodically in a thermostatic oscillator the concentration of phosphorus in the filtered supernatant was determined by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan the concentration of arsenic v was tested using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 8300 perkinelmer usa the adsorption capacity qe mg g 1 and removal rate r were obtained according to eqs 1 and 2 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 r c 0 c e c 0 100 where qe stands for the equilibrium adsorption capacity c0 and ce represent the initial and equilibrium concentration of phosphorus or arsenic v and v and m are the volumes of solution and mass of adsorbent 2 5 treatment process of real spring water by zr mofs and its recyclability the primary property parameters of yangzonghai spring water were described in table s2 in supporting information to further explore the value of zr mofs in practical application 30 ml samples of untreated spring water were taken and reacted for 24 h with different doses of zr asp furthermore the recyclability of the adsorbents for phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption was evaluated the adsorbent was dispersed in yangzonghai spring water and vibrated at a speed of 250 rpm for 24 h the phosphorus or arsenic v concentration in the supernatant was then determined and the adsorbent was separated after the adsorbent was dried 0 5 mol l 1 naoh was employed to elute phosphorus and arsenic v for 12 h the separated adsorbent was then rinsed with ultrapure water until the ph was neutral after drying a subsequent round of adsorption was conducted 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization fig 1a d exhibits sem images of zr mofs it is clear in fig 1a that the zr asp mof consists of a series of tight junctions of rice like granular solids that have diameters in the range of 0 10 0 25 μm as seen from fig 1b c d zr suc zr fum and zr mal have similar structures this is attributed to the synthesis of the above three kinds of mof based on mip 203 however each mof is slightly different in structure specifically zr suc is assembled from a cylindrical body that has a height of 0 5 1 0 μm it forms a globular body that has a radius of 1 3 μm fig 1b zr fum mof consists of irregular polyhedral particles that have edge lengths of 0 5 1 0 μm and the particles agglomerate into spheroids fig 1c zr mal mof is composed of irregular sheets that has edge lengths of 0 5 1 0 μm the sheets aggregate into spheroids and the surface folds resemble blooming petals fig 1d this could be why the ligands are different the crystal structures of the four synthetic adsorbents were characterized via xrd analysis it can be observed in fig 2a the xrd pattern of the four mofs all present sharp peaks this signifies that zr mofs have great crystallinity 38 also the positions of the characteristic peak of the zr mofs in the xrd patterns coincided with that of the crystal information file this confirms that zr mofs were successfully synthesized zr asp was synthesized using the mip 202 template fig 2b and the last three zr mofs were synthesized using the mip 203 template mip 202 ccdc 1842337 and mip 203 icsd 130986 both have octahedral nodes of zr6 μ3 o 4 μ3 oh 4 the difference is that the zirconium centers of these two are connected to different organic ligands zr suc zr fum and zr mal are the same kind of systems and belong to mip 203 39 zr suc zr fum and zr mal are all isostructural mofs that are based on mip 203 and their xrd peaks are consistent 40 thus they all have the same structure zr fum is used as an example to describe the detailed structural characteristics the results show that zr fum zr6 μ3 o 4 μ3 oh 4 fumarate 4 formate 2 oh 2 h2o 2 are interconnected by fumarate and formate connectors to form the final three dimensional 3d frame fig 2c the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of zr mofs are shown in fig 3a the specific surface areas distribution of pore size and pore volumes of the four mofs were analyzed according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac all of the zr mofs had type iv isotherms fig 3a and fig s2 this means that they are mesoporous materials in the middle section of a type iv isotherm an adsorption hysteresis loop appears and an adsorption saturation plateau appears after capillary condensation is complete finally the zr mofs curve terminates at the inflection point of the platform 41 the specific surface area of zr asp was 334 4023 m2 g 1 the pore volume was 0 400435 cm3 g 1 and the pore size was 4 7899 nm the values of the bet surface area of zr suc zr fum and zr mal were 85 2356 m2 g 1 48 6207 m2 g 1 and 99 9452 m2 g 1 respectively the pore volumes of the three adsorbents were 0 135121 cm3 g 1 0 036453 cm3 g 1 and 0 293460 cm3 g 1 respectively also the values of the pore sizes of zr suc zr fum and zr mal were 6 3411 nm 2 9990 nm and 11 7448 nm respectively the high specific surface area and well organized pores of mofs increase the number of active sites leading to larger defects and more hydroxyls on the surface of mofs which increases the probability of trapping pollutants on the contrary if mofs have lower specific surface area and porosity fewer active sites stable coordination fewer defects fewer surface hydroxyl groups and thus less chance of mo bond formation the thermal stability of the zr mofs was analyzed under the condition of a nitrogen atmosphere and the tga analysis is depicted in fig 3b as seen in the figure zr suc zr fum and zr mal all had three mass loss stages the exception was zr asp which had four mass loss stages before 110 c all of the materials lost weight rapidly and the weight losses for zr asp zr suc zr fum and zr mal were about 10 68 9 54 14 49 and 10 37 respectively these losses contributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water molecules the second rapid weight loss occurred at about 250 c and the mass of all of the samples decreased due to the evaporation of clogged solvent molecules in the inner pores at this stage the weight loss rates of the four materials were 11 77 for zr asp 10 93 for zr suc 4 72 for zr fum and 3 98 for zr mal then in the third stage when the temperature reached 430 c the ligand began to carbonize until the temperature was above 500 c then the mof structure partially collapsed and the weight loss was about 50 42 finally zirconium oxide was the only remaining component of these zr mofs 39 in conclusion zr mofs were widely outstanding and structurally stable and their brilliant structural properties attract us to expand their potential in applications 3 2 isotherms of adsorption for phosphorus and arsenic v the adsorption performances of zr mofs for phosphorus and arsenic v in single and binary systems were studied at 298 k and 250 rpm when the equilibrium concentration rose from 0 mg l 1 to 80 mg l 1 the adsorption capacity of zr mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v in a single system had the same trend specifically both increased and then approached a certain value as shown in fig 4a and c this is because the adsorption sites on mof were completely occupied by phosphorus or arsenic v as seen in fig 4a the adsorption capacities of zr mofs for phosphorus were 88 3 mg p g 1 for zr asp 94 2 mg p g 1 for zr suc 50 mg p g 1 for zr fum and 73 3 mg p g 1 for zr mal as seen in fig 4c the adsorption capacity of arsenic v was 109 75 mg as g 1 for zr asp 127 55 mg as g 1 for zr suc 82 5 mg as g 1 for zr fum and 102 mg as g 1 for zr mal also the adsorption capacity of zr asp for phosphorus and arsenic in the binary system of arsenic v and phosphorus coexistence reached 32 mg p g 1 and 59 75 mg as g 1 respectively the phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption capacities of the adsorbents that were synthesized in this study were compared with those of other materials that have been published in the literature the data comparisons were shown in tables s3 and s4 the adsorption capacity of zr mofs was far superior to that of other adsorbents furthermore the models of langmuir freundlich temkin and d r were taken to describe the adsorption process of phosphorus or arsenic v on mofs and the details of the correlations were presented in text s3 the fitting data of the above models were provided in fig 4b d and f and the parameters were shown in tables s5 s6 and s7 from a comparison of r values the langmuir was the most accurate model to demonstrate the reaction of a single or binary system on zr mofs this showed single homogeneous adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v on the adsorbents to describe whether the adsorption process occurs under favorable conditions this conclusion is verified by calculating the value of rl and eq 3 as follows 43 3 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where kl and c0 represent the langmuir equilibrium constant and the initial concentration rl value that is between 0 and 1 means that the adsorption process proceeds under favorable conditions however a value of rl that is higher than 1 implies that the adsorption process takes place under disadvantageous conditions the data was calculated and the rl values tables s5 s6 and s7 of the zr mofs were all less than 1 these results established that the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v on zr mofs occurred favorably as seen in tables s5 s6 and s7 the bt values of the temkin model were all higher than 0 this indicated that the adsorption of phosphorus or as v by zr mofs was consistent with an exothermic reaction furthermore the free energy e was calculated from the d r model the value of e determines whether or not the adsorption is chemisorption or physical adsorption e is calculated according to eq 4 4 e 1 2 k ad there are three possible outcomes for the process of adsorption first e is in the range of 1 8 kj mol 1 and the adsorption behavior of phosphorus and arsenic v on materials follows physical adsorption second e is among 8 16 kj mol 1 and the interactions between adsorbents and phosphorus and arsenic v are primarily electrostatic third e is greater than 16 kj mol 1 and the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v on mof is chemisorption from the calculations it was determined that the free energy values of the zr mofs adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v were all more than 16 kj mol 1 it was evident that the mechanisms of adsorption by the zr mofs were mainly chemisorption also in the binary system in which phosphorus and arsenic coexisted the fitting results were consistent with those of the single systems of phosphorus or arsenic this indicated that the adsorption mechanism of zr asp in systems with coexisting phosphorus and arsenic was also chemisorption in addition the maximum phosphorus uptake by zr asp was less than that of arsenic v and this is consistent with the result that the diameter of aso4 3 is larger than that of po4 3 3 3 adsorption kinetics for the removal of phosphorus and arsenic v the effect that time has on the zr mofs adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v was studied by keeping other factors constant and changing the reaction time within 3 300 min the results were shown in fig 5a and d the adsorption capacities of phosphorus and arsenic v on zr mofs rose as the process went on when the process went to saturation the maximum adsorption value tended to be a fixed value regardless of how the time changed to further learn about the adsorption process of phosphorus and arsenic v on zr mofs the pseudo first order model pseudo second order model and internal diffusion model were used to fit the data of adsorption kinetics 44 detailed information can be found in text s4 the fitting patterns of phosphorus or arsenic v were described in fig 5a c and d f and the related arguments were given in table s8 according to fig 5b and e r of the zr mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v followed a pseudo second order model meanwhile qe values of the pseudo second order model were consistent with the experimental value table s8 consequently the adsorption kinetics on the zr mofs conformed to the pseudo second order model which implicated that the whole reaction followed chemisorption fig 5c and f showed the internal diffusion models of the four materials for the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v respectively in the internal diffusion kinetics model both stages were adsorption processes this indicated that multiple diffusion mechanisms occurred in the adsorption process of phosphorus or arsenic v as seen in fig 5c and f the first 30 min was the first stage during this period membrane diffusion was the main process and the related fitting parameters of the zr mofs for single phosphorus or arsenic v were listed in table s8 the other stage occurred in the range of 30 300 min and it was a gradual adsorption stage in the meantime the rates of adsorption dropped compared to those of the last stage table s8 notably none of the line segments passed through the original point which indicated that the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v on zr mofs was controlled by multiple kinetics mechanisms e g surface adsorption external mass transfer and intrapore diffusion similar to the single system the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v in the binary system also followed the pseudo second order model fig 5h meanwhile the internal diffusion model of the binary system of phosphorus and arsenic fig 5i also included two stages and the trend was consistent with that of the single system to understand the effect that removing one adsorbate had on the other adsorbate in a multi component system multicomponent adsorption studies were carried out the proportion method was used to investigate the antagonistic and synergistic performances of the multicomponent adsorption system in the proportion method the fractional value of the adsorption capacity in a binary system to that in a single system was calculated using eq 5 45 5 fractional value q m binary q m mono where qm binary and qm mono are the adsorption capacities of the binary system and mono system respectively a fraction greater than 1 indicates that the adsorption is synergistic where the adsorption of one adsorbent is facilitated by the other adsorbent a value less than 1 indicates antagonism and competition between adsorbents occurs in the process of adsorption 45 for zr asp adsorption of phosphorus qm binary was 29 0 mg p l 1 qm mono was 88 3 mg p l 1 and the fractional value calculated using eq 5 was 0 33 this indicated that the presence of arsenic v restrained the adsorption of phosphorus in the binary system and the adsorption had antagonistic properties similarly under the same conditions the calculated arsenic v fraction value was 0 54 and this indicated that the presence of phosphorus slightly inhibited the adsorption process in the binary system moreover arsenate has a higher hydrate radius than phosphate consequently the ion with a higher hydrated radius that is arsenic v has more electrosorption capacity 46 3 4 thermodynamics the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v on zr mofs in the range of 298 328 k was studied to verify the influence that temperature had on the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v the results in fig s3a demonstrated that the temperature was positively correlated with the adsorption capacity of phosphorus or arsenic v on the zr mofs this revealed that increasing the temperature was conducive to the removal of phosphorus and arsenic v to further understand what role temperature played in the reaction the standard enthalpy change h θ standard entropy change s θ and standard gibbs free energy change g θ were calculated for the related adsorption thermodynamics and the results can be seen in text s5 fig s3b showed plots of the relationship between ln k and 1 t and exhibited the results of the linear analysis the fitting results and the related parameters were listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively a positive value of h θ demonstrated that the adsorption reaction was endothermic and the increase in temperature was beneficial for capturing phosphorus or arsenic v a negative value of δg θ indicated that the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v was spontaneous in addition δs θ was calculated and found to be greater than 0 this indicated that as the temperature increased the chaos of the solid liquid interface had the same trend 50 therefore the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v was sensitive to temperature 3 5 effects of ph the distributions of phosphorus and arsenic v species in water depend on changes in the ph of the solution this description was shown in fig s4 a and b solution ph is a remarkable factor that exerted an influence on the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v 44 the dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid and arsenic acid in the solution can be expressed by eqs 6 and 7 6 h 3 po 4 pk 1 h 2 p o 4 h pk 2 hpo 4 2 2 h pk 3 po 4 3 3 h 7 h 3 aso 4 pk 1 h 2 aso 4 h pk 2 haso 4 2 2 h pk 3 aso 4 3 3 h where the values are pk1 2 1 pk2 7 2 and pk3 12 3 for phosphoric acid and the values are pk1 2 2 pk2 6 9 and pk3 11 5 for arsenic acid the adsorption performances of the zr mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v were studied in the range of ph 3 0 to 11 0 the relationship between zr mofs adsorption capacities of phosphorus or arsenic v and ph were presented in fig 6 the adsorption capacities of the four mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v rose slightly from ph 3 0 to 5 0 and then the capacities tended to a constant value at ph 5 0 9 0 this is because the main species of phosphorus or arsenic v are in the forms of h2po4 or h2aso4 which are species that can have strong electrostatic interactions with adsorbents this prompted phosphorus or arsenic v to be efficiently captured in the range of ph 3 0 to 7 0 when the solution ph is higher than 7 2 or 6 96 hpo4 2 or haso4 2 becomes the dominant species in this range there were fewer positive charges on the adsorbent surface which weakened the electrostatic attractions nevertheless the adsorption capacities of the zr mof materials were still very high for both phosphorus and arsenic this result demonstrated that the phosphorus or arsenic v adsorption by zr mofs was in agreement with the kinetics fitting results and this indicated that chemical adsorption was the main process rather than pure electrostatic adsorption the adsorption capacities of the zr mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v reduced significantly between ph 9 0 and 11 0 this was because the number of positive charges on the adsorbent surface reduced dramatically when ph was greater than 9 0 this excluded electrostatic attractions which were not beneficial to the adsorption process in competitive adsorption there was excessive oh and phosphorus or arsenic v this contributed to a decreased amount of phosphorus and arsenic v that adsorbed on the zr mofs also to understand the process of phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption on zr asp an experiment to test ph as a function of time was conducted the results were presented in fig s4c the ph of the solution dropped rapidly from 6 0 to 4 5 within an hour after adding the adsorbent to the phosphorus and arsenic v solution then it increased slowly until reached an equilibrium value of about 4 8 within 6 h during the initial stage of phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption many protons were released from the proton active sites of zr asp into the water and this generated a dramatic decrease in the ph value of the water during this period phosphorus and arsenic v were primarily removed through electrostatic attractions nonetheless the solution ph rose gradually as the reaction progressed and the most likely reason for this was that there was a ligand exchange occurred between the hydroxyl groups in the zr mofs and phosphorus or arsenic v to form a zr o p or zr o as complexation and then released hydroxyl into the solution it was determined that the principal phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption process was internal complex formation and ligand exchange to confirm the structural stability of the zr mofs and whether they cause secondary pollution in water environments the concentration of remanent metal ions in the solution after phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption was also detected it was observed in table s9 that the residual amount of zirconium ions in the solution after phosphorus and arsenic v removal was almost always 0 over the ph range of 3 0 11 0 the concentrations of residual zirconium ions from ph 3 0 to 11 0 were well below that of who recommended zirconium ions content in groundwater 0 2 mg l 1 19 thus it was determined that zr mofs were environmentally friendly in practical applications the above conclusion confirmed that the structures of the zr mofs were quite stable when attacked by water molecules and they had outstanding practical applications and can be widely used in adsorption 3 6 effect of coexisting ions and ionic strength because of the complicated and changeable natural environment there is a great necessity to eliminate the influence that diversiform anions have on the adsorption process several usual anions e g cl so4 2 no3 hco3 and co3 2 may present negative effects on the removal of phosphorus and arsenic v anionic sodium salts were prepared in gradient concentrations e g 20 mg l 1 40 mg l 1 and 60 mg l 1 based on phosphorus or arsenic v solutions of 60 mg p l 1 or 60 mg as l 1 as seen in fig 7a and b when sodium salts were added to the solution cl so4 2 and no3 did not play conspicuous roles in the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v in contrast hco3 and co3 2 did this indicates that these mofs have good selectivity to phosphorus and arsenic v excessive hco3 and co3 2 hydrolysis resulted in the solution ph increasing and becoming alkaline this had an adverse effect on the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v in general the concentration of these two anions studied experimentally was much higher than those in nature interference results for zr suc were presented in fig s5 in the supporting information and had similar results as zr asp in conclusion the zr mof adsorbents used in this study had a strong antijamming ability and it is possible to adsorb phosphorus and treat arsenic v in wastewater that contains many competing species meanwhile the influence that ionic strength has on phosphorus or arsenic v adsorption was studied nacl solutions with concentrations of 0 001 mol l 1 0 01 mol l 1 and 0 1 mol l 1 were prepared with contents of 60 mg p l 1 or 60 mg as l 1 the adsorption results presented in fig 8a and b showed that the adsorption performances of the zr mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v were almost constant with an increase in ionic strength which means that there was no effect that ionic strength played on the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v generally when the adsorption occurred through external surface complexation the adsorption capacity of phosphorus and arsenic v decreased with an increase in ionic strength this was because the external complexation was electrostatic attraction and other impurity anions in the solution competed with phosphorus and arsenic v anions for adsorption sites 47 remarkably when the adsorption mechanism was via an inner complex the adsorption capacity of phosphorus and arsenic v increased or did not change with an increase in ionic strength 48 therefore it had been confirmed that the adsorption mechanism of the zr mofs for phosphorus and arsenic v principally took place via an inner complex 3 7 adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v with low concentrations another challenge in water pollution management was the removal of phosphorus and arsenic v in low concentrations thus it was essential to assess the adsorption performance of the zr mofs for phosphorus and arsenic when they were presenting in low concentrations according to stricter discharge standards and refraining from water eutrophication and arsenic pollution batch experiments were conducted using a laboratory configuration solution with a gradient of concentrations of phosphorus and arsenic e g 0 5 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 fig 9 showed the results when the concentration of coexisting phosphorus and arsenic v in solution was less than 5 0 mg l 1 the efficiency of adsorption was always higher than 95 with the dosage of 1 0 g l 1 zr mofs the results showed that the as synthesized zr mofs were extraordinarily efficient at adsorbing phosphorus and arsenic v when they were in low concentrations this probably offered a viable way to adsorb phosphorus and arsenic from water when they were in low concentrations 3 8 application in real contaminated spring water the feasibility of using zr mofs was evaluated by experiments on yangzonghai spring water yunnan province china the related parameters of spring water at the yangzonghai lake shore were provided in table s2 it is evident in fig 10 with an increase in the zr mof dosage the residual phosphorus and arsenic v concentrations decreased rapidly until they were completely adsorbed the optimum amount of zr mofs adsorbent was 0 4 g l 1 1 0 g l 1 in this dosage range zr asp can reduce the residual concentrations of phosphorus and arsenic v to 0 the application in real spring water further demonstrated the practicality of zr mofs in changeable water environments which indicated that there was a huge potential for applications in environmental protection 3 9 adsorbent regeneration zr asp was used as an example for discussion the elution cycle of the adsorbent was explored and the results were presented in fig 11 the whole reaction was carried out at 298 k and 0 50 mol l 1 naoh was employed as an eluant after 4 cycles the adsorption efficiency of phosphorus and arsenic v in the spring water of yangzonghai lake by zr asp was greater than 80 also the desorption efficiency of zr asp was greater than 80 except for the fourth desorption of zr asp for phosphorus it had been further demonstrated that the structure of this material was pretty stable and thus the practical applications were widely possible and extremely likely the remarkable elution performance and repeated use affirmed that zr asp was a very practical and efficient material and this further confirmed its potential value for phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption from water 3 10 adsorption mechanisms sem mapping was conducted to ulteriorly study whether or not phosphorus and arsenic v were loaded on the zr asp mof and they were described in fig 12 and fig s6 it is clear in fig 12 that phosphorus and arsenic v were well proportioned dispersed on the material in addition it was observed in fig s6a and b that the crystal structure of zr asp maintained its original morphology after adsorption a meticulous contrast of sem images before and after removal indicated that a thin layer of flocculent film adhered to the surface of the material that was adsorbed with phosphorus and arsenic v the content of phosphorus and arsenic v in the material was 14 and 6 respectively and this indicated that phosphorus and arsenic v ions were inset with an effect in the micropores of the material also the adsorbent had an outstanding performance for loading phosphorus and arsenic v furthermore we recorded xrd patterns of zr asp after the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v it is evident in fig s6c the peak shape of zr asp was consistent with that of the fresh synthetic samples however the crystallinity was slightly less therefore the fundamental skeletal structure of zr asp was maintained after adsorption which indicated that the adsorbent was stable the slightly decreased crystallinity may be related to the interaction between zr asp and phosphorus and arsenic the possible mechanism of the adsorption process can also be inferred by zero point charge in fig 13a and fig s7 phpzc over different ph ranges of values were discussed the phpzc values of zr asp and zr suc were 8 808 and 7 705 respectively if the ph is less than phpzc the material is positively charged and is conducive to the adsorption of phosphate and arsenate by electrostatic attraction as ph phpzc the material becomes negatively charged and rejects phosphate and arsenate the process will weaken the performance of adsorption nevertheless it was observed in fig 6a and b even if the value of ph was higher than phpzc there were only small differences in the loading capacities of the four mofs for phosphorus and arsenic v and the values did not reach zero this means that not only electrostatic attraction affected the entire process but the formation of internal complexes did also ftir was taken to understand the changes in the functional groups before and after adsorption to further study the interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent and the spectra were presented in fig 13b and fig s8 according to fig 13b the infrared spectrum of zr asp had a characteristic peak at 3413 75 cm 1 before adsorption and this corresponded to the oh vibration the peaks that were located at 1627 12 cm 1 and 1380 23 cm 1 were vested in the presence of co asymmetry and symmetric stretching of carboxylic acid groups the bands at 1235 86 cm 1 and 1427 75 cm 1 were attributed to the cn bond that connected the carbon chain and amino group nh2 respectively 48 the characteristic peak at 504 67 cm 1 was the zro tensile peak after adsorption there were three sharp peaks in the region of 900 1200 cm 1 these were derived from oh group stretching vibration during the formation of the zr6 octahedron and these were greatly attenuated by the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v a new peak appeared at 1103 50 cm 1 and this was attributed to the stretching vibration of op this indicated that phosphate was coordinated to the central zr ion to form the zrop inner complex 49 50 also after the peak at 504 67 cm 1 vanished there was a new peak at 509 60 cm 1 these observations indicated that phosphate and arsenate interact with metal ions and form zrop and zroas covalent bonds after adsorption after adsorption the strength of the peak at 3422 65 cm 1 was weaker this demonstrated the participation of hydroxyl groups on the material in the reaction of phosphorus and arsenic v this suggested that phosphate and arsenate were adsorbed via the direct binding of substituted hydroxyl groups to zr fig s8 showed that zr suc exhibited the same phenomenon as zr asp after adsorption and the detailed information was presented in text s6 in the supporting information in brief the ftir spectra indicated that the hydroxyl group was superseded by phosphate and arsenate through ligand exchange during the whole adsorption to form a new zrop or zroas bond this discovery was accorded with the conclusion of adsorption kinetics the mechanism of phosphorus and arsenic v removal was further revealed by the analysis of binding energy before and after adsorption and the diagrams were shown in fig 14 the full spectrum described the existence of zr o c and n in zr asp after phosphorus and arsenic v loading two new peaks appeared at 44 79 ev and 133 49 ev 54 this contributed to the p 2p and as 3d peaks and indicated that phosphorus and arsenic v were successfully loaded on the zr asp adsorbents notably the high resolution zr 3d5 2 and zr 3d3 2 spectra fig 14b showed a significant shift in the binding energy from 182 81 ev to 182 65 ev and from 185 12 ev to 185 03 ev it has been convinced that there was an inner complexation consisting of zr and phosphate or arsenate via ligand exchange 55 according to fig 14c the two peaks were attributed to zro and zroh the binding energy of zro shifted from 530 15 to 530 22 ev which corresponded to the formation of zroas or zrop the binding energy of another transferred from 531 61 to 531 54 ev after adsorption the above phenomenon demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups had a principal effect on the reaction connected with the analysis of ftir it can be convinced that there was an ligand exchange between the hydroxyl group moh and phosphate or arsenate and that an internal complex of zrop or zroas formed this might be the primary mechanism of phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption also by fitting the n1s peak fig 14d two peaks located at 399 48 ev and 401 58 ev were obtained these correspond to nh2 and nh3 respectively 51 the binding energy of nh3 decreased from 401 58 ev before adsorption to 401 52 ev after zr asp adsorption and the content increased from 0 88 to 0 91 this indicated that there was electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding between nh3 or nh2 and phosphate or arsenate 52 previous studies have shown that mof materials can trap pollutants via electrostatic attraction and this was consistent with the findings of this study 53 from the above conclusions the mechanism of zr mofs adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v was confirmed to be electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange followed by coordination in the entire adsorption process the ligand exchange occurred because of the replacement of hydroxyl groups zroh in zrmofs by phosphate or arsenate to form zrop or zroas bonds this resulted in the formation of inner complexes at ph phpzc additional active sites were available because of protonated hydroxyl and amine groups on the materials and these can be used for phosphorus and arsenic v removal these sites were conducive for adsorbing phosphate or arsenate via electrostatic attractions 4 conclusions four eco friendly zr mofs were successfully prepared via a simple hydrothermal method as expected these zr mofs involved using l aspartic acid and its derivatives as ligands with the high valence metal ion of zr4 the mofs were used for the simultaneous adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v from contaminated spring water the four zr mofs exhibited outstanding chemical stability over a wide range of ph 4 0 10 0 at 298 k the maximum loading capacity of zr mofs and arsenic v reached 88 3 mg p g 1 94 2 mg p g 1 50 mg p g 1 and 73 3 mg p g 1 for phosphorus and 109 75 mg as g 1 127 55 mg as g 1 82 5 mg as g 1 and 102 mg as g 1 for arsenic v these values were higher than those achieved with most mofs the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v on zr mofs followed langmuir models and pseudo second order models it is indicated that the reaction is single layer chemisorption on a uniform surface of the material ftir and xps analysis showed that the key to the adsorption process is to establish mop or moas coordination bond to replace the hydroxyl group with phosphate or arsenate and electrostatic attraction moreover the zr mofs could be reused via diluting naoh solution without impairing the crystal structure the synthesized eco friendly zr mofs based on amino acid can be regarded as efficient and water stable adsorbents for phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption from wastewater in variable environments based on the results of these batch experiments in the subsequent research we can study a new cylindrical device to explore the dynamics model of mofs on the actual water body and provide technical support for the practical application of the eco

12566,metal organic frameworks mofs based on amino acids and their derivatives are biocompatible and environmentally friendly and have excellent practical application value in wastewater treatment in this work four mofs based on aspartic acid derivatives were synthesized using zr iv as the central ions and aspartic acid succinic acid fumaric acid and malic acid as organic ligands these were used for the simultaneous removal of phosphorus and arsenic from wastewater the results showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of the aspartic acid based zr asp mof for phosphorus and arsenic v were 88 30 mg p g 1 109 75 mg as g 1 respectively in a single system and 32 00 mg p g 1 and 59 75 mg as g 1 respectively in a binary system of coexisting phosphorus and arsenic these capacities were over a broad ph range of 5 0 9 0 also zr asp can be recycled at least 4 times the langmuir isothermal adsorption model and pseudo second order model can be employed to describe the adsorption behavior of phosphorus and arsenic v well on the mofs based on aspartic acid derivatives in both the single pollutant and two pollutant systems the mechanism of phosphorus and arsenic v reaction on mofs was mainly electrostatic attraction and coordination reaction accompanied by ligand exchange and the hydroxyl group on the surface of the material plays a key role all the results indicated that the synthesized mofs based on aspartic acid derivatives are ideal eco friendly candidates for phosphorus and arsenic v removal in complex actual bodies of water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords eco friendly metal organic frameworks aspartic acid derivatives phosphorus and arsenic v removal adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the past decades excessive discharge of phosphorus and arsenic into water bodies has aroused great concern worldwide although phosphorus is an essential element for the growth of all living things 1 it is also a key factor that causes the eutrophication of freshwater bodies 2 the phosphorus in water mainly comes from human metabolism fertilizers and sewage treatment plants 3 excessive phosphorus discharge leads to the eutrophication of water bodies this results in algal blooms lower oxygen content in water and death of aquatic microorganisms which directly threaten aquatic ecosystems it has been reported that lake eutrophication is accelerated when the concentration of phosphorus in water exceeds 0 02 mg p l 1 4 5 arsenic is widespread and mainly exists in trivalent and pentavalent forms these are highly carcinogenic and extremely toxic they have seriously endangered the health of the world population and they have been reported as a high poison all over the world 6 natural processes such as the weathering of minerals volcanic activity and forest fires as well as human activities such as mining smelting and oil burning are all responsible for the accumulation and release of arsenic 7 the agency for research on cancer iarc has claimed that arsenic is a human carcinogen 8 long term exposure to high levels of arsenic poses a great threat to the human body and can cause cancers such as the skin liver kidney and lungs 9 to minimize the threat that arsenic poses to human health the world health organization who limits the maximum concentration of arsenic in drinking water to 10 μg l 1 10 at present there have been many cases of phosphorus and arsenic jointly polluting water bodies and yangzonghai lake is an example in 2008 the water quality of yangzonghai which is a large plateau lake of 31 km2 and with 600 million cubic meters of water in yunnan province of china was reduced from class i to the inferior class v because of arsenic pollution that was caused by the illegal discharge from a fertilizer enterprise this poses a great threat to the lives and property of coastal residents from 2009 to 2019 our research team reduced the arsenic concentration in the lake from 128 μg as l 1 to 26 μg as l 1 using iron salt flocculation 11 however there are still a large number of springs that contain high concentrations arsenic v and phosphorus along the yangzonghai coast and these still pose a great hazard to the water quality of yangzonghai therefore it is urgent to further control the concentration of phosphorus and arsenic v in spring water to date many methods have been employed for the removal of phosphorus and arsenic v from water 12 13 among them the adsorption method is considered to be one of the preferred approaches because of its advantages of low cost simple design and operation excellent efficiency and a good recovery effect 14 15 adsorbents that are commonly used for the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v include carbon based materials resin ldhs and minerals 16 18 however because of their weak binding force with anions the use of adsorbents leads to poor selectivity resulting in low overall adsorption performance and they are not suitable for large scale application in practical engineering 19 metal organic frameworks mofs are crystalline porous materials composed of metal nodes and organic ligands that bond through coordination bonds 20 21 mofs have outstanding performance such as their remarkable competitiveness in terms of their large specific surface area adjustable pore size good porosity large topology difference and good hydrothermal stability thus mofs also have possible adsorption capacity for phosphorus and arsenic v in water 22 23 recently various mofs have been used for the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v from wastewater e moumen et al reported that the phosphorus adsorption capacity of an al based mof with trimesic acid as the ligand was 23 17 mg p g 1 at ph 8 24 a renewable metal organic skeleton of mof 808 was prepared in a microwave oven and the maximum adsorption capacity of arsenic v was 24 83 mg as g 1 25 despite the rapid development of mofs there are still opportunities and challenges to some extent in terms of their safety impact on the environment and human health toxicity is one of the important factors that restrict the mass commercial application of mofs 26 the metal sources organic linkers and solvents selected in the synthesis of mofs may have an impact on the toxicity of mofs 27 examples of heavy metal ions that have frequently been used in mofs included mil 100 cr 28 cadmium based mof 29 and pb mof 30 excessive chromium can damage the skin and respiratory tract cadmium absorption can cause osteoporosis in humans and serious damage to kidney function lead poisoning is a serious health problem most organic ligands used in the synthesis of mofs are carboxylate phosphonate sulfonate imidazolate phenolate and amines the degradation process of mofs will show the characteristics of raw materials for instance human contact with terephthalic acid can cause mild respiratory irritation and exposure to bp can stimulate skin eye and respiratory contact 27 in addition because of the good porosity of mofs solvents become trapped inside by various means during synthesis these retained organic solvents may cause toxic side effects the previous report has shown that exposure to chloroform can lead to liver and renal toxicity and exposure to dimethylformamide dmf can cause nausea and vomiting 27 these effects hinder the synthesis of biocompatible environmentally friendly mofs meanwhile the water stability of mof materials is a decisive factor in determining whether or not materials can be used 31 stable mofs have large steric hindrances and strong metal ligand bonds and thus they can maintain their structure in the presence of water molecules 31 following the principle of hard soft acid base hsab theory 32 the metal carboxylic acid skeleton composed of oxygen ligands carboxylic acid ligands and high valence metal ions results in a stable mof formed that forms via the combination of a hard base and hard acid and this is the type of mof that is receiving wide attention at present at present developing mofs that are highly stable and have no or low harmful environmental effects and superior performance is one of the major challenges both inorganic metal and organic ligands exhibit minimal toxicity and this is beneficial to the synthesis of environmentally compatible mofs high valence metals such as al3 fe3 ti4 and zr4 have a large natural abundance and their complexes have long term stability thus they are harmless to humans 33 particular attention has been paid to the use of zirconium which is an attractive metal in the composition of mofs because of its attractive properties great water stability nontoxicity and low cost commercial availability 34 also designing environmentally compatible mofs with bio ligands has become a hot topic l α amino acids are ideal ligands for the preparation of mofs because of their harmless and abundant natural resources and because of their excellent coordination and bonding ability to a variety of metals under a wide range of chemical conditions 35 however to date there are few examples of mofs that have been constructed with pure l α amino acids using only major group metals transition metals or rare earth metals as metal sources 36 there are fewer three dimensional mofs and this is mainly because the l α amino acid chelation coordination pattern is common among the twenty standard l α amino acids among them aspartic acid is the smallest one aspartic acid consists of two carboxylic acid groups which have a desirable separation distance for a robust bridge connection that is suitable for favorable inorganic nodes crystal structures of a few metal aspartate mofs have been developed so far but they show limited water stability in all cases the zr mof based on the amino acid group named mip 202 zr has 12 zr6 μ3 o 4 μ3 oh 4 nodes and an l aspartic acid spacer that were constructed in water to form a three dimensional framework with a structure of uio 66 type 37 mip 202 zr is prepared using a green and environmentally friendly synthetic method but it is the only reported amino acid based mof that has great water stability and chemical stability however there are no reports on using mip 202 zr for phosphorus and arsenic removal in this work a series of zr mofs based on aspartic acid derivatives were prepared using zr iv as the central metal ions and aspartic acid fumaric acid malic acid and succinic acid as organic ligands with the utilization of water or aqueous non aqueous solvent as the synthesis medium these zr mofs were used to simultaneously remove phosphorus and arsenic from polluted spring water on the coast of yangzonghai lake the characterization of the zr mofs included scanning electron microscopy n2 adsorption desorption analysis x ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis at the same time batch experiments such as isotherms kinetics thermodynamics ph ionic strength coexisting ions and elution cycles were conducted in addition the potential mechanism of zr asp aspartic acid as a ligand was investigated using xps and ftir finally the feasibility of zr asp for phosphorus and arsenic v removal was evaluated through removal experiments of phosphorus and arsenic in actual contaminated spring water this work opens new avenues for developing and using more environmentally friendly and reusable mofs to remove phosphorus and arsenic v from water 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals all of the chemicals were listed in table s1 and fig s1 in supporting information 2 2 preparation of mofs zr aspartic acid zr asp zr fumaric acid zr fum zr succinic acid zr suc and zr malic acid zr mal were synthesized with zr4 as the metal resource and aspartic acid fumaric acid succinic acid and malic acid as organic ligands all of the synthetic methods were discussed in text s1 in supporting information 2 3 characterization of mofs the relevant characterization details for zr mofs were described in text s2 in supporting information 2 4 batch adsorption experiments batch experiments that occurred on the zr mofs discussed the effects that equilibrium concentration reaction time temperature ionic strength ph and coexisting ions have on the adsorption capacity of phosphorus and arsenic v in single or binary coexisting systems each experiment was done three times and the average value was calculated moreover except for individual experiments all of the batch experiments were conducted at an adsorbent dosage of 0 20 g l 1 all of the phosphorus and arsenic v solutions were prepared from phosphate and arsenate except for the isotherm experiment which used an initial concentration that ranged from 5 to 100 mg l 1 the concentration of other properties of batch experiments was 60 mg l 1 of phosphorus or arsenic the mixture of adsorbent and phosphorus or arsenic v solution oscillated periodically in a thermostatic oscillator the concentration of phosphorus in the filtered supernatant was determined by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan the concentration of arsenic v was tested using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 8300 perkinelmer usa the adsorption capacity qe mg g 1 and removal rate r were obtained according to eqs 1 and 2 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 r c 0 c e c 0 100 where qe stands for the equilibrium adsorption capacity c0 and ce represent the initial and equilibrium concentration of phosphorus or arsenic v and v and m are the volumes of solution and mass of adsorbent 2 5 treatment process of real spring water by zr mofs and its recyclability the primary property parameters of yangzonghai spring water were described in table s2 in supporting information to further explore the value of zr mofs in practical application 30 ml samples of untreated spring water were taken and reacted for 24 h with different doses of zr asp furthermore the recyclability of the adsorbents for phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption was evaluated the adsorbent was dispersed in yangzonghai spring water and vibrated at a speed of 250 rpm for 24 h the phosphorus or arsenic v concentration in the supernatant was then determined and the adsorbent was separated after the adsorbent was dried 0 5 mol l 1 naoh was employed to elute phosphorus and arsenic v for 12 h the separated adsorbent was then rinsed with ultrapure water until the ph was neutral after drying a subsequent round of adsorption was conducted 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization fig 1a d exhibits sem images of zr mofs it is clear in fig 1a that the zr asp mof consists of a series of tight junctions of rice like granular solids that have diameters in the range of 0 10 0 25 μm as seen from fig 1b c d zr suc zr fum and zr mal have similar structures this is attributed to the synthesis of the above three kinds of mof based on mip 203 however each mof is slightly different in structure specifically zr suc is assembled from a cylindrical body that has a height of 0 5 1 0 μm it forms a globular body that has a radius of 1 3 μm fig 1b zr fum mof consists of irregular polyhedral particles that have edge lengths of 0 5 1 0 μm and the particles agglomerate into spheroids fig 1c zr mal mof is composed of irregular sheets that has edge lengths of 0 5 1 0 μm the sheets aggregate into spheroids and the surface folds resemble blooming petals fig 1d this could be why the ligands are different the crystal structures of the four synthetic adsorbents were characterized via xrd analysis it can be observed in fig 2a the xrd pattern of the four mofs all present sharp peaks this signifies that zr mofs have great crystallinity 38 also the positions of the characteristic peak of the zr mofs in the xrd patterns coincided with that of the crystal information file this confirms that zr mofs were successfully synthesized zr asp was synthesized using the mip 202 template fig 2b and the last three zr mofs were synthesized using the mip 203 template mip 202 ccdc 1842337 and mip 203 icsd 130986 both have octahedral nodes of zr6 μ3 o 4 μ3 oh 4 the difference is that the zirconium centers of these two are connected to different organic ligands zr suc zr fum and zr mal are the same kind of systems and belong to mip 203 39 zr suc zr fum and zr mal are all isostructural mofs that are based on mip 203 and their xrd peaks are consistent 40 thus they all have the same structure zr fum is used as an example to describe the detailed structural characteristics the results show that zr fum zr6 μ3 o 4 μ3 oh 4 fumarate 4 formate 2 oh 2 h2o 2 are interconnected by fumarate and formate connectors to form the final three dimensional 3d frame fig 2c the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of zr mofs are shown in fig 3a the specific surface areas distribution of pore size and pore volumes of the four mofs were analyzed according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac all of the zr mofs had type iv isotherms fig 3a and fig s2 this means that they are mesoporous materials in the middle section of a type iv isotherm an adsorption hysteresis loop appears and an adsorption saturation plateau appears after capillary condensation is complete finally the zr mofs curve terminates at the inflection point of the platform 41 the specific surface area of zr asp was 334 4023 m2 g 1 the pore volume was 0 400435 cm3 g 1 and the pore size was 4 7899 nm the values of the bet surface area of zr suc zr fum and zr mal were 85 2356 m2 g 1 48 6207 m2 g 1 and 99 9452 m2 g 1 respectively the pore volumes of the three adsorbents were 0 135121 cm3 g 1 0 036453 cm3 g 1 and 0 293460 cm3 g 1 respectively also the values of the pore sizes of zr suc zr fum and zr mal were 6 3411 nm 2 9990 nm and 11 7448 nm respectively the high specific surface area and well organized pores of mofs increase the number of active sites leading to larger defects and more hydroxyls on the surface of mofs which increases the probability of trapping pollutants on the contrary if mofs have lower specific surface area and porosity fewer active sites stable coordination fewer defects fewer surface hydroxyl groups and thus less chance of mo bond formation the thermal stability of the zr mofs was analyzed under the condition of a nitrogen atmosphere and the tga analysis is depicted in fig 3b as seen in the figure zr suc zr fum and zr mal all had three mass loss stages the exception was zr asp which had four mass loss stages before 110 c all of the materials lost weight rapidly and the weight losses for zr asp zr suc zr fum and zr mal were about 10 68 9 54 14 49 and 10 37 respectively these losses contributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water molecules the second rapid weight loss occurred at about 250 c and the mass of all of the samples decreased due to the evaporation of clogged solvent molecules in the inner pores at this stage the weight loss rates of the four materials were 11 77 for zr asp 10 93 for zr suc 4 72 for zr fum and 3 98 for zr mal then in the third stage when the temperature reached 430 c the ligand began to carbonize until the temperature was above 500 c then the mof structure partially collapsed and the weight loss was about 50 42 finally zirconium oxide was the only remaining component of these zr mofs 39 in conclusion zr mofs were widely outstanding and structurally stable and their brilliant structural properties attract us to expand their potential in applications 3 2 isotherms of adsorption for phosphorus and arsenic v the adsorption performances of zr mofs for phosphorus and arsenic v in single and binary systems were studied at 298 k and 250 rpm when the equilibrium concentration rose from 0 mg l 1 to 80 mg l 1 the adsorption capacity of zr mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v in a single system had the same trend specifically both increased and then approached a certain value as shown in fig 4a and c this is because the adsorption sites on mof were completely occupied by phosphorus or arsenic v as seen in fig 4a the adsorption capacities of zr mofs for phosphorus were 88 3 mg p g 1 for zr asp 94 2 mg p g 1 for zr suc 50 mg p g 1 for zr fum and 73 3 mg p g 1 for zr mal as seen in fig 4c the adsorption capacity of arsenic v was 109 75 mg as g 1 for zr asp 127 55 mg as g 1 for zr suc 82 5 mg as g 1 for zr fum and 102 mg as g 1 for zr mal also the adsorption capacity of zr asp for phosphorus and arsenic in the binary system of arsenic v and phosphorus coexistence reached 32 mg p g 1 and 59 75 mg as g 1 respectively the phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption capacities of the adsorbents that were synthesized in this study were compared with those of other materials that have been published in the literature the data comparisons were shown in tables s3 and s4 the adsorption capacity of zr mofs was far superior to that of other adsorbents furthermore the models of langmuir freundlich temkin and d r were taken to describe the adsorption process of phosphorus or arsenic v on mofs and the details of the correlations were presented in text s3 the fitting data of the above models were provided in fig 4b d and f and the parameters were shown in tables s5 s6 and s7 from a comparison of r values the langmuir was the most accurate model to demonstrate the reaction of a single or binary system on zr mofs this showed single homogeneous adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v on the adsorbents to describe whether the adsorption process occurs under favorable conditions this conclusion is verified by calculating the value of rl and eq 3 as follows 43 3 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where kl and c0 represent the langmuir equilibrium constant and the initial concentration rl value that is between 0 and 1 means that the adsorption process proceeds under favorable conditions however a value of rl that is higher than 1 implies that the adsorption process takes place under disadvantageous conditions the data was calculated and the rl values tables s5 s6 and s7 of the zr mofs were all less than 1 these results established that the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v on zr mofs occurred favorably as seen in tables s5 s6 and s7 the bt values of the temkin model were all higher than 0 this indicated that the adsorption of phosphorus or as v by zr mofs was consistent with an exothermic reaction furthermore the free energy e was calculated from the d r model the value of e determines whether or not the adsorption is chemisorption or physical adsorption e is calculated according to eq 4 4 e 1 2 k ad there are three possible outcomes for the process of adsorption first e is in the range of 1 8 kj mol 1 and the adsorption behavior of phosphorus and arsenic v on materials follows physical adsorption second e is among 8 16 kj mol 1 and the interactions between adsorbents and phosphorus and arsenic v are primarily electrostatic third e is greater than 16 kj mol 1 and the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v on mof is chemisorption from the calculations it was determined that the free energy values of the zr mofs adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v were all more than 16 kj mol 1 it was evident that the mechanisms of adsorption by the zr mofs were mainly chemisorption also in the binary system in which phosphorus and arsenic coexisted the fitting results were consistent with those of the single systems of phosphorus or arsenic this indicated that the adsorption mechanism of zr asp in systems with coexisting phosphorus and arsenic was also chemisorption in addition the maximum phosphorus uptake by zr asp was less than that of arsenic v and this is consistent with the result that the diameter of aso4 3 is larger than that of po4 3 3 3 adsorption kinetics for the removal of phosphorus and arsenic v the effect that time has on the zr mofs adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v was studied by keeping other factors constant and changing the reaction time within 3 300 min the results were shown in fig 5a and d the adsorption capacities of phosphorus and arsenic v on zr mofs rose as the process went on when the process went to saturation the maximum adsorption value tended to be a fixed value regardless of how the time changed to further learn about the adsorption process of phosphorus and arsenic v on zr mofs the pseudo first order model pseudo second order model and internal diffusion model were used to fit the data of adsorption kinetics 44 detailed information can be found in text s4 the fitting patterns of phosphorus or arsenic v were described in fig 5a c and d f and the related arguments were given in table s8 according to fig 5b and e r of the zr mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v followed a pseudo second order model meanwhile qe values of the pseudo second order model were consistent with the experimental value table s8 consequently the adsorption kinetics on the zr mofs conformed to the pseudo second order model which implicated that the whole reaction followed chemisorption fig 5c and f showed the internal diffusion models of the four materials for the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v respectively in the internal diffusion kinetics model both stages were adsorption processes this indicated that multiple diffusion mechanisms occurred in the adsorption process of phosphorus or arsenic v as seen in fig 5c and f the first 30 min was the first stage during this period membrane diffusion was the main process and the related fitting parameters of the zr mofs for single phosphorus or arsenic v were listed in table s8 the other stage occurred in the range of 30 300 min and it was a gradual adsorption stage in the meantime the rates of adsorption dropped compared to those of the last stage table s8 notably none of the line segments passed through the original point which indicated that the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v on zr mofs was controlled by multiple kinetics mechanisms e g surface adsorption external mass transfer and intrapore diffusion similar to the single system the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v in the binary system also followed the pseudo second order model fig 5h meanwhile the internal diffusion model of the binary system of phosphorus and arsenic fig 5i also included two stages and the trend was consistent with that of the single system to understand the effect that removing one adsorbate had on the other adsorbate in a multi component system multicomponent adsorption studies were carried out the proportion method was used to investigate the antagonistic and synergistic performances of the multicomponent adsorption system in the proportion method the fractional value of the adsorption capacity in a binary system to that in a single system was calculated using eq 5 45 5 fractional value q m binary q m mono where qm binary and qm mono are the adsorption capacities of the binary system and mono system respectively a fraction greater than 1 indicates that the adsorption is synergistic where the adsorption of one adsorbent is facilitated by the other adsorbent a value less than 1 indicates antagonism and competition between adsorbents occurs in the process of adsorption 45 for zr asp adsorption of phosphorus qm binary was 29 0 mg p l 1 qm mono was 88 3 mg p l 1 and the fractional value calculated using eq 5 was 0 33 this indicated that the presence of arsenic v restrained the adsorption of phosphorus in the binary system and the adsorption had antagonistic properties similarly under the same conditions the calculated arsenic v fraction value was 0 54 and this indicated that the presence of phosphorus slightly inhibited the adsorption process in the binary system moreover arsenate has a higher hydrate radius than phosphate consequently the ion with a higher hydrated radius that is arsenic v has more electrosorption capacity 46 3 4 thermodynamics the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v on zr mofs in the range of 298 328 k was studied to verify the influence that temperature had on the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v the results in fig s3a demonstrated that the temperature was positively correlated with the adsorption capacity of phosphorus or arsenic v on the zr mofs this revealed that increasing the temperature was conducive to the removal of phosphorus and arsenic v to further understand what role temperature played in the reaction the standard enthalpy change h θ standard entropy change s θ and standard gibbs free energy change g θ were calculated for the related adsorption thermodynamics and the results can be seen in text s5 fig s3b showed plots of the relationship between ln k and 1 t and exhibited the results of the linear analysis the fitting results and the related parameters were listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively a positive value of h θ demonstrated that the adsorption reaction was endothermic and the increase in temperature was beneficial for capturing phosphorus or arsenic v a negative value of δg θ indicated that the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v was spontaneous in addition δs θ was calculated and found to be greater than 0 this indicated that as the temperature increased the chaos of the solid liquid interface had the same trend 50 therefore the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v was sensitive to temperature 3 5 effects of ph the distributions of phosphorus and arsenic v species in water depend on changes in the ph of the solution this description was shown in fig s4 a and b solution ph is a remarkable factor that exerted an influence on the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v 44 the dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid and arsenic acid in the solution can be expressed by eqs 6 and 7 6 h 3 po 4 pk 1 h 2 p o 4 h pk 2 hpo 4 2 2 h pk 3 po 4 3 3 h 7 h 3 aso 4 pk 1 h 2 aso 4 h pk 2 haso 4 2 2 h pk 3 aso 4 3 3 h where the values are pk1 2 1 pk2 7 2 and pk3 12 3 for phosphoric acid and the values are pk1 2 2 pk2 6 9 and pk3 11 5 for arsenic acid the adsorption performances of the zr mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v were studied in the range of ph 3 0 to 11 0 the relationship between zr mofs adsorption capacities of phosphorus or arsenic v and ph were presented in fig 6 the adsorption capacities of the four mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v rose slightly from ph 3 0 to 5 0 and then the capacities tended to a constant value at ph 5 0 9 0 this is because the main species of phosphorus or arsenic v are in the forms of h2po4 or h2aso4 which are species that can have strong electrostatic interactions with adsorbents this prompted phosphorus or arsenic v to be efficiently captured in the range of ph 3 0 to 7 0 when the solution ph is higher than 7 2 or 6 96 hpo4 2 or haso4 2 becomes the dominant species in this range there were fewer positive charges on the adsorbent surface which weakened the electrostatic attractions nevertheless the adsorption capacities of the zr mof materials were still very high for both phosphorus and arsenic this result demonstrated that the phosphorus or arsenic v adsorption by zr mofs was in agreement with the kinetics fitting results and this indicated that chemical adsorption was the main process rather than pure electrostatic adsorption the adsorption capacities of the zr mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v reduced significantly between ph 9 0 and 11 0 this was because the number of positive charges on the adsorbent surface reduced dramatically when ph was greater than 9 0 this excluded electrostatic attractions which were not beneficial to the adsorption process in competitive adsorption there was excessive oh and phosphorus or arsenic v this contributed to a decreased amount of phosphorus and arsenic v that adsorbed on the zr mofs also to understand the process of phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption on zr asp an experiment to test ph as a function of time was conducted the results were presented in fig s4c the ph of the solution dropped rapidly from 6 0 to 4 5 within an hour after adding the adsorbent to the phosphorus and arsenic v solution then it increased slowly until reached an equilibrium value of about 4 8 within 6 h during the initial stage of phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption many protons were released from the proton active sites of zr asp into the water and this generated a dramatic decrease in the ph value of the water during this period phosphorus and arsenic v were primarily removed through electrostatic attractions nonetheless the solution ph rose gradually as the reaction progressed and the most likely reason for this was that there was a ligand exchange occurred between the hydroxyl groups in the zr mofs and phosphorus or arsenic v to form a zr o p or zr o as complexation and then released hydroxyl into the solution it was determined that the principal phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption process was internal complex formation and ligand exchange to confirm the structural stability of the zr mofs and whether they cause secondary pollution in water environments the concentration of remanent metal ions in the solution after phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption was also detected it was observed in table s9 that the residual amount of zirconium ions in the solution after phosphorus and arsenic v removal was almost always 0 over the ph range of 3 0 11 0 the concentrations of residual zirconium ions from ph 3 0 to 11 0 were well below that of who recommended zirconium ions content in groundwater 0 2 mg l 1 19 thus it was determined that zr mofs were environmentally friendly in practical applications the above conclusion confirmed that the structures of the zr mofs were quite stable when attacked by water molecules and they had outstanding practical applications and can be widely used in adsorption 3 6 effect of coexisting ions and ionic strength because of the complicated and changeable natural environment there is a great necessity to eliminate the influence that diversiform anions have on the adsorption process several usual anions e g cl so4 2 no3 hco3 and co3 2 may present negative effects on the removal of phosphorus and arsenic v anionic sodium salts were prepared in gradient concentrations e g 20 mg l 1 40 mg l 1 and 60 mg l 1 based on phosphorus or arsenic v solutions of 60 mg p l 1 or 60 mg as l 1 as seen in fig 7a and b when sodium salts were added to the solution cl so4 2 and no3 did not play conspicuous roles in the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v in contrast hco3 and co3 2 did this indicates that these mofs have good selectivity to phosphorus and arsenic v excessive hco3 and co3 2 hydrolysis resulted in the solution ph increasing and becoming alkaline this had an adverse effect on the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v in general the concentration of these two anions studied experimentally was much higher than those in nature interference results for zr suc were presented in fig s5 in the supporting information and had similar results as zr asp in conclusion the zr mof adsorbents used in this study had a strong antijamming ability and it is possible to adsorb phosphorus and treat arsenic v in wastewater that contains many competing species meanwhile the influence that ionic strength has on phosphorus or arsenic v adsorption was studied nacl solutions with concentrations of 0 001 mol l 1 0 01 mol l 1 and 0 1 mol l 1 were prepared with contents of 60 mg p l 1 or 60 mg as l 1 the adsorption results presented in fig 8a and b showed that the adsorption performances of the zr mofs for phosphorus or arsenic v were almost constant with an increase in ionic strength which means that there was no effect that ionic strength played on the adsorption of phosphorus or arsenic v generally when the adsorption occurred through external surface complexation the adsorption capacity of phosphorus and arsenic v decreased with an increase in ionic strength this was because the external complexation was electrostatic attraction and other impurity anions in the solution competed with phosphorus and arsenic v anions for adsorption sites 47 remarkably when the adsorption mechanism was via an inner complex the adsorption capacity of phosphorus and arsenic v increased or did not change with an increase in ionic strength 48 therefore it had been confirmed that the adsorption mechanism of the zr mofs for phosphorus and arsenic v principally took place via an inner complex 3 7 adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v with low concentrations another challenge in water pollution management was the removal of phosphorus and arsenic v in low concentrations thus it was essential to assess the adsorption performance of the zr mofs for phosphorus and arsenic when they were presenting in low concentrations according to stricter discharge standards and refraining from water eutrophication and arsenic pollution batch experiments were conducted using a laboratory configuration solution with a gradient of concentrations of phosphorus and arsenic e g 0 5 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 fig 9 showed the results when the concentration of coexisting phosphorus and arsenic v in solution was less than 5 0 mg l 1 the efficiency of adsorption was always higher than 95 with the dosage of 1 0 g l 1 zr mofs the results showed that the as synthesized zr mofs were extraordinarily efficient at adsorbing phosphorus and arsenic v when they were in low concentrations this probably offered a viable way to adsorb phosphorus and arsenic from water when they were in low concentrations 3 8 application in real contaminated spring water the feasibility of using zr mofs was evaluated by experiments on yangzonghai spring water yunnan province china the related parameters of spring water at the yangzonghai lake shore were provided in table s2 it is evident in fig 10 with an increase in the zr mof dosage the residual phosphorus and arsenic v concentrations decreased rapidly until they were completely adsorbed the optimum amount of zr mofs adsorbent was 0 4 g l 1 1 0 g l 1 in this dosage range zr asp can reduce the residual concentrations of phosphorus and arsenic v to 0 the application in real spring water further demonstrated the practicality of zr mofs in changeable water environments which indicated that there was a huge potential for applications in environmental protection 3 9 adsorbent regeneration zr asp was used as an example for discussion the elution cycle of the adsorbent was explored and the results were presented in fig 11 the whole reaction was carried out at 298 k and 0 50 mol l 1 naoh was employed as an eluant after 4 cycles the adsorption efficiency of phosphorus and arsenic v in the spring water of yangzonghai lake by zr asp was greater than 80 also the desorption efficiency of zr asp was greater than 80 except for the fourth desorption of zr asp for phosphorus it had been further demonstrated that the structure of this material was pretty stable and thus the practical applications were widely possible and extremely likely the remarkable elution performance and repeated use affirmed that zr asp was a very practical and efficient material and this further confirmed its potential value for phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption from water 3 10 adsorption mechanisms sem mapping was conducted to ulteriorly study whether or not phosphorus and arsenic v were loaded on the zr asp mof and they were described in fig 12 and fig s6 it is clear in fig 12 that phosphorus and arsenic v were well proportioned dispersed on the material in addition it was observed in fig s6a and b that the crystal structure of zr asp maintained its original morphology after adsorption a meticulous contrast of sem images before and after removal indicated that a thin layer of flocculent film adhered to the surface of the material that was adsorbed with phosphorus and arsenic v the content of phosphorus and arsenic v in the material was 14 and 6 respectively and this indicated that phosphorus and arsenic v ions were inset with an effect in the micropores of the material also the adsorbent had an outstanding performance for loading phosphorus and arsenic v furthermore we recorded xrd patterns of zr asp after the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v it is evident in fig s6c the peak shape of zr asp was consistent with that of the fresh synthetic samples however the crystallinity was slightly less therefore the fundamental skeletal structure of zr asp was maintained after adsorption which indicated that the adsorbent was stable the slightly decreased crystallinity may be related to the interaction between zr asp and phosphorus and arsenic the possible mechanism of the adsorption process can also be inferred by zero point charge in fig 13a and fig s7 phpzc over different ph ranges of values were discussed the phpzc values of zr asp and zr suc were 8 808 and 7 705 respectively if the ph is less than phpzc the material is positively charged and is conducive to the adsorption of phosphate and arsenate by electrostatic attraction as ph phpzc the material becomes negatively charged and rejects phosphate and arsenate the process will weaken the performance of adsorption nevertheless it was observed in fig 6a and b even if the value of ph was higher than phpzc there were only small differences in the loading capacities of the four mofs for phosphorus and arsenic v and the values did not reach zero this means that not only electrostatic attraction affected the entire process but the formation of internal complexes did also ftir was taken to understand the changes in the functional groups before and after adsorption to further study the interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent and the spectra were presented in fig 13b and fig s8 according to fig 13b the infrared spectrum of zr asp had a characteristic peak at 3413 75 cm 1 before adsorption and this corresponded to the oh vibration the peaks that were located at 1627 12 cm 1 and 1380 23 cm 1 were vested in the presence of co asymmetry and symmetric stretching of carboxylic acid groups the bands at 1235 86 cm 1 and 1427 75 cm 1 were attributed to the cn bond that connected the carbon chain and amino group nh2 respectively 48 the characteristic peak at 504 67 cm 1 was the zro tensile peak after adsorption there were three sharp peaks in the region of 900 1200 cm 1 these were derived from oh group stretching vibration during the formation of the zr6 octahedron and these were greatly attenuated by the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v a new peak appeared at 1103 50 cm 1 and this was attributed to the stretching vibration of op this indicated that phosphate was coordinated to the central zr ion to form the zrop inner complex 49 50 also after the peak at 504 67 cm 1 vanished there was a new peak at 509 60 cm 1 these observations indicated that phosphate and arsenate interact with metal ions and form zrop and zroas covalent bonds after adsorption after adsorption the strength of the peak at 3422 65 cm 1 was weaker this demonstrated the participation of hydroxyl groups on the material in the reaction of phosphorus and arsenic v this suggested that phosphate and arsenate were adsorbed via the direct binding of substituted hydroxyl groups to zr fig s8 showed that zr suc exhibited the same phenomenon as zr asp after adsorption and the detailed information was presented in text s6 in the supporting information in brief the ftir spectra indicated that the hydroxyl group was superseded by phosphate and arsenate through ligand exchange during the whole adsorption to form a new zrop or zroas bond this discovery was accorded with the conclusion of adsorption kinetics the mechanism of phosphorus and arsenic v removal was further revealed by the analysis of binding energy before and after adsorption and the diagrams were shown in fig 14 the full spectrum described the existence of zr o c and n in zr asp after phosphorus and arsenic v loading two new peaks appeared at 44 79 ev and 133 49 ev 54 this contributed to the p 2p and as 3d peaks and indicated that phosphorus and arsenic v were successfully loaded on the zr asp adsorbents notably the high resolution zr 3d5 2 and zr 3d3 2 spectra fig 14b showed a significant shift in the binding energy from 182 81 ev to 182 65 ev and from 185 12 ev to 185 03 ev it has been convinced that there was an inner complexation consisting of zr and phosphate or arsenate via ligand exchange 55 according to fig 14c the two peaks were attributed to zro and zroh the binding energy of zro shifted from 530 15 to 530 22 ev which corresponded to the formation of zroas or zrop the binding energy of another transferred from 531 61 to 531 54 ev after adsorption the above phenomenon demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups had a principal effect on the reaction connected with the analysis of ftir it can be convinced that there was an ligand exchange between the hydroxyl group moh and phosphate or arsenate and that an internal complex of zrop or zroas formed this might be the primary mechanism of phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption also by fitting the n1s peak fig 14d two peaks located at 399 48 ev and 401 58 ev were obtained these correspond to nh2 and nh3 respectively 51 the binding energy of nh3 decreased from 401 58 ev before adsorption to 401 52 ev after zr asp adsorption and the content increased from 0 88 to 0 91 this indicated that there was electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding between nh3 or nh2 and phosphate or arsenate 52 previous studies have shown that mof materials can trap pollutants via electrostatic attraction and this was consistent with the findings of this study 53 from the above conclusions the mechanism of zr mofs adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v was confirmed to be electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange followed by coordination in the entire adsorption process the ligand exchange occurred because of the replacement of hydroxyl groups zroh in zrmofs by phosphate or arsenate to form zrop or zroas bonds this resulted in the formation of inner complexes at ph phpzc additional active sites were available because of protonated hydroxyl and amine groups on the materials and these can be used for phosphorus and arsenic v removal these sites were conducive for adsorbing phosphate or arsenate via electrostatic attractions 4 conclusions four eco friendly zr mofs were successfully prepared via a simple hydrothermal method as expected these zr mofs involved using l aspartic acid and its derivatives as ligands with the high valence metal ion of zr4 the mofs were used for the simultaneous adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v from contaminated spring water the four zr mofs exhibited outstanding chemical stability over a wide range of ph 4 0 10 0 at 298 k the maximum loading capacity of zr mofs and arsenic v reached 88 3 mg p g 1 94 2 mg p g 1 50 mg p g 1 and 73 3 mg p g 1 for phosphorus and 109 75 mg as g 1 127 55 mg as g 1 82 5 mg as g 1 and 102 mg as g 1 for arsenic v these values were higher than those achieved with most mofs the adsorption of phosphorus and arsenic v on zr mofs followed langmuir models and pseudo second order models it is indicated that the reaction is single layer chemisorption on a uniform surface of the material ftir and xps analysis showed that the key to the adsorption process is to establish mop or moas coordination bond to replace the hydroxyl group with phosphate or arsenate and electrostatic attraction moreover the zr mofs could be reused via diluting naoh solution without impairing the crystal structure the synthesized eco friendly zr mofs based on amino acid can be regarded as efficient and water stable adsorbents for phosphorus and arsenic v adsorption from wastewater in variable environments based on the results of these batch experiments in the subsequent research we can study a new cylindrical device to explore the dynamics model of mofs on the actual water body and provide technical support for the practical application of the eco

12567,ethane steam cracking to ethylene plants produce a large amount of organic sewage containing oil and suspended solids which can lead to heat exchanger blockage and steam regeneration difficulties efficient treatment and recycling of process water is one of the keys to ensure a stable operation of ethylene production plant the traditional multi stage tandem process water treatment process has issues such as long treatment process blockage of flow path by coke powder particles and incomplete oil water separation therefore this study proposes a cooperative process combining medium particles extraction mpe and combined fibrous coalescence cfc technology to remove oil and turbidity in process water based on laboratory tests and analyses a pilot test of process water purification with a flow rate of 1 6 m3 h was implemented the results of the pilot test demonstrated that the process reduced the average oil content of process water from 606 to 18 4 mg l and the average turbidity from 1213 to 7 9 ntu with average separation efficiencies of 96 96 and 99 35 respectively compared with current process water treatments this approach provides a higher operational flexibility better separation effect and it is more environmentally friendly this study provides a novel approach for a green and efficient treatment and recycling of process water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ethylene production process water oily wastewater coalescence filtration physical separation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ethylene production capacity is one of the important indicators of the level of petrochemical development of a country 1 ethylene production in europe and asia pacific is dominated by naphtha cracking which has disadvantages such as high energy consumption low production rate and poor production continuity 2 in recent years the technical advantages of steam cracking for ethylene production using ethane as feedstock have gradually emerged and this process has attracted increasing attention 3 ethane cracking has been implemented in many ethylene production plants worldwide for instance ethylene produced from ethane accounts for 67 of the total production in the middle east and 52 in north america 4 in ethylene production the quality of process water is directly related to the quality of operation of the cracking unit and energy consumption therefore the purification of process water is important to ensure a stable ethylene production 5 the specific process of the generation treatment and circulation of process water is described as follows fig 1 the water vapor in the cracking furnace acts as a dilution steam to promote the cracking reaction at high temperatures the dehydrogenation or chain breaking reaction of ethane and propane produce cracked gas containing hydrogen methane ethylene propylene and other target products the cracked gas is cooled in the quench water tower where the steam is cooled into quench water containing oil and suspended solids process water is formed after removing heavy gasoline from quench water after removing large particles through the filter the process water enters the process water treatment system for purification treatment of oil removal and turbidity removal the purified process water enters the extraction separator and stripping tower in turn to remove soluble organic matter and acid gas subsequently the process water enters the dilution steam generation unit for steam regeneration and is recycled as the dilution steam this steam can reduce the partial pressure of hydrocarbon decelerate the coking rate and increase the thermal stability of the raw gas in the cracking process if the process water is not recycled a large amount of additional steam is needed in the cracking process and the quench system discharges a large amount of sewage which increases the energy consumption of the plant and the burden of the sewage treatment plant the high temperature cracking gas is not adsorbed in the quench oil tower during the ethane steam cracking process therefore it directly enters the quench water tower which leads to the production of an oil water emulsion with complex oil components and high impurity content 6 the treatment of process water generated during ethane steam cracking for ethylene production has not been widely studied several ethane steam cracking plants in china do not have reliable technology for the treatment of process water and they refer to treatment methods used for petroleum hydrocarbon cracking the current process water treatment process faces the following main problems 7 9 flow path blockage by easily polymerized heavy oil components and coke powder particles long treatment process low oil removal efficiency and incomplete oil water separation which causes the dilution steam to carry oil and affects the operation of the cracking furnace therefore an efficient and stable treatment technology for process water should be urgently developed the removal of impurities and emulsified oils is the premise of an efficient recycling of process water however traditional oil water separation technologies cannot be easily applied for process water treatment for instance gravity sedimentation 10 centrifugal separation 11 and plate agglomeration 12 are not effective in separating emulsified oils whereas dissolved gas and induced air flotation techniques 13 14 require the use of chemicals and can cause secondary pollution including volatile waste gas and floating slag furthermore filter element filtration membrane filtration and other precision separation techniques 15 16 are highly prone to clogging and have the limitations of high cost and membrane contamination despite their high efficiency in contrast media coalescence technology can efficiently purify organic sewage with high suspended matter and emulsified oil content and the main forms of coalescence media are particles and fibres particle coalescence separators have a dual function of removing both oils and suspended solids the oil removal function is based on the wettability of the medium surface which provides an area for oil droplets to coalesce the oil droplets collide with and are captured by the medium surface while flowing in the bed channel and they are separated from the medium surface after coalescence and growth 17 the removal of the suspended solids is based on the principle of deep bed filtration 18 19 the particles are captured by the bed media through interception and adsorption and after accumulation until the maximum bed interception capacity the particles are removed by backwashing the selection and collocation of coalescence materials are crucial for the oil removal effect of particle coalescing separators in terms of media wettability some researchers suggest that the use of pro dispersion aggregative media can improve the separation performance 20 22 regarding combined media kulkarni 10 23 reported that the separation performance achieved by hydrophilic and hydrophobic combined media was better than that of single media and the former significantly reduced the bed pressure drop on this basis this study proposes a medium particle extraction technology mpe which considers the ability of the particle bed to intercept large suspended matter and the ease of backwashing the particle bed was constructed by combining oleophilic hydrophilic heterogeneous particles with a multiple flow channel structure aiming to collaboratively separate oil and suspended matter fibrous media can provide greater filling density and specific surface area relative to rigid particulate fillers and they present higher separation accuracy which can be used for emulsion separation yang 24 25 used fibre gauge weaving to combine hydrophilic and oleophilic heterogeneous fibres with different wettability in specific proportions and geometrical configurations upon appropriate assumptions lu 26 developed a theoretical prediction model to quantify the quantitative relationship between macroscopic parameters e g fibre size droplet size bed thickness and fibre bed separation efficiency the combined fibrous coalescer was developed by combining the two person technology and it has shown excellent oil removal ability in pilot tests and engineering applications in several wastewater de oiling processes 27 30 these technologies provide technical insights into the rapid and efficient purification of process water from ethane steam cracking considering the abovementioned industrial and technological background this study proposes an integrated purification of process water for oil and turbidity removal by combining mpe and cfc technology the method is based on physical separation and it aims to achieve an efficient and environmentally friendly treatment and recycling of process water this study comprises the design and implementation of a pilot test based on laboratory tests and analyses the separation effect and parameter influence were investigated the regeneration performance and pressure drop of the mpe separator were determined and the separation performance and water quality adaptability of the purification method were verified this study provides a novel approach for the treatment of process water from ethane steam cracking in ethylene production plants 2 experiments and methods 2 1 water quality analysis the process water used in this experiment was obtained from the quench water separation tank fig 1 the process water belongs to soft water and its source water is generated from the boiler feed water after de oxygenation as the acid gas in the cracking gas is dissolved in the process water its water quality is weakly acidic influenced by operation conditions the oil content and turbidity of process water fluctuate significantly the quality index parameters of process water are shown in table 1 process water has complex organic components mainly including aromatic hydrocarbons olefins and oxygenates table s1 in addition the suspended solids in the process water are mainly coke powder generated during the cracking reaction of hydrocarbon compounds and their particle size distribution is also shown in table 1 2 2 pilot plant and process 2 2 1 principle of coalescent separator the particles used in mpe separator are highly hydrophilic or lipophilic and they are resistant to high temperatures and corrosion the bed of mpe separator is composed of two or more different oleophilic hydrophilic heterogeneous particles that can separate suspended oil and small amounts of soluble organic matter and suspended solids by collision flow interception induced coalescence oil droplet internal circulation capture and deep filtration the principle of the mpe oil removal technology is coalescence the oily effluent moves from the top to the bottom through the mpe bed which has oleophilic and oleophobic properties during this flow oil droplets adhere to the lipophilic particles and form an oil film on their surface the presence of the oil film increases the probability of oil droplet aggregation on the oil film where they will fuse grow and eventually be released 31 as shown in fig 2 a based on similar miscibility mechanisms organic substances are dissolved on the surface of oil films the oil films generate internal vortices under the shearing action of the water flow which enables a continuous renewal between the interior and the surface through the internal circulation of oil droplets and facilitates the transfer of organic substances 30 32 hydrophilic particles ensure that the bed is not completely covered by the oil film improve fluidity and guarantee the separation efficiency the separation of suspended solids by the particles in the mpe bed primarily depends on the adsorption and interception by the bed when large particles flow through the bed they are intercepted between the pores because their size is larger than the bed void for small suspended particles owing to the many small channels on the surface of mpe particles impurities are adsorbed on the surface of the particles or on a more viscous oil layer and eventually get separated along with the oil phase mpe particles include mainly inorganic materials e g quartz sand anthracite magnetite ceramic granules and organic materials e g polypropylene pp teflon ptfe nylon pa and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf the mpe particles in this test were mixed in specific proportions by pp quartz sand and ceramics and they were filled from top to bottom in order of particle size from small to large as conventional coalescing materials are limited by their surface properties and are less effective when used directly the mpe particles were modified through surface wetting to improve their coalescence and separation performance the coalescence separation internals of cfc separators were composed of oleophilic and hydrophilic heterogeneous fibres woven in x and ω structural patterns with soft micron sized fibre media which provided a high specific surface area and filling density the oil water intercalated emulsion droplets were separated owing to the difference between the polar forces of oil and water when flowing through the heterogeneous fibre cross nodes which led to emulsion breaking and efficient capture of the remaining micro droplets the bed was designed with a large void ratio to prevent clogging the separated oil droplets were collected and discharged by the oil package as shown in fig 2 c to prevent corrosion the oleophilic fibre material used in the interior was ptfe and the hydrophilic fibre material was stainless steel fibre 2 2 2 bed thickness of mpe separator separability cycle testing of process water samples was conducted using an mpe test rig with a flow rate of 20 l h and bed thickness of 400 mm owing to the 12 h interval between field sampling and experimental tests the initial turbidity of the samples during the tests was 586 ntu which was slightly lower than those in the field the turbidity decreased to 17 8 ntu after passing through the bed for the first time and the obtained water was clear after five cycles the turbidity decreased to 1 15 ntu which indicated a good separation performance after further five cycles the turbidity was almost unchanged therefore the bed thickness of the mpe separator of the pilot plant was initially selected as 2000 mm which corresponded to five cycles fig 3 shows the decreasing trend of turbidity of the treated water samples with the number of cycles higher bed thickness leads to a higher number of coalescence cycles and lower oil and solid contents in outlet water however a high bed thickness can affect the backwash regeneration efficiency therefore two mpe separators were designed considering the oil and suspension removal efficiencies backwashing efficiency and industrial manufacturing and a bed thickness of 1200 mm was selected for each mpe separator 2 2 3 pilot test process fig 4 a shows the flow of the pilot plant the process water successively passed through two mpe separators for the removal of suspended oil and solids and then flowed into the cfc separator for further removal of oil emulsified in the water the heavy oil pipeline was regularly opened for the discharge of the heavy oil accumulated in the separator a pressure gauge was installed on the separator to measure the bed pressure drop when the pressure drop exceeded 0 09 mpa the retained suspended solids were discharged via backwashing as the incoming liquid contained suspended matter the two mpe separators could be switched in series and parallel during backwashing the backwashing was performed using nitrogen and water and the backwashing liquid was discharged to the floor drainpipe network a sampling port was set at the outlet of each separator to determine the influence of parameters including cross section velocity incoming material fluctuation and bed backwashing on the separation performance 2 3 analysis and measurements the oil content was determined by an infrared spectrophotometer et1200 shanghai euro tech ltd china the turbidity was measured using a portable turbidimeter 2100q hach usa the particle size distribution of the suspended solids was analysed using a malvern laser diffraction particle size analyser mastersizer 3000 uk the organic composition of the process water was determined using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 7890a 5975c agilent usa the oil removal rate e1 and turbidity removal rate e2 were calculated as follows 1 e 1 1 ω out ω in 100 where ω in and ω out refer to the inlet and outlet oil content mg l respectively 2 e 2 1 c out c in 100 where c in and c out are the inlet and outlet turbidity ntu respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cross sectional flow rates in terms of operating conditions the cross sectional flow rate has the most critical impact on the coalescence effect 17 therefore the optimal cross sectional flow rate was explored to maximise the treatment capacity on the premise of meeting the purification index for processing capacities of 1 2 1 6 2 0 and 2 4 m3 h the apparent flow rates were 0 0026 0 0035 0 0044 and 0 0053 m s respectively in terms of oil removal fig 5 a the drag force of water flow increased as the cross sectional flow rate increased which decreased in the trapping performance of particles and fibre medium towards oil droplets and the oil removal rate of each separator presented a significant downward trend the oil removal efficiency of the two stage mpe separator decreased from 89 14 to 80 81 as the cross sectional flow rate increased from 0 0026 to 0 0053 m s and the oil removal efficiency of the total unit decreased from 98 01 to 93 53 the turbidity removal rate of the primary mpe separator decreased significantly as the cross sectional flow rate increased whereas the total turbidity removal rate of the mpe separator decreased only slightly the benefit of the thickness of the filter bed therefore became apparent as shown in fig 5 b as the cross sectional flow rate increased from 0 0026 to 0 0053 m s the turbidity removal rate of the two stage mpe separator decreased from 99 4 to 98 65 and that of the combined unit decreased from 99 43 to 98 75 the total turbidity removal rate was reduced by only 0 68 the mpe separator demonstrated excellent flow adaptation in terms of turbidity removal capacity overall lower cross sectional flow rates led to higher separation efficiency however normal operation conditions of the plant under industrial applications should be considered therefore considering the purification requirements oil content less than 50 mg l required before entering the extraction reactor and treatment capacity the final test flow rate was determined as 1 6 m3 h with a cross sectional flow rate of 0 0035 m s and treatment capacity of 38 4 m3 d at which long term monitoring was conducted 3 2 effect of influent fluctuation the continuous operation of the test device was monitored for a prolonged period although the pollutant content of the incoming process water fluctuated greatly the test device constantly demonstrated a good separation performance in terms of oil removal fig 6 a when the influent oil content was 500 800 mg l the oil content of the effluent from the secondary mpe separator was 60 120 mg l and the oil removal rate of the separator was 84 59 87 37 the oil content of the effluent from the cfc separator ranged within 12 25 mg l and the total oil removal rate of the combined unit was maintained between 96 21 and 97 74 with an average oil removal rate of 96 96 the combined device stabilised the oil content of the effluent below 25 mg l which was substantially lower than the standard required by the factory below 50 mg l in terms of turbidity removal the mpe separator demonstrated an excellent performance fig 6 b the turbidity of the imported process water ranged within 1100 1400 ntu and the effluent turbidity of the two stage mpe separator was 6 15 ntu the turbidity removal rate of the two stage mpe separator was maintained between 98 90 and 99 48 and it remained mainly above 99 the average turbidity removal rate was 99 21 the final effluent turbidity of the combined unit was stabilised below 12 ntu with an average turbidity removal rate of 99 35 the two stage mpe separator at the front end could better eliminate the influence of water quality changes on the cfc separator and final effluent effect the oil and suspension removal ability of the primary mpe separator fluctuated which was mainly attributed to the pressure drop variation and intermittent backwashing operation the secondary mpe separator and cfc separator were stable in terms of operating conditions and separation performance the combined unit ensured the stable depth separation of oil and suspended solids under fluctuating conditions 3 3 backwash regeneration of mpe separator bed with time the operation of mpe granular beds lead to the accumulation of impurities in the bed voids which reduces the void flow path and increases the bed pressure loss the accumulation of impurities also hinders the spreading of the oil film and reduces the contact area between the oil film and oil droplets which reduces the overall processing capacity of the bed when the pressure drop reaches a certain value the bed can be backwashed with nitrogen water or steam water during backwashing the mpe granular bed is fluidised by external forces water impact airflow impact which leads to the rotation of some particles thereby increasing the contact area between the particles and the backwash water this enhances the backwash efficiency and restores the performance of the mpe granular bed 29 33 the pressure drop changes and backwashing regeneration of the primary mpe separator under the long term operation of the test equipment were examined the pressure drop of the primary mpe separator was recorded at 20 h intervals fig 7 a the initial operating bed demonstrated almost no pressure drop only approximately 0 004 mpa and it reached more than 0 09 mpa after approximately 120 140 h backwashing was applied when the bed pressure drop reached 0 09 mpa the nitrogen and water flow rates for the backwash were 2 nm3 h and 1 6 m3 h respectively the backwash progress was determined by sampling the backwash solution at regular intervals from the outlet fig 7 b as the backwash time increased the sample gradually changed from yellow to black to grey which indicated that the residual suspended matter and dirty oil in the bed were gradually washed away no clear particulate matter was observed in the samples after 45 min under the adopted backwashing intensity during the pilot test period three backwashing operations were conducted the initial operating pressure drop of the bed after backwashing was approximately 0 01 mpa and the backwashing cycle was unchanged further combined with the treatment effects section 3 2 the results demonstrate that the backwashing effectively regenerated the granular bed for the long term operation of the device 3 4 technical comparison the current process water treatment unit includes conventional coalescer air flotation separator walnut shell filter and double medium filter which is a conventional treatment process with four stages in series operation fig 8 a the influent characteristics of the process water used in the pilot scale process were the same as those in industrial scale operations the effluent oil concentration and turbidity from the pilot test were compared with data from the industrial plant as shown in fig 8 b c during the pilot test the inlet oil content of the water treatment system was 606 184 mg l and turbidity was 1213 117 ntu mean sd the outlet oil and turbidity contents of the industrial plant were 48 3 28 mg l and 49 5 32 4 ntu whereas those of the pilot plant were 18 4 7 mg l and 7 9 4 1 ntu the oil and turbidity removal efficiencies of the pilot plant were 61 67 and 84 04 higher than those of the industrial plant respectively and the fluctuation of oil content and turbidity at the outlet was 25 that of the industrial plant the combined mpe cfc process demonstrated a more consistent and efficient oil and turbidity removal than the industrial plant the treatment capacity of the plant for process water was 64 m3 h considering electricity consumption the three waste treatment waste water waste gas waste residue and operating costs the new process was comparable to the conventional process as shown in table 2 compared to the conventional process the new process required fewer devices and shorter processing time which reduced the required space and processing time for a treatment capacity of 64 m3 h the new process requires only approximately 100 m2 of space which means saving 80 of the floor space as the conventional process requires a large number of units and the air flotation separator requires a powerful air pump to produce sufficient microbubbles a large amount of electricity is consumed whereas the units involved in the new process only require electricity for the normal process and backwashing which represents a reduction of 92 5 in the energy consumption in addition the new process produced no waste gas during operation waste water was mainly generated during the backwashing process and consumed approximately half the amount of the traditional system and nearly no waste residue was produced the generation and treatment of the three wastes is reflected in the water treatment costs and the new process greatly reduces the investment in workforce and financial resources compared to the conventional process 4 conclusions in this study a physical combined treatment process based on mpe and cfc technology was designed and a pilot test was conducted to investigate the separation characteristics of the device and the influence of operating conditions the main results were as follows 1 the best apparent flow rate of the device was 0 0035 m s the suspended solids were mainly intercepted and separated by the primary mpe separator and the pressure drop increased from 0 005 to 0 09 mpa in a backwashing cycle of 120 h gas water combined backwashing presented a good performance and it effectively restored the performance of the mpe bed 2 the mpe and cfc separators maintained a long term stability of operation at a flow rate of 1 6 m3 h the average oil content decreased from 606 to 18 4 mg l and the average oil removal rate reached 96 96 the average turbidity of the process water decreased from 1213 to 7 9 ntu and the average turbidity removal rate reached 99 35 3 compared with conventional water treatment processes the presented novel process improves the treatment efficiency moreover it reduces the required floor area by 80 the energy consumption by 92 5 the discharge of three wastes by a large margin and the water treatment cost is lower this study provides a novel approach for a green and efficient treatment of process water in ethane steam cracking plants this process improves effluent quality energy consumption and pollutant emissions and the results provide data support for similar system research the novel process has a good potential for application in other wastewaters containing highly emulsified oil and suspended solids such as wastewater from petroleum extraction petrochemical processes and coal chemical industries in addition future studies should further investigate the service life of mpe particles to improve the industrial applicability of this process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

12567,ethane steam cracking to ethylene plants produce a large amount of organic sewage containing oil and suspended solids which can lead to heat exchanger blockage and steam regeneration difficulties efficient treatment and recycling of process water is one of the keys to ensure a stable operation of ethylene production plant the traditional multi stage tandem process water treatment process has issues such as long treatment process blockage of flow path by coke powder particles and incomplete oil water separation therefore this study proposes a cooperative process combining medium particles extraction mpe and combined fibrous coalescence cfc technology to remove oil and turbidity in process water based on laboratory tests and analyses a pilot test of process water purification with a flow rate of 1 6 m3 h was implemented the results of the pilot test demonstrated that the process reduced the average oil content of process water from 606 to 18 4 mg l and the average turbidity from 1213 to 7 9 ntu with average separation efficiencies of 96 96 and 99 35 respectively compared with current process water treatments this approach provides a higher operational flexibility better separation effect and it is more environmentally friendly this study provides a novel approach for a green and efficient treatment and recycling of process water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ethylene production process water oily wastewater coalescence filtration physical separation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ethylene production capacity is one of the important indicators of the level of petrochemical development of a country 1 ethylene production in europe and asia pacific is dominated by naphtha cracking which has disadvantages such as high energy consumption low production rate and poor production continuity 2 in recent years the technical advantages of steam cracking for ethylene production using ethane as feedstock have gradually emerged and this process has attracted increasing attention 3 ethane cracking has been implemented in many ethylene production plants worldwide for instance ethylene produced from ethane accounts for 67 of the total production in the middle east and 52 in north america 4 in ethylene production the quality of process water is directly related to the quality of operation of the cracking unit and energy consumption therefore the purification of process water is important to ensure a stable ethylene production 5 the specific process of the generation treatment and circulation of process water is described as follows fig 1 the water vapor in the cracking furnace acts as a dilution steam to promote the cracking reaction at high temperatures the dehydrogenation or chain breaking reaction of ethane and propane produce cracked gas containing hydrogen methane ethylene propylene and other target products the cracked gas is cooled in the quench water tower where the steam is cooled into quench water containing oil and suspended solids process water is formed after removing heavy gasoline from quench water after removing large particles through the filter the process water enters the process water treatment system for purification treatment of oil removal and turbidity removal the purified process water enters the extraction separator and stripping tower in turn to remove soluble organic matter and acid gas subsequently the process water enters the dilution steam generation unit for steam regeneration and is recycled as the dilution steam this steam can reduce the partial pressure of hydrocarbon decelerate the coking rate and increase the thermal stability of the raw gas in the cracking process if the process water is not recycled a large amount of additional steam is needed in the cracking process and the quench system discharges a large amount of sewage which increases the energy consumption of the plant and the burden of the sewage treatment plant the high temperature cracking gas is not adsorbed in the quench oil tower during the ethane steam cracking process therefore it directly enters the quench water tower which leads to the production of an oil water emulsion with complex oil components and high impurity content 6 the treatment of process water generated during ethane steam cracking for ethylene production has not been widely studied several ethane steam cracking plants in china do not have reliable technology for the treatment of process water and they refer to treatment methods used for petroleum hydrocarbon cracking the current process water treatment process faces the following main problems 7 9 flow path blockage by easily polymerized heavy oil components and coke powder particles long treatment process low oil removal efficiency and incomplete oil water separation which causes the dilution steam to carry oil and affects the operation of the cracking furnace therefore an efficient and stable treatment technology for process water should be urgently developed the removal of impurities and emulsified oils is the premise of an efficient recycling of process water however traditional oil water separation technologies cannot be easily applied for process water treatment for instance gravity sedimentation 10 centrifugal separation 11 and plate agglomeration 12 are not effective in separating emulsified oils whereas dissolved gas and induced air flotation techniques 13 14 require the use of chemicals and can cause secondary pollution including volatile waste gas and floating slag furthermore filter element filtration membrane filtration and other precision separation techniques 15 16 are highly prone to clogging and have the limitations of high cost and membrane contamination despite their high efficiency in contrast media coalescence technology can efficiently purify organic sewage with high suspended matter and emulsified oil content and the main forms of coalescence media are particles and fibres particle coalescence separators have a dual function of removing both oils and suspended solids the oil removal function is based on the wettability of the medium surface which provides an area for oil droplets to coalesce the oil droplets collide with and are captured by the medium surface while flowing in the bed channel and they are separated from the medium surface after coalescence and growth 17 the removal of the suspended solids is based on the principle of deep bed filtration 18 19 the particles are captured by the bed media through interception and adsorption and after accumulation until the maximum bed interception capacity the particles are removed by backwashing the selection and collocation of coalescence materials are crucial for the oil removal effect of particle coalescing separators in terms of media wettability some researchers suggest that the use of pro dispersion aggregative media can improve the separation performance 20 22 regarding combined media kulkarni 10 23 reported that the separation performance achieved by hydrophilic and hydrophobic combined media was better than that of single media and the former significantly reduced the bed pressure drop on this basis this study proposes a medium particle extraction technology mpe which considers the ability of the particle bed to intercept large suspended matter and the ease of backwashing the particle bed was constructed by combining oleophilic hydrophilic heterogeneous particles with a multiple flow channel structure aiming to collaboratively separate oil and suspended matter fibrous media can provide greater filling density and specific surface area relative to rigid particulate fillers and they present higher separation accuracy which can be used for emulsion separation yang 24 25 used fibre gauge weaving to combine hydrophilic and oleophilic heterogeneous fibres with different wettability in specific proportions and geometrical configurations upon appropriate assumptions lu 26 developed a theoretical prediction model to quantify the quantitative relationship between macroscopic parameters e g fibre size droplet size bed thickness and fibre bed separation efficiency the combined fibrous coalescer was developed by combining the two person technology and it has shown excellent oil removal ability in pilot tests and engineering applications in several wastewater de oiling processes 27 30 these technologies provide technical insights into the rapid and efficient purification of process water from ethane steam cracking considering the abovementioned industrial and technological background this study proposes an integrated purification of process water for oil and turbidity removal by combining mpe and cfc technology the method is based on physical separation and it aims to achieve an efficient and environmentally friendly treatment and recycling of process water this study comprises the design and implementation of a pilot test based on laboratory tests and analyses the separation effect and parameter influence were investigated the regeneration performance and pressure drop of the mpe separator were determined and the separation performance and water quality adaptability of the purification method were verified this study provides a novel approach for the treatment of process water from ethane steam cracking in ethylene production plants 2 experiments and methods 2 1 water quality analysis the process water used in this experiment was obtained from the quench water separation tank fig 1 the process water belongs to soft water and its source water is generated from the boiler feed water after de oxygenation as the acid gas in the cracking gas is dissolved in the process water its water quality is weakly acidic influenced by operation conditions the oil content and turbidity of process water fluctuate significantly the quality index parameters of process water are shown in table 1 process water has complex organic components mainly including aromatic hydrocarbons olefins and oxygenates table s1 in addition the suspended solids in the process water are mainly coke powder generated during the cracking reaction of hydrocarbon compounds and their particle size distribution is also shown in table 1 2 2 pilot plant and process 2 2 1 principle of coalescent separator the particles used in mpe separator are highly hydrophilic or lipophilic and they are resistant to high temperatures and corrosion the bed of mpe separator is composed of two or more different oleophilic hydrophilic heterogeneous particles that can separate suspended oil and small amounts of soluble organic matter and suspended solids by collision flow interception induced coalescence oil droplet internal circulation capture and deep filtration the principle of the mpe oil removal technology is coalescence the oily effluent moves from the top to the bottom through the mpe bed which has oleophilic and oleophobic properties during this flow oil droplets adhere to the lipophilic particles and form an oil film on their surface the presence of the oil film increases the probability of oil droplet aggregation on the oil film where they will fuse grow and eventually be released 31 as shown in fig 2 a based on similar miscibility mechanisms organic substances are dissolved on the surface of oil films the oil films generate internal vortices under the shearing action of the water flow which enables a continuous renewal between the interior and the surface through the internal circulation of oil droplets and facilitates the transfer of organic substances 30 32 hydrophilic particles ensure that the bed is not completely covered by the oil film improve fluidity and guarantee the separation efficiency the separation of suspended solids by the particles in the mpe bed primarily depends on the adsorption and interception by the bed when large particles flow through the bed they are intercepted between the pores because their size is larger than the bed void for small suspended particles owing to the many small channels on the surface of mpe

internals of cfc separators were composed of oleophilic and hydrophilic heterogeneous fibres woven in x and ω structural patterns with soft micron sized fibre media which provided a high specific surface area and filling density the oil water intercalated emulsion droplets were separated owing to the difference between the polar forces of oil and water when flowing through the heterogeneous fibre cross nodes which led to emulsion breaking and efficient capture of the remaining micro droplets the bed was designed with a large void ratio to prevent clogging the separated oil droplets were collected and discharged by the oil package as shown in fig 2 c to prevent corrosion the oleophilic fibre material used in the interior was ptfe and the hydrophilic fibre material was stainless steel fibre 2 2 2 bed thickness of mpe separator separability cycle testing of process water samples was conducted using an mpe test rig with a flow rate of 20 l h and bed thickness of 400 mm owing to the 12 h interval between field sampling and experimental tests the initial turbidity of the samples during the tests was 586 ntu which was slightly lower than those in the field the turbidity decreased to 17 8 ntu after passing through the bed for the first time and the obtained water was clear after five cycles the turbidity decreased to 1 15 ntu which indicated a good separation performance after further five cycles the turbidity was almost unchanged therefore the bed thickness of the mpe separator of the pilot plant was initially selected as 2000 mm which corresponded to five cycles fig 3 shows the decreasing trend of turbidity of the treated water samples with the number of cycles higher bed thickness leads to a higher number of coalescence cycles and lower oil and solid contents in outlet water however a high bed thickness can affect the backwash regeneration efficiency therefore two mpe separators were designed considering the oil and suspension removal efficiencies backwashing efficiency and industrial manufacturing and a bed thickness of 1200 mm was selected for each mpe separator 2 2 3 pilot test process fig 4 a shows the flow of the pilot plant the process water successively passed through two mpe separators for the removal of suspended oil and solids and then flowed into the cfc separator for further removal of oil emulsified in the water the heavy oil

backwashing the backwashing was performed using nitrogen and water and the backwashing liquid was discharged to the floor drainpipe network a sampling port was set at the outlet of each separator to determine the influence of parameters including cross section velocity incoming material fluctuation and bed backwashing on the separation performance 2 3 analysis and measurements the oil content was determined by an infrared spectrophotometer et1200 shanghai euro tech ltd china the turbidity was measured using a portable turbidimeter 2100q hach usa the particle size distribution of the suspended solids was analysed using a malvern laser diffraction particle size analyser mastersizer 3000 uk the organic composition of the process water was determined using gas chromatography mass spectrometry

conditions the cross sectional flow rate has the most critical impact on the coalescence effect 17 therefore the optimal cross sectional flow rate was explored to maximise the treatment capacity on the premise of meeting the purification index for processing capacities of 1 2 1 6 2 0 and 2 4 m3 h the apparent flow rates were 0 0026 0 0035 0 0044 and 0 0053 m s respectively in terms of oil removal fig 5 a the drag force of water flow increased as the cross sectional flow rate increased which decreased in the trapping performance of particles and fibre medium towards oil droplets and the oil removal rate of each separator presented a significant downward trend the oil removal efficiency of the two stage mpe separator decreased from 89 14 to 80 81 as the cross sectional flow rate increased from 0 0026 to 0 0053 m s and the oil removal efficiency of the total unit decreased from 98 01 to 93 53 the turbidity removal rate of the primary mpe separator decreased significantly as the cross sectional flow rate increased whereas the total turbidity removal rate of the mpe separator decreased only slightly the benefit of the thickness of the filter bed therefore became apparent as shown in fig 5 b as the cross sectional flow rate increased from 0 0026 to 0 0053 m s the turbidity removal rate of the two stage mpe separator decreased from 99 4 to 98 65 and that of the combined unit decreased from 99 43 to 98 75 the total turbidity removal rate was reduced by only 0 68 the mpe separator demonstrated excellent flow adaptation in terms of turbidity removal capacity overall lower cross sectional flow rates led to higher separation efficiency however normal operation conditions of the plant under industrial applications should be considered therefore considering the purification requirements oil content less than 50 mg l required before entering the extraction reactor and treatment capacity the final test flow rate was determined as 1 6 m3 h with a cross sectional flow rate of 0 0035 m s and treatment capacity of 38 4 m3 d at which long term monitoring was conducted 3 2 effect of influent fluctuation the continuous operation of the test device was monitored for a prolonged period although the pollutant content of the incoming process water fluctuated greatly the test device constantly demonstrated a good separation performance in terms of oil

turbidity removal the mpe separator demonstrated an excellent performance fig 6 b the turbidity of the imported process water ranged within 1100 1400 ntu and the effluent turbidity of the two stage mpe separator was 6 15 ntu the turbidity removal rate of the two stage mpe separator was maintained between 98 90 and 99 48 and it remained mainly above 99 the average turbidity removal rate was 99 21 the final effluent turbidity of the combined unit was stabilised below 12 ntu with an average turbidity removal rate of 99 35 the two stage mpe separator at the front end could better eliminate the influence of water quality changes on the cfc separator and final effluent effect the oil and suspension removal ability of the primary mpe separator fluctuated which was mainly attributed to the pressure drop variation and intermittent backwashing operation the secondary mpe separator and cfc separator were stable in terms of operating conditions and separation performance the combined unit ensured the stable depth separation of oil and suspended solids under fluctuating conditions 3 3 backwash regeneration of mpe separator bed with time the operation of mpe granular beds lead to the accumulation of impurities in the bed voids which reduces the void flow path and increases the bed pressure loss the accumulation of impurities also hinders the spreading of the oil film and reduces the contact area between the oil film and oil droplets which reduces the overall processing capacity of the bed when the pressure drop reaches a certain value the bed can be backwashed with nitrogen

initial operating bed demonstrated almost no pressure drop only approximately 0 004 mpa and it reached more than 0 09 mpa after approximately 120 140 h backwashing was applied when the bed pressure drop reached 0 09 mpa the nitrogen and water flow rates for the backwash were 2 nm3 h and 1 6 m3 h respectively the backwash progress was determined by sampling the backwash solution at regular intervals from the outlet fig 7 b as the backwash time increased the sample gradually changed from yellow to black to grey which indicated that the residual suspended matter and dirty oil in the bed were gradually washed away no clear particulate matter was observed in the samples after 45 min under the adopted backwashing intensity during the pilot test period three backwashing operations were conducted the initial operating pressure drop of the bed after backwashing was approximately 0 01 mpa and the backwashing cycle was unchanged further combined with the treatment effects section 3 2 the results demonstrate that the backwashing effectively regenerated the granular bed for the long term operation of the device 3 4 technical comparison the current process water treatment unit

characteristics of the process water used in the pilot scale process were the same as those in industrial scale operations the effluent oil concentration and turbidity from the pilot test were compared with data from the industrial plant as shown in fig 8 b c during the pilot test the inlet oil content of the water treatment system was 606 184 mg l and turbidity was 1213 117 ntu mean sd the outlet oil and turbidity contents of the industrial plant were 48 3 28 mg l and 49 5 32 4 ntu whereas those of the pilot plant were 18 4 7 mg l and 7 9 4 1 ntu the oil and turbidity removal efficiencies of the pilot plant were 61 67 and 84 04 higher than those of the industrial plant respectively and the fluctuation of oil content and turbidity at the outlet was 25 that of the industrial plant the combined mpe cfc process demonstrated a more consistent and efficient oil and turbidity removal than the industrial plant the treatment capacity of the plant for process water was 64 m3 h considering electricity consumption the three waste treatment waste water waste gas waste residue and operating costs the new process was comparable to the conventional process as shown in table 2 compared to the conventional process the new process required fewer devices and shorter processing time which reduced the required space and processing time for a treatment capacity of 64 m3 h the new process requires only approximately 100 m2 of space which means saving 80 of the floor space as the conventional process requires a large number of units and the air flotation separator requires a powerful air pump to produce sufficient microbubbles a large amount of electricity is consumed whereas the units involved in the new process only require electricity for the normal process and backwashing which represents a reduction of 92 5 in the energy consumption in addition the new process produced no waste gas during operation waste water was mainly generated during the backwashing process and consumed approximately half the amount of the traditional system and nearly no waste residue was produced the generation and treatment of the three wastes is reflected in the water treatment costs and the new process greatly reduces the investment in workforce and financial resources compared to the conventional process 4 conclusions in this study a physical combined treatment process based on mpe and cfc technology was designed and a pilot test was conducted to investigate the separation characteristics of the device and the influence of operating conditions the main results were as follows 1 the best apparent flow rate of the device was 0 0035 m s the suspended solids were mainly intercepted and separated by the primary mpe separator and the pressure drop increased from 0 005 to 0 09 mpa in a backwashing cycle of 120 h gas water combined backwashing presented a good performance and it effectively restored the performance of the mpe bed 2 the mpe and cfc separators maintained a long term stability of operation at a flow rate of 1 6 m3 h the average oil content decreased from 606 to 18 4 mg l and the average oil removal rate reached 96 96 the average turbidity of the process water decreased from 1213 to 7 9 ntu and the average turbidity removal rate reached 99 35 3 compared with conventional water treatment processes the presented novel process improves the treatment efficiency moreover it reduces the required floor area by 80 the energy consumption by 92 5 the discharge of three wastes by a large margin and the water treatment cost is lower this study provides a novel approach for a green and efficient treatment of process water in ethane steam cracking plants this process improves effluent quality energy consumption and pollutant emissions and the results provide data support for similar system research the novel process has a good potential for application in other wastewaters containing highly emulsified oil and suspended solids such as wastewater from petroleum extraction petrochemical processes and coal chemical industries in addition future studies should further investigate the service life of mpe

12568,cu2o cuxfeyo4 nanohybrids nhs have been electrosynthesized by a simple and environmentally safe method to be used as catalysts for tetracycline degradation nhs shown an average diameter of 14 5 nm and exhibit high crystallinity with spherical morphology xps results demonstrate a cuprite enriched surface meanwhile the inner layer is composed by a nonstoichiometric copper spinel structure the degradation has been monitored by uv visible spectroscopy toc analysis and hplc the electrochemical characterization demonstrates the synergetic effect of fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu coupling to enhance the activation of persulfate this effect results in a greater degradation efficiency of nhs than other catalysts namely cuxoy fe3o4 and a mixture of both and cu2o it has been found that a previous adsorption stage before degradation does not improve the elimination of the pollutant and its length in time with a toc reduction of 72 6 in 2 h conversely conducting the oxidative process in a direct step resulted in a more rapid and efficient process 82 3 of reduction in 1 h through this method the catalyst reutilization resulting in a decrease of 50 in toc degradation from the third use while the tcy concentration degraded remains almost constant this reduced catalytic activity with use might be a consequence of 1 the absence of the single cu oxide layer due to the leaching of mainly cu ions but also fe ions during the degradation tests and 2 the passivation of the outermost layer mainly covered by co species and oh groups which hinders access to active catalyst sites keywords advanced oxidation process sodium persulphate catalyst degradation tetracycline emerging pollutants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tetracyclines tcs are a group of widely used antibiotics including tetracycline tcy chlorotetracycline ctc and oxytetracycline otc these compounds are used as treatment for bacterial infectious diseases in humans and animals and as alimentary supplements to improve livestock growth 1 2 tcs degradation is very challenging for human and animal metabolisms which causes the excretion through urine and feces of around 70 of the tcs administrated after their excretion tcs end up in soils and wastewater causing their contamination 2 wastewater treatment plants get rid of a small amount of the antibiotics in wastewater and another significant part is released into the medium 2 several studies have been conducted to determine the impact of tcs on the environment showing their toxicity for some aquatic species 3 4 moreover the presence of tcs in wastewater promotes the increase of antibiotic resistant genes in some microorganisms which can be a significant problem for human health when these microorganisms are present in drinking or irrigation water 2 5 7 thus it is necessary to find new efficient methods to remove tcs compounds from the soils and wastewater advanced oxidation processes aops are an excellent way to degrade and mineralize organic pollutants in wastewater due to its unique advantages including ease of operation high degradation efficiency and benign process aops are based on the in situ generation of radicals that oxidize the organic compounds causing their transformation into smaller molecules and even co2 and h2o 8 9 the most common radicals used in these processes are hydroxyl radicals oh produced through the activation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sulphate radicals so4 which can be generated by oxidants like persulfate s2o8 2 in the last years sulphate radicals drew a lot of attention because they have a higher redox potential e0 so4 so4 2 2 60 3 10 v vs nhe than the hydroxyl ones e0 oh oh 1 90 2 70 v vs nhe 10 also persulfate is more stable than hydrogen peroxide and can be transported for a longer time before being activate for the pollutants degradation 11 homogenous or heterogeneous catalysts are the most studied method for persulfate activation furthermore heterogeneous aops sometimes are combined with other sources of energy to improve antibiotics removal from wastewater such as ultrasounds electricity 12 or uv 13 16 the use of a mixture of persulfate anions and homogeneous ferrous cations in acidic media has been studied in aops 17 18 nevertheless some problems arise i the catalyst cannot easily be recovered after its use and ii the processes require very low ph 3 that has to be neutralize after process generating iron residues hence new investigations are focused on the development of heterogeneous catalysts which can be recovered and used several times 17 many researchers have focused their attention on bimetallic and trimetallic catalyst 19 20 being the formation of so4 via transition metal catalysis the main oxidizing specie 21 22 minxian et al has reported the tetracycline degradation mechanism with a catalyst obtained from fe sludge doped with cu ions they reported the benefits of the synergic redox couple cu2 cu e 0 17 v and fe3 fe2 e 0 77 v in the persulfate activation 23 the possible degradation mechanism in a bimetallic catalyst consists of fe and cu transition metal was proposed as follow fe3 react with persulfate to form fe2 and s2o8 radicals the fe2 activate persulfate ions to form active sulphate radicals eqs 1 2 the same reaction also take place with cu2 and cu species eqs 3 4 in addition the standard reduction potentials of fe and cu species creates a conductive atmosphere for the reduction of fe3 to fe2 and cu to cu2 eq 5 24 moreover oh is generated but has a minor contribution in the degradation process eq 6 finally the degradation mechanism showed that tcy could be partially or totally removed because of so4 and oh eq 7 1 fe 3 s 2 o 8 2 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 s o 4 2 s o 4 3 cu 2 s 2 o 8 2 cu s 2 o 8 4 cu s 2 o 8 2 cu 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 5 fe 3 cu fe 2 cu 2 6 s o 4 h 2 o oh s o 4 2 h 7 oh s o 4 tcy intermediate h 2 o c o 2 more recent studies about tcy degradation by heterogeneous aops using cu and fe as the main catalyst components are presented in table 1 in some of these works ferrites nanoparticles are supported by other materials to improve the degradation efficiency in the light of all we have mentioned the present study was focused on the one step electrochemical synthesis and characterization of nhs constituted by cu2o cuxfeyo4 nanoparticles and their application as catalysts in tcy degradation via persulphate activation moreover the proposed green methodology for the nhs synthesis can be scaled up easily as has been already demonstrated by previous research in magnetite producing about 1 g of catalyst hourly 30 the catalytic activity of the catalyst will be compared with different catalyst constituted by only iron fe3o4 only copper cu2o and a mixture of both in addition the competing relationship of the adsorption degradation processes on the final catalytic efficiency is demonstrated finally the catalyst reusability is also proposed 2 experimental part 2 1 catalysts synthesis the synthesis of cu2o cuxfeyo4 nanohybrids nhs was performed following a similar protocol published by our group for the electrosynthesis of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles 31 briefly two foils of iron and copper of 2 cm2 each were used as anode electrodes and a cylindrical cathode of iron was placed around those electrodes whose area was 120 cm2 the use of a larger cathode surface placed around anode electrodes ensure a homogeneous current distribution current densities of 50 ma cm2 were applied to iron and copper foils to promote the oxidation and release of copper and iron cations through the solution at the same time in the cathode the water reduction takes place and generates hydroxyl species which produces a basic ph in the solution at this ph the generation of copper and iron oxides is favoured 0 04 m of nacl aqueous solution was used as a supporting electrolyte the synthesis temperature was controlled by a thermostat bath at 25 c the solution was magnetically stirred at 1100 rpm during 30 min of reaction a scheme of the reactor is provided in fig 1 in the first stages of the electrochemical synthesis the solution turns black remaining unchanged until the end of the reaction period afterward the nhs were separated from the electrolyte solution with a magnet and washed three times with distilled water following the sequence sonication for 5 min and magnetic decantation until the supernatant was clear the washed nhs were dried under vacuum at room temperature to compare the degradation efficiency of the nanohybrids magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized following the electrochemical method in a mixture of 20 80 methanol water previously reported by our group 32 in this case only a foil of iron acts as the anode while the cathode is parallel to the anode electrode with this methodology we were able to synthesize magnetite nanoparticles nps with similar size to those of nhs at the same time the electrochemical methodology was used to synthetized copper oxide catalyst cuxoy following the same protocol described for nhs synthesis but using a single copper electrode as anode 2 2 catalyst characterization the morphology of the nhs were evaluated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem using a tecnai f30 fei electron microscope operated at 300 kv also a jeol 2000 fxii tem electron microscope operating at 120 kev was used to routinary visualize the morphology of the catalysts and obtain the size distribution the leaching of copper and iron in the reusability runs from the catalysts and the metal content in the fresh and four times used nhs were determined with a plasma emission spectrometer icp oes perkin elmer mod optima 2100 dv catalyst phase identification was examined by x ray diffraction xrd the diffractograms were collected on bruker d8 powder diffractometer equipped with a primary monochromator and an ultrafast lynxeye xe t multichannel detector with cu kα1 radiation panalytical x pert highscore software 33 was used for data analyses and full proof suit package 34 was used to quantify the percentage of the catalyst crystalline phases x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps has been used to characterize the elemental composition and the oxidation states of cu and fe on the surface of the nhs samples xps experiments were performed using an x ray source of al kα 1486 6 ev 35 the spectra were analyzed with the casaxps program casa software ltd cheshire uk using a shirley method for background subtraction and data processing for quantitative xps analysis spectra are displayed after subtracting the contribution of the al kα satellite emission in some cases the spectra were normalized to the maximum intensity to highlight line shape differences which provides direct valuable insight regarding the oxidation states 2 3 electrochemical tests the electrochemical characterization of the active species on the nhs surface was performed in a conventional electrochemical cell glassy carbon electrodes gc of area 0 196 cm2were used as working electrodes the electrode was pre cleaned through polishing with alumina powder 0 3 and 0 05 μm consecutively and then washed with milli q water to modify the electrode surfaces a catalytic inks were prepared dispersing 1 mg of the catalyst and 4 mg of carbon vulcan xc 72r in 5 ml of isopropanol water 1 4 v v and 20 μl of nafion under sonication for 30 min the electrodes were modified by spin coating dropping 20 μl of the catalytic ink on the gc surface the electrochemical analyses were performed using an autolab 302 n potentiostat and a pine rotation rate control unit graphite rod and ag agcl electrode were used as counter and reference electrode respectively the potential values have been referred to reversible hydrogen electrode rhe using the relation e rhe e ag agcl 0 199 0 059 ph electrochemical characterization was performed by cyclic voltammetry at ph 6 in n2 saturated solutions the electrocatalytic tests were performed with a rotating electrode at 1600 rpm at ph 6 in n2 saturated solutions and in presence of 0 5 mm of sodium persulphate sps 2 4 adsorption and advanced oxidation process aops adsorption process the adsorption evaluation process was performed for 2 h under mechanical agitation 680 rpm in a thermostatic bath at 25 c in a typical experiment 1 0 g l of nhs was dispersed in a tcy aqueous solution 25 ml at ph 6 of 100 ppm two conventional kinetic models pseudo first order q t q e 1 e k 1 t and pseudo second order q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q t k 2 t were applied to investigate the adsorption kinetic further advance oxidation process one step protocol the experimental conditions were the same as described for adsorption process but for this experiment 0 5 mm of sps was added to the tcy solution before adding the catalyst the performance of the different catalyst on the degradation reaction of tcy were studied with this protocol the reusability of the nhs was evaluated by performing four cycling runs after the completion of the reaction the separated nhs were washed with distilled water and dried for the subsequent cycle test advance oxidation process two steps protocol a mixture of the two previous protocols were conducted at the same adsorption conditions the catalyst was in contact with the pollutant for 1 h to ensure a steady state equilibrium afterward 0 5 mm of sps was added into the above mixing solution and immediately the degradation begins and last 1 h pollutant elimination quantification at the given time sample aliquots 1 0 ml were withdrawn from the test and centrifuged for 2 min at 12 000 rpm those samples were analyzed by monitoring the absorbance at λmax 357 nm in uv vis spectra with a perkin elmer uv vis lambda 365 spectrophotometer the quantification of the total organic content toc left in solution with time last 1 h was analyzed with a toc 5000a model shimadzu analyzer considering the average of at least three measurements with an accuracy of 5 the evolution of tetracycline concentration was also analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc msms evoq elite using an ace excel 2 column 100 mm length 3 mm diameter as stationary phase analyses were performed using a mixture of h2omq 0 5 formic acid and methanol 0 05 formic acid as mobile phase with a proportion 98 2 v v 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanohybrids characterization tem image of nhs shown in fig 2a presents nanoparticles with quasi spherical morphology with a mean diameter of 14 5 nm the synthetized nhs presents high crystallinity reflected in the clearly visible crystallographic planes observed in the high resolution tem image fig 2b the metal analysis obtained by icp in the nhs reveals an important amount of copper with a total fe cu molar ratio of 2 66 xrd pattern of fresh nhs sample depicted in fig 3 presents broad reflexions correlated with particles in the nanosized regimen the analysis of the obtained pattern reveals two structures attributed to cubic spinel mfe2o4 with m cu fe and cuprite cu2o structures with space group fd 3m 227 and pn 3m 224 respectively the lattice parameter analysis of the cubic spinel is 8 383 1 å this value is in the range of other cooper ferrites 8 424 8 3715 å synthesized by coprecipitation method followed by calcination at different temperatures 36 37 and higher than the lattice parameters reported for electrosynthetized iron ferrite nanoparticles described in bibliography with similar particle sizes 8 370 8 374 å 32 which is associated to the bigger cu2 atomic radius when compared to fe2 one it is worth to mention that in nanosized regime maghemite ϒ fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 copper ferrite cufe2o4 and copper doped iron oxide have cubic spinel structures at room temperature 36 38 with similar lattice parameters which makes it difficult to ensure the nhs composition seeking to clarify this point detailed xps analysis is further performed in the fresh nhs to get some insight on the iron and copper oxidation states the overall atomic concentration at surface composition of the nhs sample was summarized in table s1 the cu fe ratio obtained for the 3p and 2p levels reports values corresponding to a higher cu content than that calculated from the icp analysis which determines the composition of the whole nhs molar ratio in addition the cu fe ratio for the 2p level also provides a significantly higher and very distinct value than that obtained for the 3p state 2p peaks provide surface sensitivity since their emission comes mostly from the outermost layers of the nhs on the contrary low binding energy signals from 3p levels with higher kinetic energy are emitted from deeper regions which significantly enhances the contribution from the nhs as a whole with minor influence from the outer surface layers these results indicate the enrichment of copper atoms on the surface of the nhs a detailed line shape analysis of xps spectra is required to obtain information on the oxidation state of copper fig 3b compares the normalized cu 2p3 2 spectra corresponding to nhs with the representative signal from commercial cu2o the first thing to be noticed in the commercial reference sample is the absence of satellite emission at binding energy in the range from 940 to 945 cu 2p3 2 and 960 to 965 ev cu 2p1 2 respectively whose are known to be characteristic of the cuo phase 39 40 in contrast there is a relative shift towards lower binding energy of ca 1 3 ev in the peak position of the cu2o commercial sample with respect to nhs one this peak appears at the binding energy position of the shoulder seen on the right side of the cu 2p3 2 emission for the nhs sample and can be inferred to cu1 oxidation state peak fitting of the cu 2p3 2 spectra fig 3c was done by using the deconvolution of the component obtained from the fit of the cu2o reference 39 40 and several mixed gaussian lorentzian symmetric functions for cu2 oxidation state and satellites components using as parameters the binding energy shifts reported in 39 the first result is that copper is fully oxidized mostly as cuo but xps also allows distinguishing some contribution from cu2o and cu oh 2 let us turn our attention to the fe region fig s1 the described analysis see discussion in si suggests that fe3 mostly forms the fe oxide signal in the nhs samples even though the presence of fe2 species cannot be discarded in good agreement with the formation of cu doped iron ferrite nanoparticles based on these results the rietveld analysis of the fresh nhs present a core with an 88 3 of cu0 34fe2 66o4 where a partial substitution of the fe2 sites by cu2 takes place and the outer layers of the catalysts with 11 7 of cu2o which perfectly agrees with the fe cu molar ratio obtained by icp 3 2 catalytic evaluation 3 2 1 the degradation performance of tcy before the aops experiment of tetracycline the adsorption of the as prepared nhs to the target compound was conducted the tcy is an amphoteric molecule symbolized as tcyh2 with multiple ionizable functional groups at different phs tcyh3 is the predominant specie at ph 3 3 tcyh2 specie is predominant in the range 3 3 ph 7 7 while anionic tcyh is predominant specie for phs at 7 7 ph 9 7 and finally tcy2 is stable at ph 9 7 41 42 two conventional kinetic models pseudo first order and pseudo second order were applied to investigate the adsorption kinetic further the kinetics parameters obtained from the two models are listed in table s2 and the fitting graph is depicted in fig s2 the r2 value 0 96 of the fit according to the pseudo second order rate model was higher than the obtained from the pseudo first order rate model r2 0 921 in addition the values of qe cal derived from the pseudo second order rate model fit was closer to the qe exp values accordingly the pseudo second order kinetic model better represents the adsorption of tcy onto nhs 43 the adsorption removal efficiency obtained following the decrease in the maximum on the visible spectrum fig 4a is about 60 with a qe cal value of 66 mg g in agreement with the 59 removal after 1 h determined by toc and with the 43 7 ppm of antibiotic left in the supernatant measured by hplc for the same experiment fig 4a and b the nhs point of zero charge pzc is around ph 7 fig s3 so the surface of the catalyst was negatively charged at working ph and the dominant tcy species is tcyh2 hence the poor electrostatic repulsion experienced at this ph results in the high adsorption capacity observed in addition the interaction of cu2 with oxygen atoms of tcy molecules enhance the adsorption efficiency of the pollutant 44 in another experiment the pollutant and the catalyst were mixed up to reach the adsorption equilibrium afterwards the aops started with adding 0 5 mm of sps and lasted 1 h fig 4a and b first is worthy to mention that without catalysts only sps cannot degrade tetracycline although persulphate anion s2o8 2 has a high oxidation potential e0 2 01 ev its kinetically slow in reacting with many organic compounds 45 however when the catalyst is involved in the reaction a very fast catalytic degradation of tcy is observed in the early instants of the reaction caused by the chemical activation of the persulfate anion to generate the intermediate sulfate free radical oxidant so4 e0 2 6 v 46 we have also compared the degradation efficiency obtained with no previous adsorption stage against the experiment conducted in separate stages first adsorption and later degradation the toc removal and tcy left in solution of those experiments are represented in fig 4b targeted pollutant left in solution after only degradation and adsorption degradation processes is very similar with values of 1 95 and 1 0 ppm respectively a good elimination performance of tcy is important but even more crucial is the mineralization percentage measured by toc since it measures not only the amount of degraded tcy but also the by products of the oxidation reaction in this sense the toc mineralization efficiency is slightly lower in the two steps protocol 72 6 than in the direct degradation reaction 82 3 this variation in the toc obtained can be explained with the high adsorption capacity of cu2 to bind with the tcy which limits the further degradation process by hiding the catalyst s active sites in the two steps experiment similar results were observed for the degradation of tcy with a porous fe3o4 catalyst embedded in chitosan as the pollutant concentration increased 26 and with cuo particles encapsulated in a carbon framework 28 in other words the adsorption process is kinetically uncompetitive with the degradation process since once the one step oxidation starts the decolorization degradation happens within the first minutes lowering the c co of the pollutant ratio from 1 to nearly 0 2 representing an 80 decrease in the targeted pollutant content within the first few minutes furthermore in the two step method the larger experiment time could compromise the reusability of the catalyst in further cycles by the possible leaching of fe and cu cations we can conclude that the one step protocol is time saving and conducted to greater degradation doses 3 2 2 electrochemical catalytic evaluation of nhs vs fe3o4 as we have already explained the nhs composition is 88 3 of cu doped ferrite and 11 7 of cuprite to assess the role of the fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu on the nhs composition and for comparison purposes we have performed the aops with fe3o4 and nhs under the same experimental conditions the decolourisation test and the toc removal shown a great difference between those reaching with the nhs a complete decolourisation in the first 10 min while the fe3o4 remain around 0 8 throughout the course of the experiment fig 5 besides the toc removal values were 82 and 8 for nhs and fe3o4 respectively to characterize the superficial active sites contribution in the activation of sps in the degradation test an electrochemical characterization was performed by cyclic voltammetry with the nhs and fe3o4 nanoparticles scan rate 5 m v s at ph 6 in n2 saturated solutions fig 6a shows the voltammograms recorded for both catalysts as can be observed the fe3o4 nanoparticles show an irreversible faradaic process ea 0 42 v ec 0 24 v vs rhe which corresponds to the fe3 fe2 redox process of the superficial iron of the nanoparticles 47 however the voltammogram for the nhs presents an extra reversible process at more positive values ea 0 65 v ec 0 58 v vs rhe which is associated to the cu2 cu redox process of the copper atoms present in the nhs in addition the cathodic peak of the fe3 fe2 process is shifted to more positive values compared with the magnetite nanoparticles ec 0 38 v vs rhe this displacement could be associated by the presence of cooper in the nhs structure which can induce an electron withdrawing effect on the iron atoms and consequently shift the reduction process to more positive values to elucidate whether the iron or copper in the structure is responsible for the sps activation electrocatalytic tests were performed by rotating disc electrode rde 1600 rpm in the presence of 0 5 mm of sps at ph 6 the solution was previously de oxygenated with n2 to avoid the presence of o2 in the solution and hinder the oxygen reduction reaction via 2e with the consequent generation of h2o2 which could interfere in the electrocatalytic reduction of sps fig 6b shows the polarization curves recorded the electrocatalytic activity was evaluated considering the onset potential of the sps reduction potential when the sps reduction takes place the electroreduction of sps for both catalysts presents different onset potentials at 0 57 v and 0 30 v vs rhe for the nhs and fe3o4 nps respectively this fact informs the higher electrocatalytic activity of the nhs than the fe3o4 due to the lower overpotential needed to start the electroreduction additionally the onset potential of the electroreduction of sps is related to the redox processes fe3 fe2 or cu2 cu determined by cyclic voltammetry for fe3o4 and nhs respectively that is the electroreduction of sps starts with the presence of cu of the nhs or the presence of fe2 in the fe3o4 nanoparticles in which both sites are electrogenerated during the cathodic polarization 48 3 2 3 catalytic performance of nhs compared to other catalysts to further understand the catalytic abilities of the nhs proposed and the role of the cu2 cu and fe3 fe2 redox couples we have also assessed the catalysis efficiency of a commercial cuprite compound where only cu is present in the sample these tests have been performed for three distinct cuprite concentrations i e 0 3 1 0 g l and 0 117 g l the final concentration found in the nhs sample the toc degradation percentages are shown in fig 7a with increasing the catalyst concentration an increment in toc degradation has been observed achieving 18 36 and 64 of mineralization with the dose increase all these values are lower than that obtained by using the nhs catalyst 1 0 g l otherwise the carbon degradation observed using the same dose 0 117 g l of cuprite that the nhs is supposed to have is about 18 far from the value obtained for the nanohybrid 82 also with the maximum dose of cuprite catalyst 1 0 g l the tcy removal is lower this implies that not only the cu ion is involved in the degradation process but also the contribution of cu2 fe2 and fe3 cations are of key importance to provide a more realistic comparison of the tcy degradation obtained with the nhs we followed a similar experimental method described for the nhs synthesis but a single copper foil was oxidized in the electrolyte solution the cuxoy catalyst obtained were composed of quasi spherical particle aggregates and rod shape morphology as shown in fig s4 the rietveld analysis of the xrd pattern shows four well differentiated phases of cu2o cuo and cu oh 2 as well as cu in a residual proportion which were not able to be separated in the washing processes fig s5 therefore the sample we refer to as cuxoy is composed of both cu2 and cu the catalytic activity of cuxoy 1 0 g l and nhs 1 0 g l catalyst was compared with the one obtained with a mixture of cuxoy and spinel iron oxide powders in the same nhs proportion provided by rietveld analysis 11 7 88 3 in order to have cu2 cu and fe3 fe2 contributions fig 7b c even if the concentration of tcy left in the solution following the degradation is comparable for both nhs and the mixed sample catalysts the total organic removal is notably greater for the former catalyst this demonstrates that there might be a synergistic effect in the hybrid by the presence of copper ferrite thereby enhancing the relative rates of mass transfer to reactive sites and chemical reaction on these 3 2 4 the stability and application in various runs the catalyst recycling performance is of importance in real world application hence the catalyst was recovered to perform several runs further to investigate the catalytic stability of the nhs in aops fig 8a depicts the uv visible color removal of nhs in the four runs explored a greater decrease in the c co ratio is observed mainly from the third cycle and onwards the hplc analysis of tcy removal is shown in fig 8b the concentration of degraded tcy was 98 1 96 6 95 1 and 90 9 ppm in the four sequential runs in the toc analysis we found the most significant differences between cycles the mineralization percentage was 82 72 40 and 15 for each of the four cycles as shown in fig 8b the reusability test showed an improved capacity of the catalyst to be reused in comparison with the cu cufe2o4 catalyst proposed by 27 where at ph 7 in the second run the efficiency was drastically reduced mainly due to the higher cu leaching during the first run at this ph 100 mg l however in the case of cuo particles encapsulated in a polyhedral carbon framework the degradation rate diminished between the third and fifth runs possibly caused by the adsorption of by products on the catalyst active sites or by the leaching of copper 28 it is evident that after the oxidation process some catalyst leaching might appear by the consumption of sps in the solution after each cycle according to the mineralization reduction to further explore this hypothesis the metal ion leaching after each cycle was also explored fig 8c the copper leaching from the nanohybrid structure has been more pronounced than iron loss this evidence might result by the fact that the cuprite phase is non magnetic and therefore can stabilize eventually in aqueous media owing to their nanosized regimen making it impossible to collect them by centrifugation such particles may have subsequently been degraded in the acid digestion for icp analysis hence the measured concentration is not exclusively of cu ions in the solution and the cu content might be overestimated the weight content of cu present in the nhs structure measured by icp and referred to the total weight of the sample treated is initially 17 8 followed by the values of 14 2 10 6 7 8 and 3 8 after successive degradation cycles it seems evident that the substantial decrease in cu concentration occurred throughout several runs compromised the catalyst reusability 3 3 xps characterization of the nhs after the degradation tests after the degradation test the surface composition of the nhs samples was characterized by xps analysis and compared with the as synthetized nhs the atomic concentration at after the aops ads aops and the aops 4th run are summarized in table 2 as can be observed the 3p and 2p intensity ratios are different in the as synthetized nhs and after the 1 step aops and ads aops tests indicating that the enrichment of copper on the outer layer of the nhs remains during the first degradation tests however it is also worth mentioning that the analysis of the 3p and 2p core levels for the nhs aops 4th run sample provide the same value for both cu fe ratios so that relative total content of copper and iron is kept constant then at this stage 4th run the nhs can be considered as a uniform system according to xps depth sensitivity in the absence of cu2o shell cu2 is present in the ferrite lattice in agreement with the xrd results for the spinel structure fig s6 where a unique phase of fd 3m 227 spatial group is observed as previously mentioned xps is particularly sensitive to the species present on the surface of the nhs which is actually where the reaction takes place and can be an ideal technique to investigate the deactivation of the catalyst in the course of the reaction the relative change in c o and n content during the aops informs about the degradation mechanism the n signal could be considered as a fingerprint of tcy degradation and adsorption on the surface of the nhs and clearly appears upon the first step of aops and reaches its maximum intensity after the adsorption aops tests the n signal is reduced due to the partial coverage of the nhs surface with high amount of oh groups which produces a certain passivation effect the last reaction step 4th also shows a reduced n signal which explains the loss of catalytic activity of the nhs after the degradation results table 2 at this point further analysis of the corresponding c 1s and o 1s spectra are needed to study the progress of the reaction fig 9 show the deconvolution analysis of the c 1s and o 1s spectra for the fresh nhs nhs aops and nhs aops 4th run samples c 1s and o 1s fitting results are summarized in table s3 c 1s has been decomposed into several components ascribed to the different chemical environment as cc coh co co and oco ordered from low to high binding energy values respectively in accordance with their respective energy shift values reported 49 analogously o 1s has been fitted with three peaks attributed to lattice oxygen ol bound to the metal cation in the catalyst cu fe oxides adsorbed surface oxygen including mainly oxygen species of hydroxyl groups and water molecules and carbon oxygen species adsorbed on the surface ol component has a strong signal for the fresh nhs sample due to the contribution of o bonding in the ferrite and cuprite lattices which is difficult to be resolver individually this component decreases in intensity in nhs aops 4th run due to the progressive release of cu and the simultaneous adsorption of hydroxyl groups on the nhs surface which agrees with the increment shown in the c 1s signal of carbon species bonded in the form of hydroxyl carbonyl groups equivalent results are obtained for nhs ads aops sample not shown the similarities of the c 1s and o 1s spectra related to the deposition of oxidized carbonaceous species and oh groups derived from the adsorption stage and the 4th consecutive reuse of the nhs might suggest a comparable catalytic behavior however it is important to remark on the very different relative surface content of cu and fe which affect the efficiency of the tcy degradation process in the case of nhs ads aops reaction sample nhs are able to preserve the high elimination efficiency with c c0 ratio very similar to that observed in nhs aops although limited by the tcy adsorption step and the consequent activation delay on the contrary in the case of nhs aops 4th run the reduced catalytic activity might be consequence of 1 the absence of the single cu oxide layer discussed in base of the cu 2p 3p sensitive depth conditions and 2 the passivation of the outermost layer mainly covered by co species and oh groups as already discussed overall we infer that the high efficiency of nhs is ascribed not only to the existence of fe and cu but also to the cu leaching in solution thus the probable mechanism of the catalytic performance of tetracycline degradation is proposed in fig 10 in parentheses is depicted the equation proposed in the introduction which refers each process the persulphate activation by cu and fe2 cations present in the catalyst surface to generate so4 process 2 and 4 also the cu in solution behaves the process 4 the redox coupling fe cu process 5 the reaction of so4 in water to promotes the oh radicals generation which are less reactive than so4 finally so4 and oh radicals react in eq 7 to degrade tcy in intermediates and co2 h2o 4 conclusions it is the first time shown that the electrochemical route can generates a catalyst nhs consisting of cuprite as a shell and non stoichiometric spinel copper ferrite this catalyst is able to reduce the concentration of tetracycline from the initial concentration 100 ppm up to 1 ppm in about 10 min reducing the total carbon content to 17 3 in 1 h with one of the lowest persulfate doses reported the presence of cu and fe atoms at the surface provided catalyst with new properties yielding great tcy degradation in one 1 h in addition the progressive release of cu atoms from cu oxide nhs shell and their dilution into the medium has its own contribution complementary studies performed with catalyst consisted of a surface composition of fe3 fe2 fe3o4 cu cu2o cu cu cu2 cuxoy and the catalyst mixture of fe and cu oxidation states fe3o4 cuxoy at the same experimental conditions shown poorer degradations yields the catalyst loss its efficiency from 3rd cycle and onwards because of the loss of cu shell with the consecutive runs and the adsorption of by products or initial tcy which hinders the catalyst active sites demonstrated by the reduction of the ol component and the increment of c 1s signal of carbon species bonded in the form of hydroxyl carbonyl groups in the xps analysis it has also been established that it is unnecessary to reach a steady state of adsorption before performing the degradation since the toc removal in this case is worse than those obtained in a single degradation step

12568,cu2o cuxfeyo4 nanohybrids nhs have been electrosynthesized by a simple and environmentally safe method to be used as catalysts for tetracycline degradation nhs shown an average diameter of 14 5 nm and exhibit high crystallinity with spherical morphology xps results demonstrate a cuprite enriched surface meanwhile the inner layer is composed by a nonstoichiometric copper spinel structure the degradation has been monitored by uv visible spectroscopy toc analysis and hplc the electrochemical characterization demonstrates the synergetic effect of fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu coupling to enhance the activation of persulfate this effect results in a greater degradation efficiency of nhs than other catalysts namely cuxoy fe3o4 and a mixture of both and cu2o it has been found that a previous adsorption stage before degradation does not improve the elimination of the pollutant and its length in time with a toc reduction of 72 6 in 2 h conversely conducting the oxidative process in a direct step resulted in a more rapid and efficient process 82 3 of reduction in 1 h through this method the catalyst reutilization resulting in a decrease of 50 in toc degradation from the third use while the tcy concentration degraded remains almost constant this reduced catalytic activity with use might be a consequence of 1 the absence of the single cu oxide layer due to the leaching of mainly cu ions but also fe ions during the degradation tests and 2 the passivation of the outermost layer mainly covered by co species and oh groups which hinders access to active catalyst sites keywords advanced oxidation process sodium persulphate catalyst degradation tetracycline emerging pollutants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tetracyclines tcs are a group of widely used antibiotics including tetracycline tcy chlorotetracycline ctc and oxytetracycline otc these compounds are used as treatment for bacterial infectious diseases in humans and animals and as alimentary supplements to improve livestock growth 1 2 tcs degradation is very challenging for human and animal metabolisms which causes the excretion through urine and feces of around 70 of the tcs administrated after their excretion tcs end up in soils and wastewater causing their contamination 2 wastewater treatment plants get rid of a small amount of the antibiotics in wastewater and another significant part is released into the medium 2 several studies have been conducted to determine the impact of tcs on the environment showing their toxicity for some aquatic species 3 4 moreover the presence of tcs in wastewater promotes the increase of antibiotic resistant genes in some microorganisms which can be a significant problem for human health when these microorganisms are present in drinking or irrigation water 2 5 7 thus it is necessary to find new efficient methods to remove tcs compounds from the soils and wastewater advanced oxidation processes aops are an excellent way to degrade and mineralize organic pollutants in wastewater due to its unique advantages including ease of operation high degradation efficiency and benign process aops are based on the in situ generation of radicals that oxidize the organic compounds causing their transformation into smaller molecules and even co2 and h2o 8 9 the most common radicals used in these processes are hydroxyl radicals oh produced through the activation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sulphate radicals so4 which can be generated by oxidants like persulfate s2o8 2 in the last years sulphate radicals drew a lot of attention because they have a higher redox potential e0 so4 so4 2 2 60 3 10 v vs nhe than the hydroxyl ones e0 oh oh 1 90 2 70 v vs nhe 10 also persulfate is more stable than hydrogen peroxide and can be transported for a longer time before being activate for the pollutants degradation 11 homogenous or heterogeneous catalysts are the most studied method for persulfate activation furthermore heterogeneous aops sometimes are combined with other sources of energy to improve antibiotics removal from wastewater such as ultrasounds electricity 12 or uv 13 16 the use of a mixture of persulfate anions and homogeneous ferrous cations in acidic media has been studied in aops 17 18 nevertheless some problems arise i the catalyst cannot easily be recovered after its use and ii the processes require very low ph 3 that has to be neutralize after process generating iron residues hence new investigations are focused on the development of heterogeneous catalysts which can be recovered and used several times 17 many researchers have focused their attention on bimetallic and trimetallic catalyst 19 20 being the formation of so4 via transition metal catalysis the main oxidizing specie 21 22 minxian et al has reported the tetracycline degradation mechanism with a catalyst obtained from fe sludge doped with cu ions they reported the benefits of the synergic redox couple cu2 cu e 0 17 v and fe3 fe2 e 0 77 v in the persulfate activation 23 the possible degradation mechanism in a bimetallic catalyst consists of fe and cu transition metal was proposed as follow fe3 react with persulfate to form fe2 and s2o8 radicals the fe2 activate persulfate ions to form active sulphate radicals eqs 1 2 the same reaction also take place with cu2 and cu species eqs 3 4 in addition the standard reduction potentials of fe and cu species creates a conductive atmosphere for the reduction of fe3 to fe2 and cu to cu2 eq 5 24 moreover oh is generated but has a minor contribution in the degradation process eq 6 finally the degradation mechanism showed that tcy could be partially or totally removed because of so4 and oh eq 7 1 fe 3 s 2 o 8 2 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 2 s 2

tcy degradation by heterogeneous aops using cu and fe as the main catalyst components are presented in table 1 in some of these works ferrites nanoparticles are supported by other materials to improve the degradation efficiency in the light of all we have mentioned the present study was focused on the one step electrochemical synthesis and characterization of nhs constituted by cu2o cuxfeyo4 nanoparticles and their application as catalysts in tcy degradation via persulphate activation moreover the proposed green methodology for the nhs synthesis can be scaled up easily as has been already demonstrated by previous research in magnetite producing about 1 g of catalyst hourly 30 the catalytic activity of the catalyst will be compared with different catalyst constituted by only iron fe3o4 only copper cu2o and a mixture of both in addition the competing relationship of the adsorption degradation processes on the final catalytic efficiency is demonstrated finally the catalyst reusability is also proposed 2 experimental part 2 1 catalysts synthesis the synthesis of cu2o cuxfeyo4 nanohybrids nhs was performed following a similar protocol published by our group for the electrosynthesis of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles 31 briefly two foils of iron and copper of 2 cm2 each were used as anode electrodes and a cylindrical cathode of iron was placed around those electrodes whose area was 120 cm2 the use of a larger cathode surface placed around anode electrodes ensure a homogeneous current distribution current densities of 50 ma cm2 were applied to iron and copper foils to promote the oxidation and release of copper and iron cations through the solution at the same time in the cathode the water reduction takes place and generates hydroxyl species which produces a basic ph in the solution at this ph the generation of copper and iron oxides is favoured 0 04 m of nacl aqueous solution was used as a supporting electrolyte the synthesis temperature was controlled by a thermostat bath at 25 c the solution was magnetically stirred at 1100 rpm during 30 min of reaction a scheme of the reactor is provided in fig 1 in the first stages of the electrochemical synthesis the solution turns black remaining unchanged until the end of the reaction period afterward the nhs were separated from the electrolyte solution with a magnet and washed three times with distilled water following the sequence sonication for 5 min and magnetic decantation until the supernatant was clear the washed nhs were dried under vacuum at room temperature to compare the degradation efficiency of the nanohybrids magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized following the electrochemical method in a mixture of 20 80 methanol water previously reported by our group 32 in this case only a foil of iron acts as the anode while the cathode is parallel to the anode electrode with this methodology we were able to synthesize magnetite nanoparticles nps with similar size to those of nhs at the same time the electrochemical methodology was used to synthetized copper oxide catalyst cuxoy following the same protocol described for nhs synthesis but using a single copper electrode as anode 2 2 catalyst characterization the morphology of the nhs were evaluated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem using a tecnai f30 fei electron microscope operated at 300 kv also a jeol 2000 fxii tem electron microscope operating at 120 kev was used to routinary visualize the morphology of the catalysts and obtain the size distribution the leaching of copper and iron in the reusability runs from the catalysts and the metal content in the fresh and four times used nhs were determined with a plasma emission spectrometer icp oes perkin elmer mod optima 2100 dv catalyst phase identification

with cu kα1 radiation panalytical x pert highscore software 33 was used for data analyses and full proof suit package 34 was used to quantify the percentage of the catalyst crystalline phases x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps has been used to characterize the elemental composition and the oxidation states of cu and fe on the surface of the nhs samples xps experiments were performed using an x ray source of al kα 1486 6 ev 35 the spectra were analyzed with the casaxps program casa software ltd cheshire uk using a shirley method for background subtraction and data processing for quantitative xps analysis spectra are displayed after subtracting the contribution of the al kα satellite emission in some cases the spectra were normalized to the maximum intensity to highlight line shape differences which provides direct valuable insight regarding the oxidation states 2 3 electrochemical tests the electrochemical characterization of the active species on the nhs surface was performed in a conventional electrochemical cell glassy carbon electrodes gc of area 0 196 cm2were used as working electrodes the electrode was pre cleaned through polishing with alumina powder 0 3 and 0 05 μm consecutively and then washed with milli q water to modify the electrode surfaces a catalytic inks were prepared dispersing 1 mg of the catalyst and 4 mg of carbon vulcan xc 72r in 5 ml of isopropanol water 1 4 v v and 20 μl of nafion under sonication for 30 min the electrodes were modified by spin coating dropping 20 μl of the catalytic ink on the gc surface the electrochemical analyses were performed using an autolab 302 n potentiostat and a pine rotation rate control unit graphite rod and ag agcl electrode were used as counter and reference electrode respectively the potential values have been referred to reversible hydrogen electrode rhe using the relation e rhe e ag agcl 0 199 0 059 ph electrochemical characterization was performed by cyclic voltammetry at ph 6 in n2 saturated solutions the electrocatalytic tests were performed with a rotating electrode at 1600 rpm at ph 6 in n2 saturated solutions and in presence of 0 5 mm of sodium persulphate sps 2 4 adsorption and advanced oxidation process aops adsorption process the adsorption evaluation process was performed for 2 h under mechanical agitation 680 rpm in a thermostatic bath at 25 c in a typical experiment 1 0 g l of nhs was dispersed in a tcy aqueous solution 25 ml at ph 6 of 100 ppm two conventional kinetic models pseudo first order q t q e 1 e k 1 t and pseudo second order q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q t k 2 t were applied to investigate the adsorption kinetic further advance oxidation process one step protocol the experimental conditions were the same as described for adsorption process but for this experiment 0 5 mm of sps was added to the tcy solution before adding the catalyst the performance of the different catalyst on the degradation reaction of tcy were studied with this protocol the reusability of the nhs was evaluated by performing four cycling runs after the completion of the reaction the separated nhs were washed with distilled water and dried for the subsequent cycle test advance oxidation process two steps protocol a mixture of the two previous protocols were conducted at the same adsorption conditions the catalyst was in contact with the pollutant for 1 h to ensure a steady state equilibrium afterward 0 5 mm of sps was added into the above mixing solution and immediately the degradation begins and last 1 h pollutant elimination quantification at the given time sample aliquots 1 0 ml were withdrawn from the test and centrifuged for 2 min at 12 000 rpm those samples were analyzed by monitoring the absorbance at λmax 357 nm in uv vis spectra with a perkin elmer uv vis lambda 365 spectrophotometer the quantification of the total organic content toc left in solution with time last 1 h was analyzed with a toc 5000a model shimadzu analyzer considering the average of at least three measurements with an accuracy of 5 the evolution of tetracycline concentration was also analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc msms evoq elite using an ace excel 2 column 100 mm length 3 mm diameter as stationary phase analyses were performed using a mixture of h2omq 0 5 formic acid and methanol 0 05 formic acid as mobile phase with a proportion 98 2 v v 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanohybrids characterization tem image of nhs shown in fig 2a presents nanoparticles with quasi spherical morphology with a mean diameter of 14 5 nm the synthetized nhs presents high crystallinity reflected in the clearly visible crystallographic planes observed in the high resolution tem image fig 2b the metal analysis obtained by icp in the nhs reveals an important amount of copper with a total fe cu molar ratio of 2 66 xrd pattern of fresh nhs sample depicted in fig 3 presents broad reflexions correlated with particles in the nanosized regimen the analysis of the obtained pattern reveals two structures attributed to cubic spinel mfe2o4 with m cu fe and cuprite cu2o structures with space group fd 3m 227 and pn 3m 224 respectively the lattice parameter analysis of the cubic spinel is 8 383 1 å this value is in the range of other cooper ferrites 8 424 8 3715 å synthesized by coprecipitation method followed by calcination at different temperatures 36 37 and higher than the lattice parameters reported for electrosynthetized iron ferrite nanoparticles described in bibliography with similar particle sizes 8 370 8 374 å 32 which is associated to the bigger cu2 atomic radius when compared to fe2 one it is worth to mention that in nanosized regime maghemite ϒ fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 copper ferrite cufe2o4 and copper doped iron oxide have cubic spinel structures at room temperature 36 38 with similar lattice parameters which makes it difficult to ensure the nhs composition seeking to clarify this point detailed xps analysis is further performed in the fresh nhs to get some insight on the iron and copper oxidation states the overall atomic concentration at surface composition of the nhs sample was summarized in table s1 the cu fe ratio obtained for the 3p and 2p levels reports values corresponding to a higher cu content than that calculated from the icp analysis which determines the composition of the whole nhs molar ratio in addition the cu fe ratio for the 2p level also provides a significantly higher and very distinct value than that obtained for the 3p state 2p peaks provide surface sensitivity since their emission comes mostly from the outermost layers of the nhs on the contrary low binding energy signals from 3p levels with higher kinetic energy are emitted from deeper regions which significantly enhances the contribution from the nhs as a whole with minor influence from the outer surface layers these results indicate the enrichment of copper atoms on the surface of the nhs a detailed line shape analysis of xps spectra is required to obtain information on the oxidation state of copper fig 3b compares the normalized cu 2p3 2 spectra corresponding to nhs with the representative signal from commercial cu2o the first thing to be noticed in the commercial reference sample is the absence of satellite emission at binding energy in the range from 940 to 945 cu 2p3 2 and 960 to 965 ev cu 2p1 2 respectively whose are known to be characteristic of the cuo phase 39 40 in contrast there is a relative shift towards lower binding energy of ca 1 3 ev in the peak position of the cu2o commercial sample with respect to nhs one this peak appears at the binding energy position of the shoulder seen on the right side of the cu 2p3 2 emission for the nhs sample and can be inferred to cu1 oxidation state peak fitting of the cu 2p3 2 spectra fig 3c was done by using the deconvolution of the component obtained from the fit of the cu2o reference 39 40 and several mixed gaussian lorentzian symmetric functions for cu2 oxidation state and satellites components using as parameters the binding energy shifts reported in 39 the first result is that copper is fully oxidized mostly as cuo but xps also allows distinguishing some contribution from cu2o and cu oh 2 let us turn our attention to the fe region fig s1 the described analysis see discussion in si suggests that fe3 mostly forms the fe oxide signal in the nhs samples even though the presence of fe2 species cannot be discarded in good agreement with the formation of cu doped iron ferrite nanoparticles based on these results the rietveld analysis of the fresh nhs present a core with an 88 3 of cu0 34fe2 66o4 where a partial substitution of the fe2 sites by cu2 takes place and the outer layers of the catalysts with 11 7 of cu2o which perfectly agrees with the fe cu molar ratio obtained by icp 3 2 catalytic evaluation 3 2 1 the degradation performance of tcy before the aops experiment of tetracycline the adsorption of the as prepared nhs to the target compound was conducted the tcy is an amphoteric molecule symbolized as tcyh2 with multiple ionizable functional groups at different phs tcyh3 is the predominant specie at ph 3 3 tcyh2 specie is predominant in the range 3 3 ph 7 7 while anionic tcyh is predominant specie for phs at 7 7 ph 9 7 and finally tcy2 is stable at ph 9 7 41 42 two conventional kinetic models pseudo first order and pseudo second order were applied to investigate the adsorption kinetic further the kinetics parameters obtained from the two models are listed in table s2 and the fitting graph is depicted in fig s2 the r2 value 0 96 of the fit according to the pseudo second order rate model was higher than the obtained from the pseudo first order rate model r2 0 921 in addition the values of qe cal derived from the pseudo second order rate model fit was closer to the qe exp values accordingly the pseudo second order kinetic model better represents the adsorption of tcy onto nhs 43 the adsorption removal efficiency obtained following the decrease in the maximum on the visible spectrum fig 4a is about 60 with a qe cal value of 66 mg g in agreement with the 59 removal after 1 h determined by toc and with the 43 7 ppm of antibiotic left in the supernatant measured by hplc for the same experiment fig 4a and b the nhs point of zero charge pzc is around ph 7 fig s3 so the surface of the catalyst was negatively charged at working ph and the dominant tcy species is tcyh2 hence the poor electrostatic repulsion experienced at this ph results in the high adsorption capacity observed in addition the interaction of cu2 with oxygen atoms of tcy molecules enhance the adsorption efficiency of the pollutant 44 in another experiment the pollutant and the catalyst were mixed up to reach the adsorption equilibrium afterwards the aops started with adding 0 5 mm of sps and lasted 1 h fig 4a and b first is worthy to mention that without catalysts only sps cannot degrade tetracycline although persulphate anion s2o8 2 has a high oxidation potential e0 2 01 ev its kinetically slow in reacting with many organic compounds 45 however when the catalyst is involved in the reaction a very fast catalytic degradation of tcy is observed in the early instants of the reaction caused by the chemical activation of the persulfate anion to generate the intermediate sulfate free radical oxidant so4 e0 2 6 v 46 we have also compared the degradation efficiency obtained with no previous adsorption stage against the experiment conducted in separate stages first adsorption and later degradation the toc removal and tcy left in solution of those experiments are represented in fig 4b targeted pollutant left in solution after only degradation and adsorption degradation processes is very similar with values of 1 95 and 1 0 ppm respectively a good elimination performance of tcy is important but even more crucial is the mineralization percentage measured by toc since it measures not only the amount of degraded tcy but also the by products of the oxidation reaction in this sense the toc mineralization efficiency is slightly lower in the two steps protocol 72 6 than in the direct degradation reaction 82 3 this variation in the toc obtained can be explained with the high adsorption capacity of cu2 to bind with the tcy which limits the further degradation process by hiding the catalyst s active sites in the two steps experiment similar results were observed for the degradation of tcy with a porous fe3o4 catalyst embedded in chitosan as the pollutant concentration increased 26 and with cuo particles encapsulated in a carbon framework 28 in other words the adsorption process is kinetically uncompetitive with the degradation process since once the one step oxidation starts the decolorization degradation happens within the first minutes lowering the c co of the pollutant ratio from 1 to nearly 0 2 representing an 80 decrease in the targeted pollutant content within the first few minutes furthermore in the two step method the larger experiment time could compromise the reusability of the catalyst in further cycles by the possible leaching of fe and cu cations we can conclude that the one step protocol is time saving and conducted to greater degradation doses 3 2 2 electrochemical catalytic evaluation of nhs vs fe3o4 as we have already explained the nhs composition is 88 3 of cu doped ferrite and 11 7 of cuprite to assess the role of the fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu on the nhs composition and for comparison purposes we have performed the aops with fe3o4 and nhs under the same experimental conditions the decolourisation test and the toc removal shown a great difference between those reaching with the nhs a complete decolourisation in the first 10 min while the fe3o4 remain around 0 8 throughout the course of the experiment fig 5 besides the toc removal values were 82 and 8 for nhs and fe3o4 respectively to characterize the superficial active sites contribution in the activation of sps in the degradation test an electrochemical characterization was performed by cyclic voltammetry with the nhs and fe3o4 nanoparticles scan rate 5 m v s at ph 6 in n2 saturated solutions fig 6a shows the voltammograms recorded for both catalysts as can be observed the fe3o4 nanoparticles show an irreversible faradaic process ea 0 42 v ec 0 24 v vs rhe which corresponds to the fe3 fe2 redox process of the superficial iron of the nanoparticles 47 however the voltammogram for the nhs presents an extra reversible process at more positive values ea 0 65 v ec 0 58 v vs rhe which is associated to the cu2 cu redox process of the copper atoms present in the nhs in addition the cathodic peak of the fe3 fe2 process is shifted to more positive values compared with the magnetite nanoparticles ec 0 38 v vs rhe this displacement could be associated by the presence of cooper in the nhs structure which can induce an electron withdrawing effect on the iron atoms and consequently shift the reduction process to more positive values to elucidate whether the iron or copper in the structure is responsible for the sps activation electrocatalytic tests were performed by rotating disc electrode rde 1600 rpm in the presence of 0 5 mm of sps at ph 6 the solution was previously de oxygenated with n2 to avoid the presence of o2 in the solution and hinder the oxygen reduction reaction via 2e with the consequent generation of h2o2 which could interfere in the electrocatalytic reduction of sps fig 6b shows the polarization curves recorded the electrocatalytic activity was evaluated considering the onset potential of the sps reduction potential when the sps reduction takes place the electroreduction of sps for both catalysts presents different onset potentials at 0 57 v and 0 30 v vs rhe for the nhs and fe3o4 nps respectively this fact informs the higher electrocatalytic activity of the nhs than the fe3o4 due to the lower overpotential needed to start the electroreduction additionally the onset potential of the electroreduction of sps is related to the redox processes fe3 fe2 or cu2 cu determined by cyclic voltammetry for fe3o4 and nhs respectively that is the electroreduction of sps starts with the presence of cu of the nhs or the presence of fe2 in the fe3o4 nanoparticles in which both sites are electrogenerated during the cathodic polarization 48 3 2 3 catalytic performance of nhs compared to other catalysts to further understand the catalytic abilities of the nhs proposed and the role of the cu2 cu and fe3 fe2 redox couples we have also assessed the catalysis efficiency of a commercial cuprite compound where only cu is present in the sample these tests have been performed for three distinct cuprite concentrations i e 0 3 1 0 g l and 0 117 g l the final concentration found in the nhs sample the toc degradation percentages are shown in fig 7a with increasing the catalyst concentration an increment in toc degradation has been observed achieving 18 36 and 64 of mineralization with the dose increase all these values are lower than that obtained by using the nhs catalyst 1 0 g l otherwise the carbon degradation observed using the same dose 0 117 g l of cuprite that the nhs is supposed to have is about 18 far from the value obtained for the nanohybrid 82 also with the maximum dose of cuprite catalyst 1 0 g l the tcy removal is lower this implies that not only the cu ion is involved in the degradation process but also the contribution of cu2 fe2 and fe3 cations are of key importance to provide a more realistic comparison of the tcy degradation obtained with the nhs we followed a similar experimental method described for the nhs synthesis but a single copper foil was oxidized in the electrolyte solution the cuxoy catalyst obtained were composed of quasi spherical particle aggregates and rod shape morphology as shown in fig s4 the rietveld analysis of the xrd pattern shows four well differentiated phases of cu2o cuo and cu oh 2 as well as cu in a residual proportion which were not able to be separated in the washing processes fig s5 therefore the sample we refer to as cuxoy is composed of both cu2 and cu the catalytic activity of cuxoy 1 0 g l and nhs 1 0 g l catalyst was compared with the one obtained with a mixture of cuxoy and spinel iron oxide powders in the same nhs proportion provided by rietveld analysis 11 7 88 3 in order to have cu2 cu and fe3 fe2 contributions fig 7b c even if the concentration of tcy left in the solution following the degradation is comparable for both nhs and the mixed sample catalysts the total organic removal is notably greater for the former catalyst this demonstrates that there might be a synergistic effect in the hybrid by the presence of copper ferrite thereby enhancing the relative rates of mass transfer to reactive sites and chemical reaction on these 3 2 4 the stability and application in various runs the catalyst recycling performance is of importance in real world application hence the catalyst was recovered to perform several runs further to investigate the catalytic stability of the nhs in aops fig 8a depicts the uv visible color removal of nhs in the four runs explored a greater decrease in the c co ratio is observed mainly from the third cycle and onwards the hplc analysis of tcy removal is shown in fig 8b the concentration of degraded tcy was 98 1 96 6 95 1 and 90 9 ppm in the four sequential runs in the toc analysis we found the most significant differences between cycles the mineralization percentage was 82 72 40 and 15 for each of the four cycles as shown in fig 8b the reusability test showed an improved capacity of the catalyst to be reused in comparison with the cu cufe2o4 catalyst proposed by 27 where at ph 7 in the second run the efficiency was drastically reduced mainly due to the higher cu leaching during the first run at this ph 100 mg l however in the case of cuo particles encapsulated in a polyhedral carbon framework the degradation rate diminished between the third and fifth runs possibly caused by the adsorption of by products on the catalyst active sites or by the leaching of copper 28 it is evident that after the oxidation process some catalyst leaching might appear by the consumption of sps in the solution after each cycle according to the mineralization reduction to further explore this hypothesis the metal ion leaching after each cycle was also explored fig 8c the copper leaching from the nanohybrid structure has been more pronounced than iron loss this evidence might result by the fact that the cuprite phase is non magnetic and therefore can stabilize eventually in aqueous media owing to their nanosized regimen making it impossible to collect them by centrifugation such particles may have subsequently been degraded in the acid digestion for icp analysis hence the measured concentration is not exclusively of cu ions in the solution and the cu content might be overestimated the weight content of cu present in the nhs structure measured by icp and referred to the total weight of the sample treated is initially 17 8 followed by the values of 14 2 10 6 7 8 and 3 8 after successive degradation cycles it seems evident that the substantial decrease in cu concentration occurred throughout several runs compromised the catalyst reusability 3 3 xps characterization of the nhs after the degradation tests after the degradation test the surface composition of the nhs samples was characterized by xps analysis and compared with the as synthetized nhs the atomic concentration at after the aops ads aops and the aops 4th run are summarized in table 2 as can be observed the 3p and 2p intensity ratios are different in the as synthetized nhs and after the 1 step aops and ads aops tests indicating that the enrichment of copper on the outer layer of the nhs remains during the first degradation tests however it is also worth mentioning that the analysis of the 3p and 2p core levels for the nhs aops 4th run sample provide the same value for both cu fe ratios so that relative total content of copper and iron is kept constant then at this stage 4th run the nhs can be considered as a uniform system according to xps depth sensitivity in the absence of cu2o shell cu2 is present in the ferrite lattice in agreement with the xrd results for the spinel structure fig s6 where a unique phase of fd 3m 227 spatial group is observed as previously mentioned xps is particularly sensitive to the species present on the surface of the nhs which is actually where the reaction takes place and can be an ideal technique to investigate the deactivation of the catalyst in the course of the reaction the relative change in c o and n content during the aops informs about the degradation mechanism the n signal could be considered as a fingerprint of tcy degradation and adsorption on the surface of the nhs and clearly appears upon the first step of aops and reaches its maximum intensity after the adsorption aops tests the n signal is reduced due to the partial coverage of the nhs surface with high amount of oh groups which produces a certain passivation effect the last reaction step 4th also shows a reduced n signal which explains the loss of catalytic activity of the nhs after the degradation results table 2 at this point further analysis of the corresponding c 1s and o 1s spectra are needed to study the progress of the reaction fig 9 show the deconvolution analysis of the c 1s and o 1s spectra for the fresh nhs nhs aops and nhs aops 4th run samples c 1s and o 1s fitting results are summarized in table s3 c 1s has been decomposed into several components ascribed to the different chemical environment as cc coh co co and oco ordered from low to high binding energy values respectively in accordance with their respective energy shift values reported 49 analogously o 1s has been fitted with three peaks attributed to lattice oxygen ol bound to the metal cation in the catalyst cu fe oxides adsorbed surface oxygen including mainly oxygen species of hydroxyl groups and water molecules and carbon oxygen species adsorbed on the surface ol component has a strong signal for the fresh nhs sample due to the contribution of o bonding in the ferrite and cuprite lattices which is difficult to be resolver individually this component decreases in intensity in nhs aops 4th run due to the progressive release of cu and the simultaneous adsorption of hydroxyl groups on the nhs surface which agrees with the increment shown in the c 1s signal of carbon species bonded in the form of hydroxyl carbonyl groups equivalent results are obtained for nhs ads aops sample not shown the similarities of the c 1s and o 1s spectra related to the deposition of oxidized carbonaceous species and oh groups derived from the adsorption stage and the 4th consecutive reuse of the nhs might suggest a comparable catalytic behavior however it is important to remark on the very different relative surface content of cu and fe which affect the efficiency of the tcy degradation process in the case of nhs ads aops reaction sample nhs are able to preserve the high elimination efficiency with c c0 ratio very similar to that observed in nhs aops although limited by the tcy adsorption step and the consequent activation delay on the contrary in the case of nhs aops 4th run the reduced catalytic activity might be consequence of 1 the absence of the single cu oxide layer discussed in base of the cu 2p 3p sensitive depth conditions and 2 the passivation of the outermost layer mainly covered by co species and oh groups as already discussed overall we infer that the high efficiency of nhs is ascribed not only to the existence of fe and cu but also to the cu leaching in solution thus the probable mechanism of the catalytic performance of tetracycline degradation is proposed in fig 10 in parentheses is depicted the equation proposed in the introduction which refers each process the persulphate activation by cu and fe2 cations present in the catalyst surface to generate so4 process 2 and 4 also the cu in solution behaves the process 4 the redox coupling fe cu process 5 the reaction of so4 in water to promotes the oh radicals generation which are less reactive than so4 finally so4 and oh radicals react in eq 7 to degrade tcy in intermediates and co2 h2o 4 conclusions it is the first time shown that the electrochemical route can generates a catalyst nhs consisting of cuprite as a shell and non stoichiometric spinel copper ferrite this catalyst is able to reduce the concentration of tetracycline from the initial concentration 100 ppm up to 1 ppm in about 10 min reducing the total carbon content to 17 3 in 1 h with one of the lowest persulfate doses reported the presence of cu and fe atoms at the surface provided catalyst with new properties yielding great tcy degradation in one 1 h in addition the progressive release of cu atoms from cu oxide nhs shell and their dilution into the medium has its own contribution complementary studies performed with catalyst consisted of a surface composition of fe3 fe2 fe3o4 cu cu2o cu cu cu2 cuxoy and the catalyst mixture of fe and cu oxidation states fe3o4 cuxoy at the same experimental conditions shown poorer degradations yields the catalyst loss its efficiency from 3rd cycle and onwards because of the loss of cu shell with the consecutive runs and the adsorption of by products or initial tcy which hinders the catalyst active sites demonstrated by the reduction of the ol component and the increment of c 1s signal of carbon species bonded in the form of hydroxyl carbonyl groups in the xps analysis it has also been established that it is unnecessary to reach a steady state of adsorption before performing the degradation since the toc removal in this case is worse than those obtained in a single degradation step

12569,phosphorus p recovery from wastewater is meaningful in wastewater treatment and resource recycling natural extracellular polymeric substances eps of microbes show impressive p uptake ability however natural eps is difficult to assist in p recovery due to the high harvesting cost in extraction thus eps like hydrogels constructed by sodium alginate sa fe iii and humic acids ha were designed the results showed that the optimal formation conditions of eps like hydrogel were 0 1 m fe iii and m ha m sa 1 fe iii ions were the key crosslinkers in constructing the 3 dimensional sodium alginate sa fe iii hydrogels and in the embedding of humic acid ha for ha sa fe iii hydrogels ha sa fe iii hydrogels showed bigger pore sizes lesser fe leaching and higher phosphate selectivity in so4 2 compared to sa fe iii hydrogels the highest p adsorption amounts were 56 and 134 33 mg p g for the ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii respectively the adsorption isotherm results exhibited that when the initial p concentration was in a range of 0 35 mg l the adsorption mainly existed on the surface of the adsorbent while in the pore filling stage i e the initial p concentration was higher than 35 mg l internal diffusion controlled the adsorption process based on the kinetics the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis detected an appearance of fe o p and o p bonds and a disappearance of chloride ions in the hydrogels after adsorption which confirmed the major driving forces on adsorption ligand exchange and ion exchange moreover ha sa fe iii hydrogel saturated by p adsorption passed a test as sustainable release p fertilizers overall the eps like hydrogels developed here provide new absorbents for p recovery graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations ha humic acid sa

alginate linking to humic acid with fe iii keywords sodium alginate humic acid eps like hydrogels phosphorus adsorption data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as an essential element constituting organisms phosphorus p is irreplaceable to human health and development 1 2 however the widespread usage of p with low efficiency in agriculture and industry has led excessive p to enter the environment through wastewater discharge causing severe environmental pollution 3 for example p enrichment in water bodies can cause eutrophication with severe algal blooms and the deterioration of ecosystems 4 more importantly as a non renewable and irreplaceable resource mineral p will be scarce or even depleted in the next 50 100 years 2 5 therefore p recovery is significant for resource recycling and environmental protection various techniques have been developed for p removals such as adsorption chemical precipitation membrane filtration and biological methods 6 7 among these techniques adsorption is superior for its high efficiency advantages low cost and less secondary pollution 8 the adsorbent is decisive for adsorption performance 9 12 microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps displayed great potential in p uptake and storage 13 15 which could be an ideal adsorbent for p recovery however natural eps are challenging to be extracted and remain stable limiting to be applied industrially for p recovery the structure and elemental composition of eps have been analyzed which is a kind of hydrogel mainly composed of proteins humic substances and polysaccharides 16 therefore eps based bionic hydrogels may remove p efficiently similar to microbial eps thus it is meaningful to develop eps like hydrogels for industrial applications sodium alginate sa is a natural polysaccharide with considerable carboxyl and hydroxyl groups which can easily crosslink with multivalent metal ions 17 such as iron iii 18 calcium ii 19 and aluminum iii 20 to form three dimensional network hydrogels due to their non toxicity and biodegradable characteristics sa based hydrogels have been widely studied for p removal and recovery 21 26 in rivers and lakes fe bound p fe p is a common p form 27 indicating a strong affinity of fe for p for example sa fe iii hydrogels have impressive p adsorption capacities 18 considering the high p affinity sa fe iii based hydrogel is proposed however the application of sa fe iii hydrogels is still limited because of the low selectivity for p under the presence of other anions such as hco3 28 and so4 2 21 sa fe iii hydrogels were also sensitive to external ph affecting adsorption capacity and chemical stability 29 30 more importantly the underlying mechanisms of p adsorption remain to be elucidated humic acid ha an essential constituent of microbial eps 31 is derived from the biodegradation of organisms like plants and animals 32 various active functional groups exist in ha such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amine groups 33 these functional groups could provide numerous p adsorption sites by combining metal ions and forming ha metal p complexes 34 37 besides introducing ha in sa fe iii hydrogels could enhance the hydrogel s chemical stability and reduce the crosslinking ions leaching 38 39 although the ha fe iii p binding model has been proposed 40 the knowledge of how ha connects with sa and fe iii and the involved process of p adsorption of ha sa fe iii hydrogels are still limited besides ha metal p complexes can potentially be sustainable release p fertilizers 32 33 thus ha sa fe iii hydrogels could be used as sustainable release p fertilizers providing an effective strategy for p reuse although very few studies have explicitly tested the hypothesis this study aims to construct eps like hydrogels by crosslinking sa fe iii matrix with or without ha to remove and reuse p for this purpose the following key objectives were designed i to explore the formation mechanisms of hydrogels and the p adsorption process ii to optimize the preparation of eps like hydrogels by varying the amount of ha and the concentration of fe iii iii to assess the p adsorption performance of the eps like hydrogels under a series of ph values initial p concentrations coexisting anions and contact time and iv to examine the p release properties of the eps like hydrogels by hydrostatic sustained release experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o sodium bicarbonate nahco3 anhydrous sodium sulfate na2so4 sodium

tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china a phosphate stock solution was prepared by dissolving dipotassium hydrogen phosphate k2hpo4 in distilled water all reagents are of analytical grade 2 2 fabrication of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels were synthesized by a one step titration gel crosslink method precisely a certain amount of sa was weighed and dissolved in distilled water and a transparent and homogeneous sa 2 wt solution was obtained 18 a series of ha to sa ratios 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 w w were designed the suspension was stirred by a magnetic stirrer until completely dissolved after that the mixture 30 ml was added to ferric chloride solution 100 ml drop by drop for hydrogel formation to explore the effect of fe iii concentration on hydrogel properties a series of fe iii concentrations 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 m was designed the obtained hydrogels were left in the ferric chloride solution for 12 h of aging lastly the hydrogel capsules were washed 4 5 times with distilled water to remove fe iii residues before use 2 3 adsorption experiments all experiments were carried out with hydrogel capsules in a 50 ml tube containing 10 ml phosphate solutions 75 mg p l which were put on a shaking table 80 rpm for 24 h after drying at 100 c the average weight of the sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii was 0 004 g and 0 012 g respectively the effects of ha content and crosslinking fe iii ion concentration on the adsorption capacity of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels were studied the effect of the solution ph on phosphate removal and fe leakage from sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels were measured and analyzed at different initial ph ranging from 2 to 11 with an interval of 1 phosphate adsorption isotherms of hydrogels were obtained under various initial phosphate concentrations 0 100 mg p l phosphate adsorption kinetics were analyzed at different reaction time from 0 to 24 h moreover the effects of coexisting anions i e no3 cl hco3 so4 2 on phosphate removal were evaluated at three concentrations 0 6 1 2 and 2 4 mm the experiment was conducted at room temperature 25 c and the temperature would not affect the results the p adsorption capacity at equilibrium state qe and removal rate r was computed by eqs 1 and 2 1 q e c e c i v m 2 r c e c i c i where ci mg l and ce mg l denote the initial

with a significance level at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the eps like hydrogels two kinds of eps like hydrogels sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii were prepared and both hydrogels formed 3 dimensional net like structures with numerous pores fig 1 pore size analysis demonstrated the pore size in ha sa fe iii hydrogel was much bigger than that in the sa fe iii hydrogel table s1 it could be attributed to the strong affinity of ha for fe iii ions 41 which complexed a portion of the fe iii ions crosslinked with alginate resulting in a rough surface this was also confirmed by the presence of feo oh peak in the xrd spectrum of ha sa fe iii hydrogels fig 1c specifically no apparent diffraction peaks were presented in the xrd spectrum of the sa fe iii hydrogel fe iii ions connected to the carboxyl group of the alginate molecules led to the disappearance of the three characteristic peaks of sa 42 43 however the addition of ha significantly altered the shape of hydrogel peaks with the appearance of a strong diffraction peak corresponding to feo oh 2θ 26 725 additionally the porosity increased with the addition of ha 61 66 for sa fe iii and 69 12 for ha sa fe iii it suggested that adding ha reduced the crosslinking between sa and fe iii it is known that fe iii is the crosslinking ion 17 therefore it can be inferred that fe iii ions complexed with ha become more prominent active sites instead of being involved in crosslinking based on divalent cation bridging dcb theory divalent cations bridge negatively charged functional groups within eps which helps to aggregate and stabilize biopolymers and microbial matrices 44 therefore the fe iii ions which played a crosslinking role in ha sa fe iii would connect alginate long chains and ha 45 forming stable hydrogels in the ftir spectra the peak intensities of oh 3193 cm 1 cooh 1600 cm 1 and co 1018 cm 1 43 46 47 displayed a significant decrease for ha sa fe iii compared to sa fe iii details in section fig s4 indicating that the introduction of ha enriched the functional groups in hydrogels which affect the peak intensity besides the internal structure of ha sa fe iii hydrogels is exhibited a heterogeneous three dimensional network with marked junctions this revealed that ha was also inserted into the 3 dimensional hydrogel because ha contained abundant active groups of carboxyl hydroxyl and amine which can connect with alginate through hydrogen bonds and fe metal bridges 48 49 however the size of ha molecules was not uniform which could link to alginate in various ways both might lead to heterogeneous porous structures in a previous study the long chain of sa formed a dense homogeneous and compact microporous meshwork structure by cooh and oh groups 50 as for the mixed droplets of ha and sa the crosslinking decreased because the carboxyl groups of ha combined with fe iii ions which were no longer involved in crosslinking reactions the fe iii ions complexed by ha became more prominent against phosphate due to the absence of alginate encapsulation when the drops were crosslinked with fe iii the ha macromolecules were further connected with the alginate chain through metal bridges and hydrogen bonds forming a loose and macro porous mesh structure with nodules the formation mechanisms of sa fe iii hydrogels and ha sa fe iii were summarized in fig s2 50 and fig 1 respectively 3 2 the optimization of eps like hydrogels for phosphate adsorption fig s3a illustrates that phosphate adsorption capacity and removal rate decreased as the m ha m sa ratio rose from 0 to 0 4 this was probably due to ha s extreme affinity with metal ions 51 ha occupied the active iron sites that could otherwise be used for phosphate adsorption however as the ratio further increased to 1 the adsorption capacity and removal efficiencies rose and the removal rate increased significantly this might be attributed to more fe iii ions being linked with the increasing ha content becoming a more prominent active site against phosphate 51 as a result introducing iron active sites could compensate for the loss of the phosphate adsorption sites in ha sa fe iii hydrogels as can be seen from the sem images of ha sa fe iii hydrogels fig 1b and pore parameters table s1 ha enlarged the pore size and facilitated phosphate diffusion therefore the phosphate removal rate kept increasing and achieved a maximum ratio of 8 although the removal rate was increasing the dry weight of per ha sa fe iii hydrogel became excessive due to adding humic acid resulting in decreased adsorption capacity thus after careful consideration the ratio of 1 was chosen to prepare ha sa fe iii hydrogel microspheres in subsequent experiments the optimized parameters are listed in table 1 ferric ions participated in the formation of hydrogels 16 and substantially influenced phosphate sorption efficacy ha sa fe iii microspheres were difficult to gel at 0 01 m ferric concentration therefore no relevant data are available fig s3b shows the effect of fe iii ion concentration on the adsorption properties of hydrogels sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii microspheres captured more phosphate at higher fe iii ion concentrations 0 01 0 1 m and the maximal values arrived at 0 1 m unexpectedly a further increase in fe iii ion concentration led to a decrease in adsorption capacity the fe element content in both ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels upgraded with the increasing fe iii ion concentration fig s3b while the microsphere size did not change fig s3c the carboxylate groups of sa could form complexes with fe iii ions and link the polysaccharide to hydrogels 17 excessive crosslinking of fe iii within hydrogel at higher fe iii ion concentrations 52 inhibited the internal mass transfer of phosphate which caused a decreasing sorption capacity fig s3b moreover feo oh crystals were detected in the xrd spectra of ha sa fe iii fig 1c under high iron concentrations a large number of iron hydroxide precipitates within the hydrogels and plugged the pores inside which might also be a reason for the hindrance of phosphate mass transfer within the ha sa fe iii hydrogels the efficiency of fe in capturing phosphate i e adsorbed phosphate per fe also was calculated fig s3b the crosslinking fe iii ion concentration was negatively correlated with fe efficiency however the hydrogels appeared with weak gelation and poor mechanical strength at low fe iii ion concentration 0 01 m besides similar fe utilization efficiencies were observed at 0 05 m and 0 1 m fe iii concentrations therefore 0 1 m fe iii is suitable for an economical and effective practice moreover the results showed that the fe utilization efficiency of ha sa fe iii was significantly lower than that of sa fe iii indicating that the addition of ha might change the physicochemical properties of hydrogels such as the formation mechanism fig 1 3 3 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics were conducted to gain insights into the adsorption mechanisms of hydrogels three kinetics models the pseudo first order model 53 the pseudo second order model 54 the elovich model 55 and the intra particle diffusion model 56 were used to fit the kinetics data table 2 shows the expressions relevant parameters and correlation coefficients r2 of the kinetics models the r2 values of the pseudo second order model were slightly higher than those of the pseudo first order model it demonstrated that the adsorption of ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii would be mainly driven by chemisorption 57 moreover the elovich model which supposes that the active sites are heterogeneous 58 fits the experimental data very well r2 0 998 for the entire adsorption process it exhibited that the chemisorption of phosphate would take place on a heterogeneous surface the adsorption mechanisms will be further explained in the following characterization results three stages were involved in the phosphate adsorption from solution to hydrogel fig 2b and characterized by pore filling adsorption detailed explanation in section 3 4 in the first stage with the fastest mass transfer rate phosphate continuously diffused to the boundary layer after that phosphate is diffused via a concentration gradient into the pores of hydrogels as there were plenty of sorption sites on the surface and within the pores the diffusion and adsorption efficiency of hydrogels was high at this stage in the second stage with the lower internal mass transfer diffusion rate the internal mass transfer diffusion slowed down as the concentration gradient in the solution decreased in the third stage the adsorption reached equilibrium because of the gradual reduction in the active center furthermore the effects of internal diffusion led to a significant decrease in the correlation coefficient r2 and k of the second stage compared to that of the first stage indicating that intra particle diffusion was the rate controlling step 59 3 4 adsorption isotherms the isothermal adsorption models described the adsorption behavior and investigated the adsorbate adsorbent interaction adsorption isotherms of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels displayed an s shaped curve with two inflexion points which divided the curves into three distinct parts fig 2c and fig 2d in the first part the adsorption slowly increased at the same time the remaining phosphate concentration in the solution equilibrium concentration also increased in the second part after the first inflexion point a sharp increase appeared in the adsorption capacity with a decrease in the equilibrium concentration in the third part after the second inflexion point the adsorption capacity tended slowly towards saturation and the equilibrium concentration sharply increased again p element distribution inside the hydrogels was analyzed according to the adsorption curves to explore further the mechanisms underlying this three stage adsorption specifically the cross profiles of ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels before the first inflexion point and at the first and second inflexion points were sampled to perform eds mapping scans respectively as shown in fig 3 p element was almost absent inside the ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels before the first inflexion point at the first inflexion point a small number of p element appeared inside the sa fe iii hydrogels except for the center meanwhile the p content absorbed inside the microspheres of ha sa fe iii was much lower than that on the surface fig 3v these indicated that p started entering into hydrogels to be adsorbed after surface adsorption saturation when the adsorption reached the second inflexion point the elemental p was uniformly distributed inside the ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels therefore the adsorption of the hydrogels included three distinct stages the first stage was surface adsorption where adsorption occurred on the surface due to the low initial phosphate concentration the second stage was the pore filling stage with the increase of initial phosphate concentration the surface adsorption attained saturation the concentration difference between the inside and outside of hydrogels increased considerable phosphate was pushed into hydrogels driven by the concentration difference filling the internal pores and being adsorbed thus the adsorption capacity surged sharply at this stage which decreased the equilibrium concentration the third stage was the saturation stage in which adsorption approached a saturated condition finally in this study an interesting pore filling adsorption phenomenon was discovered however the well studied adsorption models including langmuir and freundlich 56 were challenging to fit the isothermal adsorption data and describe the sorption reaction between adsorbate and adsorbent systems the usual s shaped adsorption isotherms such as the fowler guggenheim 60 were also unsuitable for this pore filling phenomenon herein an empirical adsorption model was proposed to fit the specific adsorption specifically the experimental data were fitted at three stages separately according to the isotherms this model includes three parts the first is the sips model for the surface adsorption stage which combines the langmuir and freundlich isotherms 61 the second is the proposed model in this paper for the internal adsorption stage which is transformed from the one phase exponential decay function 62 and well fitted for the equilibrium data a detailed explanation of this expression can be found in the supporting text s1 the third is the freundlich model for the saturation stage 63 the equations and relevant parameters are shown in table s2 the experimental maximum adsorption capacities of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels were 133 43 and 55 99 mg p g respectively the proposed model is well fitted to the second stage isotherm data of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels with correlation coefficients of 0 8043 and 0 9996 respectively it demonstrated that the model could reasonably describe the equilibrium relationship between the adsorbed quantity and the remaining in solution during the pore filling stage 3 5 adsorption mechanisms the ftir spectra of ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels before and after phosphate adsorption are shown in fig s4 the remarkable decrease of oh peak 3193 cm 1 intensity was found in the sa fe iii spectrum suggesting that hydroxyl groups were involved in phosphate adsorption the peaks at 1387 cm 1 were assigned to the carboxy symmetric stretching vibrations 46 63 the intensity of the coo peak of sa fe iii decreased significantly after p adsorption this revealed that the carboxyl group of sa fe iii was involved in phosphate adsorption an apparent characteristic at 1018 cm 1 in the ha sa fe iii spectrum was associated with co in the coordination compound 47 after phosphate adsorption the peak intensity of oh decreased while the peak intensity of co increased noticeably it implied that the phosphate might substitute the hydroxyl group to form a phosphate ester complex in the ha sa fe iii hydrogels 64 the peak at 432 cm 1 in ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii spectra reflected the stretching vibration of feo 64 here the peak intensity of ha sa fe iii hydrogels was higher than that of the sa fe iii hydrogels suggesting that the addition of ha caused the fe iii ions to bind more tightly after adsorption the feo peak disappeared and new peaks were observed at 550 cm 1 sa fe iii and 487 cm 1 ha sa fe iii which were assigned to the bending vibration of o p o in phosphate 23 this result suggested that the feo bond interacted with the phosphate anions xps analysis of the hydrogels before and after adsorption was conducted to explore the phosphate adsorption mechanisms further and the results are shown in fig 4 after adsorption the cl2p peaks in sa fe iii fig 4a and ha sa fe iii fig 4d diminished with the appearance of p2p peak at around 133 52 ev indicated that some phosphates were successfully loaded on hydrogels via exchange with chloride ions 47 the o1s spectra are shown in fig 4b and fig 4e the two peaks of o1s spectrum for sa fe iii fig 4b at 530 75 and 532 7 ev assigned to the feo and feoh 23 47 which were shifted to 531 53 and 532 96 ev after p adsorption respectively the higher binding energy could be explained by the valence band transfer of electrons indicating the formation of fe o p complexes 21 after adsorption the peak intensity of fe oh decreased from 84 89 to 32 59 while feo increased from 13 9 to 63 08 it demonstrated that the oh group in sa fe iii hydrogels was replaced by phosphate to form monodentate or bidentate complexes with fe 23 the two peaks with binding energies of 533 2 and 532 09 ev in the o1s spectrum of ha sa fe iii were attributed to coh and fe oh respectively 65 after adsorbing p the intensity of both peaks decreased and a new peak appeared at 531 41 ev corresponding to op 65 it could be the result of the ligand exchange between oh and phosphate which confirmed the involvement of hydroxyl functional groups in the adsorption mechanism furthermore the fe2p peaks of ha sa fe iii fig 4f and sa fe iii fig 4c slightly shifted towards higher binding energy suggesting that the adsorption sites acted as lewis acids and attracted phosphate species with negatively charged 66 based on adsorption experiments and characterization the mechanisms of phosphate removal by ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels can be concluded as the following fig 5 i ligand exchange phosphate is adsorbed onto sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels via r o p phosphate esters are formed through ligand exchange between hydroxyl groups and phosphate ii ion exchange phosphate exchanges with chloride ions iii lewis acids and bases the presence of ligand unsaturated metal sites acts as a lewis acid and interacts with the phosphate via electrostatic attraction iv pore filling the physisorption of phosphate occurs in porous structures based on the isotherm results 3 6 application of the eps like hydrogels in the removal of p 3 6 1 effects of ph it has been proved that ph determines the morphology of the adsorbate and influences the surface properties of the adsorbent 12 fig 6a exhibits eps like hydrogel adsorption amounts at different ph levels there was an increase in phosphate adsorption capacity when ph increased from 7 to 10 in particular the adsorption capacity of sa fe iii hydrogels increased significantly compared to that of ha sa fe iii hydrogels when ph rose from 6 to 7 meanwhile the adsorption capacity increased while the dissolution of fe ions was not detected besides the correlation analysis fig 6b indicated that the sorption capacity was negatively correlated to the amount of leached fe therefore it can be inferred that fe iii is the primary adsorption active site and its dissolution reduced the number of active adsorption sites leading to a decrease in adsorption capacity at ph 2 6 furthermore the fe leached from ha sa fe iii was lower than that of sa fe iii regardless of the ph variation it indicated that ha enhanced the chemical stability of ha sa fe iii hydrogels by improving the ability to combine fe ions furthermore the increment of ph values favoured the conversion of h2po4 ions to hpo4 2 and po4 3 ions which displayed stronger negatively charged strengthening the electrostatic attraction between phosphate and fe iii on the hydrogel as the ph increased to 11 the sa fe iii hydrogels collapsed while the internal structure of ha sa fe iii hydrogels was disrupted due to the volume expansion fig s5 it can explain the marked decrease in the adsorption capacity of both hydrogels these results demonstrated that it is better to apply sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels to p recovery within the ph range of 7 10 3 6 2 effects of contact time and the initial phosphate concentration to explore the effect of contact time the phosphate adsorption performances of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels were carried out at 0 to 24 h fig 6c demonstrates that the adsorption efficiencies of both hydrogels were relatively high within the initial 4 h adsorption with the adsorption amount exceeding 75 of the maximum adsorption capacity 88 for sa fe iii and 79 for ha sa fe iii respectively afterwards the adsorption rate slowed and the equilibrium state arrived after adsorption around 8 h effects of the initial phosphate concentration on the adsorption of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels are shown in fig 6d the adsorption capacity increased with the initial phosphate concentration and reached saturation at 75 mg p l the maximum phosphate removal rate 70 19 for sa fe iii and 90 19 for ha sa fe iii respectively arrived at the initial phosphate concentration of 65 mg p l it indicated that both hydrogels were suitable for p removal in the solution with higher initial phosphate concentrations 50 mg p l furthermore when the initial phosphate concentrations were higher than 20 mg p l the removal rates of ha sa fe iii hydrogels were higher than those of sa fe iii hydrogels this result demonstrated that ha could benefit the hydrogel s ability to remove p however the excess dry weight of ha reduced the adsorption capacity by significantly changing the mass this is consistent with the results in fig s3a 3 6 3 effects of coexisting anions anions such as cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 can compete with phosphate for active adsorption sites of hydrogels 21 28 which could affect the adsorption efficiency in application to evaluate the selectivity of the hydrogels for phosphate the effects of coexisting anions on phosphate adsorption were tested fig 6e and fig 6f the adsorption capacity was less changed with the presence of no3 and cl presumably attributed to their smaller ionic radius than phosphate 67 in contrast hco3 significantly inhibited phosphate adsorption it may be due to the similar sorption affinities of hco3 to the active sites 68 moreover the electrostatic repulsion between the highly charged phosphate anions and the deprotonated surface hydroxyls which was caused by the increasing equilibrium ph fig s6 might also be responsible for the limitation of phosphate adsorption 69 based on univariate analyses a notable reduction of phosphate adsorption by sa fe iii hydrogels appeared with the so4 2 concentration increased this can be explained by the higher charge of so4 2 and a stronger electrostatic attraction to be absorbed in the presence of sulfate ions ha sa fe iii hydrogels showed higher selectivity for phosphate than sa fe iii hydrogels 3 7 p sustainable release performance and wastewater treatment humic acids can effectively fix p and reduce p losses to improve p utilization efficiency in soil 70 71 to further explore the feasibility of p adsorbed hydrogels as fertilizers hydrostatic release experiments were undertaken to assess the p controlled release performance text s2 the results text s3 met the requirements of sustainable release criteria in hgt4215 2011 12 for 1d 75 for 28d two kinds of hydrogels had the potential to serve as sustainable release p fertilizers to investigate the eps like hydrogel s p removal ability in real wastewater the discharged piggery wastewater was collected from an industrial farm in the gaochun district of nanjing china the piggy wastewater was divided into two equal portions one portion was pretreated by filtration with 0 35 μm membrane to remove large non soluble particulate solids and the other was not pretreated the characteristics and features of the filtrated and non filtrated wastewater and the removal efficiency of p by the eps like hydrogel are summarized in table s3 as shown in table s3 the eps like hydrogels showed a high p removal rate 60 in industrial wastewater 3 8 application prospects in recent decades different adsorbents such as biochar 72 metal oxides 73 layered double hydroxide 74 and clays 75 have been designed for p recovery however most adsorbents were fine powders and some may be highly costly to separate and recover after adsorption 76 magnetic adsorbents have been synthesized to solve this problem 77 78 while increasing the cost is inevitable this study designed two kinds of eps like hydrogels using natural polymers these hydrogels had well porous structures and large sizes improving the adsorption capability table 3 and facilitating the separation and regeneration efficiency after adsorption besides eps like hydrogels have the potential to be used as a sustainable release p fertilizer which can effectively promote p recovery in the application according to the maximum adsorption capacity it can be calculated that the cost of treating one ton of phosphorus containing wastewater p 75 mg l is about 25 and 80 using sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii respectively the price advantage is not significant compared with normal chemical agents however the excellent p adsorption performance and sustainable release potential contribute to a cyclic pattern p recovery from wastewater p sustainable release in soil and p reuse for plants to cope with environmental pollution and p resource constraints 4 conclusions this work successfully developed two types of eps like hydrogels sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii for p recovery hydrogen bonds and fe iii which acted as a metal bridge connected the ha and sodium alginate constructing the 3d mesh structure of ha sa fe iii the addition of ha led to the formation of macro porous rich ha sa fe iii hydrogels which enhanced its removal efficiency for phosphate and its chemical stability to ph reducing the fe leaching during the adsorption process adding ha failed to mitigate against the impact of hco3 but it enhanced the selectivity for phosphate adsorption under the presence of so4 2 according to the kinetic and isotherm analysis when the initial p concentration was higher than 35 mg l both hydrogels performed pore filling adsorption where the internal diffusion controlled the rate based on the xps and ftir analyses the adsorption mechanisms involved electrostatic attraction ligand exchange physical adsorption and ion exchange eps like hydrogels displayed excellent phosphorus adsorption capacity and sustainable release potential which

12569,phosphorus p recovery from wastewater is meaningful in wastewater treatment and resource recycling natural extracellular polymeric substances eps of microbes show impressive p uptake ability however natural eps is difficult to assist in p recovery due to the high harvesting cost in extraction thus eps like hydrogels constructed by sodium alginate sa fe iii and humic acids ha were designed the results showed that the optimal formation conditions of eps like hydrogel were 0 1 m fe iii and m ha m sa 1 fe iii ions were the key crosslinkers in constructing the 3 dimensional sodium alginate sa fe iii hydrogels and in the embedding of humic acid ha for ha sa fe iii hydrogels ha sa fe iii hydrogels showed bigger pore sizes lesser fe leaching and higher phosphate selectivity in so4 2 compared to sa fe iii hydrogels the highest p adsorption amounts were 56 and 134 33 mg p g for the ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii respectively the adsorption isotherm results exhibited that when the initial p concentration was in a range of 0 35 mg l the adsorption mainly existed on the surface of the adsorbent while in the pore filling stage i e the initial p concentration was higher than 35 mg l internal diffusion controlled the adsorption process based on the kinetics the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis detected an appearance of fe o p and o p bonds and a disappearance of chloride ions in the hydrogels after adsorption which confirmed the major driving forces on adsorption ligand exchange and ion exchange moreover ha sa fe iii hydrogel saturated by p adsorption passed a test as sustainable release p fertilizers overall the eps like hydrogels developed here provide new absorbents for p recovery graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations ha humic acid sa sodium alginate ebpr enhanced biological phosphorus removal dcb divalent cation bridging eps extracellular polymeric substances sa fe iii sodium alginate crosslink with fe iii ha sa fe iii sodium alginate linking to humic acid with fe iii keywords sodium alginate humic acid eps like hydrogels phosphorus adsorption data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as an essential element constituting organisms phosphorus p is irreplaceable to human health and development 1 2 however the widespread usage of p with low efficiency in agriculture and industry has led excessive p to enter the environment through wastewater discharge causing severe environmental pollution 3 for example p enrichment in water bodies can cause eutrophication with severe algal blooms and the deterioration of ecosystems 4 more importantly as a non renewable and irreplaceable resource mineral p will be scarce or even depleted in the next 50 100 years 2 5 therefore p recovery is significant for resource recycling and environmental protection various techniques have been developed for p removals such as adsorption chemical precipitation membrane filtration and biological methods 6 7 among these techniques adsorption is superior for its high efficiency advantages low cost and less secondary pollution 8 the adsorbent is decisive for adsorption performance 9 12 microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps displayed great potential in p uptake and storage 13 15 which could be an ideal adsorbent for p recovery however natural eps are challenging to be extracted and remain stable limiting to be applied industrially for p recovery the structure and elemental composition of eps have been analyzed which is a kind of hydrogel mainly composed of proteins humic substances and polysaccharides 16 therefore eps based bionic hydrogels may remove p efficiently similar to microbial eps thus it is meaningful to develop eps like hydrogels for industrial applications sodium alginate sa is a natural polysaccharide with considerable carboxyl and hydroxyl groups which can easily crosslink with multivalent metal ions 17 such as iron iii 18 calcium ii 19 and aluminum iii 20 to form three dimensional network hydrogels due to their non toxicity and biodegradable characteristics sa based hydrogels have been widely studied for p removal and recovery 21 26 in rivers and lakes fe bound p fe p is a common p form 27 indicating a strong affinity of fe for p for example sa fe iii hydrogels have impressive p adsorption capacities 18 considering the high p affinity sa fe iii based hydrogel is proposed however the application of sa fe iii hydrogels is still limited because of the low selectivity for p under the presence of other anions such as hco3 28 and so4 2 21 sa fe iii hydrogels were also sensitive to external ph affecting adsorption capacity and chemical stability 29 30 more importantly the underlying mechanisms of p adsorption remain to be elucidated humic acid ha an essential constituent of microbial eps 31 is derived from the biodegradation of organisms like plants and animals 32 various active functional groups exist in ha such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amine groups 33 these functional groups could provide numerous p adsorption sites by combining metal ions and forming ha metal p complexes 34 37 besides introducing ha in sa fe iii hydrogels could enhance the hydrogel s chemical stability and reduce the crosslinking ions leaching 38 39 although the ha fe iii p binding model has been proposed 40 the knowledge of how ha connects with sa and fe iii and the involved process of p adsorption of ha sa fe iii hydrogels are still limited besides ha metal p complexes can potentially be sustainable release p fertilizers 32 33 thus ha sa fe iii hydrogels could be used as sustainable release p fertilizers providing an effective strategy for p reuse although very few studies have explicitly tested the hypothesis this study aims to construct eps like hydrogels by crosslinking sa fe iii matrix with or without ha to remove and reuse p for this purpose the following key objectives were designed i to explore the formation mechanisms of hydrogels and the p adsorption process ii to optimize the preparation of eps like hydrogels by varying the amount of ha and the concentration of fe iii iii to assess the p adsorption performance of the eps like hydrogels under a series of ph values initial p concentrations coexisting anions and contact time and iv to examine the p release properties of the eps like hydrogels by hydrostatic sustained release experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o sodium bicarbonate nahco3 anhydrous sodium sulfate na2so4 sodium nitrate nano3 and sodium chloride nacl were procured from xilong scientific co china sodium alginate cp viscosity 200 20 mpa s m g 1 1 was purchased from macklin china sodium humate was supplied by tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china a phosphate stock solution was prepared by dissolving dipotassium hydrogen phosphate k2hpo4 in distilled water all reagents are of analytical grade 2 2 fabrication of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels were synthesized by a one step titration gel crosslink method precisely a certain amount of sa was weighed and dissolved in distilled water and a transparent and homogeneous sa 2 wt solution was obtained 18 a series of ha to sa ratios 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 w w were designed the suspension was stirred by a magnetic stirrer until completely dissolved after that the mixture 30 ml was added to ferric chloride solution 100 ml drop by drop for hydrogel formation to explore the effect of fe iii concentration on hydrogel properties a series of fe iii concentrations 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 m was designed the obtained hydrogels were left in the ferric chloride solution for 12 h of aging lastly the hydrogel capsules were washed 4 5 times with distilled water to remove fe iii residues before use 2 3 adsorption experiments all experiments were carried out with hydrogel capsules in a 50 ml tube containing 10 ml phosphate solutions 75 mg p l which were put on a shaking table 80 rpm for 24 h after drying at 100 c the average weight of the sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii was 0 004 g and 0 012 g respectively the effects of ha content and crosslinking fe iii ion concentration on the adsorption capacity of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels were studied the effect of the solution ph on phosphate removal and fe leakage from sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels were measured and analyzed at different initial ph ranging from 2 to 11 with an interval of 1 phosphate adsorption isotherms of hydrogels were obtained under various initial phosphate concentrations 0 100 mg p l phosphate adsorption kinetics were analyzed at different reaction time from 0 to 24 h moreover the effects of coexisting anions i e no3 cl hco3 so4 2 on phosphate removal were evaluated at three concentrations 0 6 1 2 and 2 4 mm the experiment was conducted at room temperature 25 c and the temperature would not affect the results the p adsorption capacity at equilibrium state qe and removal rate r was computed by eqs 1 and 2 1 q e c e c i v m 2 r c e c i c i where ci mg l and ce mg l denote the initial concentration and the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in solution respectively qe mg g is the adsorption capacity of adsorbent at equilibrium v is the volume of solution m is the dry weight of adsorbent 2 4 characterization and analytical methods the phosphate concentration was measured by an automatic discrete analyzer dechem tech cleverchem the morphology and element mapping measurements

as coexisting anions were compared using one way anova by spss 26 the correlation analysis was performed by origin correlation application the analysis of one way anova was carried out using s n k with a significance level at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the eps like hydrogels two kinds of eps like hydrogels sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii were prepared and both hydrogels formed 3 dimensional net like structures with numerous pores fig 1 pore size analysis demonstrated the pore size in ha sa fe iii hydrogel was much bigger than that in the sa fe iii hydrogel table s1 it could be attributed to the strong affinity of ha for fe iii ions 41 which complexed a portion of the fe iii ions crosslinked with alginate resulting in a rough surface this was also confirmed by the presence of feo oh peak in the xrd spectrum of ha sa fe iii hydrogels fig 1c specifically no apparent diffraction peaks were presented in the xrd spectrum of the sa fe iii hydrogel fe iii ions connected to the carboxyl group of the alginate molecules led to the disappearance of the three characteristic peaks of sa 42 43 however the addition of ha significantly altered the shape of hydrogel peaks with the appearance of a strong diffraction peak corresponding to feo oh 2θ 26 725 additionally the porosity increased with the addition of ha 61 66 for sa fe iii and 69 12 for ha sa fe iii it suggested that adding ha reduced the crosslinking between sa and fe iii it is known that fe iii is the crosslinking ion 17 therefore it can be inferred that fe iii ions complexed with ha become more prominent active sites instead of being involved in crosslinking based on divalent cation bridging dcb theory divalent cations bridge negatively charged functional groups within eps which helps to aggregate and stabilize biopolymers and microbial matrices 44 therefore the fe iii ions which played a crosslinking role in ha sa fe iii would connect alginate long chains and ha 45 forming stable hydrogels in the ftir spectra the peak intensities of oh 3193 cm 1 cooh 1600 cm 1 and co 1018 cm 1 43 46 47 displayed a significant decrease for ha sa fe iii compared to sa fe iii details in section fig s4 indicating that the introduction of ha enriched the functional groups in hydrogels which affect the peak intensity besides the internal structure of ha sa fe iii hydrogels is exhibited a heterogeneous three dimensional network with marked junctions this revealed that ha was also inserted into the 3 dimensional hydrogel because ha contained abundant active groups of carboxyl hydroxyl and amine which can connect with alginate through hydrogen bonds and fe metal bridges 48 49 however the size of ha molecules was not uniform which could link to alginate in various ways both might lead to heterogeneous porous structures in a previous study the long chain of sa formed a dense homogeneous and compact microporous meshwork structure by cooh and oh groups 50 as for the mixed droplets of ha and sa the crosslinking decreased because the carboxyl groups of ha combined with fe iii ions which were no longer involved in crosslinking reactions the fe iii ions complexed by ha became more prominent against phosphate due to the absence of alginate encapsulation when the drops were crosslinked with fe iii the ha macromolecules were further connected with the alginate chain through metal bridges and hydrogen bonds forming a loose and macro porous mesh structure with nodules the formation mechanisms of sa fe iii hydrogels and ha sa fe iii were summarized in fig s2 50 and fig 1 respectively 3 2 the optimization of eps like hydrogels for phosphate adsorption fig s3a illustrates that phosphate adsorption capacity and removal rate decreased as the m ha m sa ratio rose from 0 to 0 4 this was probably due to ha s extreme affinity with metal ions 51 ha occupied the active iron sites that could otherwise be used for phosphate adsorption however as the ratio further increased to 1 the adsorption capacity and removal efficiencies rose and the removal rate increased significantly this might be attributed to more fe iii ions being linked with the increasing ha content becoming a more prominent active site against phosphate 51 as a result introducing iron active sites could compensate for the loss of the phosphate adsorption sites in ha sa fe iii hydrogels as can be seen from the sem images of ha sa fe iii hydrogels fig 1b and pore parameters table s1 ha enlarged the pore size and facilitated phosphate diffusion therefore the phosphate removal rate kept increasing and achieved a maximum ratio of 8 although the removal rate was increasing the dry weight of per ha sa fe iii hydrogel became excessive due to adding humic acid resulting in decreased adsorption capacity thus after careful consideration the ratio of 1 was chosen to prepare ha sa fe iii hydrogel microspheres in subsequent experiments the optimized parameters are listed in table 1 ferric ions participated in the formation of hydrogels 16 and substantially influenced phosphate sorption efficacy ha sa fe iii microspheres were difficult to gel at 0 01 m ferric concentration therefore no relevant data are available fig s3b shows the effect of fe iii ion concentration on the adsorption properties of hydrogels sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii microspheres captured more phosphate at higher fe iii ion concentrations 0 01 0 1 m and the maximal values arrived at 0 1 m unexpectedly a further increase in fe iii ion concentration led to a decrease in adsorption capacity the fe element content in both ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels upgraded with the increasing fe iii ion concentration fig s3b while the microsphere size did not change fig s3c the carboxylate groups of sa could form complexes with fe iii ions and link the polysaccharide to hydrogels 17 excessive crosslinking of fe iii within hydrogel at higher fe iii ion concentrations 52 inhibited the internal mass transfer of phosphate which caused a decreasing sorption capacity fig s3b moreover feo oh crystals were detected in the xrd spectra of ha sa fe iii fig 1c under high iron concentrations a large number of iron hydroxide precipitates within the hydrogels and plugged the pores inside which might also be a reason for the hindrance of phosphate mass transfer within the ha sa fe iii hydrogels the efficiency of fe in capturing phosphate i e adsorbed phosphate per fe also was calculated fig s3b the crosslinking fe iii ion concentration was negatively correlated with fe efficiency however the hydrogels appeared with weak gelation and poor mechanical strength at low fe iii ion concentration 0 01 m besides similar fe utilization efficiencies were observed at 0 05 m and 0 1 m fe iii concentrations therefore 0 1 m fe iii is suitable for an economical and effective practice moreover the results showed that the fe utilization efficiency of ha sa fe iii was significantly lower than that of sa fe iii indicating that the addition of ha might change the physicochemical properties of hydrogels such as the formation mechanism fig 1 3 3 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics were conducted to gain insights into the adsorption mechanisms of hydrogels three kinetics models the pseudo first order model 53 the pseudo second order model 54 the elovich model 55 and the intra particle diffusion model 56 were used to fit the kinetics data table 2 shows the expressions relevant parameters and correlation coefficients r2 of the kinetics models the r2 values of the pseudo second order model were slightly higher than those of the pseudo first order model it demonstrated that the adsorption of ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii would be mainly driven by chemisorption 57 moreover the elovich model which supposes that the active sites are heterogeneous 58 fits the experimental data very well r2 0 998 for the entire adsorption process it exhibited that the chemisorption of phosphate would take place on a heterogeneous surface the adsorption mechanisms will be further explained in the following characterization results three stages were involved in the phosphate adsorption from solution to hydrogel fig 2b and characterized by pore filling adsorption detailed explanation in section 3 4 in the first stage with the fastest mass transfer rate phosphate continuously diffused to the boundary layer after that phosphate is diffused via a concentration gradient into the pores of hydrogels as there were plenty of sorption sites on the surface and within the pores the diffusion and adsorption efficiency of hydrogels was high at this stage in the second stage with the lower internal mass transfer diffusion rate the internal mass transfer diffusion slowed down as the concentration gradient in the solution decreased in the third stage the adsorption reached equilibrium because of the gradual reduction in the active center furthermore the effects of internal diffusion led to a significant decrease in the correlation coefficient r2 and k of the second stage compared to that of the first stage indicating that intra particle diffusion was the rate controlling step 59 3 4 adsorption isotherms the isothermal adsorption models described the adsorption behavior and investigated the adsorbate adsorbent interaction adsorption isotherms of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels displayed an s shaped curve with two inflexion points which divided the curves into three distinct parts fig 2c and fig 2d in the first part the adsorption slowly increased at the same time the remaining phosphate concentration in the solution equilibrium concentration also increased in the second part after the first inflexion point a sharp increase appeared in the adsorption capacity with a decrease in the equilibrium concentration in the third part after the second inflexion point the adsorption capacity tended slowly towards saturation and the equilibrium concentration sharply increased again p element distribution inside the hydrogels was analyzed according to the adsorption curves to explore further the mechanisms underlying this three stage adsorption specifically the cross profiles of ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels before the first inflexion point and at the first and second inflexion points were sampled to perform eds mapping scans respectively as shown in fig 3 p element was almost absent inside the ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels before the first inflexion point at the first inflexion point a small number of p element appeared inside the sa fe iii hydrogels except for the center meanwhile the p content absorbed inside the microspheres of ha sa fe iii was much lower than that on the surface fig 3v these indicated that p started entering into hydrogels to be adsorbed after surface adsorption saturation when the adsorption reached the second inflexion point the elemental p was uniformly distributed inside the ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels therefore the adsorption of the hydrogels included three distinct stages the first stage was surface adsorption where adsorption occurred on the surface due to the low initial phosphate concentration the second stage was the pore filling stage with the increase of initial phosphate concentration the surface adsorption attained saturation the concentration difference between the inside and outside of hydrogels increased considerable phosphate was pushed into hydrogels driven by the concentration difference filling the internal pores and being adsorbed thus the adsorption capacity surged sharply at this stage which decreased the equilibrium concentration the third stage was the saturation stage in which adsorption approached a saturated condition finally in this study an interesting pore filling adsorption phenomenon was discovered however the well studied adsorption models including langmuir and freundlich 56 were challenging to fit the isothermal adsorption data and describe the sorption reaction between adsorbate and adsorbent systems the usual s shaped adsorption isotherms such as the fowler guggenheim 60 were also unsuitable for this pore filling phenomenon herein an empirical adsorption model was proposed to fit the specific adsorption specifically the experimental data were fitted at three stages separately according to the isotherms this model includes three parts the first is the sips model for the surface adsorption stage which combines the langmuir and freundlich isotherms 61 the second is the proposed model in this paper for the internal adsorption stage which is transformed from the one phase exponential decay function 62 and well fitted for the equilibrium data a detailed explanation of this expression can be found in the supporting text s1 the third is the freundlich model for the saturation stage 63 the equations and relevant parameters are shown in table s2 the experimental maximum adsorption capacities of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels were 133 43 and 55 99 mg p g respectively the proposed model is well fitted to the second stage isotherm data of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels with correlation coefficients of 0 8043 and 0 9996 respectively it demonstrated that the model could reasonably describe the equilibrium relationship between the adsorbed quantity and the remaining in solution during the pore filling stage 3 5 adsorption mechanisms the ftir spectra of ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels before and after phosphate adsorption are shown in fig s4 the remarkable decrease of oh peak 3193 cm 1 intensity was found in the sa fe iii spectrum suggesting that hydroxyl groups were involved in phosphate adsorption the peaks at 1387 cm 1 were assigned to the carboxy symmetric stretching vibrations 46 63 the intensity of the coo peak of sa fe iii decreased significantly after p adsorption this revealed that the carboxyl group of sa fe iii was involved in phosphate adsorption an apparent characteristic at 1018 cm 1 in the ha sa fe iii spectrum was associated with co in the coordination compound 47 after phosphate adsorption the peak intensity of oh decreased while the peak intensity of co increased noticeably it implied that the phosphate might substitute the hydroxyl group to form a phosphate ester complex in the ha sa fe iii hydrogels 64 the peak at 432 cm 1 in ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii spectra reflected the stretching vibration of feo 64 here the peak intensity of ha sa fe iii hydrogels was higher than that of the sa fe iii hydrogels suggesting that the addition of ha caused the fe iii ions to bind more tightly after adsorption the feo peak disappeared and new peaks were observed at 550 cm 1 sa fe iii and 487 cm 1 ha sa fe iii which were assigned to the bending vibration of o p o in phosphate 23 this result suggested that the feo bond interacted with the phosphate anions xps analysis of the hydrogels before and after adsorption was conducted to explore the phosphate adsorption mechanisms further and the results are shown in fig 4 after adsorption the cl2p peaks in sa fe iii fig 4a and ha sa fe iii fig 4d diminished with the appearance of p2p peak at around 133 52 ev indicated that some phosphates were successfully loaded on hydrogels via exchange with chloride ions 47 the o1s spectra are shown in fig 4b and fig 4e the two peaks of o1s spectrum for sa fe iii fig 4b at 530 75 and 532 7 ev assigned to the feo and feoh 23 47 which were shifted to 531 53 and 532 96 ev after p adsorption respectively the higher binding energy could be explained by the valence band transfer of electrons indicating the formation of fe o p complexes 21 after adsorption the peak intensity of fe oh decreased from 84 89 to 32 59 while feo increased from 13 9 to 63 08 it demonstrated that the oh group in sa fe iii hydrogels was replaced by phosphate to form monodentate or bidentate complexes with fe 23 the two peaks with binding energies of 533 2 and 532 09 ev in the o1s spectrum of ha sa fe iii were attributed to coh and fe oh respectively 65 after adsorbing p the intensity of both peaks decreased and a new peak appeared at 531 41 ev corresponding to op 65 it could be the result of the ligand exchange between oh and phosphate which confirmed the involvement of hydroxyl functional groups in the adsorption mechanism furthermore the fe2p peaks of ha sa fe iii fig 4f and sa fe iii fig 4c slightly shifted towards higher binding energy suggesting that the adsorption sites acted as lewis acids and attracted phosphate species with negatively charged 66 based on adsorption experiments and characterization the mechanisms of phosphate removal by ha sa fe iii and sa fe iii hydrogels can be concluded as the following fig 5 i ligand exchange phosphate is adsorbed onto sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels via r o p phosphate esters are formed through ligand exchange between hydroxyl groups and phosphate ii ion exchange phosphate exchanges with chloride ions iii lewis acids and bases the presence of ligand unsaturated metal sites acts as a lewis acid and interacts with the phosphate via electrostatic attraction iv pore filling the physisorption of phosphate occurs in porous structures based on the isotherm results 3 6 application of the eps like hydrogels in the removal of p 3 6 1 effects of ph it has been proved that ph determines the morphology of the adsorbate and influences the surface properties of the adsorbent 12 fig 6a exhibits eps like hydrogel adsorption amounts at different ph levels there was an increase in phosphate adsorption capacity when ph increased from 7 to 10 in particular the adsorption capacity of sa fe iii hydrogels increased significantly compared to that of ha sa fe iii hydrogels when ph rose from 6 to 7 meanwhile the adsorption capacity increased while the dissolution of fe ions was not detected besides the correlation analysis fig 6b indicated that the sorption capacity was negatively correlated to the amount of leached fe therefore it can be inferred that fe iii is the primary adsorption active site and its dissolution reduced the number of active adsorption sites leading to a decrease in adsorption capacity at ph 2 6 furthermore the fe leached from ha sa fe iii was lower than that of sa fe iii regardless of the ph variation it indicated that ha enhanced the chemical stability of ha sa fe iii hydrogels by improving the ability to combine fe ions furthermore the increment of ph values favoured the conversion of h2po4 ions to hpo4 2 and po4 3 ions which displayed stronger negatively charged strengthening the electrostatic attraction between phosphate and fe iii on the hydrogel as the ph increased to 11 the sa fe iii hydrogels collapsed while the internal structure of ha sa fe iii hydrogels was disrupted due to the volume expansion fig s5 it can explain the marked decrease in the adsorption capacity of both hydrogels these results demonstrated that it is better to apply sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels to p recovery within the ph range of 7 10 3 6 2 effects of contact time and the initial phosphate concentration to explore the effect of contact time the phosphate adsorption performances of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels were carried out at 0 to 24 h fig 6c demonstrates that the adsorption efficiencies of both hydrogels were relatively high within the initial 4 h adsorption with the adsorption amount exceeding 75 of the maximum adsorption capacity 88 for sa fe iii and 79 for ha sa fe iii respectively afterwards the adsorption rate slowed and the equilibrium state arrived after adsorption around 8 h effects of the initial phosphate concentration on the adsorption of sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii hydrogels are shown in fig 6d the adsorption capacity increased with the initial phosphate concentration and reached saturation at 75 mg p l the maximum phosphate removal rate 70 19 for sa fe iii and 90 19 for ha sa fe iii respectively arrived at the initial phosphate concentration of 65 mg p l it indicated that both hydrogels were suitable for p removal in the solution with higher initial phosphate concentrations 50 mg p l furthermore when the initial phosphate concentrations were higher than 20 mg p l the removal rates of ha sa fe iii hydrogels were higher than those of sa fe iii hydrogels this result demonstrated that ha could benefit the hydrogel s ability to remove p however the excess dry weight of ha reduced the adsorption capacity by significantly changing the mass this is consistent with the results in fig s3a 3 6 3 effects of coexisting anions anions such as cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 can compete with phosphate for active adsorption sites of hydrogels 21 28 which could affect the adsorption efficiency in application to evaluate the selectivity of the hydrogels for phosphate the effects of coexisting anions on phosphate adsorption were tested fig 6e and fig 6f the adsorption capacity was less changed with the presence of no3 and cl presumably attributed to their smaller ionic radius than phosphate 67 in contrast hco3 significantly inhibited phosphate adsorption it may be due to the similar sorption affinities of hco3 to the active sites 68 moreover the electrostatic repulsion between the highly charged phosphate anions and the deprotonated surface hydroxyls which was caused by the increasing equilibrium ph fig s6 might also be responsible for the limitation of phosphate adsorption 69 based on univariate analyses a notable reduction of phosphate adsorption by sa fe iii hydrogels appeared with the so4 2 concentration increased this can be explained by the higher charge of so4 2 and a stronger electrostatic attraction to be absorbed in the presence of sulfate ions ha sa fe iii hydrogels showed higher selectivity for phosphate than sa fe iii hydrogels 3 7 p sustainable release performance and wastewater treatment humic acids can effectively fix p and reduce p losses to improve p utilization efficiency in soil 70 71 to further explore the feasibility of p adsorbed hydrogels as fertilizers hydrostatic release experiments were undertaken to assess the p controlled release performance text s2 the results text s3 met the requirements of sustainable release criteria in hgt4215 2011 12 for 1d 75 for 28d two kinds of hydrogels had the potential to serve as sustainable release p fertilizers to investigate the eps like hydrogel s p removal ability in real wastewater the discharged piggery wastewater was collected from an industrial farm in the gaochun district of nanjing china the piggy wastewater was divided into two equal portions one portion was pretreated by filtration with 0 35 μm membrane to remove large non soluble particulate solids and the other was not pretreated the characteristics and features of the filtrated and non filtrated wastewater and the removal efficiency of p by the eps like hydrogel are summarized in table s3 as shown in table s3 the eps like hydrogels showed a high p removal rate 60 in industrial wastewater 3 8 application prospects in recent decades different adsorbents such as biochar 72 metal oxides 73 layered double hydroxide 74 and clays 75 have been designed for p recovery however most adsorbents were fine powders and some may be highly costly to separate and recover after adsorption 76 magnetic adsorbents have been synthesized to solve this problem 77 78 while increasing the cost is inevitable this study designed two kinds of eps like hydrogels using natural polymers these hydrogels had well porous structures and large sizes improving the adsorption capability table 3 and facilitating the separation and regeneration efficiency after adsorption besides eps like hydrogels have the potential to be used as a sustainable release p fertilizer which can effectively promote p recovery in the application according to the maximum adsorption capacity it can be calculated that the cost of treating one ton of phosphorus containing wastewater p 75 mg l is about 25 and 80 using sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii respectively the price advantage is not significant compared with normal chemical agents however the excellent p adsorption performance and sustainable release potential contribute to a cyclic pattern p recovery from wastewater p sustainable release in soil and p reuse for plants to cope with environmental pollution and p resource constraints 4 conclusions this work successfully developed two types of eps like hydrogels sa fe iii and ha sa fe iii for p recovery hydrogen bonds and fe iii which acted as a metal bridge connected the ha and sodium alginate constructing the 3d mesh structure of ha sa fe iii the addition of ha led to the formation of macro porous rich ha sa fe iii hydrogels which enhanced its removal efficiency for phosphate and its chemical stability to ph reducing the fe leaching during the adsorption process adding ha failed to mitigate against the impact of hco3 but it enhanced the selectivity for phosphate adsorption under the presence of so4 2 according to the kinetic and isotherm analysis when the initial p concentration was higher than 35 mg l both hydrogels performed pore filling adsorption where the internal diffusion controlled the rate based on the xps and ftir analyses the adsorption mechanisms involved electrostatic attraction ligand exchange physical adsorption and ion exchange eps like hydrogels displayed excellent phosphorus adsorption capacity and sustainable release potential which
