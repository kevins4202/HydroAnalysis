16605,interest in anaerobic co digestion acod has increased significantly in recent decades owing to enhanced biogas productivity due to the utilization of different organic wastes such as food waste and sewage sludge in this study a robust acod model for biogas prediction is developed using deep learning dl we propose a hybrid dl architecture i e da lstm vsn wherein a dual stage attention da based long short term memory lstm network is integrated with variable selection networks vsns to enhance the model predictability we perform hyperparameter optimization the model accuracy is validated using long term acod monitoring data measured over two years of municipal wastewater treatment plant operation and then compared with those of two other dl based models i e da lstm and the standard lstm in addition the feature importance fi is analyzed to investigate the relative contribution of input variables to biogas production prediction finally we demonstrate the successful application of the validated dl model to the acod process optimization results show that the model accuracy improved significantly by incorporating da into lstm i e the coefficient of determination r2 increased from 0 38 to 0 68 however the r2 can be further increased to 0 76 by combining da lstm with a vsn for the biogas prediction of the acod model the vsn contributes significantly by employing the discontinuous time series of measurement data on biodegradable organic associated variables during acod in addition the vsn allows the acod model to be interpretable via fi analysis using its weighted input features the fi results show that the relative importance is vital to variables associated with food waste leachate whereas it is marginal for those associated with the primary and chemically assisted sedimentation sludges in conclusion the acod model proposed herein can be utilized in practical applications as a robust tool because it can provide the optimal sludge conditions to improve biogas production this is because it facilitates the time series biogas prediction at the full scale using unprocessed datasets with either missing value imputation or outlier removal keywords anaerobic co digestion deep learning biogas modeling and prediction model based process optimization 1 introduction recognition and concern regarding global climate change have increased significantly therefore efforts have been expended gradually to implement activities pertaining to environmental sustainability moriarty and honnery 2012 in this regard the utilization of renewable energy sources for replacing fossil fuels has been emphasized panwar et al 2011 anaerobic digestion ad is a crucial process owing to its ability to produce biogas and renewable energy from organic waste sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant mwtp appels et al 2011 several approaches have been used extensively to enhance biogas production via ad for example anaerobic co digestion acod using multiple organic waste sources has been recognized as an excellent approach for improving digestion efficiency guo et al 2015 the high digestion efficiency afforded by acod is primarily attributed to the sufficient supply of organic materials from various feedstock wastes lee et al 2009 furthermore it yields a favorable amount of nutrients and can generate a synergistic effect between organic substrates in a digester xu et al 2018 for example leachates from food waste fw processing facilities and landfill sites have been increasingly utilized for acod in mwtps as they can be a highly biodegradable organic source for methane production xie et al 2018 to generate biogas from organic wastes using microorganisms such as fermentative bacteria and methanogens ad is performed via four essential stages hydrolysis acidogenesis fermentation acetogenesis and methanogenesis rotaru et al 2014 during the four consecutive stages the solid phase of complex organic matter i e proteins carbohydrates and lipids becomes a liquid phase and yields monomers and oligomers i e amino acids sugars and fatty acids the soluble organic molecules are transformed into intermediate products short chain volatile fatty acids ethanol hydrogen and dioxide which are converted from acetate and formate to final products methane and carbon dioxide as such various factors are involved in the overall process until biogas is produced not only operating parameters i e the characteristics or quantities of water and sludge and digester conditions but also numerous kinetic and stoichiometric parameters are associated with microbial growth and chemical reactions rotaru et al 2014 owing to the extremely high complexity of the system mathematical modeling of the entire ad process to predict the overall biogas production is challenging even though ad is theoretically well understood de clercq et al 2020 machine learning ml which constitutes artificial intelligence is a data driven method for modeling jordan and mitchell 2015 ml considers physical objects processes or systems as black box models from input and output measurements thereby facilitating high predictive capability based on observations rudin 2019 therefore ml based approaches may be superior to theoretical mathematical approaches when target systems possess a higher complexity or nonlinearity of the environment because of multiple input parameters de clercq et al 2020 several ml algorithms have been used to model ad however studies regarding deep learning dl are scarce xu et al 2021 dl architectures use multiple layers in the network to extract representations for the detection or classification of higher level features from the raw input he et al 2016 among several dl techniques recurrent neural networks rnns are specialized for sequence prediction problems such as temporal data williams and zipser 1989 in rnns long short term memory lstm networks can be used to learn long term temporal dependencies by solving the vanishing gradient problem of standard rnns gers et al 2002 recently the model predictability was enhanced using lstm with an attention mechanism in which essential input features are distinguishable from other less important features qin et al 2017 initially the applicability of artificial neural networks anns to ad process modeling was demonstrated using laboratory scale experimental data of measured methane ch4 production holubar et al 2002 and gaseous trace compounds h2s and nh3 strik et al 2005 meanwhile ann based ad models for predicting the methane fraction ch4 of landfill gas from field scale landfill digesters have been developed as well ozkaya et al 2007 qdais et al 2010 the ann was further integrated with genetic algorithms to optimize the digester operating parameters to yield improved ch4 for a biogas plant qdais et al 2010 in another study support vector machines svms were used to predict total ammonia nitrogen from which the superiority of svm over ann was demonstrated alejo et al 2018 furthermore least squares svm i e an improved svm was used to model the cumulative biogas production dong and chen 2019 recent studies have demonstrated the high potential of predicting methane production using advanced ml algorithms such as random forest rf extreme gradient boosting and the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system asadi et al 2020 de clercq et al 2020 long et al 2021 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 whereas only one application of dl to ad performance prediction has been reported xu et al 2021 existing studies show the high potential of ml for ad modeling nonetheless its feasibility in applying actual monitoring data at the full scale necessitates further investigation the preceding dl model for example consisted of three fully connected layers of neural networks nns xu et al 2021 such kind of nns has two major limitations first such nns are uninterpretable not providing the importance of input features in the model second a fully connected network cannot capture features from sequential data lecun et al 2015 sze et al 2017 accordingly the previous dl approach may be unsatisfactory in modeling the long term operating data of mwtps because high variability and nonlinearity in the time series are shown due to the effects of multiple process variables li et al 2020 scano et al 2014 the influencing factors of acod include the sludge inflow rate q sludge in and sludge outflow rate q sludge out of the digester temperature solid retention time srt ratio of volatile solid vs to total solid ts in sludge and pollutant mass loading from the sludge and fw leachate to the digester these factors can be utilized as input variables in ml for predicting biogas production due to these features adopting the lstm network is more suitable for modeling the acod process since being specifically designed to extract temporal features from sequential data hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 furthermore the use of lstm with the attention mechanism can identify the relative importance of each variable the ultimate goal of this study is to develop a robust acod model for the time series prediction which can be utilized for improving biogas production in an mwtp hence we propose a hybrid dl architecture hereinafter abbreviated as da lstm vsn that combines dual stage attention da lstm with variable section networks vsns da lstm and vsn are used to process continuous and discontinuous monitoring data in a time series for two years respectively the aforementioned key process variables of acod were considered as model inputs for the da lstm vsn subsequently we optimized the hyperparameters of the da lstm vsn to improve predictability the prediction accuracy of the optimized model was compared with that of standalone dl architectures da lstm and lstm which excluded discontinuous time series data a feature importance analysis was then performed by quantifying the importance of the input variables of biogas prediction to acod lastly we used the validated dl model to optimize the sludge conditions for efficient acod process 2 materials and methods 2 1 system description of mwtp a full scale mwtp located in gwangju city south korea was investigated this mwtp has a capacity of 120 000 m3 d to treat sewage with unit processes as follows scree and grit removal primary sedimentation two different activated sludge processes i e anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process and modified ludzack ettinger mle process secondary sedimentation chemically assisted sedimentation filtration and ultraviolet disinfection fig 1 a2o and mle can treat 60 000 m3 d of sewage individually in the system the a2o treatment is composed of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic stages whereas the mle treatment comprises anoxic and aerobic stages the filtration retentate as well as the supernatants from a recycled water treatment rwt and mesophilic ad are fed back to the influent sewage accompanied by the filtrates from a sludge thickening and dewatering in the rwt coagulation and flocculation are performed to treat both the dewatering filtrate from the secondary sludge and the supernatant of the fw leachate the sewage sludge is thickened digested anaerobically dehydrated and finally dried to be discarded to produce biogas the mesophilic two stage ad uses the mixed solids of the fw leachate with thickened raw and excess sludges which originate from primary and chemically assisted sedimentation tanks clarifiers respectively ad comprises two units each with an inner diameter of 19 m d an effective depth h of 9 5 m and a volume of 2 692 m3 v finally dewatering dehydrates the digested secondary and coagulation flocculation sludges at the rwt fig 1 2 2 dataset details seventeen process variables were measured for two years january 1 2016 to december 31 2017 a time series of 731 daily data points was used for model training and validation as illustrated in fig s1 in the whole dataset for the ad process 70 of the obtained data was used for training the deep learning model while the remaining 30 was used to validate test the model accuracy the training dataset was used to estimate the weights and biases that were best fitted to predict the input and output relation in accordance with the calculated errors the test dataset was used to verify the trained model and prevent the model overfitting it is noteworthy that each of the training and test datasets was separated completely from the other dataset sixteen operating parameters were used as input variables to train and validate the dl based acod process models and 16 other operating parameters were used as input variables they are typically measurable parameters at full scale mwtps in actual practice as well as influencing factors of biogas production in the digester specifically they include the q sludge in and q sludge out to the digester srt temperature vs ts ratio i e indicator of organic content in substrate mass loading of primary and secondary sedimentation sludges for biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solids ss and mass loading of the fw leachate for the bod cod ss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp as a target output variable biogas production m3 d was selected and used for model training and validation the input and output data were acquired for two years january 01 2016 to december 31 2017 and prepared for the training and validation datasets they were segregated into two time series types obtained from continuous and discontinuous measurements the former type was monitored daily using sensors and meters whereas the latter was irregularly measured one to five time a week or month via basic water quality tests in laboratory experiments in the proposed hybrid dl architecture continuous and discontinuous data of 17 features were input to da lstm and the vsn respectively 2 3 model structure three different dl models are compared herein the first model comprises only lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 based on continuous input features including the q sludge in and q sludge out temperature and srt of ad the lstm algorithm is an rnn based architecture for simulating time series data sze et al 2017 it comprises gates and memory states that control the flow of information in and out of an lstm cell the second model comprises da lstm which improves the lstm s predictability owing to the attention mechanism qin et al 2017 this model uses continuous input features that are only allowable in lstm networks the third dl model is a combination of da lstm and a vsn lim et al 2019 the vsn algorithm was used to process discontinuous input features while applying continuous input features to the da lstm the discontinuous input features are features that are not continuously recorded in the time series the discontinuous input features are the vs ts ratio of the feed sludge for acod mass loading of bod cod and ss in primary and chemically assisted sedimentation sludges fed to the digester and mass loading of bod cod ss tn and tp in the fw leachate fed to the digester two different outputs from da lstm and vsn were concatenated and then passed through a dense layer the output from this dense layer was regarded as the predicted biogas production this hybrid modeling approach enabled both continuous and discontinuous input data to be used for continuous biogas output prediction more details regarding the da lstm and vsn are provided in the following sections 2 3 1 da lstm da lstm is an attention based lstm model for the simulation of time series data qin et al 2017 it comprises two attention mechanisms followed by lstm layers fig 2 a the first attention layer also known as the input attention layer is used to rescale the input features based on their importance this rescaling amplifies the input features that are more important for prediction while decreases those that are less important the rescaled input is passed through a softmax layer the sum of all the weighted inputs is 1 after passing through the softmax layer the second attention layer is known as the temporal attention layer which selects the important lookback steps for a specified input as such the most important previous time step for a specified input can be determined finally the output of temporal attention is fed to the lstm layer for the further processing and extraction of temporal features fig 2 2 3 2 vsn the vsn algorithm used in this study is similar to that used in a temporal fusion transformer lim et al 2019 with a few modifications this network calculates the relevance and specific contributions of the input features to the output first we assigned the missing values in the discontinuous data ε with zeros fig 2b subsequently they were input to the gated residual network grn the grn estimates the importance of each discontinuous input feature via a weight calculation and it uses the exponential linear unit elu clevert et al 2015 for the activation function between dense layers followed by an add and norm layer ba et al 2016 furthermore it has a residual connection to connect the input to the output the output of the grn is fed to softmax to return the weights of discontinuous features v in which the sum is 1 we performed an element wise multiplication of v and ε to calculate the weighted discontinuous inputs ε this multiplication eliminates the effect of filling the discontinuous input data with zeros using the vsn renders the model interpretable this is because the weights calculated by the vsn quantify the importance assigned to each discontinuous feature during model prediction 2 4 hyperparameter optimization the structure and training of a neural network depend on parameters known as hyperparameters the performance of a dl model is affected significantly by the hyperparameters used including the learning rate batch size lookback steps types of activation functions and number of units in the lstm layer the learning rate determines the amount of change in the model parameters at each step the batch size determines the number of input data examples provided to the model before updating the model parameters the number of lookback steps is the amount of historical input data fed to the neural network at each step for prediction the activation function defines the type of nonlinearity applied to the output of a neural network the number of lstm units is equivalent to the number of parameters in lstm increasing the number of lstm units improves the learning capacity of lstm however it can also result in overfitting and increased computational cost to optimize the hyperparameters the minimum validation loss was used as an objective function the validation loss was calculated using the mean squared error mse between the observed and predicted values of biogas production in the validation data in this study we used the bayesian optimization algorithm boa snoek et al 2015 which is acknowledged for its good performance in the optimization of black box objective functions such as neural networks frazier 2018 in contrast to random and grid search based optimizations the boa considers the results from previously evaluated iterations after each optimization iteration new parameters are suggested based on the expected improvement ei algorithm jones et al 1998 the boa uses gaussian processes i e the posterior distribution of functions that best describe the objective function dewancker et al 2015 this posterior distribution can be improved by increasing the number of iterations because the ei algorithm explores those regions in a parameter space that is more likely to yield the minima mockus et al 1978 in this study the number of iterations for the optimized hyperparameters was set to 50 for the dl based models 2 5 model evaluation the dl model was trained using the mse as a loss function subsequently it was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination r 2 normalized root mean square error nrmse and mean absolute error mae between the observed and predicted values of biogas production the equations used to calculate these performance metrics are as follows 1 mse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 2 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n 3 nrmse rmse o max o min 4 r 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 5 mae i 1 n p i o i n where n is the number of data points pi is the predicted value oi is the observed value o max and o min are the maximum and minimum values observed respectively o and p are the mean of the observed and predicted values respectively 2 6 feature importance evaluation when using ml as a black box model the significance of the input features in predicting the outputs is difficult to explain murdoch et al 2019 therefore feature importance analysis was performed as it facilitates the quantitative assessment of the importance of input variables on output prediction de clercq et al 2020 long et al 2021 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 2 6 1 continuous input features to estimate the sensitivity of continuous input features we performed a functional analysis of variance anova hutter et al 2014 the fanova algorithm enabled us to analyze the variation in the model output with respect to the changed input we used lstm as a model and trained it using only continuous input features i e q sludge in q sludge out sludge temperature tempad and sludge retention time srtad fig 3 a we prepared 16 different combinations of these four input features and then recorded the model response i e validation loss for each input combination a separate lstm was trained for each input combination and its minimum loss was used as the model output the lstm model input combinations and their corresponding outputs are represented as f x and y respectively as shown in fig 3a the rf algorithm was trained using x and y data subsequently the tree of the trained rf was utilized in the fanova algorithm to obtain the mean μx and standard deviation σx of the input data x finally the relative importance of each input variable was calculated using the fraction of variance f u fig 3 2 6 2 discontinuous input features the sensitivity of the discontinuous input features was estimated based on the calculated weights in the vsn section 2 3 1 these weights were calculated for each training and test example for all discontinuous input features and for each lookback step fig 3b therefore these weights indicate the importance of each discontinuous input feature with respect to the lookback step for each example the total importance of each input feature xi was determined by calculating the mean importance of xi for all examples n 2 7 model based process optimization the usefulness of our approach was demonstrated by showing how the proposed model can be used for biogas production enhancement for this purpose we optimized the amount of the sludge inflow and outflow in ad denoted as q sludge in and q sludge out respectively the dl based model already validated in this study was used for the biogas prediction by varying q sludge in and q sludge out to consider srt change resulting from the variable sludge amount in ad we built a categorical boosting catboost based ml model prokhorenkova et al 2017 to predict srt this model used q sludge in and q sludge out as input and its resultant output i e srt was then inputted to the dl based model the catboost model was robust with a high accuracy of r2 0 94 fig s2 since being trained validated and tested using 64 jan 2016 apr 2017 16 may 2016 aug 2017 and 20 sep 2017 jan 2018 of the measurement data respectively during the optimization of q sludge in and q sludge out new values were selected randomly within their upper and lower fences as statistically analyzed afterward fig 4 q sludge in was 155 333 m3 d and q sludge out was 112 324 m3 d we ran the optimization for 50 000 iterations to maintain the predicted biogas production close to 1400 m3 d which could significantly improve the total biogas quantity measured in jan 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistical variation in process variables for acod the monitoring data were characterized using boxplots to clearly describe the features of an acod dataset based on a set of descriptive statistics including the median i e the middle value upper and lower quartiles 75th and 25th percentiles respectively and sample maximum and minimum i e the largest and smallest observations respectively except for outliers the median value of biogas production presented as a red line was 1391 5 m3 d indicating that the values of 50 of the 731 data points in this study were greater than the abovementioned value fig 4a furthermore the boxplot for biogas production show that the upper and lower quartiles were 1771 5 and 958 6 m3 d respectively the median q sludge in and q sludge out were 246 and 215 m3 d respectively fig 4b the median values of ad temperature and srt were 34 8 c and 23 1 d respectively fig 4c the inflow sludge indicates a median value of 0 75 for the vs ts ratio fig 4d the primary sedimentation sludge indicates that the median mass loadings for the bod cod and ss were 149 1 51 4 and 142 7 kg d respectively fig 4e the chemically assisted sedimentation sludge shows a considerably lower mass loading for the bod 20 3 kg d cod 21 1 kg d and ss 27 4 kg d compared with those for the primary sedimentation sludge fig 4f fw leachate is a crucial component for determining biogas production because it can supplement biodegradable organic materials to the microorganisms during acod therefore the mass loadings of bod cod ss tn and tp were quantified when the fw leachate was fed to the digester their median mass loadings were 1036 4 kg d bod 650 6 kg d cod 1956 kg d ss 180 7 kg d tn and 26 5 kg d tp fig 4g and h fig 4 3 2 hyperparameter optimization for dl models tuning the hyperparameters of dl models is crucial for improving the model accuracy in the present study the hyperparameters were optimized as follows batch size 8 128 lookback 6 15 learning rate 10 7 10 3 number of lstm units for either the encoder or decoder 8 256 the types of activation functions for the encoder and decoder included the relu tanh elu and none table 1 summarizes the optimized hyperparameters for maximizing the accuracy of the three dl models for da lstm vsn the optimum batch size lookback and learning rate were 16 13 and 5 3 10 4 respectively the numbers of lstm units were 69 encoder and 78 decoder the activation functions that yielded the best results were none encoder tanh decoder and relu vsn for da lstm the batch size lookback and learning rate were 8 10 and 2 3 10 4 respectively whereas the activation functions for the encoder and decoder were optimal similar to those of the da lstn and vsn hybrid models in comparison with the preceding model da lstm required fewer lstm units i e 64 encoder and 30 decoder this can be explained by its lower complexity as it uses only continuous time series data for four input variables except for the discontinuous data for 12 input variables in the weight matrix calculation by contrast the number of optimized hyperparameters for the standard lstm were much higher than those of the preceding two models and relu was the best activation function for lstm table 1 3 3 model training and validation 3 3 1 learning curves a comparison of the learning curves for the training and validation datasets for the three dl models is shown in fig 5 the learning behavior was monitored during model training by recording the training and validation loss mse after each training epoch an epoch indicates the number of passes for the entire training dataset after each training epoch the mean mse values for all the training examples were measured subsequently the model performance was determined based on the mse calculation of the validation data training and validation losses were recorded after each training epoch in general both the training and validation losses decreased more rapidly in the early epochs but stabilized after certain epochs therefore we employed the early stopping criteria to apply the optimal number of epochs for training a model raskutti et al 2014 these optimal epoch criteria allowed our dl models to be trained until the validation loss decreased when the validation loss stopped decreasing for consecutive epochs we stopped the training even when the training loss decreased this is because the model was overfitting and not generalizing resulting in a reduced training loss without a decrease in the validation loss chollet 2018 training for three dl models i e da lstm vsn da lstm and standard lstm was performed for 285 281 and 235 epochs respectively based on the principle of avoiding model overfitting fig 5 the results show that the first two dl models were stably trained and their validation losses plateaued within 80 epochs fig 5a and b by contrast the training loss of lstm decreased significantly even after the 235th epoch fig 5c hence we stopped the training process at 140 epochs at which the minimum validation loss was achieved this indicates no further decline in the validation loss for the next 100 epochs the validation loss curve of da lstm vsn varied slightly with the epoch fig 5a whereas that of lstm fluctuated significantly with the epoch fig 5c these noisy curves can be incurred by the larger batch sizes optimized at 16 for da lstm vsn and 64 for lstm compared with that of da lstm at 8 in particular the optimized lstm model had a batch size of 64 for 200 validation examples thereby resulting in only four validation batches for one epoch because the loss was averaged for all the examples in one epoch we observed a greater variation in the validation loss owing to the smaller number of validation batches for lstm after the training was completed we selected the model with the minimum validation loss to perform predictions fig 5 3 3 2 model validation once the best model was selected via training the trained model was used and its predictability was evaluated based on a validation dataset the predicted and observed biogas productions for the three dl based models were compared using regression plots as well as time series plots fig 6 the values of the performance metrics for the training and validation data for the three dl based models are listed in table 2 as shown the models performances for the training data were generally better than that for the validation data although overfitting can occur when the training performance is better than the validation performance it can be avoided by employing an early stopping mechanism fig 6 when only continuous input features were used the lstm model yielded a low prediction accuracy r2 0 38 nrmse 0 14 that was much lower than that of the da lstm model r2 0 68 nrmse 0 10 table 2 the predictions from the lstm model were primarily centered around a mean value and could not capture the dynamic fluctuations in the time series biogas production fig 6c the lstm model rarely followed peaks in biogas productions exceeding 2000 m3 d and less than 1000 m3 d as such a high mae value was observed in the lstm model table 2 by contrast the da lstm demonstrated a considerable improvement in predictability for highly variable biogas production by incorporating the attention mechanism fig 6b this suggests that a simple lstm network is unsatisfactory for describing dynamic fluctuations in biogas production particularly when using actual acod data from full scale mwtps nonetheless such a deficiency in lstm can be compensated by using the attention mechanism the input and temporal attention in da lstsm imposes greater weights on input features that are more relevant to loss value reduction for improving model performance consequently da lstm can select the important features and discard irrelevant ones based on different extents of weights in the network table 2 the da lstm prediction was further improved by incorporating it with a vsn to account for discontinuous input features in this hybrid dl architecture the vsn selects the relevant features from the discontinuous input data thereby supporting the model prediction it is noteworthy that discontinuous input features represent the sludge characteristics for the acod process such as the mass loading of pollutants in the fw leachate in this study see section 2 2 therefore da lstm vsn can describe more peaks than da lstm particularly in regions containing outliers 2581 and 176 m3 d fig 6a the r 2 increased to 0 76 from 0 68 once the discontinuous input features were considered the addition of the vsn to da lstm not only improved the model performance but also provided the rationale for proposing a hybrid dl architecture for more realistic process modeling the biogas production in the digester was affected by acod parameters e g the characteristics of the inflow sludge and fw leachate therefore its realistic prediction is likely to depend significantly on the discontinuous variables 3 4 identification of input feature importance feature importance analysis can provide insights into the effects of the operating parameters of acod on the prediction of biogas production when using the da lstm vsn model in this study the relative importance of the input variables to the model accuracy was investigated fig 7 among the four continuous time series input variables q sludge out demonstrated the greatest impact 28 on the ad biogas prediction followed by q sludge in 27 fig 7a the srtad and tempad exhibited relatively lower importance hence they were ranked third 25 and fourth 21 respectively the difference in the relative importance of these four input variables was slight i e within 7 whereas that for the discontinuous variables was great i e up to 99 3 fig 7b the results reveal that biogas prediction was highly affected by the vs ts ratio and the input variables associated with the fw leachate in particular the first two variables ml ss fw and vs ts were the most influential factors with a relative importance of 34 this is because the fw leachate supplied a significantly larger portion of the ts fed to the acod process of the mwtp system compared with the primary and excess sludges based on the results reported in section 3 1 the ss mass loading for the fw leachate was 13 7 and 71 4 times higher than those for the primary and excess sludges respectively the primary sludge generally contained more biodegradable organics than the excess sludge however its organic source supply to the investigated digester would likely be insufficient for biogas production as well as that of the excess sludge this implies that the mwtp must enhance both the quality and quantity of the primary sludge supplied to the digester for an increased biogas production meanwhile the relative importance values of ml bod fw ml tn fw ml tp fw and ml cod fw were 7 1 5 7 5 3 and 4 6 respectively it is noteworthy that the ps and cs associated variables imposed a marginal effect 1 2 on biogas prediction this may be because the fw leachate can possess a high content of biodegradable organics as a microbe substrate particularly as compared with the excess sludge from the chemically assisted sedimentation additionally the results suggest that the proposed dl method can be used as an interpretable acod model fig 7 3 5 improved biogas production this study demonstrates the successful application of the dl based model to the acod process optimization fig 8 we used the extra test data measured in jan 2018 which was excluded in the previous sections the actual measurements of biogas production were compared with the optimized predictions fig 8a the predicted result tended to produce biogas closer to a target value of 1400 m3 d than the actual measurements the bar chart of this figure shows the differential of biogas productions between the measured and optimized cases which are depicted in the orange and blue bars respectively for 27 days of operation in acod the diminished biogas production below the target level could be improved significantly by regulating the sludge inflow and outflow and srt based on the optimized predictions figs 8b d under the optimized sludge conditions the original biogas productivity increased by 20 i e 6375 8 m3 in total this improvement would be attributed to the predicted srt values mainly within the range of 20 30 days which could be optimal for mesophilic ad fig 8d in contrast with the predictions the measured srt values were below 20 days frequently in the latter half of jan 2018 therefore these results confirm that the dl model developed in this study can be helpful for mwtp operators to control sludge values to maintain the biogas production in the acod process fig 8 3 6 implications of present study an rnn based dl method is robust for forecasting problems involving either spatial or temporal sequence data lipton et al 2015 hence rnn based models which are proposed herein can be beneficial for the time series prediction of biogas production fig 6 and optimization of acod process fig 8 using monitoring data in a full scale mwtp it is noteworthy that rnns are affected by data processing with discontinuous sequences of input features caused by missing values or outlier removal che et al 2018 lipton et al 2016 this is attributed to the intrinsic architecture which utilizes prior sequence data to extract parametric information to predict the current state of variables lipton et al 2016 therefore the selection of key process variables as rnn input features may be limited owing to the difficulty in acquiring all variable data at the same timestep intervals or in performing complete measurements without overlooking the timesteps some variables can be measured promptly using in situ sensors and meters for other variables time consuming measurements via ex situ experiments performed in a laboratory using analytical equipment are necessitated in addition many typically used datasets retain missing or abnormal values in a few timesteps incurred by equipment failures or measurement errors little and rubin 2019 the absence of partial sequence data can be compensated by performing a listwise deletion or substituting an estimated value by the single mean regression stochastic interpolation k nearest neighbors and multiple imputations nonetheless the listwise deletion can either degrade the model accuracy or render the model unpractical for use in actual mwtps even though imputation methods can be used it may still be challenging to sufficiently capture the complex correlations of variables che et al 2018 or compensate for the long term gaps overlooked in the time series since they are measured a few times a week or a month as shown in section 3 1 therefore the hybrid dl architecture proposed herein is promising for successfully training rnn based models even when using raw datasets unprocessed with either missing value imputation or outlier removal which are attributed to the vsn or attention mechanism respectively 4 conclusion the data driven dl approach is useful for modeling complex biological processes the biogas productivity of acod can be affected by various factors originating from not only mwtp waste sludge but also other organic waste sources as such it can indicate high variability over time during long term operations therefore we proposed rnn based dl algorithms to develop a robust acod model for biogas prediction the main conclusions of the present study are as follows the da lstm based acod models were effectively trained via hyperparameter optimization without overfitting and successfully validated using practically measurable process data acquired in two years from a local mwtp gwangju city south korea the proposed hybrid architecture da lstm vsn enabled the acod model to use both continuous daily or discontinuous one to five times a week or month time series data to model a complex acod process with high accuracy the rnn based dl models required an attention mechanism and discontinuous input data assimilation using a vsn the attention based dl models da lstm and da lstm vsn yielded better prediction performance r2 0 68 and 0 76 respectively compared with the standard lstm model r2 0 38 the contribution of the input variables to biogas prediction was analyzed the results revealed that q sludge out was of the highest importance followed by q sludge in srt and temperature in addition the relative importance results for the discontinuous input features revealed that the vs ts ratio and fw leachate associated variables were more significant for biogas prediction than the other variables associated with the primary and chemically assisted sedimentation sludges the optimization of the acod process was viable with the use of the validated dl based model by finding the optimal conditions for the sludge inflow and outflow and srt in which the biogas production

16605,interest in anaerobic co digestion acod has increased significantly in recent decades owing to enhanced biogas productivity due to the utilization of different organic wastes such as food waste and sewage sludge in this study a robust acod model for biogas prediction is developed using deep learning dl we propose a hybrid dl architecture i e da lstm vsn wherein a dual stage attention da based long short term memory lstm network is integrated with variable selection networks vsns to enhance the model predictability we perform hyperparameter optimization the model accuracy is validated using long term acod monitoring data measured over two years of municipal wastewater treatment plant operation and then compared with those of two other dl based models i e da lstm and the standard lstm in addition the feature importance fi is analyzed to investigate the relative contribution of input variables to biogas production prediction finally we demonstrate the successful application of the validated dl model to the acod process optimization results show that the model accuracy improved significantly by incorporating da into lstm i e the coefficient of determination r2 increased from 0 38 to 0 68 however the r2 can be further increased to 0 76 by combining da lstm with a vsn for the biogas prediction of the acod model the vsn contributes significantly by employing the discontinuous time series of measurement data on biodegradable organic associated variables during acod in addition the vsn allows the acod model to be interpretable via fi analysis using its weighted input features the fi results show that the relative importance is vital to variables associated with food waste leachate whereas it is marginal for those associated with the primary and chemically assisted sedimentation sludges in conclusion the acod model proposed herein can be utilized in practical applications as a robust tool because it can provide the optimal sludge conditions to improve biogas production this is because it facilitates the time series biogas prediction at the full scale using unprocessed datasets with either missing value imputation or outlier removal keywords anaerobic co digestion deep learning biogas modeling and prediction model based process optimization 1 introduction recognition and concern regarding global climate change have increased significantly therefore efforts have been expended gradually to implement activities pertaining to environmental sustainability moriarty and honnery 2012 in this regard the utilization of renewable energy sources for replacing fossil fuels has been emphasized panwar et al 2011 anaerobic digestion ad is a crucial process owing to its ability to produce biogas and renewable energy from organic waste sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant mwtp appels et al 2011 several approaches have been used extensively to enhance biogas production via ad for example anaerobic co digestion acod using multiple organic waste sources has been recognized as an excellent approach for improving digestion efficiency guo et al 2015 the high digestion efficiency afforded by acod is primarily attributed to the sufficient supply of organic materials from various feedstock wastes lee et al 2009 furthermore it yields a favorable amount of nutrients and can generate a synergistic effect between organic substrates in a digester xu et al 2018 for example leachates from food waste fw processing facilities and landfill sites have been increasingly utilized for acod in mwtps as they can be a highly biodegradable organic source for methane production xie et al 2018 to generate biogas from organic wastes using microorganisms such as fermentative bacteria and methanogens ad is performed via four essential stages hydrolysis acidogenesis fermentation acetogenesis and methanogenesis rotaru et al 2014 during the four consecutive stages the solid phase of complex organic matter i e proteins carbohydrates and lipids becomes a liquid phase and yields monomers and oligomers i e amino acids sugars and fatty acids the soluble organic molecules are transformed into intermediate products short chain volatile fatty acids ethanol hydrogen and dioxide which are converted from acetate and formate to final products methane and carbon dioxide as such various factors are involved in the overall process until biogas is produced not only operating parameters i e the characteristics or quantities of water and sludge and digester conditions but also numerous kinetic and stoichiometric parameters are associated with microbial growth and chemical reactions rotaru et al 2014 owing to the extremely high complexity of the system mathematical modeling of the entire ad process to predict the overall biogas production is challenging even though ad is theoretically well understood de clercq et al 2020 machine learning ml which constitutes artificial intelligence is a data driven method for modeling jordan and mitchell 2015 ml considers physical objects processes or systems as black box models from input and output measurements thereby facilitating high predictive capability based on observations rudin 2019 therefore ml based approaches may be superior to theoretical mathematical approaches when target systems possess a higher complexity or nonlinearity of the environment because of multiple input parameters de clercq et al 2020 several ml algorithms have been used to model ad however studies regarding deep learning dl are scarce xu et al 2021 dl architectures use multiple layers in the network to extract representations for the detection or classification of higher level features from the raw input he et al 2016 among several dl techniques recurrent neural networks rnns are specialized for sequence prediction problems such as temporal data williams and zipser 1989 in rnns long short term memory lstm networks can be used to learn long term temporal dependencies by solving the vanishing gradient problem of standard rnns gers et al 2002 recently the model predictability was enhanced using lstm with an attention mechanism in which essential input features are distinguishable from other less important features qin et al 2017 initially the applicability of artificial neural networks anns to ad process modeling was demonstrated using laboratory scale experimental data of measured methane ch4 production holubar et al 2002 and gaseous trace compounds h2s and nh3 strik et al 2005 meanwhile ann based ad models for predicting the methane fraction ch4 of landfill gas from field scale landfill digesters have been developed as well ozkaya et al 2007 qdais et al 2010 the ann was further integrated with genetic algorithms to optimize the digester operating parameters to yield improved ch4 for a biogas plant qdais et al 2010 in another study support vector machines svms were used to predict total ammonia nitrogen from which the superiority of svm over ann was demonstrated alejo et al 2018 furthermore least squares svm i e an improved svm was used to model the cumulative biogas production dong and chen 2019 recent studies have demonstrated the high potential of predicting methane production using advanced ml algorithms such as random forest rf extreme gradient boosting and the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system asadi et al 2020 de clercq et al 2020 long et al 2021 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 whereas only one application of dl to ad performance prediction has been reported xu et al 2021 existing studies show the high potential of ml for ad modeling nonetheless its feasibility in applying actual monitoring data at the full scale necessitates further investigation the preceding dl model for example consisted of three fully connected layers of neural networks nns xu et al 2021 such kind of nns has two major limitations first such nns are uninterpretable not providing the importance of input features in the model second a fully connected network cannot capture features from sequential data lecun et al 2015 sze et al 2017 accordingly the previous dl approach may be unsatisfactory in modeling the long term operating data of mwtps because high variability and nonlinearity in the time series are shown due to the effects of multiple process variables li et al 2020 scano et al 2014 the influencing factors of acod include the sludge inflow rate q sludge in and sludge outflow rate q sludge out of the digester temperature solid retention time srt ratio of volatile solid vs to total solid ts in sludge and pollutant mass loading from the sludge and fw leachate to the digester these factors can be utilized as input variables in ml for predicting biogas production due to these features adopting the lstm network is more suitable for modeling the acod process since being specifically designed to extract temporal features from sequential data hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 furthermore the use of lstm with the attention mechanism can identify the relative importance of each variable the ultimate goal of this study is to develop a robust acod model for the time series prediction which can be utilized for improving biogas production in an mwtp hence we propose a hybrid dl architecture hereinafter abbreviated as da lstm vsn that combines dual stage attention da lstm with variable section networks vsns da lstm and vsn are used to process continuous and discontinuous monitoring data in a time series for two years respectively the aforementioned key process variables of acod were considered as model inputs for the da lstm vsn subsequently we optimized the hyperparameters of the da lstm vsn to improve predictability the prediction accuracy of the optimized model was compared with that of standalone dl architectures da lstm and lstm which excluded discontinuous time series data a feature importance analysis was then performed by quantifying the importance of the input variables of biogas prediction to acod lastly we used the validated dl model to optimize the sludge conditions for efficient acod process 2 materials and methods 2 1 system description of mwtp a full scale mwtp located in gwangju city south korea was investigated this mwtp has a capacity of 120 000 m3 d to treat sewage with unit processes as follows scree and grit removal primary sedimentation two different activated sludge processes i e anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process and modified ludzack ettinger mle process secondary sedimentation chemically assisted sedimentation filtration and ultraviolet disinfection fig 1 a2o and mle can treat 60 000 m3 d of sewage individually in the system the a2o treatment is composed of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic stages whereas the mle treatment comprises anoxic and aerobic stages the filtration retentate as well as the supernatants from a recycled water treatment rwt and mesophilic ad are fed back to the influent sewage accompanied by the filtrates from a sludge thickening and dewatering in the rwt coagulation and flocculation are performed to treat both the dewatering filtrate from the secondary sludge and the supernatant of the fw leachate the sewage sludge is thickened digested anaerobically dehydrated and finally dried to be discarded to produce biogas the mesophilic two stage ad uses the mixed solids of the fw leachate with thickened raw and excess sludges which originate from primary and chemically assisted sedimentation tanks clarifiers respectively ad comprises two units each with an inner diameter of 19 m d an effective depth h of 9 5 m and a volume of 2 692 m3 v finally dewatering dehydrates the digested secondary and coagulation flocculation sludges at the rwt fig 1 2 2 dataset details seventeen process variables were measured for two years january 1 2016 to december 31 2017 a time series of 731 daily data points was used for model training and validation as illustrated in fig s1 in the whole dataset for the ad process 70 of the obtained data was used for training the deep learning model while the remaining 30 was used to validate test the model accuracy the training dataset was used to estimate the weights and biases that were best fitted to predict the input and output relation in accordance with the calculated errors the test dataset was used to verify the trained model and prevent the model overfitting it is noteworthy that each of the training and test datasets was separated completely from the other dataset sixteen operating parameters were used as input variables to train and validate the dl based acod process models and 16 other operating parameters were used as input variables they are typically measurable parameters at full scale mwtps in actual practice as well as influencing factors of biogas production in the digester specifically they include the q sludge in and q sludge out to the digester srt temperature vs ts ratio i e indicator of organic content in substrate mass loading of primary and secondary sedimentation sludges for biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solids ss and mass loading of the fw leachate for the bod cod ss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp as a target output variable biogas production m3 d was selected and used for model training and validation the input and output data were acquired for two years january 01 2016 to december 31 2017 and prepared for the training and validation datasets they were segregated into two time series types obtained from continuous and discontinuous measurements the former type was monitored daily using sensors and meters whereas the latter was irregularly measured one to five time a week or month via basic water quality tests in laboratory experiments in the proposed hybrid dl architecture continuous and discontinuous data of 17 features were input to da lstm and the vsn respectively 2 3 model structure three different dl models are compared herein the first model comprises only lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 based on continuous input features including the q sludge in and q sludge out temperature and srt of ad the lstm algorithm is an rnn based architecture for simulating time series data sze et al 2017 it comprises gates and memory states that control the flow of information in and out of an lstm cell the second model comprises da lstm which improves the lstm s predictability owing to the attention mechanism qin et al 2017 this model uses continuous input features that are only allowable in lstm networks the third dl model is a combination of da lstm and a vsn lim et al 2019 the vsn algorithm was used to process discontinuous input features while applying continuous input features to the da lstm the discontinuous input features are features that are not continuously recorded in the time series the discontinuous input features are the vs ts ratio of the feed sludge for acod mass loading of bod cod and ss in primary and chemically assisted sedimentation sludges fed to the digester and mass loading of bod cod ss tn and tp in the fw leachate fed to the digester two different outputs from da lstm and vsn were concatenated and then passed through a dense layer the output from this dense layer was regarded as the predicted biogas production this hybrid modeling approach enabled both continuous and discontinuous input data to be used for continuous biogas output prediction more details regarding the da lstm and vsn are provided in the following sections 2 3 1 da lstm da lstm is an attention based lstm model for the simulation of time series data qin et al 2017 it comprises two attention mechanisms followed by lstm layers fig 2 a the first attention layer also known as the input attention layer is used to rescale the input features based on their importance this rescaling amplifies the input features that are more important for prediction while decreases those that are less important the rescaled input is passed through a softmax layer the sum of all the weighted inputs is 1 after passing through the softmax layer the second attention layer is known as the temporal attention layer which selects the important lookback steps for a specified input as such the most important previous time step for a specified input can be determined finally the output of temporal attention is fed to the lstm layer for the further processing and extraction of temporal features fig 2 2 3 2 vsn the vsn algorithm used in this study is similar to that used in a temporal fusion transformer lim et al 2019 with a few modifications this network calculates the relevance and specific contributions of the input features to the output first we assigned the missing values in the discontinuous data ε with zeros fig 2b subsequently they were input to the gated residual network grn the grn estimates the importance of each discontinuous input feature via a weight calculation and it uses the exponential linear unit elu clevert et al 2015 for the activation function between dense layers followed by an add and norm layer ba et al 2016 furthermore it has a residual connection to connect the input to the output the output of the grn is fed to softmax to return the weights of discontinuous features v in which the sum is 1 we performed an element wise multiplication of v and ε to calculate the weighted discontinuous inputs ε this multiplication eliminates the effect of filling the discontinuous input data with zeros using the vsn renders the model interpretable this is because the weights calculated by the vsn quantify the importance assigned to each discontinuous feature during model prediction 2 4 hyperparameter optimization the structure and training of a neural network depend on parameters known as hyperparameters the performance of a dl model is affected significantly by the hyperparameters used including the learning rate batch size lookback steps types of activation functions and number of units in the lstm layer the learning rate determines the amount of change in the model parameters at each step the batch size determines the number of input data examples provided to the model before updating the model parameters the number of lookback steps is the amount of historical input data fed to the neural network at each step for prediction the activation function defines the type of nonlinearity applied to the output of a neural network the number of lstm units is equivalent to the number of parameters in lstm increasing the number of lstm units improves the learning capacity of lstm however it can also result in overfitting and increased computational cost to optimize the hyperparameters the minimum validation loss was used as an objective function the validation loss was calculated using the mean squared error mse between the observed and predicted values of biogas production in the validation data in this study we used the bayesian optimization algorithm boa snoek et al 2015 which is acknowledged for its good performance in the optimization of black box objective functions such as neural networks frazier 2018 in contrast to random and grid search based optimizations the boa considers the results from previously evaluated iterations after each optimization iteration new parameters are suggested based on the expected improvement ei algorithm jones et al 1998 the boa uses gaussian processes i e the posterior distribution of functions that best describe the objective function dewancker et al 2015 this posterior distribution can be improved by increasing the number of iterations because the ei algorithm explores those regions in a parameter space that is more likely to yield the minima mockus et al 1978 in this study the number of iterations for the optimized hyperparameters was set to 50 for the dl based models 2 5 model evaluation the dl model was trained using the mse as a loss function subsequently it was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination r 2 normalized root mean square error nrmse and mean absolute error mae between the observed and predicted values of biogas production the equations used to calculate these performance metrics are as follows 1 mse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 2 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n 3 nrmse rmse o max o min 4 r 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 5 mae i 1 n p i o i n where n is the number of data points pi is the predicted value oi is the observed value o max and o min are the maximum and minimum values observed respectively o and p are the mean of the observed and predicted values respectively 2 6 feature importance evaluation when using ml as a black box model the significance of the input features in predicting the outputs is difficult to explain murdoch et al 2019 therefore feature importance analysis was performed as it facilitates the quantitative assessment of the importance of input variables on output prediction de clercq et al 2020 long et al 2021 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 2 6 1 continuous input features to estimate the sensitivity of continuous input features we performed a functional analysis of variance anova hutter et al 2014 the fanova algorithm enabled us to analyze the variation in the model output with respect to the changed input we used lstm as a model and trained it using only continuous input features i e q sludge in q sludge out sludge temperature tempad and sludge retention time srtad fig 3 a we prepared 16 different combinations of these four input features and then recorded the model response i e validation loss for each input combination a separate lstm was trained for each input combination and its minimum loss was used as the model output the lstm model input combinations and their corresponding outputs are represented as f x and y respectively as shown in fig 3a the rf algorithm was trained using x and y data subsequently the tree of the trained rf was utilized in the fanova algorithm to obtain the mean μx and standard deviation σx of the input data x finally the relative importance of each input variable was calculated using the fraction of variance f u fig 3 2 6 2 discontinuous input features the sensitivity of the discontinuous input features was estimated based on the calculated weights in the vsn section 2 3 1 these weights were calculated for each training and test example for all discontinuous input features and for each lookback step fig 3b therefore these weights indicate the importance of each discontinuous input feature with respect to the lookback step for each example the total importance of each input feature xi was determined by calculating the mean importance of xi for all examples n 2 7 model based process optimization the usefulness of our approach was demonstrated by showing how the proposed model can be used for biogas production enhancement for this purpose we optimized the amount of the sludge inflow and outflow in ad denoted as q sludge in and q sludge out respectively the dl based model already validated in this study was used for the biogas prediction by varying q sludge in and q sludge out to consider srt change resulting from the variable sludge amount in ad we built a categorical boosting catboost based ml model prokhorenkova et al 2017 to predict srt this model used q sludge in and q sludge out as input and its resultant output i e srt was then inputted to the dl based model the catboost model was robust with a high accuracy of r2 0 94 fig s2 since being trained validated and tested using 64 jan 2016 apr 2017 16 may 2016 aug 2017 and 20 sep 2017 jan 2018 of the measurement data respectively during the optimization of q sludge in and q sludge out new values were selected randomly within their upper and lower fences as statistically analyzed afterward fig 4 q sludge in was 155 333 m3 d and q sludge out was 112 324 m3 d we ran the optimization for 50 000 iterations to maintain the predicted biogas production close to 1400 m3 d which could significantly improve the total biogas quantity measured in jan 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistical variation in process variables for acod the monitoring data were characterized using boxplots to clearly describe the features of an acod dataset based on a set of descriptive statistics including the median i e the middle value upper and lower quartiles 75th and 25th percentiles respectively and sample maximum and minimum i e the largest and smallest observations respectively except for outliers the median value of biogas production presented as a red line was 1391 5 m3 d indicating that the values of 50 of the 731 data points in this study were greater than the abovementioned value fig 4a furthermore the boxplot for biogas production show that the upper and lower quartiles were 1771 5 and 958 6 m3 d respectively the median q sludge in and q sludge out were 246 and 215 m3 d respectively fig 4b the median values of ad temperature and srt were 34 8 c and 23 1 d respectively fig 4c the inflow sludge indicates a median value of 0 75 for the vs ts ratio fig 4d the primary sedimentation sludge indicates that the median mass loadings for the bod cod and ss were 149 1 51 4 and 142 7 kg d respectively fig 4e the chemically assisted sedimentation sludge shows a considerably lower mass loading for the bod 20 3 kg d cod 21 1 kg d and ss 27 4 kg d compared with those for the primary sedimentation sludge fig 4f fw leachate is a crucial component for determining biogas production because it can supplement biodegradable organic materials to the microorganisms during acod therefore the mass loadings of bod cod ss tn and tp were quantified when the fw leachate was fed to the digester their median mass loadings were 1036 4 kg d bod 650 6 kg d cod 1956 kg d ss 180 7 kg d tn and 26 5 kg d tp fig 4g and h fig 4 3 2 hyperparameter optimization for dl models tuning the hyperparameters of dl models is crucial for improving the model accuracy in the present study the hyperparameters were optimized as follows batch size 8 128 lookback 6 15 learning rate 10 7 10 3 number of lstm units for either the encoder or decoder 8 256 the types of activation functions for the encoder and decoder included the relu tanh elu and none table 1 summarizes the optimized hyperparameters for maximizing the accuracy of the three dl models for da lstm vsn the optimum batch size lookback and learning rate were 16 13 and 5 3 10 4 respectively the numbers of lstm units were 69 encoder and 78 decoder the activation functions that yielded the best results were none encoder tanh decoder and relu vsn for da lstm the batch size lookback and learning rate were 8 10 and 2 3 10 4 respectively whereas the activation functions for the encoder and decoder were optimal similar to those of the da lstn and vsn hybrid models in comparison with the preceding model da lstm required fewer lstm units i e 64 encoder and 30 decoder this can be explained by its lower complexity as it uses only continuous time series data for four input variables except for the discontinuous data for 12 input variables in the weight matrix calculation by contrast the number of optimized hyperparameters for the standard lstm were much higher than those of the preceding two models and relu was the best activation function for lstm table 1 3 3 model training and validation 3 3 1 learning curves a comparison of the learning curves for the training and validation datasets for the three dl models is shown in fig 5 the learning behavior was monitored during model training by recording the training and validation loss mse after each training epoch an epoch indicates the number of passes for the entire training dataset after each training epoch the mean mse values for all the training examples were measured subsequently the model performance was determined based on the mse calculation of the validation data training and validation losses were recorded after each training epoch in general both the training and validation losses decreased more rapidly in the early epochs but stabilized after certain epochs therefore we employed the early stopping criteria to apply the optimal number of epochs for training a model raskutti et al 2014 these optimal epoch criteria allowed our dl models to be trained until the validation loss decreased when the validation loss stopped decreasing for consecutive epochs we stopped the training even when the training loss decreased this is because the model was overfitting and not generalizing resulting in a reduced training loss without a decrease in the validation loss chollet 2018 training for three dl models i e da lstm vsn da lstm and standard lstm was performed for 285 281 and 235 epochs respectively based on the principle of avoiding model overfitting fig 5 the results show that the first two dl models were stably trained and their validation losses plateaued within 80 epochs fig 5a and b by contrast the training loss of lstm decreased significantly even after the 235th epoch fig 5c hence we stopped the training process at 140 epochs at which the minimum validation loss was achieved this indicates no further decline in the validation loss for the next 100 epochs the validation loss curve of da lstm vsn varied slightly with the epoch fig 5a whereas that of lstm fluctuated significantly with the epoch fig 5c these noisy curves can be incurred by the larger batch sizes optimized at 16 for da lstm vsn and 64 for lstm compared with that of da lstm at 8 in particular the optimized lstm model had a batch size of 64 for 200 validation examples thereby resulting in only four validation batches for one epoch because the loss was averaged for all the examples in one epoch we observed a greater variation in the validation loss owing to the smaller number of validation batches for lstm after the training was completed we selected the model with the minimum validation loss to perform predictions fig 5 3 3 2 model validation once the best model was selected via training the trained model was used and its predictability was evaluated based on a validation dataset the predicted and observed biogas productions for the three dl based models were compared using regression plots as well as time series plots fig 6 the values of the performance metrics for the training and validation data for the three dl based models are listed in table 2 as shown the models performances for the training data were generally better than that for the validation data although overfitting can occur when the training performance is better than the validation performance it can be avoided by employing an early stopping mechanism fig 6 when only continuous input features were used the lstm model yielded a low prediction accuracy r2 0 38 nrmse 0 14 that was much lower than that of the da lstm model r2 0 68 nrmse 0 10 table 2 the predictions from the lstm model were primarily centered around a mean value and could not capture the dynamic fluctuations in the time series biogas production fig 6c the lstm model rarely followed peaks in biogas productions exceeding 2000 m3 d and less than 1000 m3 d as such a high mae value was observed in the lstm model table 2 by contrast the da lstm demonstrated a considerable improvement in predictability for highly variable biogas production by incorporating the attention mechanism fig 6b this suggests that a simple lstm network is unsatisfactory for describing dynamic fluctuations in biogas production particularly when using actual acod data from full scale mwtps nonetheless such a deficiency in lstm can be compensated by using the attention mechanism the input and temporal attention in da lstsm imposes greater weights on input features that are more relevant to loss value reduction for improving model performance consequently da lstm can select the important features and discard irrelevant ones based on different extents of weights in the network table 2 the da lstm prediction was further improved by incorporating it with a vsn to account for discontinuous input features in this hybrid dl architecture the vsn selects the relevant features from the discontinuous input data thereby supporting the model prediction it is noteworthy that discontinuous input features represent the sludge characteristics for the acod process such as the mass loading of pollutants in the fw leachate in this study see section 2 2 therefore da lstm vsn can describe more peaks than da lstm particularly in regions containing outliers 2581 and 176 m3 d fig 6a the r 2 increased to 0 76 from 0 68 once the discontinuous input features were considered the addition of the vsn to da lstm not only improved the model performance but also provided the rationale for proposing a hybrid dl architecture for more realistic process modeling the biogas production in the digester was affected by acod parameters e g the characteristics of the inflow sludge and fw leachate therefore its realistic prediction is likely to depend significantly on the discontinuous variables 3 4 identification of input feature importance feature importance analysis can provide insights into the effects of the operating parameters of acod on the prediction of biogas production when using the da lstm vsn model in this study the relative importance of the input variables to the model accuracy was investigated fig 7 among the four continuous time series input variables q sludge out demonstrated the greatest impact 28 on the ad biogas prediction followed by q sludge in 27 fig 7a the srtad and tempad exhibited relatively lower importance hence they were ranked third 25 and fourth 21 respectively the difference in the relative importance of these four input variables was slight i e within 7 whereas that for the discontinuous variables was great i e up to 99 3 fig 7b the results reveal that biogas prediction was highly affected by the vs ts ratio and the input variables associated with the fw leachate in particular the first two variables ml ss fw and vs ts were the most influential factors with a relative importance of 34 this is because the fw leachate supplied a significantly larger portion of the ts fed to the acod process of the mwtp system compared with the primary and excess sludges based on the results reported in section 3 1 the ss mass loading for the fw leachate was 13 7 and 71 4 times higher than those for the primary and excess sludges respectively the primary sludge generally contained more biodegradable organics than the excess sludge however its organic source supply to the investigated digester would likely be insufficient for biogas production as well as that of the excess sludge this implies that the mwtp must enhance both the quality and quantity of the primary sludge supplied to the digester for an increased biogas production meanwhile the relative importance values of ml bod fw ml tn fw ml tp fw and ml cod fw were 7 1 5 7 5 3 and 4 6 respectively it is noteworthy that the ps and cs associated variables imposed a marginal effect 1 2 on biogas prediction this may be because the fw leachate can possess a high content of biodegradable organics as a microbe substrate particularly as compared with the excess sludge from the chemically assisted sedimentation additionally the results suggest that the proposed dl method can be used as an interpretable acod model fig 7 3 5 improved biogas production this study demonstrates the successful application of the dl based model to the acod process optimization fig 8 we used the extra test data measured in jan 2018 which was excluded in the previous sections the actual measurements of biogas production were compared with the optimized predictions fig 8a the predicted result tended to produce biogas closer to a target value of 1400 m3 d than the actual measurements the bar chart of this figure shows the differential of biogas productions between the measured and optimized cases which are depicted in the orange and blue bars respectively for 27 days of operation in acod the diminished biogas production below the target level could be improved significantly by regulating the sludge inflow and outflow and srt based on the optimized predictions figs 8b d under the optimized sludge conditions the original biogas productivity increased by 20 i e 6375 8 m3 in total this improvement would be attributed to the predicted srt values mainly within the range of 20 30 days which could be optimal for mesophilic ad fig 8d in contrast with the predictions the measured srt values were below 20 days frequently in the latter half of jan 2018 therefore these results confirm that the dl model developed in this study can be helpful for mwtp operators to control sludge values to maintain the biogas production in the acod process fig 8 3 6 implications of present study an rnn based dl method is robust for forecasting problems involving either spatial or temporal sequence data lipton et al 2015 hence rnn based models which are proposed herein can be beneficial for the time series prediction of biogas production fig 6 and optimization of acod process fig 8 using monitoring data in a full scale mwtp it is noteworthy that rnns are affected by data processing with discontinuous sequences of input features caused by missing values or outlier removal che et al 2018 lipton et al 2016 this is attributed to the intrinsic architecture which utilizes prior sequence data to extract parametric information to predict the current state of variables lipton et al 2016 therefore the selection of key process variables as rnn input features may be limited owing to the difficulty in acquiring all variable data at the same timestep intervals or in performing complete measurements without overlooking the timesteps some variables can be measured promptly using in situ sensors and meters for other variables time consuming measurements via ex situ experiments performed in a laboratory using analytical equipment are necessitated in addition many typically used datasets retain missing or abnormal values in a few timesteps incurred by equipment failures or measurement errors little and rubin 2019 the absence of partial sequence data can be compensated by performing a listwise deletion or substituting an estimated value by the single mean regression stochastic interpolation k nearest neighbors and multiple imputations nonetheless the listwise deletion can either degrade the model accuracy or render the model unpractical for use in actual mwtps even though imputation methods can be used it may still be challenging to sufficiently capture the complex correlations of variables che et al 2018 or compensate for the long term gaps overlooked in the time series since they are measured a few times a week or a month as shown in section 3 1 therefore the hybrid dl architecture proposed herein is promising for successfully training rnn based models even when using raw datasets unprocessed with either missing value imputation or outlier removal which are attributed to the vsn or attention mechanism respectively 4 conclusion the data driven dl approach is useful for modeling complex biological processes the biogas productivity of acod can be affected by various factors originating from not only mwtp waste sludge but also other organic waste sources as such it can indicate high variability over time during long term operations therefore we proposed rnn based dl algorithms to develop a robust acod model for biogas prediction the main conclusions of the present study are as follows the da lstm based acod models were effectively trained via hyperparameter optimization without overfitting and successfully validated using practically measurable process data acquired in two years from a local mwtp gwangju city south korea the proposed hybrid architecture da lstm vsn enabled the acod model to use both continuous daily or discontinuous one to five times a week or month time series data to model a complex acod process with high accuracy the rnn based dl models required an attention mechanism and discontinuous input data assimilation using a vsn the attention based dl models da lstm and da lstm vsn yielded better prediction performance r2 0 68 and 0 76 respectively compared with the standard lstm model r2 0 38 the contribution of the input variables to biogas prediction was analyzed the results revealed that q sludge out was of the highest importance followed by q sludge in srt and temperature in addition the relative importance results for the discontinuous input features revealed that the vs ts ratio and fw leachate associated variables were more significant for biogas prediction than the other variables associated with the primary and chemically assisted sedimentation sludges the optimization of the acod process was viable with the use of the validated dl based model by finding the optimal conditions for the sludge inflow and outflow and srt in which the biogas production predicted could be increased declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

16606,extracellular polymeric substances eps are biopolymers that can be recovered from excess sludge which could contribute to a more sustainable wastewater treatment plant wwtp operation an example is alginate like extracellular polymers ale contained in the biopolymers could be a potential resource with a highly added value eps extraction for ale from aerobic granules sludge ags has already been well studied and applied in the netherlands on the other hand there is little attention to the recovery of biopolymers from conventional activated sludge cas in this study flocculent sludge from eight cas wwtps in china was collected and their eps biopolymers were extracted to investigate their recovery potential chemical physical properties and limiting factors the results revealed that the biopolymers extracted and purified from cas ranged from 90 to 190 mg g vss the compositional characteristics of the biopolymers were observed by ft ir 3d eem and uv visible spectra demonstrating some differences in the composition and property of the biopolymers from the different wwtps the biopolymers had a similarity of about 60 to a commercial alginate with respect to chemical functional groups and the alginate equivalent was 400 mg g biopolymers moreover the biopolymers consisted of poly guluronic acid blocks 20 30 and poly guluronic acid mannuronic acid blocks 8 28 and the ionic hydrogel formation tests indicated that condensed beads were immediately formed once the drops of the biopolymers came in contact with cacl2 solution these results demonstrated that the biopolymers extracted had a relatively high gel forming capacity and might also have a potential application as commercial biopolymers furthermore the factors influencing the biopolymers formation such as influent substrate nutrient content and microbial community and the related mechanisms were investigated among them increasing soluble organics scod content and low nutrient content c n p in the influent could promote the biopolymers formation also different bacteria in bnr processes might have positive or negative effects on the biopolymers formation in conclusion the diversity and abundance of bacteria were identified to be a crucial and decisive factor controlling biopolymers extraction and composition graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words extracellular biopolymers alginate like extracellular polymers ale conventional activated sludge cas extraction gel forming capacity microbial community 1 introduction resource recovery from wastewater is currently emphasized to develop a sustainable wastewater treatment system in this context excess sludge can be considered a potential resource for recovering highly added value products such as phosphate cellulose bioplastics biopolymers etc van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 li et al 2015 activated sludge flocs are actually a matrix of bacterial cells embedded in extracellular polymeric substance eps the eps accounts for about 10 40 of the total dry weight of activated sludge basuvara et al 2015 eps mainly consists of polysaccharides proteins lipids nucleic acids and humic substances felz et al 2016 boltz et al 2017 the eps substances embed the microcolonies and form a matrix in which these microcolonies and single cells are embedded by flocculation various physical and biochemical interactions such as electrostatic force hydrogen bonding or ionic bonds form the mechanisms for the floc formation and stability basuvaraj et al 2015 mahendran et al 2012 eps is considered as the protective matrix for environmental pressures mechanical stability external heavy metals and toxic compounds and also as the storage of carbon or water sheng et al 2010 schambeck et al 2020 the biopolymers in the matrix form a unique structure that can be recovered for potential highly valuable biomaterials sheng et al 2010 more et al 2014 much attention on recovering the biopolymers has focussed on alginate like extracellular polymers ale from aerobic granular sludge ags lin et al 2015 2018 xue et al 2019 ale is a biopolymer that can be used in the food paper textile medical and construction industry and also in agriculture and horticulture rehm 2010 lin et al 2015 2018 xue et al 2019 felz et al 2020 kim et al 2020 lin et al 2015 have evaluated the performance of ale extracted and purified from ags as non flammable surface coating and kim et al 2020 showed that ale could comply with the aviation requirements for aircraft interiors by the federal aviation regulations far currently the extraction of the eps biopolymers from ags has been scaled up to demonstration scale in an installation in zutphen the netherlands because of its unique properties the biopolymer ale has been branded kaumera kaumera recovery from ags is moving towards a commercial market introduction however according to the existing studies the content of eps from conventional activated sludge cas is only 7 19 vss lin et al 2010 2013 yang et al 2014 schambeck et al 2020 which is lower than that of ags 35 1 1 9 ss lin et al 2010 kim et al 2020 on the other hand the total amount of the excess sludge in conventional wwtps is huge for example there was more than 60 million t a 80 moisture content of excess sludge from cas in china in 2019 moreover handling excess sludge accounts for nearly a half of the total investment and operation costs of wwtps kroiss 2004 if the eps recovery could be applied as high value biopolymers like ale from ags it could offset some the costs of handling sludge and also make wwtps more sustainable towards the circular economy van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 li et al 2015 hao et al 2019 conversely there have been relatively few studies on recovering extracellular biopolymers from cas while the existing studies on eps from cas mostly focused on identifying and evaluating their roles in biological nutrient removal and sludge disposal processes sheng et al 2010 seviour et al 2019 the economic value of eps from cas seems largely ignored the eps recovery from cas could give a large potential for extraction and application for this reason a study was initiated to investigate eps biopolymers recovery from cas towards ale based on the excess sludge from eight cas wwtps from different regions of china eps biopolymers were extracted and purified by the previous methods felz et al 2016 2019 to obtain the yield and the purity of ale then the amounts and compositions of ale were investigated and evaluated by comparing with kaumera ale from ags next the physical and chemical properties of the biopolymers ale were analysed to clarify their performance gaps relative to commercial alginate finally the influences and related mechanisms of such factors as substrate and nutrient content in influent were summarized to provide some possible technical strategies for increasing the eps biopolymers production in cas 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge characteristics flocculent excess sludge was collected from eight wwtps wwtp 1 8 the conventional biological nutrient removal processes for municipal wastewater in different regions of china the locations and flocculent excess sludge characteristics were listed in table s1 the average influent quality and other detailed information are listed in table 1 the collected flocculent sludge was concentrated by a 0 15 mm filter sieved and then stored in a refrigerator 4 c for use 2 2 extraction protocols extracellular biopolymers were extracted by the method of ale as described by felz et al 2016 and 2019 and the detailed procedure was shown in fig s2 the samples of washed and centrifuged excess sludge were put into baffled flasks na2co3 in the demineralized water up to the concentration of 0 5 w v was added to the sludge samples hence the total volume of the mixture was kept at 400 ml with mlss 30 g l the flasks were then stirred for 35 min at 80 c in a water bath and finally centrifuged at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min supernatants were collected and pellets for baffling were removed respectively ph of the supernatants was adjusted to 2 2 with 1 m hcl for alginate purification then the acidified supernatants were again centrifuged at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min the pellets containing ale was collected and re dissolved with 1 m naoh at ph 8 5 the dissolved biopolymers were dialyzed for 24 h in a dialysis bag with a molecular weight cut off of 3 5 kda to remove the solubilized ions finally the samples were frozen at 50 c and then freeze dried in freeze drier lin et al 2010 extracellular biopolymers extracted from ags by the same methods were identified to be similar to the commercial alginate lin et al 2010 felz et al 2019 therefore in this study biopolymers samples extracted from eight different wwtps excess sludge were labelled as ale 1 to ale 8 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemical analysis analyzing polysaccharide ps was based on the conceptual framework proposed by dubois et al 1956 with a phenol sulfuric acid assay with both d glucose moreover ale was the main structural biopolymers in eps matrix and the commercial alginate extracted from brown algae was chosen as the standard to evaluate the amount of alginate equivalents in biopolymers also with a phenol sulfuric acid assay lin et al 2010 felz et al 2019 protein pn content was prepared according to the procedure of lorry assay with bovine serum albumin used as the standard lowry et al 1951 ts total solid vs volatile solids mlss mixed liquor suspended solids mlvss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids and ph were detected according to the standard methods apha 2012 total organic carbon toc was determined with a toc analyzer vario total organic carbon analyzer dksh company in swiss the fractionations of the isolated ale including a family of copolymers comprised of mannuronic acid m and guluronic acid g units arranged in an irregular block pattern of varying proportions of gg mg and mm blocks were detected by the methods of partial acid hydrolysis as described in lin et al 2013 moreover ionic hydrogel formation was tested with 2 5 w v cacl2 following the procedure as described in lin et al 2013 and felz et al 2016 a one way anova was used to estimate the difference between excess sludge from different wwtps the significance level at 95 were based on the data obtained from the duplicated experiments on the other hand the correlation coefficient r2 between different independent variables was also analyzed in this study 2 3 2 spectroscopic analysis other characterizations of biopolymers were detected by the uv visible absorbance measurements from 800 to 200 nm using an agilent cary 5000 uv vis nir spectrophotometer resolution 1 0 nm suva254 has a positive correlation with aromaticity of ale while the indexes of e2 e3 e2 e4 and e4 e6 have a negative correlation with the humification degree molecular size and condensation polak et al 2007 liu et al 2019 moreover suva260 has a positive correlation with hydrophobicity of substances suva254 and suva260 were obtained using uv vis absorbance at 254 nm and 260 nm respectively and then the values were normalized per mg toc of the sample solutions weishaar et al 2003 e2 e3 e2 e4 and e4 e6 refer to the uv visible absorbance ratio at 250 and 365 nm ratio at 240 and 420 and ratio at 465 and 665 nm respectively the functional groups were analyzed by a thermo fisher fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir by which specific structures and chemical functional groups can be easily evaluated the spectra of commercial sodium alginate extracted from brown algae viscosity 4 12 cp 1 in h2o was also recorded as the standard to estimate of the similarity of different biopolymers from the commercial alginate by the ft ir software li et al 2019 the ft ir spectra of biopolymers in kbr pellets 98 mg kbr 2 mg sample were recorded in at the wavenumber of 4000 400 cm 1 three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy was applied for identify fluorescent compounds contained in biopolymers sheng and yu 2006 in this study eem spectra were collected with subsequent scanning emission em spectra from 220 to 550 nm at 1 nm increment by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 200 to 500 nm at 5 nm increments ex and em slits were maintained at 5 nm and the scanning speed was set at 1200 nm min for all the measurements the spectrum of distilled water was recorded as the blank the statistical analysis of 3d eem data was performed using the matlab software 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction potentials the amounts of extracellular biopolymers extracted from different flocculent sludge wwtp 1 8 are shown in fig 1 wwtp 3 had the lowest yield of the biopolymers 92 9 3 3 mg g vss about half as compared to the highest yield from wwtp 1 187 9 12 3 mg g vss the amounts of the biopolymers ranged from 90 to 190 mg g vss 9 19 vss interestingly the biopolymer yields are comparable to those analyzed in the previous studies with the same extraction methods e g 187 94 mg ale g vss with municipal wastewater schambeck et al 2020 100 150 mg ale g vss with propionate used as the only carbon source yang et al 2014 72 6 mg ale g vss from aerobic excess sludge cas lin et al 2013 there is a certain gap on the extracted biopolymers amount between cas and ags cultured with sodium acetate as the carbon source 31 1 6 ss lin et al 2008 but the difference becomes less when compared with ags fed with mixed wastewater approximately 25 of slaughterhouse wastewater discharged in the sewage 160 4 mg g vss lin et al 2010 thus extracellular biopolymers extracted from cas seem to offer a similar potential as from ags in a quantitative sense 3 2 evaluation of alginate like extracellular polymers ale in extracellular biopolymers 3 2 1 alginate equivalents ale are the main structural component in extracellular biopolymers and thus determine the functionalities of the recovered materials therefore the commercial alginate was chosen as the standard to evaluate the amount of alginate equivalents in biopolymers lin et al 2010 the results are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 ale 3 and ale 8 were the highest ones of the alginate equivalents around 525 mg g ale while as ale 6 was the lowest one about 420 4 5 7 mg g ale the alginate equivalents relative to the commercial alginate 42 52 for the ale from the flocculent sludge of cas is similar as reported to the ale extracted from ags ranging from 48 53 lin et al 2010 3 2 2 gel forming capacity of the biopolymers alginate is able to form a gel matrix due to three different kinds of blocks including gg mg and mm blocks they are distributed randomly in the molecular chain of alginate which has its specific property and result in the different fine chemical structure their proportion distribution and length determine the chemical and physical properties of alginate molecules gg blocks have a higher affinity towards divalent cations than the other two blocks and the order of gel forming capability of the three blocks is mm blocks mg blocks gg blocks smidrød 1974 in this study the amount of mannuronic acid m and guluronic acid g poly units in the biopolymers were tested to evaluate the gel forming capacity of the biopolymers lin et al 2013 felz et al 2016 the results fig 3 indicated that the recovery yield of blocks from the biopolymers were at 40 60 with about 20 30 gg blocks and 8 28 mg blocks in the chemical structure of all the biopolymers the gg rich ale flocs benefited the flocculent sludge with the formation of a compact gel structure these results are consistent with the analysis of alginate equivalent and indicate that ale was one part of the important structural biopolymers moreover the monomer ratios of g m of the biopolymers from different flocculent sludge was similar at about 2 0 3 5 ionic hydrogel formation tests revealed that ca2 ale beads displayed the good and similar stabilities between different biopolymers which demonstrated that there was a hydrogel that got stabilized by divalent ions similar as the gel formation with alginate 3 2 3 similarity of functional groups to the commercial alginate the functional groups bonds in the biopolymers are the critical part reflecting the primary chemical properties of organics and also the effective parameters to evaluate the possible applications as the substitute for the commercial alginate therefore functional groups were measured and the results are shown in fig 4 the main peaks and characters of functional groups contained in the biopolymers are listed in table s3 jia et al 2017 niu et al 2016 yin et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 based on fig 4 the main structure of biopolymers ale varied from different wwtps table s3 also listed the obvious difference of band assignments for the ft ir spectral features of different extracellular biopolymers among them ale 3 4 and 7 should belong to polysaccharide dominated structures in contrast ale 2 5 6 and 8 had more protein like chemical substances moreover the commercial alginate was used as the standard substance to evaluate the similarity of functional groups by ft ir software and the results are shown in table 2 no significant difference in the spectra was found and the quantitative similarity of chemical functional groups reached up to 60 83 above all due to the above results of chemical structure and alginate equivalents the biopolymers extracted from the flocculent sludge seem to have the similar characters as compared to the commercial alginate 3 3 characterization of compositions 3 3 1 protein and polysaccharide as described above the extracted biopolymers were ale which contained a variety of complex organic substances such as glycoproteins polysaccharides proteins and humic substances these substances are enmeshed with each other and can form unique structures felz et al 2019 further characterization of the composition was needed to evaluate the specific property of the biopolymers as shown in fig 5 the extracellular polysaccharide ps fraction in ale 8 was the lowest around 75 1 8 8 mg g ale while ale 1 showed the highest fraction around 130 6 3 0 mg g ale moreover ps in the other biopolymers ranged from 105 to 120 mg g ale the extracellular protein pn is also shown in fig 5 also pn varied significantly between different biopolymer samples both ps and pn analysis results corresponded to the indication of functional groups for polysaccharides and protein as observed from ft ir spectra fig 4 these results demonstrated that different environmental or operational parameters like influent quality substrate temperature solid retention time etc might have a strong influence on the composition of the biopolymers from flocculent sludge the detailed explanation is followed below the different structures and fractions of pn and ps contribute to varied chemical properties and functions some studies have noted the importance of the ratio of pn to ps pn ps for evaluating composition and properties of organics mahendran et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 the pn ps ratio of eps extracted from ags were at around 3 3 while anaerobic granules are reported to have a pn ps ratio of 4 2 mahendran et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 these values are higher than those reported for floc 1 6 and biofilms 1 2 mahendran et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 a higher pn ps ratio denotes more extracellular protein substances which has been suggested as important for sludge granulation and stability maintenance park et al 2008 zhu et al 2012 in this study pn ps were also analyzed and the results are shown in fig 5 ale 8 and ale 6 had the highest pn ps at nearly 4 5 the pn ps ratio of the ale extracted from the flocs of flocculent sludge ranged from 3 0 to 4 5 except for ale 3 1 9 the ratios were clearly higher than that of eps reported before for flocculent sludge but they are close to that of the ale extracted from ags mahendran et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 the higher pn ps ratio might be attributed to the different extraction protocol the extraction protocol for ale has been developed in order to solubilize the structural eps felz et al 2016 whereas many previous used extraction methods did not really solubilize all eps seviour et al 2019 above all these results provided some important insights in evaluating the biopolymers extracted from the flocs of cas and comparing it with the ale extracted from ags in composition characterization and properties 3 3 2 volatile solids vs yield and ash content some previous studies have reported that the ale extracted from ags contains not only organic components but also inorganic components up to 5 20 depending on different extraction protocols felz et al 2016 total organic carbon toc including the organics of ps pn humic substances lipids and so on can indirectly represent the organic proportions of biopolymers therefore toc was used to evaluate the vs yield and ash content of the biopolymers the results are shown in fig 6 the toc of ale 3 was relatively lower only 279 4 16 7 mg c g ale which was consistent with the low content of both pn and ps moreover toc of ale 6 was also lower 350 0 5 6 mg c g ale but the sum of ps and pn was as high as 57 7 on the contrary toc of ale 4 was at the highest level 533 0 19 2 mg c g ale but the total content of ps and pn was not at the highest level only 48 8 ale 6 was speculated to contain a larger proportion of organic matter including ps and pn while as ale 4 contained a larger proportion of humic substances and other organics rather than ps and pn 3 4 spectral analysis for physical and chemical properties 3 4 1 uv visible spectroscopy the special wavelengths in the uv visible spectra are generally seen as the parameter strongly related to the degree of humification aliphatic and aromatic compounds which reflects the chemical structure of biopolymers stability weishaar et al 2003 polak et al 2007 liu et al 2019 the results of uv spectra analysis of the biopolymers samples are shown in fig s4 based on the evaluation of these indexes as described in the section 2 3 3 spectroscopic analysis the difference of the biopolymers was obvious as analyzed below i analysis of humification show that ale 4 contained more stable compounds with higher molecules and also higher degree of humification and condensation as for the other biopolymers the index of e2 e3 4 5 5 0 e4 e6 6 0 and e2 e4 5 8 indicates that the content of aliphatic compounds was relatively high ii results of aromatics suggest that ale 1 and ale 3 contained more aromatic substances with higher level of unsaturation while ale 8 contained less aromatics iii evaluation of hydrophobicity indicate that ale 1 had a higher proportion of hydrophobic components followed by ale 3 ale 4 and ale 5 and ale 8 lower hydrophobicity is strongly associated with higher solubilities and instabilities of gel forming in water in summary chemical structure of the ale 4 showed the most humified structure and stable formation on the other hand ale 1 ale 2 ale 7 and ale 8 demonstrated different humified or aromatized structures but did not differ significantly from each other different parameters such as influent quality and operational conditions might change the biopolymers yield and composition but also have some effect on their chemical and physical structures 3 4 2 3d eem spectroscopy three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectroscopy was used to further characterize the composition of the biopolymers the results are shown in fig 7 according to the corresponding excitation ex and emission em wavelengths the fluorescence regions are divided into flu ⅰ flu ⅴ among them flu ⅰ and flu ⅱ indicate aromatic protein like substances aromatic protein ⅰ and ⅱ respectively flu ⅳ represents soluble microbial by product like substances smps flu iii and flu v include fulvic acid like and humic acid like organics dai et al 2018 in fig 7 there is the clear peaks of fluorescent substances at flu ⅳ for ale 2 8 which indicates that biopolymers contained more smps in contrast ale 1 revealed less smps which was basically consistent with the relatively higher alginate equivalent in ale 1 as concluded in section 3 2 ale 4 meant obvious absorbance peaks at flu iii and flu v which indicates that it contained the higher contents of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances which contributed to a higher concentration of toc volatile solids instead of ps and pn as described in section 3 3 2 moreover the quantitative analysis of fluorescence density is shown in fig s5 the main fluorescent substances contained in the biopolymers were varied from others which implies that chemical properties of the biopolymers are relatively different 4 factors limiting biopolymers formation obviously extracting biopolymers from the flocs of cas is attractive as a potential substitute for commercial biopolymers however there was still the difference on extracted biopolymers amount and its physical and or chemical properties from cas in different wwtps and also comparing with ags as indicated above thus it is necessary to further analyze the factors causing the difference and limitation including influent substrates nutrient content and microbial community to figure out the related mechanisms of biopolymers formation and associated properties 4 1 influent substrate as shown in table 1 and fig s6 scod tcod ratio were different p 0 05 from different wwtps among them wwtp 3 had a low scod tcod ratio about 27 7 due to the influent containing 50 industrial wastewater interestingly wwtp 3 indicated the lowest biopolymers content around 92 9 3 3 mg g vss the same phenomenon also occurred in wwtp 7 in which the influent scod tcod was 25 2 also resulting in a relatively low level of biopolymers extraction 115 3 mg g vss on the other hand wwtp 1 had the highest content of the biopolymers up to 187 9 mg g vss corresponding to a highest influent scod tcod ratio 45 9 therefore it could be concluded that the soluble organics scod content in the influent could affect the biopolymers formation to an extent a high scod content would enhance the biopolymers formation these relationships may partly be explained by the fact that higher soluble organics could benefit microbes for accelerating metabolic processes and thus promote the secretion of metabolites a main origin of extracellular biopolymers this explanation was also supported by yang et al 2014 who claimed that organic loading was related to the formation of biopolymers increasing soluble organics would stimulate granules to secrete more extracellular cyclic diguanylate monophosphate c di gmp a well conserved second messenger in bacteria that promotes granules formation and regulates high glycans formation and contribute to further secretion of the biopolymers ross et al 1987 jiang 2011 yang et al 2014 in addition peng et al 2012 also held that increasing the influent cod led to the decrease of the ps content in eps an exceptional case occurred for wwtp 2 in which the influent scod tcod was as low as 28 1 but its biopolymers extraction was as high as 154 5 mg g vss it is thus hypothesized that there might be other factors affecting the ale information moreover the high degree of humification of ale 4 was caused by the low influent cod concentration and a long srt in wwtp 4 which resulted to the serious endogenous metabolism of flocs and thus to produce more humic acid like substances and soluble microbial by product like substances as a result the degree of humification of biopolymers was associated 4 2 nutrient content c n p it has been known that the yield of eps depends heavily on the influent nutrient content c n p wang et al 2014 sanin and durmaz 2003 liu et al 2006 hoa et al 2003 therefore the linear correlation between biopolymers and influent c n p 0 05 c p p 0 05 was analyzed and the results are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the biopolymers extraction gradually increased along with decreasing c n and or c p and the correlation coefficient between c n and ale was at r2 0 71 and c p at r2 0 72 there are several possible explanations for these results i external unfavorable surroundings low c n or c p high n p load for bacteria leading to a low activity of metabolisms but promoting more extracellular biopolymers secretion including exoenzymes as protective layers ii cells disintegration and autolysis would also release intracellular substances from cells and thus increase the content of ps and pn in the biopolymers wang et al 2014 sanin and durmaz 2003 liu et al 2006 hoa et al 2003 shortly reducing carbon source or increasing the nutrient content n or p in influent lower ratio of c n p could be speculated to increase the biopolymers formation in flocs on the other hand some researches revealed that c n 20 resulted in the high content of ps and thus contributed to increase biopolymers wang et al 2014 sanin and durmaz 2003 liu et al 2006 hoa et al 2003 which might be due to that excessive carbon source could not be fully transformed by microorganisms and could be accumulated for formating ps in flocs it may be also related to the high soluble organics resulting in high value of c n and promoting the biopolymers production as described above as for overloading carbon source c n 40 moreover bacteria would be in an abnormal condition with lack of n and p elements for cells proliferation and growth thus extracellular substances are likely to be endogenously consumed to supply n and p under this circumstance the relationship and associated mechanisms between biopolymers and nutrient content c n p are still needed to be further studied 4 3 microbial community biopolymers are produced by the microbial community in the activated sludge would microbial abundance and activity take a key role in regulating and formating biopolymers with this question bacterial diversity and abundance were checked to investigate the inextricable relationship between microbes and biopolymers the diversity and abundance of bacteria and the linear correlation coefficients r2 are listed in table s7 it is clear that the biopolymers extraction tended to be negatively correlated with the bacterial abundance ace index r2 0 30 followed by a negative correlation with the diversity index shannon r2 0 24 whereas almost no correlation with the bacterial homogeneity in diversity simpson index r2 0 03 these results indicate that the dominant species and higher abundance of bacteria would decrease the biopolymers extraction which might be attributed to such a fact that a high yield of biopolymers could be expected with the enrichment of pure bacterial strains however some studies suggested that there were synergistic effects between different microorganisms which would increase the utilization efficiency of substrate and thus result in the formation of biopolymers more et al 2014 this discrepancy could be caused by some special enzymes secreted by different microorganisms which could help other microorganisms to obtain sufficient nutrient requirements in the complex environment and increase the formation of extracellular substances anyway there is no a clear conclusion on the effect of dominant species and abundance of microbial community on the biopolymers formation 4 3 1 phylum levels a sequential analysis of the microbial community from the different wwtps was annotated by the phylum levels of genus species using rdp classifier the abundance of microorganisms at the phylum levels are shown in fig 9 and the correlation coefficients r2 between the microbial community at the phylum level and the biopolymers extraction are shown in table s8 as shown in fig 9 the phylum proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes and planctomycetes were at a higher level ranging from 10 to 30 among them the abundances of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were significantly correlated with the biopolymers formation as shown in table s8 lee and mooney 2012 meng et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 for example the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in wwtp 3 was the lowest one around 19 0 and 13 4 respectively and chloroflexi was the highest one at 24 0 whereas the biopolymers extraction from wwtp 3 was at the low level 92 9 3 3 mg g vss the similar tendency also occurred in wwtp 7 moreover the abundance of proteobacteria and chloroflexi in wwtp 1 was at 27 9 highest and 13 2 lowest respectively but the biopolymers extraction was the highest one 187 9 12 3 mg g vss above all it can be confirmed that proteobacteria and chloroflexi phylum took a critical role in producing biopolymers as also mentioned by some previous studies lee and mooney 2012 meng et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 as also shown in table s8 the phylums firmicutes myxococcota bacteroidetes and nitrospira had a strong positive correlation r2 0 5 while latescibacterota chloroflexi and zixibacteria tended to be a significantly negative correlation r2 0 6 it could be concluded that different microbial community at the phylum level had the important effect on the biopolymers formation 4 3 2 family levels the abundance of microorganisms at the family levels are shown in fig 10 the relationship between microbes at the family levels and the biopolymers extraction were analyzed and shown in table 3 as shown in fig 10 and table 3 the different families significantly affected the biopolymers formation as biopolymers mainly originate from the cellular secretion and is closely associated with the bacteria metabolism these results also indicated that ale formation and characteristics were varied with synergetic interactions between different bacteria rather than only depend on the specific bacteria hence the high correlation coefficient 0 73 of one kind of microorganisms means significant effects on biopolymers formation while low coefficient such as 0 31 and 0 15 means the minor effect the family saprospiraceae mainly functioned as denitrification in the bnr process indicated a positive correlation with the biopolymers extraction r2 0 50 in wwtp 3 there was a relatively low abundance of family saprospiraceae at 6 6 and the biopolymers extraction was also at the lowest level with a further low pn content at 258 2 15 3 mg g ale similarly wwtp 1 and wwtp 6 took the trend that the higher abundance of family saprospiraceae had the higher biopolymers extraction xia et al 2008 have indicated that family saprospiraceae degraded organics by secreting associated enzymes extracellular proteins in flocs matrix and gave an increase to pn content in the biopolymers a strong negative correlation r2 0 73 between family anaerolineaceae and the biopolymers extraction was also found narihiro et al 2012 suggested that family anaerolineaceae played a main role in determining acidification and catabolism of polysaccharide and thus promoting the conversion of large molecules into small molecules with easily absorbability and usability for bacteria thus extracellular polysaccharide would also be degraded by the higher abundance of family anaerolineaceae resulting in the lower biopolymers production there was also a positive correlation r2 0 31 for family comamonadaceae which was already reported as putative paos ge et al 2015 and mainly associated with the production of zoogloeal sadaie et al 2007 the low abundance less than 2 of family comamonadaceae in wwtp 3 and wwtp 7 resulted in insufficient formation of zoogloeal and thus a lower biopolymers extraction there was a significant positive correlation r2 0 50 between the biopolymers extraction and family nitrosomonadaceae which is regarded as dominant aob besides other microbes also showed the correlation with the biopolymers extraction in conclusion the results confirm that the microbial community correlates with the biopolymers formation in other words both influent parameters and operating conditions could ultimately affect the dominant bacteria in the bnr process and eventually lead to the difference on the formation of biopolymers 5 conclusions the yield and the purity of the extracellular biopolymers extracted from the flocs of conventional activated sludge cas were analyzed and evaluated and the physical and chemical properties of the biopolymers were also elucidated moreover the influencing factors and related mechanisms of the biopolymers formation were identified based on the results main points can be addressed as follows ø the biopolymers ale extraction from the flocs of cas eight wastewater treatment plants wwtps ranged from 90 to 190 mg g vss which is comparative to the lower levels reported for production of the ale extracted from aerobic granular sludge ags ø the chemical structure evaluation of the biopolymers from cas revealed a similarity of 60 to a commercial alginate with respect to functional groups ø alginate equivalent of 400 mg g ale and 40 60 of the mannuronic acid m and guluronic acid g units in the biopolymers as well as the good performances of the ionic hydrogel formation mean a potential application of the ale from cas as a promising substitute for commercial alginates ø the general composition of the biopolymers extracted from the eight wwtps was quite similar such as proteins polysaccharides and humic acids however there were also some differences in the component content which could result in some different chemical properties of the biopolymers ø both influent substrate and nutrient content affected the biopolymers formation which was mainly associated with substance degradation and cellular metabolism ø the dominant bacterial involved in sludge was a decisive factor affecting the biopolymers formation behaving different either positive or negative effects moreover the biopolymers formation was mostly associated with nitrification and denitrification processes in conclusion extracellular biopolymers extracted from flocculent sludge were also confirmed as a sustainable alternative for some existing chemical materials however the biopolymers production from flocculent sludge was as low as 9 19 therefore it is meaningful to improve the formation of the biopolymers in flocculent sludge by some effective strategies such as modifying the influent and optimizing the operational parameters as well as the extracted protocols moreover the enrichment of the dominant bacterial in the biological nutrient removal processes without affecting the effluent quality of wwtps would be also the optimal

16606,extracellular polymeric substances eps are biopolymers that can be recovered from excess sludge which could contribute to a more sustainable wastewater treatment plant wwtp operation an example is alginate like extracellular polymers ale contained in the biopolymers could be a potential resource with a highly added value eps extraction for ale from aerobic granules sludge ags has already been well studied and applied in the netherlands on the other hand there is little attention to the recovery of biopolymers from conventional activated sludge cas in this study flocculent sludge from eight cas wwtps in china was collected and their eps biopolymers were extracted to investigate their recovery potential chemical physical properties and limiting factors the results revealed that the biopolymers extracted and purified from cas ranged from 90 to 190 mg g vss the compositional characteristics of the biopolymers were observed by ft ir 3d eem and uv visible spectra demonstrating some differences in the composition and property of the biopolymers from the different wwtps the biopolymers had a similarity of about 60 to a commercial alginate with respect to chemical functional groups and the alginate equivalent was 400 mg g biopolymers moreover the biopolymers consisted of poly guluronic acid blocks 20 30 and poly guluronic acid mannuronic acid blocks 8 28 and the ionic hydrogel formation tests indicated that condensed beads were immediately formed once the drops of the biopolymers came in contact with cacl2 solution these results demonstrated that the biopolymers extracted had a relatively high gel forming capacity and might also have a potential application as commercial biopolymers furthermore the factors influencing the biopolymers formation such as influent substrate nutrient content and microbial community and the related mechanisms were investigated among them increasing soluble organics scod content and low nutrient content c n p in the influent could promote the biopolymers formation also different bacteria in bnr processes might have positive or negative effects on the biopolymers formation in conclusion the diversity and abundance of bacteria were identified to be a crucial and decisive factor controlling biopolymers extraction and composition graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words extracellular biopolymers alginate like extracellular polymers ale conventional activated sludge cas extraction gel forming capacity microbial community 1 introduction resource recovery from wastewater is currently emphasized to develop a sustainable wastewater treatment system in this context excess sludge can be considered a potential resource for recovering highly added value products such as phosphate cellulose bioplastics biopolymers etc van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 li et al 2015 activated sludge flocs are actually a matrix of bacterial cells embedded in extracellular polymeric substance eps the eps accounts for about 10 40 of the total dry weight of activated sludge basuvara et al 2015 eps mainly consists of polysaccharides proteins lipids nucleic acids and humic substances felz et al 2016 boltz et al 2017 the eps substances embed the microcolonies and form a matrix in which these microcolonies and single cells are embedded by flocculation various physical and biochemical interactions such as electrostatic force hydrogen bonding or ionic bonds form the mechanisms for the floc formation and stability basuvaraj et al 2015 mahendran et al 2012 eps is considered as the protective matrix for environmental pressures mechanical stability external heavy metals and toxic compounds and also as the storage of carbon or water sheng et al 2010 schambeck et al 2020 the biopolymers in the matrix form a unique structure that can be recovered for potential highly valuable biomaterials sheng et al 2010 more et al 2014 much attention on recovering the biopolymers has focussed on alginate like extracellular polymers ale from aerobic granular sludge ags lin et al 2015 2018 xue et al 2019 ale is a biopolymer that can be used in the food paper textile medical and construction industry and also in agriculture and horticulture rehm 2010 lin et al 2015 2018 xue et al 2019 felz et al 2020 kim et al 2020 lin et al 2015 have evaluated the performance of ale extracted and purified from ags as non flammable surface coating and kim et al 2020 showed that ale could comply with the aviation requirements for aircraft interiors by the federal aviation regulations far currently the extraction of the eps biopolymers from ags has been scaled up to demonstration scale in an installation in zutphen the netherlands because of its unique properties the biopolymer ale has been branded kaumera kaumera recovery from ags is moving towards a commercial market introduction however according to the existing studies the content of eps from conventional activated sludge cas is only 7 19 vss lin et al 2010 2013 yang et al 2014 schambeck et al 2020 which is lower than that of ags 35 1 1 9 ss lin et al 2010 kim et al 2020 on the other hand the total amount of the excess sludge in conventional wwtps is huge for example there was more than 60 million t a 80 moisture content of excess sludge from cas in china in 2019 moreover handling excess sludge accounts for nearly a half of the total investment and operation costs of wwtps kroiss 2004 if the eps recovery could be applied as high value biopolymers like ale from ags it could offset some the costs of handling sludge and also make wwtps more sustainable towards the circular economy van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 li et al 2015 hao et al 2019 conversely there have been relatively few studies on recovering extracellular biopolymers from cas while the existing studies on eps from cas mostly focused on identifying and evaluating their roles in biological nutrient removal and sludge disposal processes sheng et al 2010 seviour et al 2019 the economic value of eps from cas seems largely ignored the eps recovery from cas could give a large potential for extraction and application for this reason a study was initiated to investigate eps biopolymers recovery from cas towards ale based on the excess sludge from eight cas wwtps from different regions of china eps biopolymers were extracted and purified by the previous methods felz et al 2016 2019 to obtain the yield and the purity of ale then the amounts and compositions of ale were investigated and evaluated by comparing with kaumera ale from ags next the physical and chemical properties of the biopolymers ale were analysed to clarify their performance gaps relative to commercial alginate finally the influences and related mechanisms of such factors as substrate and nutrient content in influent were summarized to provide some possible technical strategies for increasing the eps biopolymers production in cas 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge characteristics flocculent excess sludge was collected from eight wwtps wwtp 1 8 the conventional biological nutrient removal processes for municipal wastewater in different regions of china the locations and flocculent excess sludge characteristics were listed in table s1 the average influent quality and other detailed information are listed in table 1 the collected flocculent sludge was concentrated by a 0 15 mm filter sieved and then stored in a refrigerator 4 c for use 2 2 extraction protocols extracellular biopolymers were extracted by the method of ale as described by felz et al 2016 and 2019 and the detailed procedure was shown in fig s2 the samples of washed and centrifuged excess sludge were put into baffled flasks na2co3 in the demineralized water up to the concentration of 0 5 w v was added to the sludge samples hence the total volume of the mixture was kept at 400 ml with mlss 30 g l the flasks were then stirred for 35 min at 80 c in a water bath and finally centrifuged at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min supernatants were collected and pellets for baffling were removed respectively ph of the supernatants was adjusted to 2 2 with 1 m hcl for alginate purification then the acidified supernatants were again centrifuged at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min the pellets containing ale was collected and re dissolved with 1 m naoh at ph 8 5 the dissolved biopolymers were dialyzed for 24 h in a dialysis bag with a molecular weight cut off of 3 5 kda to remove the solubilized ions finally the samples were frozen at 50 c and then freeze dried in freeze drier lin et al 2010 extracellular biopolymers extracted from ags by the same methods were identified to be similar to the commercial alginate lin et al 2010 felz et al 2019 therefore in this study biopolymers samples extracted from eight different wwtps excess sludge were labelled as ale 1 to ale 8 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemical analysis analyzing polysaccharide ps was based on the conceptual framework proposed by dubois et al 1956 with a phenol sulfuric acid assay with both d glucose moreover ale was the main structural biopolymers in eps matrix and the commercial alginate extracted from brown algae was chosen as the standard to evaluate the amount of alginate equivalents in biopolymers also with a phenol sulfuric acid assay lin et al 2010 felz et al 2019 protein pn content was prepared according to the procedure of lorry assay with bovine serum albumin used as the standard lowry et al 1951 ts total solid vs volatile solids mlss mixed liquor suspended solids mlvss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids and ph were detected according to the standard methods apha 2012 total organic carbon toc was determined with a toc analyzer vario total organic carbon analyzer dksh company in swiss the fractionations of the isolated ale including a family of copolymers comprised of mannuronic acid m and guluronic acid g units arranged in an irregular block pattern of varying proportions of gg mg and mm blocks were detected by the methods of partial acid hydrolysis as described in lin et al 2013 moreover ionic hydrogel formation was tested with 2 5 w v cacl2 following the procedure as described in lin et al 2013 and felz et al 2016 a one way anova was used to estimate the difference between excess sludge from different wwtps the significance level at 95 were based on the data obtained from the duplicated experiments on the other hand the correlation coefficient r2 between different independent variables was also analyzed in this study 2 3 2 spectroscopic analysis other characterizations of biopolymers were detected by the uv visible absorbance measurements from 800 to 200 nm using an agilent cary 5000 uv vis nir spectrophotometer resolution 1 0 nm suva254 has a positive correlation with aromaticity of ale while the indexes of e2 e3 e2 e4 and e4 e6 have a negative correlation with the humification degree molecular size and condensation polak et al 2007 liu et al 2019 moreover suva260 has a positive correlation with hydrophobicity of substances suva254 and suva260 were obtained using uv vis absorbance at 254 nm and 260 nm respectively and then the values were normalized per mg toc of the sample solutions weishaar et al 2003 e2 e3 e2 e4 and e4 e6 refer to the uv visible absorbance ratio at 250 and 365 nm ratio at 240 and 420 and ratio at 465 and 665 nm respectively the functional groups were analyzed by a thermo fisher fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir by which specific structures and chemical functional groups can be easily evaluated the spectra of commercial sodium alginate extracted from brown algae viscosity 4 12 cp 1 in h2o was also recorded as the standard to estimate of the similarity of different biopolymers from the commercial alginate by the ft ir software li et al 2019 the ft ir spectra of biopolymers in kbr pellets 98 mg kbr 2 mg sample were recorded in at the wavenumber of 4000 400 cm 1 three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy was applied for identify fluorescent compounds contained in biopolymers sheng and yu 2006 in this study eem spectra were collected with subsequent scanning emission em spectra from 220 to 550 nm at 1 nm increment by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 200 to 500 nm at 5 nm increments ex and em slits were maintained at 5 nm and the scanning speed was set at 1200 nm min for all the measurements the spectrum of distilled water was recorded as the blank the statistical analysis of 3d eem data was performed using the matlab software 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction potentials the amounts of extracellular biopolymers extracted from different flocculent sludge wwtp 1 8 are shown in fig 1 wwtp 3 had the lowest yield of the biopolymers 92 9 3 3 mg g vss about half as compared to the highest yield from wwtp 1 187 9 12 3 mg g vss the amounts of the biopolymers ranged from 90 to 190 mg g vss 9 19 vss interestingly the biopolymer yields are comparable to those analyzed in the previous studies with the same extraction methods e g 187 94 mg ale g vss with municipal wastewater schambeck et al 2020 100 150 mg ale g vss with propionate used as the only carbon source yang et al 2014 72 6 mg ale g vss from aerobic excess sludge cas lin et al 2013 there is a certain gap on the extracted biopolymers amount between cas and ags cultured with sodium acetate as the carbon source 31 1 6 ss lin et al 2008 but the difference becomes less when compared with ags fed with mixed wastewater approximately 25 of slaughterhouse wastewater discharged in the sewage 160 4 mg g vss lin et al 2010 thus extracellular biopolymers extracted from cas seem to offer a similar potential as from ags in a quantitative sense 3 2 evaluation of alginate like extracellular polymers ale in extracellular biopolymers 3 2 1 alginate equivalents ale are the main structural component in extracellular biopolymers and thus determine the functionalities of the recovered materials therefore the commercial alginate was chosen as the standard to evaluate the amount of alginate equivalents in biopolymers lin et al 2010 the results are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 ale 3 and ale 8 were the highest ones of the alginate equivalents around 525 mg g ale while as ale 6 was the lowest one about 420 4 5 7 mg g ale the alginate equivalents relative to the commercial alginate 42 52 for the ale from the flocculent sludge of cas is similar as reported to the ale extracted from ags ranging from 48 53 lin et al 2010 3 2 2 gel forming capacity of the biopolymers alginate is able to form a gel matrix due to three different kinds of blocks including gg mg and mm blocks they are distributed randomly in the molecular chain of alginate which has its specific property and result in the different fine chemical structure their proportion distribution and length determine the chemical and physical properties of alginate molecules gg blocks have a higher affinity towards divalent cations than the other two blocks and the order of gel forming capability of the three blocks is mm blocks mg blocks gg blocks smidrød 1974 in this study the amount of mannuronic acid m and guluronic acid g poly units in the biopolymers were tested to evaluate the gel forming capacity of the biopolymers lin et al 2013 felz et al 2016 the results fig 3 indicated that the recovery yield of blocks from the biopolymers were at 40 60 with about 20 30 gg blocks and 8 28 mg blocks in the chemical structure of all the biopolymers the gg rich ale flocs benefited the flocculent sludge with the formation of a compact gel structure these results are consistent with the analysis of alginate equivalent and indicate that ale was one part of the important structural biopolymers moreover the monomer ratios of g m of the biopolymers from different flocculent sludge was similar at about 2 0 3 5 ionic hydrogel formation tests revealed that ca2 ale beads displayed the good and similar stabilities between different biopolymers which demonstrated that there was a hydrogel that got stabilized by divalent ions similar as the gel formation with alginate 3 2 3 similarity of functional groups to the commercial alginate the functional groups bonds in the biopolymers are the critical part reflecting the primary chemical properties of organics and also the effective parameters to evaluate the possible applications as the substitute for the commercial alginate therefore functional groups were measured and the results are shown in fig 4 the main peaks and characters of functional groups contained in the biopolymers are listed in table s3 jia et al 2017 niu et al 2016 yin et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 based on fig 4 the main structure of biopolymers ale varied from different wwtps table s3 also listed the obvious difference of band assignments for the ft ir spectral features of different extracellular biopolymers among them ale 3 4 and 7 should belong to polysaccharide dominated structures in contrast ale 2 5 6 and 8 had more protein like chemical substances moreover the commercial alginate was used as the standard substance to evaluate the similarity of functional groups by ft ir software and the results are shown in table 2 no significant difference in the spectra was found and the quantitative similarity of chemical functional groups reached up to 60 83 above all due to the above results of chemical structure and alginate equivalents the biopolymers extracted from the flocculent sludge seem to have the similar characters as compared to the commercial alginate 3 3 characterization of compositions 3 3 1 protein and polysaccharide as described above the extracted biopolymers were ale which contained a variety of complex organic substances such as glycoproteins polysaccharides proteins and humic substances these substances are enmeshed with each other and can form unique structures felz et al 2019 further characterization of the composition was needed to evaluate the specific property of the biopolymers as shown in fig 5 the extracellular polysaccharide ps fraction in ale 8 was the lowest around 75 1 8 8 mg g ale while ale 1 showed the highest fraction around 130 6 3 0 mg g ale moreover ps in the other biopolymers ranged from 105 to 120 mg g ale the extracellular protein pn is also shown in fig 5 also pn varied significantly between different biopolymer samples both ps and pn analysis results corresponded to the indication of functional groups for polysaccharides and protein as observed from ft ir spectra fig 4 these results demonstrated that different environmental or operational parameters like influent quality substrate temperature solid retention time etc might have a strong influence on the composition of the biopolymers from flocculent sludge the detailed explanation is followed below the different structures and fractions of pn and ps contribute to varied chemical properties and functions some studies have noted the importance of the ratio of pn to ps pn ps for evaluating composition and properties of organics mahendran et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 the pn ps ratio of eps extracted from ags were at around 3 3 while anaerobic granules are reported to have a pn ps ratio of 4 2 mahendran et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 these values are higher than those reported for floc 1 6 and biofilms 1 2 mahendran et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 a higher pn ps ratio denotes more extracellular protein substances which has been suggested as important for sludge granulation and stability maintenance park et al 2008 zhu et al 2012 in this study pn ps were also analyzed and the results are shown in fig 5 ale 8 and ale 6 had the highest pn ps at nearly 4 5 the pn ps ratio of the ale extracted from the flocs of flocculent sludge ranged from 3 0 to 4 5 except for ale 3 1 9 the ratios were clearly higher than that of eps reported before for flocculent sludge but they are close to that of the ale extracted from ags mahendran et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 the higher pn ps ratio might be attributed to the different extraction protocol the extraction protocol for ale has been developed in order to solubilize the structural eps felz et al 2016 whereas many previous used extraction methods did not really solubilize all eps seviour et al 2019 above all these results provided some important insights in evaluating the biopolymers extracted from the flocs of cas and comparing it with the ale extracted from ags in composition characterization and properties 3 3 2 volatile solids vs yield and ash content some previous studies have reported that the ale extracted from ags contains not only organic components but also inorganic components up to 5 20 depending on different extraction protocols felz et al 2016 total organic carbon toc including the organics of ps pn humic substances lipids and so on can indirectly represent the organic proportions of biopolymers therefore toc was used to evaluate the vs yield and ash content of the biopolymers the results are shown in fig 6 the toc of ale 3 was relatively lower only 279 4 16 7 mg c g ale which was consistent with the low content of both pn and ps moreover toc of ale 6 was also lower 350 0 5 6 mg c g ale but the sum of ps and pn was as high as 57 7 on the contrary toc of ale 4 was at the highest level 533 0 19 2 mg c g ale but the total content of ps and pn was not at the highest level only 48 8 ale 6 was speculated to contain a larger proportion of organic matter including ps and pn while as ale 4 contained a larger proportion of humic substances and other organics rather than ps and pn 3 4 spectral analysis for physical and chemical properties 3 4 1 uv visible spectroscopy the special wavelengths in the uv visible spectra are generally seen as the parameter strongly related to the degree of humification aliphatic and aromatic compounds which reflects the chemical structure of biopolymers stability weishaar et al 2003 polak et al 2007 liu et al 2019 the results of uv spectra analysis of the biopolymers samples are shown in fig s4 based on the evaluation of these indexes as described in the section 2 3 3 spectroscopic analysis the difference of the biopolymers was obvious as analyzed below i analysis of humification show that ale 4 contained more stable compounds with higher molecules and also higher degree of humification and condensation as for the other biopolymers the index of e2 e3 4 5 5 0 e4 e6 6 0 and e2 e4 5 8 indicates that the content of aliphatic compounds was relatively high ii results of aromatics suggest that ale 1 and ale 3 contained more aromatic substances with higher level of unsaturation while ale 8 contained less aromatics iii evaluation of hydrophobicity indicate that ale 1 had a higher proportion of hydrophobic components followed by ale 3 ale 4 and ale 5 and ale 8 lower hydrophobicity is strongly associated with higher solubilities and instabilities of gel forming in water in summary chemical structure of the ale 4 showed the most humified structure and stable formation on the other hand ale 1 ale 2 ale 7 and ale 8 demonstrated different humified or aromatized structures but did not differ significantly from each other different parameters such as influent quality and operational conditions might change the biopolymers yield and composition but also have some effect on their chemical and physical structures 3 4 2 3d eem spectroscopy three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectroscopy was used to further characterize the composition of the biopolymers the results are shown in fig 7 according to the corresponding excitation ex and emission em wavelengths the fluorescence regions are divided into flu ⅰ flu ⅴ among them flu ⅰ and flu ⅱ indicate aromatic protein like substances aromatic protein ⅰ and ⅱ respectively flu ⅳ represents soluble microbial by product like substances smps flu iii and flu v include fulvic acid like and humic acid like organics dai et al 2018 in fig 7 there is the clear peaks of fluorescent substances at flu ⅳ for ale 2 8 which indicates that biopolymers contained more smps in contrast ale 1 revealed less smps which was basically consistent with the relatively higher alginate equivalent in ale 1 as concluded in section 3 2 ale 4 meant obvious absorbance peaks at flu iii and flu v which indicates that it contained the higher contents of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances which contributed to a higher concentration of toc volatile solids instead of ps and pn as described in section 3 3 2 moreover the quantitative analysis of fluorescence density is shown in fig s5 the main fluorescent substances contained in the biopolymers were varied from others which implies that chemical properties of the biopolymers are relatively different 4 factors limiting biopolymers formation obviously extracting biopolymers from the flocs of cas is attractive as a potential substitute for commercial biopolymers however there was still the difference on extracted biopolymers amount and its physical and or chemical properties from cas in different wwtps and also comparing with ags as indicated above thus it is necessary to further analyze the factors causing the difference and limitation including influent substrates nutrient content and microbial community to figure out the related mechanisms of biopolymers formation and associated properties 4 1 influent substrate as shown in table 1 and fig s6 scod tcod ratio were different p 0 05 from different wwtps among them wwtp 3 had a low scod tcod ratio about 27 7 due to the influent containing 50 industrial wastewater interestingly wwtp 3 indicated the lowest biopolymers content around 92 9 3 3 mg g vss the same phenomenon also occurred in wwtp 7 in which the influent scod tcod was 25 2 also resulting in a relatively low level of biopolymers extraction 115 3 mg g vss on the other hand wwtp 1 had the highest content of the biopolymers up to 187 9 mg g vss corresponding to a highest influent scod tcod ratio 45 9 therefore it could be concluded that the soluble organics scod content in the influent could affect the biopolymers formation to an extent a high scod content would enhance the biopolymers formation these relationships may partly be explained by the fact that higher soluble organics could benefit microbes for accelerating metabolic processes and thus promote the secretion of metabolites a main origin of extracellular biopolymers this explanation was also supported by yang et al 2014 who claimed that organic loading was related to the formation of biopolymers increasing soluble organics would stimulate granules to secrete more extracellular cyclic diguanylate monophosphate c di gmp a well conserved second messenger in bacteria that promotes granules formation and regulates high glycans formation and contribute to further secretion of the biopolymers ross et al 1987 jiang 2011 yang et al 2014 in addition peng et al 2012 also held that increasing the influent cod led to the decrease of the ps content in eps an exceptional case occurred for wwtp 2 in which the influent scod tcod was as low as 28 1 but its biopolymers extraction was as high as 154 5 mg g vss it is thus hypothesized that there might be other factors affecting the ale information moreover the high degree of humification of ale 4 was caused by the low influent cod concentration and a long srt in wwtp 4 which resulted to the serious endogenous metabolism of flocs and thus to produce more humic acid like substances and soluble microbial by product like substances as a result the degree of humification of biopolymers was associated 4 2 nutrient content c n p it has been known that the yield of eps depends heavily on the influent nutrient content c n p wang et al 2014 sanin and durmaz 2003 liu et al 2006 hoa et al 2003 therefore the linear correlation between biopolymers and influent c n p 0 05 c p p 0 05 was analyzed and the results are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the biopolymers extraction gradually increased along with decreasing c n and or c p and the correlation coefficient between c n and ale was at r2 0 71 and c p at r2 0 72 there are several possible explanations for these results i external unfavorable surroundings low c n or c p high n p load for bacteria leading to a low activity of metabolisms but promoting more extracellular biopolymers secretion including exoenzymes as protective layers ii cells disintegration and autolysis would also release intracellular substances from cells and thus increase the content of ps and pn in the biopolymers wang et al 2014 sanin and durmaz 2003 liu et al 2006 hoa et al 2003 shortly reducing carbon source or increasing the nutrient content n or p in influent lower ratio of c n p could be speculated to increase the biopolymers formation in flocs on the other hand some researches revealed that c n 20 resulted in the high content of ps and thus contributed to increase biopolymers wang et al 2014 sanin and durmaz 2003 liu et al 2006 hoa et al 2003 which might be due to that excessive carbon source could not be fully transformed by microorganisms and could be accumulated for formating ps in flocs it may be also related to the high soluble organics resulting in high value of c n and promoting the biopolymers production as described above as for overloading carbon source c n 40 moreover bacteria would be in an abnormal condition with lack of n and p elements for cells proliferation and growth thus extracellular substances are likely to be endogenously consumed to supply n and p under this circumstance the relationship and associated mechanisms between biopolymers and nutrient content c n p are still needed to be further studied 4 3 microbial community biopolymers are produced by the microbial community in the activated sludge would microbial abundance and activity take a key role in regulating and formating biopolymers with this question bacterial diversity and abundance were checked to investigate the inextricable relationship between microbes and biopolymers the diversity and abundance of bacteria and the linear correlation coefficients r2 are listed in table s7 it is clear that the biopolymers extraction tended to be negatively correlated with the bacterial abundance ace index r2 0 30 followed by a negative correlation with the diversity index shannon r2 0 24 whereas almost no correlation with the bacterial homogeneity in diversity simpson index r2 0 03 these results indicate that the dominant species and higher abundance of bacteria would decrease the biopolymers extraction which might be attributed to such a fact that a high yield of biopolymers could be expected with the enrichment of pure bacterial strains however some studies suggested that there were synergistic effects between different microorganisms which would increase the utilization efficiency of substrate and thus result in the formation of biopolymers more et al 2014 this discrepancy could be caused by some special enzymes secreted by different microorganisms which could help other microorganisms to obtain sufficient nutrient requirements in the complex environment and increase the formation of extracellular substances anyway there is no a clear conclusion on the effect of dominant species and abundance of microbial community on the biopolymers formation 4 3 1 phylum levels a sequential analysis of the microbial community from the different wwtps was annotated by the phylum levels of genus species using rdp classifier the abundance of microorganisms at the phylum levels are shown in fig 9 and the correlation coefficients r2 between the microbial community at the phylum level and the biopolymers extraction are shown in table s8 as shown in fig 9 the phylum proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes and planctomycetes were at a higher level ranging from 10 to 30 among them the abundances of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were significantly correlated with the biopolymers formation as shown in table s8 lee and mooney 2012 meng et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 for example the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in wwtp 3 was the lowest one around 19 0 and 13 4 respectively and chloroflexi was the highest one at 24 0 whereas the biopolymers extraction from wwtp 3 was at the low level 92 9 3 3 mg g vss the similar tendency also occurred in wwtp 7 moreover the abundance of proteobacteria and chloroflexi in wwtp 1 was at 27 9 highest and 13 2 lowest respectively but the biopolymers extraction was the highest one 187 9 12 3 mg g vss above all it can be confirmed that proteobacteria and chloroflexi phylum took a critical role in producing biopolymers as also mentioned by some previous studies lee and mooney 2012 meng et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 as also shown in table s8 the phylums firmicutes myxococcota bacteroidetes and nitrospira had a strong positive correlation r2 0 5 while latescibacterota chloroflexi and zixibacteria tended to be a significantly negative correlation r2 0 6 it could be concluded that different microbial community at the phylum level had the important effect on the biopolymers formation 4 3 2 family levels the abundance of microorganisms at the family levels are shown in fig 10 the relationship between microbes at the family levels and the biopolymers extraction were analyzed and shown in table 3 as shown in fig 10 and table 3 the different families significantly affected the biopolymers formation as biopolymers mainly originate from the cellular secretion and is closely associated with the bacteria metabolism these results also indicated that ale formation and characteristics were varied with synergetic interactions between different bacteria rather than only depend on the specific bacteria hence the high correlation coefficient 0 73 of one kind of microorganisms means significant effects on biopolymers formation while low coefficient such as 0 31 and 0 15 means the minor effect the family saprospiraceae mainly functioned as denitrification in the bnr process indicated a positive correlation with the biopolymers extraction r2 0 50 in wwtp 3 there was a relatively low abundance of family saprospiraceae at 6 6 and the biopolymers extraction was also at the lowest level with a further low pn content at 258 2 15 3 mg g ale similarly wwtp 1 and wwtp 6 took the trend that the higher abundance of family saprospiraceae had the higher biopolymers extraction xia et al 2008 have indicated that family saprospiraceae degraded organics by secreting associated enzymes extracellular proteins in flocs matrix and gave an increase to pn content in the biopolymers a strong negative correlation r2 0 73 between family anaerolineaceae and the biopolymers extraction was also found narihiro et al 2012 suggested that family anaerolineaceae played a main role in determining acidification and catabolism of polysaccharide and thus promoting the conversion of large molecules into small molecules with easily absorbability and usability for bacteria thus extracellular polysaccharide would also be degraded by the higher abundance of family anaerolineaceae resulting in the lower biopolymers production there was also a positive correlation r2 0 31 for family comamonadaceae which was already reported as putative paos ge et al 2015 and mainly associated with the production of zoogloeal sadaie et al 2007 the low abundance less than 2 of family comamonadaceae in wwtp 3 and wwtp 7 resulted in insufficient formation of zoogloeal and thus a lower biopolymers extraction there was a significant positive correlation r2 0 50 between the biopolymers extraction and family nitrosomonadaceae which is regarded as dominant aob besides other microbes also showed the correlation with the biopolymers extraction in conclusion the results confirm that the microbial community correlates with the biopolymers formation in other words both influent parameters and operating conditions could ultimately affect the dominant bacteria in the bnr process and eventually lead to the difference on the formation of biopolymers 5 conclusions the yield and the purity of the extracellular biopolymers extracted from the flocs of conventional activated sludge cas were analyzed and evaluated and the physical and chemical properties of the biopolymers were also elucidated moreover the influencing factors and related mechanisms of the biopolymers formation were identified based on the results main points can be addressed as follows ø the biopolymers ale extraction from the flocs of cas eight wastewater treatment plants wwtps ranged from 90 to 190 mg g vss which is comparative to the lower levels reported for production of the ale extracted from aerobic granular sludge ags ø the chemical structure evaluation of the biopolymers from cas revealed a similarity of 60 to a commercial alginate with respect to functional groups ø alginate equivalent of 400 mg g ale and 40 60 of the mannuronic acid m and guluronic acid g units in the biopolymers as well as the good performances of the ionic hydrogel formation mean a potential application of the ale from cas as a promising substitute for commercial alginates ø the general composition of the biopolymers extracted from the eight wwtps was quite similar such as proteins polysaccharides and humic acids however there were also some differences in the component content which could result in some different chemical properties of the biopolymers ø both influent substrate and nutrient content affected the biopolymers formation which was mainly associated with substance degradation and cellular metabolism ø the dominant bacterial involved in sludge was a decisive factor affecting the biopolymers formation behaving different either positive or negative effects moreover the biopolymers formation was mostly associated with nitrification and denitrification processes in conclusion extracellular biopolymers extracted from flocculent sludge were also confirmed as a sustainable alternative for some existing chemical materials however the biopolymers production from flocculent sludge was as low as 9 19 therefore it is meaningful to improve the formation of the biopolymers in flocculent sludge by some effective strategies such as modifying the influent and optimizing the operational parameters as well as the extracted protocols moreover the enrichment of the dominant bacterial in the biological nutrient removal processes without affecting the effluent quality of wwtps would be also the optimal measurement for maximizing the biopolymers production xxxx declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

16607,hydrothermal pretreatment of waste activated sludge was could eliminate the rate limiting step of anaerobic digestion ad hydrolysis however the high organic loading rate may cause acid accumulation thus leading to an unstable system this study compared the effect of different hydrochar hc2 260 c and hc3 320 c and biochar bc5 500 c and bc7 700 c on ad of hydrothermal pretreated was hps results demonstrated that hydrochar was superior to biochar in the methane yield and production rate especially hc2 hc2 had the highest surface oxygen containing functional groups that could facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer diet the enhanced methane yield was related with the increased protein utilization and hydrochar and biochar enriched different microbes related to protein degradation metabolomic analysis showed the significantly changed metabolites induced by hydrochar and biochar were involved in fatty acids and amino acids related metabolism indicating the rapid conversion of intermediated products which was consistent with the microbial community structure results hydrochar and biochar also induced upregulation of metabolites related to microbial metabolic activity and extracellular electron transfer although biochar induced the same metabolic changes the alterations of these metabolites were weaker than those of hydrochar the results of this study offered new insights into the molecular mechanisms of enhanced ad of hps by hydrochar and biochar graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metabolomic analysis 16s rrna transcript analysis hydrochar biochar methane 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is produced from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps which may become serious secondary pollution if it is not properly treated and disposed usman et al 2020 anaerobic digestion ad is widely used to treat was and recover energy in the form of biogas however was is mainly composed of microbial cells wang et al 2014 a large number of organic components lipid proteins and carbohydrates in microbial cells are difficult to release in hydrolysis step resulting in low efficiency during ad of was yan et al 2020 therefore chemical mechanical and thermal pretreatments were used to improve degradation efficiency burger and parker 2013 chen et al 2021 therein hydrothermal pretreatment at a specific temperature and pressure can effectively collapse sludge and improve the bioavailability of organic wastes shi et al 2021 hydrothermal pretreatment at 170 c and 0 5 h has been recognized as an appropriate condition and widely used in engineering li et al 2017 however high concentrations of potential inhibitors could cause system instability especially the easily accumulated high concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfas at high organic loading rates in this case it is important to enhance the methane production rate to fast degrade the accumulated vfas recently measures to add exogenous materials to increase the methane production rate and improve the stability of ad have begun to receive much attention ren et al 2020 usman et al 2020 zero valent iron and magnetite nanoparticles could stimulate methanogenesis under ammonia inhibition condition during the hydrothermal pretreatment and ad integrated process yan et al 2020 granular activated carbon could also effectively enhance methanogenesis by virtue of its capacity of adsorption and enrichment of syntrophic microbes martins et al 2018 it was noting that the above materials have also been proved to promote direct interspecies electron transfer diet between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens martins et al 2018 yan et al 2020 diet establishment was often closely related to the enhancement of methane production rate notwithstanding these materials were relatively costly and it is necessary to develop more low cost material to improve methane production rate biochar is produced by dry pyrolysis in an oxygen free atmosphere and hydrochar is prepared by hydrothermal liquefaction htl in the presence of hot and pressurized water wang et al 2018 as relatively inexpensive carbonaceous solid products hydrochar and biochar which are obtained from biomass through thermal chemical conversion have been confirmed to promote methane production rate chen et al 2014a usman et al 2020 biochar derived from rice straw and manure could stimulate methane production rate with ethanol as the substrate by facilitating the diet between methanogens and geobacteraceae yuan et al 2018 the oxygen based functional groups on the surface of hydrochar were related to the enhanced methane production rate of glucose ren et al 2020 both hydrochar and biochar can be used as the mediator of electron transfer which accept electrons released by electroactive bacteria by oxidizing organic compounds and donate electrons to methanogens the preparation conditions of biochar and hydrochar are different and therefore their physical and chemical properties are also significantly different for example compared with biochar hydrochar usually has lower ash content surface area porosity and electrical conductivity fuertes et al 2010 ren et al 2020 obviously these differences between hydrochar and biochar would directly affect their efficiency in promoting ad efficiency however to the best of our knowledge the different promoting effects of hydrochar and biochar on ad of hydrothermal pretreated was have not been investigated and the microbial mechanism differences of hydrochar and biochar on ad of hydrothermal pretreated was hps remain to be elucidated both hydrochar and biochar may interact directly or indirectly with microbes during ad of hps and subsequently affect the metabolism of the microbes therefore monitoring metabolites can indirectly reflect changes in microbial metabolism metabolites are the final products of gene expressions and therefore variation in microbe s metabolite profiles can offer a chemical fingerprint of microbial functional status chen et al 2020 however previous studies have not investigated the changes of metabolites with the addition of hydrochar or biochar in ad of organic wastes 16s rrna gene sequencing is a widely used technique to provide information on the microbial community compositions in environmental samples compared with the 16s rrna gene set from the total genomic dna the 16s rrna transcript set from rna could exclude the interference of dormant or dead microbes to specifically provide insight in the metabolically active microbes campanaro et al 2018 given the known functions of these altered microbes researchers can make corresponding assumptions about the changes in biochemistry based on the above considerations the present study aimed to compare the different promotion effects of hydrochar and biochar on methane production from hps both high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna transcripts and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis were conducted to evaluate the different alterations in microbial community structures and metabolite profiles in responses to hydrochar and biochar the results of the present study provided new insights to enable the accurate assessment of the mechanism of enhanced ad of hps by hydrochar and biochar 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of hydrochar and biochar corn straw was used as the feedstock for the preparation of hydrochar and biochar since our preliminary experiment found that this biomass source had better capacity to promote methane production rate ren et al 2020 shi et al 2021 usman et al 2020 hydrochar was obtained by htl htl at different temperatures 260 c and 320 c hc2 and hc3 for 1 h was conducted in a pilot scale 3 l pressurized stirred tank reactor by keeping the same condition as our previous study shi et al 2021 the bio oil attached on the hydrochar was removed by using tetrahydrofuran biochar was obtained from pyrolysis at both 500 c and 700 c for 1 h bc5 and bc7 which was the common condition for the preparation of biochar chen et al 2014b all types of hydrochar and biochar were grounded and sieved 2 mm dried at 105 c for 24 h and stored in the dryer for further utilization the characteristics of hydrochar and biochar were shown in table s1 2 2 hps and inoculum was used in this study was collected from wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china hps was prepared in the same 3 l pressurized stirred tank reactor the desired temperature and reaction residence time were 170 c and 30 min respectively and the other reaction conditions were consistent with the preparation of hydrochar the inoculum was obtained from a mesophilic anaerobic digester treating cassava stillage the characteristics of inoculum were as follows total solids ts 35 6 1 7 g l volatile solids vs 28 5 0 8 g l and ph 7 30 0 05 the characteristics of hps were as follows ts 143 4 2 g l vs 55 7 4 g l and ph 6 65 0 07 2 3 experimental set up the effects of carbon based materials on the methane production were investigated in batch mode by using 118 ml serum bottles with a working volume of 40 ml each bottle contained 2 ml of inoculum 20 ml of hps and 18 ml of deionized water hydrochar or biochar was added to the bottles to a final concentration 10 g l which has been demonstrated to be the optimal concentration in previous studies luo et al 2015 ren et al 2020 the bottles without carbon based materials were used as control the solutions of sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid were used to adjust the initial ph of each bottle to 7 5 bottles were flushed with n2 for 5 min to maintain the anaerobic environment and then placed in an incubator at 37 c all the tests were prepared in sextuplicate three for gas measurement and the remaining three for other parameters i e vfas soluble protein soluble carbohydrate and ph solids samples were taken for rna and metabolite extraction when the active methane phases were achieved i e the methane production reached half of the maximum value around 100 ml ch4 g vs indicating vigorous microbial metabolism activity and a profitable amount of mrna expression the gompertz model was used to fit the measured methane production with hydrochar and biochar the analysis of methane content vfas concentration ts vs ph and characteristics of carbon based materials was described in the supporting methods 2 4 16s rrna transcript sequencing and analysis total rna was extracted from sludge using a ribopure rna purification kit ambion life technologies lithuania according to the manufacturer s guidelines then the extracted rna was subjected to dna removal and complementary dna cdna synthesis tiangen beijing china the quality and quantity of rna were checked using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa and dna contamination was detected by performing pcr reactions using the isolated rna samples the cdna with bacterial 16s rrna transcripts was amplified with the primers 338f and 806r targeting the v3 v4 region the raw sequence data were merged and then used for demultiplexing sequence quality control and feature table construction by qiime2 pipeline with the q2 dada2 plugin default values were selected for all parameters bolyen et al 2019 q2 dada2 was also used to generate amplicon sequence variants asv a pre trained naïve bayes classifies which was trained on the silva ssu database version 138 was applied to assign the asvs to taxonomic categories at different levels quast et al 2013 the 16s rrna transcript sequences have been deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession number sub10011081 2 5 lc ms based metabolomic analysis the sludge were harvested at 9000 g at 4 c for 5 min quenched in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c immediately sludge samples were resuspended in 200 μl of ultrapure water 4 c and sonicated using a tip sonicator scientz jy 92 iin then the samples were quenched using 60 v v cold methanol the samples were separated from the quenching solution by centrifuged at 13 900 g for 10 min at 4 c the sample was resuspended in 5 ml of 80 cold methanol and ultrasonicated at low temperature 4 c for 20 min subsequently the supernatant were collected after centrifugation at 10 000 g for 30 min a quality control qc sample was prepared by mixing aliquots of all samples a pooled sample to obtain the purified metabolites metabolomic analysis was carried out at room temperature 18 c under the condition of nitrogen flow drying the mass spectrometry data were collected using q exactive plus orbitrap mass spectrometer thermo fisher waltham ma the supernatant was loaded onto chromatographic column and eluted onto an orbitrap mass spectrometer with 50 acetonitrile nitrogen 99 999 was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 0 4 ml min through the column metabolites were analyzed in the positive ion and negative ion modes over the mass range of 60 1000

and metlin were used for tracking search to identify the measured metabolites 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different carbon based materials on hps ad 3 1 1 effects of carbon based material on methane production as shown in fig 1 all types of carbon based materials effectively promoted ad of hps however the promotion effects of the four carbon based materials on methane production were different the promotion effect of hydrochar on methane production was better than that of biochar the specific methane production rates rmax were increased by 49 8 and 34 3 for hc2 and hc3 respectively while the enhancement of rmax for bc5 and bc7 were 23 8 and 14 6 respectively table s2 the potential methane yields p were significantly increased by 25 6 24 6 13 3 and 4 74 in hc2 hc3 bc5 and bc7 groups respectively p 0 05 additionally adding carbon based materials also shortened the lag time it was worth pointing out that although the methane yields in hc2 and hc3 groups were almost the same the lag phase of hc2 group was lower than that of hc3 and the rmax of hc2 group was higher than that of hc3 therefore hc2 was the most effective carbon based material to promote ad of hps recently most studies paid attention on the effect of biochar on the ad performance however the above results showed that hydrochar was more effective in increasing both methane production rate and methane yield chen et al 2014a pan et al 2019 shen et al 2021 yuan et al 2018 in order to clarify the reasons the subsequent analysis investigated the effects of different carbon based materials on the performance of methane production from the perspectives of organic components degradation characteristics of the carbon based materials microbial community structures and microbial metabolites 3 1 2 transformation of organic components in ad with carbon based materials the transformation of organic components was tracked to provide insights into the different impacts of diverse carbon based materials on methane production soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vfas in hc2 group presented the lowest accumulation and fastest consumption rates fig 1 among all the groups the peak values of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vfas in hc2 group appeared earlier with lower concentration compared to the control and other carbon base material groups the capacity of hc2 to promote the consumption of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vfas was more prominent similar to hc2 the existence of hc3 also promoted the metabolism of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vfas although its effect on the degradation of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vfas was not as effective as hc2 it was better than biochar and control group it was worth noting that soluble proteins and soluble carbohydrates peaked earlier with lower concentration in bc7 group compared to bc5 group the degradation of soluble proteins and soluble carbohydrates in bc5 group even weakened than the control group although the existence of bc5 resulted in higher accumulation these intermediate products could be consumed rapidly nevertheless the accumulation of vfas in hc7 was higher than that in bc5 suggesting that bc7 was not as effective as bc5 in promoting the degradation of vfas in general both hydrochar and biochar could alleviate the inhibition of vfas and the effect of hydrochar was better than that of biochar especially hc2 as for biochar group bc5 exhibited superior effects over bc7 on the degradation of vfas additionally ph in the presence of hydrochar or biochar was higher than the control groups which was consistent with the lower concentration of accumulated vfas in carbon based material groups 3 2 characterization of carbon base materials by xps and ftir our previous study have shown that hydrochar increased methane production rate through diet mediated by surface oxygen containing functional groups ren et al 2020 other studies also suggested that the redox active moieties of biochar which was related to the oxygen containing functional groups was directly related to the promotion of methane production rate saquing et al 2016 shen et al 2021 thus the surface functional groups of hydrochar and biochar were characterized by xps and ftir to identify the active source that may relate to the improvement of methane production as shown in figure s1 the adsorption peak at about 3420 3448 cm 1 was assigned to the oh stretching vibration of both carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and this peak was stronger for hc2 than that for other carbon based materials the band at 2907 2941 cm 1 was ascribed to aliphatic ch stretching vibration compared with biochar the intensity of this peak was also higher in hydrochar especially in hc2 the bands at 1604 1618 cm 1 corresponded to c o carbonyl ester or carboxyl groups the peak at 1389 1448 cm 1 were attributed to c c group vibration of aromatic structure the bands in the 1022 1059 cm 1 region mainly related to co stretching and oh bending vibrations the intensity of these bands was higher in hydrochar than that in biochar the redox active oxygen containing functional groups include co c o and coh zhang et al 2019 the analysis of the ftir spectra indicated abundant amount of oxygen containing functional groups existed on the surface of hydrochar and biochar and the intensity of these groups was higher on the surface of hydrochar especially in hc2 this observation might explain the highest capability for the enhancement of methane production rate by hc2 the abundance of oxygen containing functional groups was further determined by xps and it was found that the abundance of oxygen containing functional groups in hc2 was the highest table s3 meanwhile the oxygen containing functional groups had the positive correlation with methane production rate r 2 0 9761 p 0 05 figure s2 which confirmed that the previously reported redox active moieties of carbon based materials was proportional to the enhanced methane production rates ren et al 2020 ftir and xps characterizations revealed that the hydrothermal and pyrolysis temperatures greatly affected the abundances of surface oxygen containing groups the differences in surface oxygen containing functional groups of hydrochar and biochar determined the different promotion effects on ad of hps this observation might be explained by the change of molecular structure caused by temperature keiluweit et al 2010 found a variation of molecular structure of biochar from plant biomass with temperature the characteristic of high temperature carbon based materials was that there were less labile compounds at the surface of particle bruun et al 2011 on the contrary slow hydrothermal or pyrolysis at low temperature produced more biochar or hydrochar with diverse chemical groups including oxygen containing functional groups which were related with the promotion of the methane production chen et al 2019 overall our findings showed that the lower the preparation temperature the more abundant functional groups on the surface of carbon based materials meanwhile the content of oxygen containing functional groups was positively correlated with the improvement of methanogenesis 3 3 metabolically active microbial community alteration 3 3 1 effects of carbon based materials on microbial community composition at the phylum level the addition of hydrochar and biochar significantly altered the microbial community structure supporting notes figure s3 to better understand the effects of different carbon based materials on microbial community composition the phylum level classification was first analyzed firmicutes synergistetes bacteroidetes and cloacimonetes presented significant differences among all the groups firmicutes was the most abundant phyla in all the groups which accounted for 78 6 56 2 54 8 60 4 and 62 7 in the control hc2 hc3 bc5 and bc7 groups respectively fig 2 it was obvious that the abundance of firmicutes was significantly decreased after the addition of carbon based materials p 0 05 firmicutes was reported to be the dominant species in biogas reactors shi et al 2021 the phylum firmicutes includes species with a wide range of functions such as the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins the fermentation of sugars and the production of acids campanaro et al 2020 the abundance of synergistetes was significantly increased in hydrochar group 23 8 as compared with control 4 47 and biochar groups 5 25 p 0 05 the microbes in phylum synergistetes have the ability to degrade proteins peptides and amino acids jumas bilak and marchandin 2014 the abundance of bacteroidetes in biochar group 20 7 was also significantly higher than that in control 9 58 and hydrochar 8 02 groups p 0 05 meanwhile the abundance of cloacimonetes was more abundant in bc7 group p 0 05 cloacimonetes contained the members that could utilize the carbon and energy produced from the fermentation of amino acids pelletier et al 2008 compared to the control group the abundance of euryarchaeota mainly methanogens was increased in carbon based material groups which might be related to the enhanced methane production efficiency taken together carbon based materials had significant effects on microbial communities at the phylum level 3 3 2 the different effects of carbon based materials at the genus level genus level classification was further conducted to have a deep insight of the changes of microbial communities induced by carbon based materials an amino acid degradation bacterium aminobacterium belonging to aminobacterium genus phylum synergistetes was the most abundant genus in hydrochar group especially in hc3 group p 0 05 fig 2 the proteolytic bacterium proteiniphilum belonging to bacteroidetes had the greatest abundance in biochar group 13 6 17 7 especially in bc7 group both of them played important roles in hydrolysis of protein and their low abundance in bc5 group might explain the delay of soluble protein peak baena et al 1998 shi et al 2021 our previous study found that proteiniphilum would release a large number of amino acids which could be further degraded by aminobacterium shi et al 2021 in other words the capacity of aminobacterium in protein degradation was better than that of proteiniphilum hence the microbes enriched by hydrochar and biochar had different capacity to ferment protein to produce organic acids which led to different protein utilization and different promotion effect of methane yield although the abundance of aminobacterium in hc2 was lower than that in hc3 the abundance of proteiniphilum in hc2 was higher than that in hc3 which might compensate for the ability of hc2 to hydrolyze protein thus making the degradation of soluble protein in hc2 group faster the genera lutispora which was related to the degradation of polysaccharides was significantly enriched upon the addition of carbon based materials especially in hc2 group p 0 05 izquierdo et al 2010 the significant enrichment of lutispora in hc2 might explain the fast degradation of soluble carbohydrates in hc2 group which might be related with the highest methane yield the higher abundance of lutispora in bc7 group also corresponded to its faster degradation rate this observation might explain the enhancement of methane yield in carbon based materials group syntrophaceticus p 0 05 and tepidanaerobacter were enriched in control group which had acetate oxidizing ability in co cultivation with hydrogenotrophic methanogens to produce methane manzoor et al 2015 westerholm et al 2011 syntrophomonas was a syntrophic microorganism that can generate electrons and utilize butyric acid shi et al 2021 thus its enrichment could contribute to the faster scfas consumption syntrophomonas had the higher abundance in hydrochar group especially in hc3 group it was worth noting that syntrophomonas was also enriched in biochar groups but its abundance was the lowest in bc7 group gelria a type of syntrophic oxidizing bacterium also showed the highest abundance in bc5 groups ma et al 2020 notably compared with the biochar group the abundance of these bacteria with organic acid oxidation function in biochar group was relatively low these bacteria might be involved in the oxidation of acetate to produce h2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis or mediation of diet in all groups archaea were mainly composed of methanosarcina methanobacterium and methanoculleus fig 2 methanogens were directly related to methane production therefore promoting the growth of the methanogens was the key factor in the superior methanogenic performance methanosarcina was the most dominant methanogens in all groups except for control group methanosarcina was the only genus that can use the three methane metabolism pathways to methanogenesis rotaru et al 2014 subspecies of methanosarcina has been well proven to be able to perform diet rotaru et al 2014 shi et al 2021 meanwhile the menaquinone in syntrophomonas could act as a conduit to facilitate electron transfer between syntrophic microorganisms which might be related with diet since the previous studies demonstrated that syntrophomonas was involved in diet mediated syntrophic methanogenesis shi et al 2021 zhang and lu 2016 in addition as reported by our previous studies hydrochar could regulated the diet between syntrophomonas and methanosarcina and biochar could also stimulate diet to enhance syntrophic metabolism in both pure cultures and complex anaerobic systems chen et al 2014a shi et al 2021 therefore the existence of syntrophomonas and methanosarcina might indicate that the diet based methanogenic pathway had been established in this study and both hydrochar and biochar could facilitate diet it was worth noting that the abundance of syntrophomonas and methanosarcina was higher in hydrochar group therefore the facilitation of diet by carbon based materials might explain the observed enhancement in methane production rates based on the above observations it could be found that carbon based materials changed the microbial community structures and different biochar and hydrochar had different microbial community structures for the enhancement of methane yield the enriched functional microbes in the hydrochar group was aminobacterium while the enriched functional microbes in the biochar group was proteiniphilum the oxidation of organic acids and the interaction of syntrophic microorganisms also affect methane yield the electron transfer from syntrophomonas to methanosarcina seems to explain the enhancement of methane production rate compared with biochar hydrochar was more efficient in promoting diet generally the distribution of these microbes in hydrochar and biochar groups was different however they played the important role in promoting methane production therefore it could be inferred that the influence mechanism of hydrochar and biochar on microbes was different and the enriched microorganisms had the specificity on degrading some organic compounds resulting in the production of differential intermediate metabolites therefore more detailed microbial metabolite profiles need to be investigated through metabolomics additionally whether there were microbial metabolites related to diet was also worth further exploring 3 4 metabolic response to carbon based materials a total of 340 metabolites were identified in the sludge samples and semiquantified by non targeted metabolomics pca and pls da were performed on the lc ms data set by the use of metaboanalyst which provides the clustering information among groups figure s4 chong et al 2019 the two score plots shows that all hydrochar and biochar groups were noticeably separated from the control group these results suggested that both hydrochar and biochar altered the low molecular weight metabolic profiles metabolites in ad system mainly derived from substances synthesized by microbial activities and intermediates produced by organic degradation while metabolites from both sources were driven by microbes therefore the results indicated that carbon based materials altered the metabolic processes within microbes on the basis of the parameter vip variable of importance in prediction 1 32 metabolites with important variations that led to separation of the control and carbon based material groups were identified figure s5 in order to further distinguish the response of hydrochar and biochar the metabolic data set of hydrochar versus control and biochar versus control pls da analyses were performed separately figure s6 and s7 the multivariate statistical results revealed the differentially regulated metabolites induced by hydrochar or biochar meanwhile an overlap of differentially affected metabolites was observed in response to hydrochar and biochar 10 metabolite changes indicating that hydrochar and biochar may have the same impact on some metabolites 3 4 1 shared metabolites changes induced by both hydrochar and biochar a number of metabolites 5 of 10 metabolites were fatty acids and their precursors including butyric acid succinic acid 2 amino muconic acid 2 hydroxy tricosanoic acid and 21 hydroxy heneicosanoic acid fig 3 it was noteworthy that the five metabolites were all important intermediate products in methanogenesis and their contents in hc2 group were the lowest this observation suggests that hc2 more effectively promoted the conversion and degradation of intermediate products this could be the reasons that the methane production rate was the highest in hc2 group it should be noted that the microbial communities enriched by hydrochar hc2 and hc3 were almost the same however the content of the five metabolites seemed to be the highest in hc3 group which indicated that different hydrochar can induce different changes in metabolites succinic acid was an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle which was significantly reduced in carbon based material groups especially in hc2 group p 0 05 tca cycle was the final metabolic pathway of carbohydrates lipids and proteins and the down regulation of its intermediate indicated rapid consumption of nutrients carbon based materials were likely to accelerate the conversion of nutrients to produce more energy and methanogenic precursors butyric acid can be activated to acetoacetyl coa which can be further transformed to acetate with atp production shi et al 2021 the reduction of butyric acid indicated the positive impact of carbon based materials on the degradation of fatty acid l glutamine can participate in the biosynthesis of streptomycin and secondary metabolites and was closely related to the enzymes that degrade amino acid ahlert et al 1997 the up regulation of l glutamine in carbon based material groups indicated the activation of amino acid degradation pathway with certain members of the microbial community previous results indicated that aminobacterium was enriched in carbon materials groups and therefore the up regulation of l glutamine might be related to the increased methane production rate it should be noted that the up regulation trend of l glutamine was not consistent with the abundance of aminobacterium which suggested that other members of the anaerobic system had the function of amino acid degradation 1 phenylethylamine and 5 4 dimethyl 6 hydroxyluteolinidin were also differential metabolites in both hydrochar group and biochar group the significant down regulation of 5 4 dimethyl 6 hydroxyluteolinidin in carbon based material groups indicated that it is a specific indicator metabolite in methanogenesis the split agent 1 phenylethylamine could be oxidized into benzoic acid which could cause harm to methanogens wang et al 2012 biochar promoted the up regulation of 1 phenylethylamine however the methanogenesis in the biochar group did not seem to be inhibited previous studies have shown that due to the surface functional groups and efficient adsorption capacity of biochar they can be used as adsorbents to remove benzoic acid in environmental systems liu et al 2017 therefore depending on the adsorption capacity of biochar and the enriched microorganisms the toxic intermediate metabolites can be effectively degraded for subsequent microbial growth or metabolic activities 1 phenylethylamine was also increased exposure to hc2 the up regulation of 1 phenylethylamine may indicate that hydrochar prepared at 260 c could alleviate the inhibition of benzoic acid nadh is an important electron carrier of the cellular electron transport chain and its content has a strong correlation with bacterial metabolic activity wos and pollard 2009 in this study the level of nadh was significantly up regulated in hydrochar and biochar groups p 0 05 these carbon based materials enriched more electron carrier to participate in the redox reaction thereby stimulating the active metabolism state of microorganisms moreover as the prosthetic group of nadh dehydrogenase flavin mononucleotide fmn s strong oxidizing property allow it to participate in the transfer of electrons light et al 2018 the level of fmn was also significantly up regulated in carbon based material groups p 0 05 previous studies have shown that the chemical reactivities of hydrochar and biochar were normally related to their redox active moieties i e oxygen containing functional groups ren et al 2020 saquing et al 2016 through its chemical reactivity hydrochar and biochar can shuttle electron transfer from microbes to extracellular electron acceptors the abundance of oxygen based functional groups of carbon based materials was proportional to the level of nadh and fmn figure s2 therefore it can be speculated that the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of carbon based materials improved the metabolism state of microbes and then the microbes responded in the form of releasing more biomolecules interestingly the abundance of oxygen containing functional groups was positively correlated with methane production rate therefore it could be further speculated that the release of nadh and fmn by microorganisms induced by hydrochar and biochar could promote the methane production rate by promoting extracellular electron transfer 3 4 2 hydrochar specific and biochar specific metabolic changes importantly some unique metabolites would be induced by specific hydrochar or biochar figure s6 and s7 a noteworthy phenomenon was that the disorder of the change trends of saturated fatty acids gallic acid xanthurenic acid levulinic acid fumaric acid palmitic acid tricosanoic acid and lithocholic acid of hydrochar specific or biochar specific which had no significant correlation with the carbon based materials and its preparation temperature the up or down regulation of saturated fatty acids might indicate the strategy of anaerobic microbes to affect the accumulation or degradation of acid through fatty acids metabolism the different functional microbes enriched by hydrochar or biochar could produce different types of specific saturated fatty acids which led to the fluctuation of the level of saturated fatty acids additionally the metabolites with important variations that led to separation of the control and carbon based material groups deserved further analysis fig 4 phenol as a persistent pollutant in urban solid waste inhibits ad performance and has toxic effects on methanogens usman et al 2020 the enrichment of bacteroides was related with the degradation of phenolic organics muñoz sierra et al 2019 the increase of bacteroides in biochar groups was accompanied by the down regulation of phenol which was consistent with the above inference the significant up regulation of phenol in the hc3 group might affect the methanogenesis process and led to a longer lag period table s2 p 0 05 however usman et al 2020 found that hydrochar could also increase the degradation of phenolic compounds and resulted in higher methane yield the methanogenesis of the hc3 group was not inhibited by phenol hence other enriched microbes in the hc3 group might have performed the function of phenol degradation pyridoxal was a form of vitamin b6 which can interact with atp to form active pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate mittenhuber 2001 they were coenzymes of various transaminase enzymes and catalyze the conversion of amino acids between amino acids and keto acids the metabolites upregulated showed that carbon based materials had the capacity to accelerate fatty acid and vitamin b6 metabolism and the level of pyridoxal in hydrochar group was slightly lower than that in biochar group p 0 05 interestingly as the differential metabolites in the hydrochar 4 pyridoxic acid was the final excretory product of vitamin b6 stanulović et al 1976 in other words pyridoxal was the precursor of 4 pyridoxic acid the up regulation of 4 pyridoxic acid in hydrochar group indicated that hydrochar promoted microbial community activity to metabolize vitamin b6 p 0 05 generally the above results indicated that metabolome can reveal important information about how anaerobic microbes respond to hydrochar and biochar at the molecular level including the metabolic mechanism of the substrate metabolomics revealed that metabolite profiles were altered by carbon based materials indicating that the metabolic processes and activities of microbial community were disturbed conclusions the present study showed that both hydrochar and biochar promoted ad of hps however hydrochar had better performance than biochar considering higher surface oxygen containing functional groups in addition it was found that hydrochar and biochar had different influences on the microbial communities which could be related with the different promotion effects on ad of hps these changes in the microbes may promote methanogenic performance by affecting key functions involving the hydrolysis of macromolecular organics fatty acid consumption and electron transfer metabolomics was proved to be a powerful tool and revealed the mode of microbes that regulated ad performance under the enhanced action by hydrochar and biochar it can be seen that fatty acid and amino acid were all abundantly represented in hydrochar and biochar groups these metabolites provided the anaerobic microbes with abundant sources of carbon and energy through its chemical reaction hydrochar and biochar can transfer electrons from electron donors to acceptors the level of nadh and fmn revealed by metabolomics analysis illustrated the important role of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of carbon based materials in promoting ad overall the unique combination of microbiome and metabolomics provided a comprehensive understanding of the ecological impact of carbon based materials and can be a useful strategy for analyzing the impact of other exogenous substances on ad performances

16607,hydrothermal pretreatment of waste activated sludge was could eliminate the rate limiting step of anaerobic digestion ad hydrolysis however the high organic loading rate may cause acid accumulation thus leading to an unstable system this study compared the effect of different hydrochar hc2 260 c and hc3 320 c and biochar bc5 500 c and bc7 700 c on ad of hydrothermal pretreated was hps results demonstrated that hydrochar was superior to biochar in the methane yield and production rate especially hc2 hc2 had the highest surface oxygen containing functional groups that could facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer diet the enhanced methane yield was related with the increased protein utilization and hydrochar and biochar enriched different microbes related to protein degradation metabolomic analysis showed the significantly changed metabolites induced by hydrochar and biochar were involved in fatty acids and amino acids related metabolism indicating the rapid conversion of intermediated products which was consistent with the microbial community structure results hydrochar and biochar also induced upregulation of metabolites related to microbial metabolic activity and extracellular electron transfer although biochar induced the same metabolic changes the alterations of these metabolites were weaker than those of hydrochar the results of this study offered new insights into the molecular mechanisms of enhanced ad of hps by hydrochar and biochar graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metabolomic analysis 16s rrna transcript analysis hydrochar biochar methane 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is produced from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps which may become serious secondary pollution if it is not properly treated and disposed usman et al 2020 anaerobic digestion ad is widely used to treat was and recover energy in the form of biogas however was is mainly composed of microbial cells wang et al 2014 a large number of organic components lipid proteins and carbohydrates in microbial cells are difficult to release in hydrolysis step resulting in low efficiency during ad of was yan et al 2020 therefore chemical mechanical and thermal pretreatments were used to improve degradation efficiency burger and parker 2013 chen et al 2021 therein hydrothermal pretreatment at a specific temperature and pressure can effectively collapse sludge and improve the bioavailability of organic wastes shi et al 2021 hydrothermal pretreatment at 170 c and 0 5 h has been recognized as an appropriate condition and widely used in engineering li et al 2017 however high concentrations of potential inhibitors could cause system instability especially the easily accumulated high concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfas at high organic loading rates in this case it is important to enhance the methane production rate to fast degrade the accumulated vfas recently measures to add exogenous materials to increase the methane production rate and improve the stability of ad have begun to receive much attention ren et al 2020 usman et al 2020 zero valent iron and magnetite nanoparticles could stimulate methanogenesis under ammonia inhibition condition during the hydrothermal pretreatment and ad integrated process yan et al 2020 granular activated carbon could also effectively enhance methanogenesis by virtue of its capacity of adsorption and enrichment of syntrophic microbes martins et al 2018 it was noting that the above materials have also been proved to promote direct interspecies electron transfer diet between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens martins et al 2018 yan et al 2020 diet establishment was often closely related to the enhancement of methane production rate notwithstanding these materials were relatively costly and it is necessary to develop more low cost material to improve methane production rate biochar is produced by dry pyrolysis in an oxygen free atmosphere and hydrochar is prepared by hydrothermal liquefaction htl in the presence of hot and pressurized water wang et al 2018 as relatively inexpensive carbonaceous solid products hydrochar and biochar which are obtained from biomass through thermal chemical conversion have been confirmed to promote methane production rate chen et al 2014a usman et al 2020 biochar derived from rice straw and manure could stimulate methane production rate with ethanol as the substrate by facilitating the diet between methanogens and geobacteraceae yuan et al 2018 the oxygen based functional groups on the surface of hydrochar were related to the enhanced methane production rate of glucose ren et al 2020 both hydrochar and biochar can be used as the mediator of electron transfer which accept electrons released by electroactive bacteria by oxidizing organic compounds and donate electrons to methanogens the preparation conditions of biochar and hydrochar are different and therefore their physical and chemical properties are also significantly different for example compared with biochar hydrochar usually has lower ash content surface area porosity and electrical conductivity fuertes et al 2010 ren et al 2020 obviously these differences between hydrochar and biochar would directly affect their efficiency in promoting ad efficiency however to the best of our knowledge the different promoting effects of hydrochar and biochar on ad of hydrothermal pretreated was have not been investigated and the microbial mechanism differences of hydrochar and biochar on ad of hydrothermal pretreated was hps remain to be elucidated both hydrochar and biochar may interact directly or indirectly with microbes during ad of hps and subsequently affect the metabolism of the microbes therefore monitoring metabolites can indirectly reflect changes in microbial metabolism metabolites are the final products of gene expressions and therefore variation in microbe s metabolite profiles can offer a chemical fingerprint of microbial functional status chen et al 2020 however previous studies have not investigated the changes of metabolites with the addition of hydrochar or biochar in ad of organic wastes 16s rrna gene sequencing is a widely used technique to provide information on the microbial community compositions in environmental samples compared with the 16s rrna gene set from the total genomic dna the 16s rrna transcript set from rna could exclude the interference of dormant or dead microbes to specifically provide insight in the metabolically active microbes campanaro et al 2018 given the known functions of these altered microbes researchers can make corresponding assumptions about the changes in biochemistry based on the above considerations the present study aimed to compare the different promotion effects of hydrochar and biochar on methane production from hps both high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna transcripts and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis were conducted to evaluate the different alterations in microbial community structures and metabolite profiles in responses to hydrochar and biochar the results of the present study provided new insights to enable the accurate assessment of the mechanism of enhanced ad of hps by hydrochar and biochar 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of hydrochar and biochar corn straw was used as the feedstock for the preparation of hydrochar and biochar since our preliminary experiment found that this biomass source had better capacity to promote methane production rate ren et al 2020 shi et al 2021 usman et al 2020 hydrochar was obtained by htl htl at different temperatures 260 c and 320 c hc2 and hc3 for 1 h was conducted in a pilot scale 3 l pressurized stirred tank reactor by keeping the same condition as our previous study shi et al 2021 the bio oil attached on the hydrochar was removed by using tetrahydrofuran biochar was obtained from pyrolysis at both 500 c and 700 c for 1 h bc5 and bc7 which was the common condition for the preparation of biochar chen et al 2014b all types of hydrochar and biochar were grounded and sieved 2 mm dried at 105 c for 24 h and stored in the dryer for further utilization the characteristics of hydrochar and biochar were shown in table s1 2 2 hps and inoculum was used in this study was collected from wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china hps was prepared in the same 3 l pressurized stirred tank reactor the desired temperature and reaction residence time were 170 c and 30 min respectively and the other reaction conditions were consistent with the preparation of hydrochar the inoculum was obtained from a mesophilic anaerobic digester treating cassava stillage the characteristics of inoculum were as follows total solids ts 35 6 1 7 g l volatile solids vs 28 5 0 8 g l and ph 7 30 0 05 the characteristics of hps were as follows ts 143 4 2 g l vs 55 7 4 g l and ph 6 65 0 07 2 3 experimental set up the effects of carbon based materials on the methane production were investigated in batch mode by using 118 ml serum bottles with a working volume of 40 ml each bottle contained 2 ml of inoculum 20 ml of hps and 18 ml of deionized water hydrochar or biochar was added to the bottles to a final concentration 10 g l which has been demonstrated to be the optimal concentration in previous studies luo et al 2015 ren et al 2020 the bottles without carbon based materials were used as control the solutions of sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid were used to adjust the initial ph of each bottle to 7 5 bottles were flushed with n2 for 5 min to maintain the anaerobic environment and then placed in an incubator at 37 c all the tests were prepared in sextuplicate three for gas measurement and the remaining three for other parameters i e vfas soluble protein soluble carbohydrate and ph solids samples were taken for rna and metabolite extraction when the active methane phases were achieved i e the methane production reached half of the maximum value around 100 ml ch4 g vs indicating vigorous microbial metabolism activity and a profitable amount of mrna expression the gompertz model was used to fit the measured methane production with hydrochar and biochar the analysis of methane content vfas concentration ts vs ph and characteristics of carbon based materials was described in the supporting methods 2 4 16s rrna transcript sequencing and analysis total rna was extracted from sludge using a ribopure rna purification kit ambion life technologies lithuania according to the manufacturer s guidelines then the extracted rna was subjected to dna removal and complementary dna cdna synthesis tiangen beijing china the quality and quantity of rna were checked using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa and dna contamination was detected by performing pcr reactions using the isolated rna samples the cdna with bacterial 16s rrna transcripts was amplified with the primers 338f and 806r targeting the v3 v4 region the raw sequence data were merged and then used for demultiplexing sequence quality control and feature table construction by qiime2 pipeline with the q2 dada2 plugin default values were selected for all parameters bolyen et al 2019 q2 dada2 was also used to generate amplicon sequence variants asv a pre trained naïve bayes classifies which was trained on the silva ssu database version 138 was applied to assign the asvs to taxonomic categories at different levels quast et al 2013 the 16s rrna transcript sequences have been deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession number sub10011081 2 5 lc ms based metabolomic analysis the sludge were harvested at 9000 g at 4 c for 5 min quenched in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c immediately sludge samples were resuspended in 200 μl of ultrapure water 4 c and sonicated using a tip sonicator scientz jy 92 iin then the samples were quenched using 60 v v cold methanol the samples were separated from the quenching solution by centrifuged at 13 900 g for 10 min at 4 c the sample was resuspended in 5 ml of 80 cold methanol and ultrasonicated at low temperature 4 c for 20 min subsequently the supernatant were collected after centrifugation at 10 000 g for 30 min a quality control qc sample was prepared by mixing aliquots of all samples a pooled sample to obtain the purified metabolites metabolomic analysis was carried out at room temperature 18 c under the condition of nitrogen flow drying the mass spectrometry data were collected using q exactive plus orbitrap mass spectrometer thermo fisher waltham ma the supernatant was loaded onto chromatographic column and eluted onto an orbitrap mass spectrometer with 50 acetonitrile nitrogen 99 999 was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 0 4 ml min through the column metabolites were analyzed in the positive ion and negative ion modes over the mass range of 60 1000 m z using a c18 column 100 2 1 mm 1 7 μm from waters corporation milford ma full scan and fragment spectra were collected at 70 000 and 17 500 resolution respectively three databases hmdb lipidmaps and metlin were used for tracking search to identify the measured metabolites 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different carbon based materials on hps ad 3 1 1 effects of carbon based material on methane production as shown in fig 1 all types of carbon based materials effectively promoted ad of hps however the promotion effects of the four carbon based materials on methane production were different the promotion effect of hydrochar on methane production was better than that of biochar the specific methane production rates rmax were increased by 49 8 and 34 3 for hc2 and hc3 respectively while the enhancement of rmax for bc5 and bc7 were 23 8 and 14 6 respectively table s2 the potential methane yields p were significantly increased by 25 6 24 6 13 3 and 4 74 in hc2 hc3 bc5 and bc7 groups respectively p 0 05 additionally adding carbon based materials also shortened the lag time it was worth pointing out that although the methane yields in hc2 and hc3 groups were almost the same the lag phase of hc2 group was lower than that of hc3 and the rmax of hc2 group was higher than that of hc3 therefore hc2 was the most effective carbon based material to promote ad of hps recently most studies paid attention on the effect of biochar on the ad performance however the above results showed that hydrochar was more effective in increasing both methane production rate and methane yield chen et al 2014a pan et al 2019 shen et al 2021 yuan et al 2018 in order to clarify the reasons the subsequent analysis investigated the effects of different carbon based materials on the performance of methane production from the perspectives of organic components degradation characteristics of the carbon based materials microbial community structures and microbial metabolites 3 1 2 transformation of organic components in ad with carbon based materials the transformation of organic components was tracked to provide insights into the different impacts of diverse carbon based materials on methane production soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vfas in hc2 group presented the lowest accumulation and fastest consumption rates fig 1 among all the groups the peak values of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vfas in hc2 group appeared earlier with lower concentration compared to the control and other carbon base material groups the capacity of hc2 to promote the consumption of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vfas was more prominent similar to hc2 the existence of hc3 also promoted the metabolism of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vfas although its effect on the degradation of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vfas was not as effective as hc2 it was better than biochar and control group it was worth noting that soluble proteins and soluble carbohydrates peaked earlier with lower concentration in bc7 group compared to bc5 group the degradation of soluble proteins and soluble carbohydrates in bc5 group even weakened than the control group although the existence of bc5 resulted in higher accumulation these intermediate products could be consumed rapidly nevertheless the accumulation of vfas in hc7 was higher than that in bc5 suggesting that bc7 was not as effective as bc5 in promoting the degradation of vfas in general both hydrochar and biochar could alleviate the inhibition of vfas and the effect of hydrochar was better than that of biochar especially hc2 as for biochar group bc5 exhibited superior effects over bc7 on the degradation of vfas additionally ph in the presence of hydrochar or biochar was higher than the control groups which was consistent with the lower concentration of accumulated vfas in carbon based material groups 3 2 characterization of carbon base materials by xps and ftir our previous study have shown that hydrochar increased methane production rate through diet mediated by surface oxygen containing functional groups ren et al 2020 other studies also suggested that the redox active moieties of biochar which was related to the oxygen containing functional groups was directly related to the promotion of methane production rate saquing et al 2016 shen et al 2021 thus the surface functional groups of hydrochar and biochar were characterized by xps and ftir to identify the active source that may relate to the improvement of methane production as shown in figure s1 the adsorption peak at about 3420 3448 cm 1 was assigned to the oh stretching vibration of both carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and this peak was stronger for hc2 than that for other carbon based materials the band at 2907 2941 cm 1 was ascribed to aliphatic ch stretching vibration compared with biochar the intensity of this peak was also higher in hydrochar especially in hc2 the bands at 1604 1618 cm 1 corresponded to c o carbonyl ester or carboxyl groups the peak at 1389 1448 cm 1 were attributed to c c group vibration of aromatic structure the bands in the 1022 1059 cm 1 region mainly related to co stretching and oh bending vibrations the intensity of these bands was higher in hydrochar than that in biochar the redox active oxygen containing functional groups include co c o and coh zhang et al 2019 the analysis of the ftir spectra indicated abundant amount of oxygen containing functional groups existed on the surface of hydrochar and biochar and the intensity of these groups was higher on the surface of hydrochar especially in hc2 this observation might explain the highest capability for the enhancement of methane production rate by hc2 the abundance of oxygen containing functional groups was further determined by xps and it was found that the abundance of oxygen containing functional groups in hc2 was the highest table s3 meanwhile the oxygen containing functional groups had the positive correlation with methane production rate r 2 0 9761 p 0 05 figure s2 which confirmed that the previously reported redox active moieties of carbon based materials was proportional to the enhanced methane production rates ren et al 2020 ftir and xps characterizations revealed that the hydrothermal and pyrolysis temperatures greatly affected the abundances of surface oxygen containing groups the differences in surface oxygen containing functional groups of hydrochar and biochar determined the different promotion effects on ad of hps this observation might be explained by the change of molecular structure caused by temperature keiluweit et al 2010 found a variation of molecular structure of biochar from plant biomass with temperature the characteristic of high temperature carbon based materials was that there were less labile compounds at the surface of particle bruun et al 2011 on the contrary slow hydrothermal or pyrolysis at low temperature produced more biochar or hydrochar with diverse chemical groups including oxygen containing functional groups which were related with the promotion of the methane production chen et al 2019 overall our findings showed that the lower the preparation temperature the more abundant functional groups on the surface of carbon based materials meanwhile the content of oxygen containing functional groups was positively correlated with the improvement of methanogenesis 3 3 metabolically active microbial community alteration 3 3 1 effects of carbon based materials on microbial community composition at the phylum level the addition of hydrochar and biochar significantly altered the microbial community structure supporting notes figure s3 to better understand the effects of different carbon based materials on microbial community composition the phylum level classification was first analyzed firmicutes synergistetes bacteroidetes and cloacimonetes presented significant differences among all the groups firmicutes was the most abundant phyla in all the groups which accounted for 78 6 56 2 54 8 60 4 and 62 7 in the control hc2 hc3 bc5 and bc7 groups respectively fig 2 it was obvious that the abundance of firmicutes was significantly decreased after the addition of carbon based materials p 0 05 firmicutes was reported to be the dominant species in biogas reactors shi et al 2021 the phylum firmicutes includes species with a wide range of functions such as the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins the fermentation of sugars and the production of acids campanaro et al 2020 the abundance of synergistetes was significantly increased in hydrochar group 23 8 as compared with control 4 47 and biochar groups 5 25 p 0 05 the microbes in phylum synergistetes have the ability to degrade proteins peptides and amino acids jumas bilak and marchandin 2014 the abundance of bacteroidetes in biochar group 20 7 was also significantly higher than that in control 9 58 and hydrochar 8 02 groups p 0 05 meanwhile the abundance of cloacimonetes was more abundant in bc7 group p 0 05 cloacimonetes contained the members that could utilize the carbon and energy produced from the fermentation of amino acids pelletier et al 2008 compared to the control group the abundance of euryarchaeota mainly methanogens was increased in carbon based material groups which might be related to the enhanced methane production efficiency taken together carbon based materials had significant effects on microbial communities at the phylum level 3 3 2 the different effects of carbon based materials at the genus level genus level classification was further conducted to have a deep insight of the changes of microbial communities induced by carbon based materials an amino acid degradation bacterium aminobacterium belonging to aminobacterium genus phylum synergistetes was the most abundant genus in hydrochar group especially in hc3 group p 0 05 fig 2 the proteolytic bacterium proteiniphilum belonging to bacteroidetes had the greatest abundance in biochar group 13 6 17 7 especially in bc7 group both of them played important roles in hydrolysis of protein and their low abundance in bc5 group might explain the delay of soluble protein peak baena et al 1998 shi et al 2021 our previous study found that proteiniphilum would release a large number of amino acids which could be further degraded by aminobacterium shi et al 2021 in other words the capacity of aminobacterium in protein degradation was better than that of proteiniphilum hence the microbes enriched by hydrochar and biochar had different capacity to ferment protein to produce organic acids which led to different protein utilization and different promotion effect of methane yield although the abundance of aminobacterium in hc2 was lower than that in hc3 the abundance of proteiniphilum in hc2 was higher than that in hc3 which might compensate for the ability of hc2 to hydrolyze protein thus making the degradation of soluble protein in hc2 group faster the genera lutispora which was related to the degradation of polysaccharides was significantly enriched upon the addition of carbon based materials especially in hc2 group p 0 05 izquierdo et al 2010 the significant enrichment of lutispora in hc2 might explain the fast degradation of soluble carbohydrates in hc2 group which might be related with the highest methane yield the higher abundance of lutispora in bc7 group also corresponded to its faster degradation rate this observation might explain the enhancement of methane yield in carbon based materials group syntrophaceticus p 0 05 and tepidanaerobacter were enriched in control group which had acetate oxidizing ability in co cultivation with hydrogenotrophic methanogens to produce methane manzoor et al 2015 westerholm et al 2011 syntrophomonas was a syntrophic microorganism that can generate electrons and utilize butyric acid shi et al 2021 thus its enrichment could contribute to the faster scfas consumption syntrophomonas had the higher abundance in hydrochar group especially in hc3 group it was worth noting that syntrophomonas was also enriched in biochar groups but its abundance was the lowest in bc7 group gelria a type of syntrophic oxidizing bacterium also showed the highest abundance in bc5 groups ma et al 2020 notably compared with the biochar group the abundance of these bacteria with organic acid oxidation function in biochar group was relatively low these bacteria might be involved in the oxidation of acetate to produce h2 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis or mediation of diet in all groups archaea were mainly composed of methanosarcina methanobacterium and methanoculleus fig 2 methanogens were directly related to methane production therefore promoting the growth of the methanogens was the key factor in the superior methanogenic performance methanosarcina was the most dominant methanogens in all groups except for control group methanosarcina was the only genus that can use the three methane metabolism pathways to methanogenesis rotaru et al 2014 subspecies of methanosarcina has been well proven to be able to perform diet rotaru et al 2014 shi et al 2021 meanwhile the menaquinone in syntrophomonas could act as a conduit to facilitate electron transfer between syntrophic microorganisms which might be related with diet since the previous studies demonstrated that syntrophomonas was involved in diet mediated syntrophic methanogenesis shi et al 2021 zhang and lu 2016 in addition as reported by our previous studies hydrochar could regulated the diet between syntrophomonas and methanosarcina and biochar could also stimulate diet to enhance syntrophic metabolism in both pure cultures and complex anaerobic systems chen et al 2014a shi et al 2021 therefore the existence of syntrophomonas and methanosarcina might indicate that the diet based methanogenic pathway had been established in this study and both hydrochar and biochar could facilitate diet it was worth noting that the abundance of syntrophomonas and methanosarcina was higher in hydrochar group therefore the facilitation of diet by carbon based materials might explain the observed enhancement in methane production rates based on the above observations it could be found that carbon based materials changed the microbial community structures and different biochar and hydrochar had different microbial community structures for the enhancement of methane yield the enriched functional microbes in the hydrochar group was aminobacterium while the enriched functional microbes in the biochar group was proteiniphilum the oxidation of organic acids and the interaction of syntrophic microorganisms also affect methane yield the electron transfer from syntrophomonas to methanosarcina seems to explain the enhancement of methane production rate compared with biochar hydrochar was more efficient in promoting diet generally the distribution of these microbes in hydrochar and biochar groups was different however they played the important role in promoting methane production therefore it could be inferred that the influence mechanism of hydrochar and biochar on microbes was different and the enriched microorganisms had the specificity on degrading some organic compounds resulting in the production of differential intermediate metabolites therefore more detailed microbial metabolite profiles need to be investigated through metabolomics additionally whether there were microbial metabolites related to diet was also worth further exploring 3 4 metabolic response to carbon based materials a total of 340 metabolites were identified in the sludge samples and semiquantified by non targeted metabolomics pca and pls da were performed on the lc ms data set by the use of metaboanalyst which provides the clustering information among groups figure s4 chong et al 2019 the two score plots shows that all hydrochar and biochar groups were noticeably separated from the control group these results suggested that both hydrochar and biochar altered the low molecular weight metabolic profiles metabolites in ad system mainly derived from substances synthesized by microbial activities and intermediates produced by organic degradation while metabolites from both sources were driven by microbes therefore the results indicated that carbon based materials altered the metabolic processes within microbes on the basis of the parameter vip variable of importance in prediction 1 32 metabolites with important variations that led to separation of the control and carbon based material groups were identified figure s5 in order to further distinguish the response of hydrochar and biochar the metabolic data set of hydrochar versus control and biochar versus control pls da analyses were performed separately figure s6 and s7 the multivariate statistical results revealed the differentially regulated metabolites induced by hydrochar or biochar meanwhile an overlap of differentially affected metabolites was observed in response to hydrochar and biochar 10 metabolite changes indicating that hydrochar and biochar may have the same impact on some metabolites 3 4 1 shared metabolites changes induced by both hydrochar and biochar a number of metabolites 5 of 10 metabolites were fatty acids and their precursors including butyric acid succinic acid 2 amino muconic acid 2 hydroxy tricosanoic acid and 21 hydroxy heneicosanoic acid fig 3 it was noteworthy that the five metabolites were all important intermediate products in methanogenesis and their contents in hc2 group were the lowest this observation suggests that hc2 more effectively promoted the conversion and degradation of intermediate products this could be the reasons that the methane production rate was the highest in hc2 group it should be noted that the microbial communities enriched by hydrochar hc2 and hc3 were almost the same however the content of the five metabolites seemed to be the highest in hc3 group which indicated that different hydrochar can induce different changes in metabolites succinic acid was an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle which was significantly reduced in carbon based material groups especially in hc2 group p 0 05 tca cycle was the final metabolic pathway of carbohydrates lipids and proteins and the down regulation of its intermediate indicated rapid consumption of nutrients carbon based materials were likely to accelerate the conversion of nutrients to produce more energy and methanogenic precursors butyric acid can be activated to acetoacetyl coa which can be further transformed to acetate with atp production shi et al 2021 the reduction of butyric acid indicated the positive impact of carbon based materials on the degradation of fatty acid l glutamine can participate in the biosynthesis of streptomycin and secondary metabolites and was closely related to the enzymes that degrade amino acid ahlert et al 1997 the up regulation of l glutamine in carbon based material groups indicated the activation of amino acid degradation pathway with certain members of the microbial community previous results indicated that aminobacterium was enriched in carbon materials groups and therefore the up regulation of l glutamine might be related to the increased methane production rate it should be noted that the up regulation trend of l glutamine was not consistent with the abundance of aminobacterium which suggested that other members of the anaerobic system had the function of amino acid degradation 1 phenylethylamine and 5 4 dimethyl 6 hydroxyluteolinidin were also differential metabolites in both hydrochar group and biochar group the significant down regulation of 5 4 dimethyl 6 hydroxyluteolinidin in carbon based material groups indicated that it is a specific indicator metabolite in methanogenesis the split agent 1 phenylethylamine could be oxidized into benzoic acid which could cause harm to methanogens wang et al 2012 biochar promoted the up regulation of 1 phenylethylamine however the methanogenesis in the biochar group did not seem to be inhibited previous studies have shown that due to the surface functional groups and efficient adsorption capacity of biochar they can be used as adsorbents to remove benzoic acid in environmental systems liu et al 2017 therefore depending on the adsorption capacity of biochar and the enriched microorganisms the toxic intermediate metabolites can be effectively degraded for subsequent microbial growth or metabolic activities 1 phenylethylamine was also increased exposure to hc2 the up regulation of 1 phenylethylamine may indicate that hydrochar prepared at 260 c could alleviate the inhibition of benzoic acid nadh is an important electron carrier of the cellular electron transport chain and its content has a strong correlation with bacterial metabolic activity wos and pollard 2009 in this study the level of nadh was significantly up regulated in hydrochar and biochar groups p 0 05 these carbon based materials enriched more electron carrier to participate in the redox reaction thereby stimulating the active metabolism state of microorganisms moreover as the prosthetic group of nadh dehydrogenase flavin mononucleotide fmn s strong oxidizing property allow it to participate in the transfer of electrons light et al 2018 the level of fmn was also significantly up regulated in carbon based material groups p 0 05 previous studies have shown that the chemical reactivities of hydrochar and biochar were normally related to their redox active moieties i e oxygen containing functional groups ren et al 2020 saquing et al 2016 through its chemical reactivity hydrochar and biochar can shuttle electron transfer from microbes to extracellular electron acceptors the abundance of oxygen based functional groups of carbon based materials was proportional to the level of nadh and fmn figure s2 therefore it can be speculated that the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of carbon based materials improved the metabolism state of microbes and then the microbes responded in the form of releasing more biomolecules interestingly the abundance of oxygen containing functional groups was positively correlated with methane production rate therefore it could be further speculated that the release of nadh and fmn by microorganisms induced by hydrochar and biochar could promote the methane production rate by promoting extracellular electron transfer 3 4 2 hydrochar specific and biochar specific metabolic changes importantly some unique metabolites would be induced by specific hydrochar or biochar figure s6 and s7 a noteworthy phenomenon was that the disorder of the change trends of saturated fatty acids gallic acid xanthurenic acid levulinic acid fumaric acid palmitic acid tricosanoic acid and lithocholic acid of hydrochar specific or biochar specific which had no significant correlation with the carbon based materials and its preparation temperature the up or down regulation of saturated fatty acids might indicate the strategy of anaerobic microbes to affect the accumulation or degradation of acid through fatty acids metabolism the different functional microbes enriched by hydrochar or biochar could produce different types of specific saturated fatty acids which led to the fluctuation of the level of saturated fatty acids additionally the metabolites with important variations that led to separation of the control and carbon based material groups deserved further analysis fig 4 phenol as a persistent pollutant in urban solid waste inhibits ad performance and has toxic effects on methanogens usman et al 2020 the enrichment of bacteroides was related with the degradation of phenolic organics muñoz sierra et al 2019 the increase of bacteroides in biochar groups was accompanied by the down regulation of phenol which was consistent with the above inference the significant up regulation of phenol in the hc3 group might affect the methanogenesis process and led to a longer lag period table s2 p 0 05 however usman et al 2020 found that hydrochar could also increase the degradation of phenolic compounds and resulted in higher methane yield the methanogenesis of the hc3 group was not inhibited by phenol hence other enriched microbes in the hc3 group might have performed the function of phenol degradation pyridoxal was a form of vitamin b6 which can interact with atp to form active pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate mittenhuber 2001 they were coenzymes of various transaminase enzymes and catalyze the conversion of amino acids between amino acids and keto acids the metabolites upregulated showed that carbon based materials had the capacity to accelerate fatty acid and vitamin b6 metabolism and the level of pyridoxal in hydrochar group was slightly lower than that in biochar group p 0 05 interestingly as the differential metabolites in the hydrochar 4 pyridoxic acid was the final excretory product of vitamin b6 stanulović et al 1976 in other words pyridoxal was the precursor of 4 pyridoxic acid the up regulation of 4 pyridoxic acid in hydrochar group indicated that hydrochar promoted microbial community activity to metabolize vitamin b6 p 0 05 generally the above results indicated that metabolome can reveal important information about how anaerobic microbes respond to hydrochar and biochar at the molecular level including the metabolic mechanism of the substrate metabolomics revealed that metabolite profiles were altered by carbon based materials indicating that the metabolic processes and activities of microbial community were disturbed conclusions the present study showed that both hydrochar and biochar promoted ad of hps however hydrochar had better performance than biochar considering higher surface oxygen containing functional groups in addition it was found that hydrochar and biochar had different influences on the microbial communities which could be related with the different promotion effects on ad of hps these changes in the microbes may promote methanogenic performance by affecting key functions involving the hydrolysis of macromolecular organics fatty acid consumption and electron transfer metabolomics was proved to be a powerful tool and revealed the mode of microbes that regulated ad performance under the enhanced action by hydrochar and biochar it can be seen that fatty acid and amino acid were all abundantly represented in hydrochar and biochar groups these metabolites provided the anaerobic microbes with abundant sources of carbon and energy through its chemical reaction hydrochar and biochar can transfer electrons from electron donors to acceptors the level of nadh and fmn revealed by metabolomics analysis illustrated the important role of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of carbon based materials in promoting ad overall the unique combination of microbiome and metabolomics provided a comprehensive understanding of the ecological impact of carbon based materials and can be a useful strategy for analyzing the impact of other exogenous substances on ad performances

16608,molybdenum disulfide mos2 poses great potential in water treatment as a popular transition metal dichalcogenide arousing considerable concern regarding its fates and risk in aquatic environments this study revealed that the interplay with extracellular polymeric substances eps of freshwater algae significantly changed the properties and toxicity of mos2 to aquatic fish the predominant binding of aromatic compounds polysaccharides and carboxyl rich proteins in eps on the 1t polymorph of mos2 via hydrophilic effects and the preferential adsorption of carboxylic groups contributed to morphological alterations structural disorders band gap and phase alterations and the attenuated aggregation of mos2 in aqueous solutions electron charge transfer and n π interactions with eps decreased the catalytic activity of mos2 by inhibiting its capability of generating reactive intermediates the dissolution of mos2 slowed down after interacting with eps from 0 089 to 0 045 mg l per day owing to rapid initial oxidation i e forming mo o bond and carbon grafting notably the morphological and structural alterations after eps binding alleviated the toxicity e g malformation and oxidative stress of mos2 to infantile zebrafish our findings provide insights into the environmental fate and risk of mos2 by ubiquitous eps in natural waters serving as valuable information while developing water treatment processes accordingly graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aquatic environment engineered nanomaterials environmental fate environmental risk extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction recently molybdenum disulfide mos2 as a popular two dimensional 2d transition metal dichalcogenide tmd was discovered to display unique structure and activity arousing great enthusiasms for its wide application in energy storage lei et al 2018 electronics autere et al 2018 catalysis gupta and rao 2017 biomedicine leso et al 2019 and environmental protection i e wastewater treatment and disinfection liu et al 2016 wang and mi 2017 the increasing scientific and industrial applications would result in the inevitable release of mos2 to aquatic environments where they could pose great threats to the health of ecosystems guiney et al 2018 moreover natural processes e g molybdenum ore mining also lead to the generation of nano sized mos2 and expand its environmental capacity in waters krishnan et al 2019 in the last five years 7333 academic papers on mos2 were published according to the web of science the search date and search topic was september 1 2021 and molybdenum disulfide respectively among these studies many have reported the adverse effects of mos2 on aquatic organisms freshwater algae daphnia magna and zebrafish arefi oskoui et al 2021 li et al 2021 zou et al 2020a and concluded that mos2 is harmful to water ecosystem actually engineering nanomaterials enms would undergo physicochemical transformations after discharged to the environments which can alter their behaviors and risk however compared to other hot enms e g graphene titanium dioxide and copper nanoparticles adeleye et al 2014 adeleye and keller 2016 zhao et al 2014 the environmental processes and related impacts on the risks of mos2 were rarely concerned which deserve urgent investigations extracellular polymeric substances eps which are primarily from hydrobios and are composed of polysaccharides proteins lipids and other small molecules vo et al 2020 are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and are known to influence the fates and risk of enms adeleye et al 2014 louie et al 2016 for instance algal eps adsorption reduced the aggregation rate of silver nanoparticles agnps and increased their critical coagulation concentration adeleye and keller 2016 interactions with eps altered the surface topography and thickness of graphene oxide go nanoflakes and improved their colloidal stability causing negative biological effects on fish mu et al 2016 studies exploring the impacts of eps on the fates of enms revealed that intrinsic surface chemistry charge configuration and hydrophobicity of enms played crucial roles toward the interactions with eps adeleye and keller 2016 fulaz et al 2019 mos2 exists as a polymorph and displays diverse crystal structures including trigonal prismatic coordination and octahedral coordination kurapati et al 2016 it is unknown whether the proposed mechanisms are appropriate for mos2 because the structures and characteristics of mos2 are quite different from reported enms more importantly the modulation effects of eps on the toxicity of enms still remained not unified hessler et al 2012 mu et al 2016 therefore with the inevitable release of mos2 into the waters and great concerns were paid to its safety the basic interactions between mos2 and eps of waterborne organisms and how these interactions influence its fates morphology and stability etc and risk deserve further exploration mos2 with superior band gap structure displays high photochemical activity which was related to its environmental sustainability and oxidative damages to organisms by producing reactive oxygen species ros shang et al 2017 in the water mos2 will be inevitably exposed to active substances and light from natural sunlight or artificial irradiation monolayer mos2 can generate superoxide radicals o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh in aqueous solution under light irradiation shang et al 2017 humic acid ha reacted with mos2 leading to elevated peroxidase like activity and dispersibility zou et al 2018 both ha and fulvic acid can inhibit the generation of o2 and oh by mos2 in waters shang et al 2017 eps secreted by hydrophyte contain abundant charged functional groups such as cooh and och3 chakraborty et al 2021 of greatest concern is whether the energy transfer between eps and mos2 would occur and related chemical activities of mos2 would be altered in addition the covalent bonding and absence of lone electrons provide the ability for mos2 to resist ambient oxidation chhowalla et al 2013 in the presence of oxidants mos2 can be oxidized to form molybdate and sulfate wang et al 2016 zou et al 2019 therefore another key issue that remains unknown is whether the interactions of eps in the receiving water can impact the persistence i e dissolution of mos2 freshwater algae are ubiquitous in water ecosystem and eps are massively secreted which can sufficiently interact with enms adeleye and keller 2016 many studies have reported that mos2 exhibits toxicity to hydrophytes and fish li et al 2021 zou et al 2020a compared to the studies on mos2 alone the investigations on the risk of mos2 binding with eps in aquatic environments are more meaningful therefore this work investigated the impacts of eps derived from algae chlorella vulgaris on the topography structure colloidal dispersion chemical activity and stability of mos2 in waters zebrafish a model organism that universally coexists with algae in aquatic ecosystems was selected to explore the impacts of eps on the risk of mos2 while the underlying mechanisms associated with the alterations in the properties of mos2 were elucidated the findings have great implications for understanding the environmental behaviors and risks of tmds in water ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 extraction and characterization of the eps derived from freshwater algae soluble eps were extracted from the cultivation of chlorella vulgaris no fachb 8 which was purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china the microalgae were cultivated in blue green bg 11 medium and were kept in an illumination incubator 14 10 h light dark 25 0 c 80 humidity a chemical free and sonication based method was employed to extract eps from algae as described in the supplementary material sm meanwhile the content measurements of dissolved organic carbon doc total nitrogen carbohydrates and proteins in addition to the ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm suva280 zeta potential and surface chemistry of eps were also given in the sm 2 2 precipitation of mos2 in the presence of eps in aqueous media pristine mos2 chemically exfoliated single layer 99 no xf137 was purchased from nanjing xfnano tech co ltd china the mos2 was initially suspended in deionized water 500 mg l using ultrasonic dispersion 150 w in ice water and was centrifuged at 3000 g to separate it from inhomogeneous and large sized nps the precipitates were collected and lyophilized for the following tests eps concentration in water ecosystems would vary temporally and spatially based on water productivity and nutrient availability to analyze the mos2 eps interaction the mixed suspensions containing different concentrations 0 5 2 5 5 and 10 mg c l of eps and mos2 25 mg l were prepared and the ph of the matrices was adjusted to 7 4 7 5 using sodium 4 2 hydroxyethyl piperazine 1 ethanesulfonate all the experimental matrices were kept static in the dark for 72 h at room temperature to achieve adsorption equilibrium the mixtures were centrifuged at 10 000 g 4 c and the mos2 eps precipitates were successively collected washed and centrifuged the upper aqueous phase containing unbound eps was separated and doc concentration was measured 0 07 0 35 0 82 and 1 26 mg

analysis to explore the structural variation information of mos2 affected by eps synchronous and asynchronous two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos analyses were performed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir with the eps content as a perturbation mos2 concentration was 25 mg l and the eps concentration ranged from 0 5 to 10 mg c l the matrices ph 7 4 7 5 were kept under the dark for 72 h 150 rpm at 25 c the precipitates were then collected and freeze dried for the ftir measurement bruker tensor 27 germany specifically the mos2 or mos2 eps 0 3 mg were mixed with kbr powder 100 mg and pressed under the irradiation of an infrared lamp to eliminate the moisture influence each ftir spectra was recorded from 600 to 2400 cm 1 after an average of 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the synchronous and asynchronous 2dcos spectra were formed according to the method of noda and ozaki noda 2012 as shown in the sm 2 4 analysis of the eps composition bound to mos2 the fluorescence compositions of eps before and after interacting with mos2 were analyzed using three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 7100 hitachi japan as shown in the sm the molecules including proteins and small metabolites adsorbed on mos2 were identified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer lc ms ms thermo scientific usa and gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms agilent 5973 usa details of the separation procedures and ms analyses are described in the sm to evaluate the roles of the functional groups toward protein adsorption on mos2 the relative numbers of twenty amino acids and three functional groups cooh nh2 and sh groups in the identified proteins were counted based on the fasta files in the uniprot database see the sm 2 5 aggregation kinetics of mos2 in the presence of eps the aggregation experiments on mos2 were conducted at 25 c in the presence of eps 0 5 2 5 5 and 10 mg c l to prepare homogeneous suspensions and significantly observe the agglomeration of particles a relatively moderate concentration of mos2 at 10 mg l was selected in this assay the variations of hydrodynamic diameter d h in deionized water and electrolyte solutions 60 mm na or 1 mm ca2 were measured using dynamic light scattering dls malvern instruments uk equal volume 500 μl of mos2 or mos2 eps suspension was mixed with prepared solution deionized water nacl or cacl2 in a cuvette and was placed in dls instrument after vortexing the scattered light intensity at 90 was measured and each autocorrelation function was accumulated for 20 s in the initial aggregation process the initial aggregation stage was defined as the time from the initiation of the experiment t 0 to the time when the d h reached 1 5 fold higher than d h initial the whole measurements were conducted from 0 to 60 min and the initial aggregation rate k a was proportional to the initial rate of the increase in d h with time yang et al 2016 1 k a d d h t d t t 0 2 6 catalytic activity test and epr measurement to reveal the effect of eps binding on the chemical activity of mos2 the degradation tests of methyl orange were performed under simulated light irradiation using a xenon lamp 4 5 w m2 cel hxf300 ceaulight china to observe an obvious degradation phenomenon mos2 at a high dose 100 mg l was set in this test and the details were presented in the sm further the capability of mos2 25 mg l to generate reactive intermediates o2 oh and 1o2 before and after eps 10 mg l adsorption was determined using electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker e500 cw x band germany as displayed in the sm 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 0 2 m was used as a trapping agent of o2 and oh 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 0 2 m which can react with 1o2 to generate 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidone 1 oxyl tempo was used to monitor the 1o2 level 2 7 dissolution dynamics of the mos2 affected by eps

particles at the 7th 14th 21st 28th 35th 42nd 49th and 56th days through ultrafiltration centrifugation amicon ultra 15 3 kd millipore usa respectively the concentration of released mo species was quantified using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700 usa 2 8 exposure of nanomaterials to zebrafish embryos adult zebrafish ab strain were purchased from the zebrafish resource center wuhan china the zebrafish cultivation and embryo collection were shown in the sm for the toxicity experiments the nanomaterials were dispersed in e3 medium 5 mm nacl 0 33 mm cacl2 0 17 mm kcl 0 33 mm mgso4 ph 7 4 with an ice bath sonication for 20 min 150 w considering similar applications with other emerging enms e g agnps and titanium dioxide the environmental levels of mos2 should range from μg l to mg l gottschalk et al 2013 it was reported that mos2 at 1 10 mg l exhibited remarkable toxicity to organisms such as algae and zebrafish li et al 2021 zou et al 2020a hence to compare with recent toxicological studies of mos2 and other enms bour et al 2015 luo et al 2021 embryos were exposed to mos2 at 1 5 and 10 mg l for toxicity analyses given the temporally and spatially variation in natural aquatic environment adeleye and keller 2016 eps at 5 mg c l which is relatively realistic was selected embryos were exposed to e3 medium the control eps 5 mg c l mos2 1 10 mg l and mos2 eps 1 10 mg l mos2 5 mg c l eps from 2 5 h post fertilization hpf to 7 days post fertilization dpf at 28 c in an incubator spx 300i 180c boxun china under a 14 10 h light dark cycle to investigate the toxicity contributions of ionic release from mos2 100 μm na2moo4 corresponding mo content was 9 6 mg l which was higher than the levels of soluble mo released by mos2 in dissolution experiment was exposed to embryos as a control oxidative stress mitochondrial membrane potential mmp cellular content of mos2 and developmental index hatching rate heartbeats mortality and malformation rates in zebrafish larvae were determined see the sm all the zebrafish procedures were approved by the henan normal university animal care committee and were in line with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee 2 9 statistical analysis all the samples were performed in triplicate and the results were presented as the mean the standard deviation sd the statistical significance was evaluated using the one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s test a p value less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant ibm spss 22 0 statistical software was used for the statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 eps induced morphological and structural alterations of mos2 transmission electron microscope tem images revealed that mos2 and mos2 eps exhibit translucent sheet like structures fig 1 a 1d and their diameters were similar accounting for 278 3 and 261 1 nm fig s1 respectively the atomic layer distance was 0 261 nm which is in line with a recent study uhlig et al 2019 the thickness is 1 52 nm as shown in atomic force microscopy afm image fig 1e revealing the monolayer structure of pristine mos2 irregular pores and jagged edges on and around the sheets are ascribed to intrinsic defects of mos2 hong et al 2015 the increased thickness of mos2 eps 4 57 nm fig 1f revealed the morphological alterations of nanosheets which is similar to the surface adsorption of biomacromolecule on enms ouyang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 meanwhile raman spectrometry in fig 1g showed that the raman phonon modes at 385 0 cm 1 and 402 3 cm 1 are related to the in plane e 2g 1 and out of plane a 1g lattice vibrations of mos2 lee et al 2010 respectively a notable finding was that e 2g 1 and a 1g peaks exhibited red maximally 3 5 cm 1 and blue maximally 2 7 cm 1 shifts respectively with the increase in eps content this can be explained by the molecule adsorption the chemically adsorbed eps on mos2 suppressed the atomic vibration thereby leading to the shifted constant vibration force cho et al 2015 further the layer number of mos2 was relevant to the difference in the e 2g 1 and a 1g peak positions velicky et al 2016 the broadened a 1g e 2g 1 shift of mos2 eps 23 4 cm 1 implied that the nanosheets were transformed from single to multiple layer approximately 3 layers fig s2 which agrees with the afm results fig 1f uv vis spectra showed that pristine mos2 exhibited an obvious absorption band at 217 nm fig 1h which was associated with the plasmon resonances in the 1t phase of mos2 eda et al 2011 this peak was blue shifted especially in the presence of 10 mg c l eps 4 nm reflecting the variations in the electronic structure of mos2 after eps binding the characteristic peaks 440 610 and 670 nm related to the 2h phase of mos2 voiry et al 2015 had no remarkable alterations fig 1i signifying that the grafting of eps is energetically favorable on the 1t polymorph rather than 2h polymorph of mos2 further evidences for the structural alterations were provided by the xps spectra fig 1j for the pristine mos2 and mos2 eps the mo 3d core level spectra consisted of two peaks located at 232 0 and 229 0 ev which were ascribed to mo4 3d3 2 and mo4 3d5 2 band respectively paredes et al 2016 the proportion of 1t phase in mos2 was 83 9 whereas that in mos2 eps were remarkably reduced 72 8 eps were adsorbed on the 1t phase and electronic transfer occurred between the two chemicals according to the uv vis spectra fig 1h and 1i likely resulting in the oxidation of mos2 and the decrease of 1t phase the emergence of mo o bond at 236 0 ev in mos2 eps provides support for this result in the s 2p core level spectra fig 1j a significant additional band appeared at 163 0 ev ascribing to the covalent bonding between s atoms and carbon containing functional groups cfgs paredes et al 2016 the binding energy of s 2p3 2 band was shifted 161 5 and 161 3 ev for mos2 and mos2 eps respectively also signifying that the mos2 eps hybridization occurred between eps and s atoms the peak of 2h polymorph of the s 2p band did not shift in contrast the bands related to the 1t polymorph shifted to lower binding energies these findings indicated that eps mainly interacted with the s atoms on the 1t phase resulting in the structural disorder of mos2 a significant signature in the epr spectra relevant to the mo s dangling bond of mos2 was observed g 2 0017 fig 1k which is consistent with the defects in the afm image fig 1e mos2 eps g 2 0045 had a larger width resonance line and a higher signature intensity than mos2 indicating that mos2 eps had higher levels of semiquinone type unpaired electron ouyang et al 2019 this should result from the surface electronic transfer initiated by the chromophoric oxygen containing functional groups ofgs of eps the optical performance and chemical stability of mos2 were affected by surface activities cho et al 2015 the electronic transfer with eps led to property changes and surface oxidation of mos2 which was supported by the peak shifts in the uv vis raman spectra and formation of mo o bond in the xps analysis 3 2 analysis of surface chemistry alteration and adsorbed eps compositions ftir spectra fig s3a exhibited strong bands at the wavenumbers corresponding to aromatic compounds 1632 cm 1 for c c and c o and amide fragments 1539 cm 1 for cn and nh of proteins in eps adeleye and keller 2016 the 1100 and 1399 cm 1 peaks are related to polysaccharides co and carboxylic compounds o c o respectively yin et al 2015 compared with mos2 the variations corresponding to the c c o c o and co bonds were showed in mos2 eps fig s3b which is consistent with the c s peak in xps the peak of nh bond was not found likely due to the weaker electrostatic interaction of mos2 with positively charged amino groups ouyang et al 2019 additionally the peak related to the c o bond in eps shifted from 1632 to 1620 cm 1 after adsorption onto mos2 implying the occurrence of n π interaction between mos2 and eps 2dcos analysis can explain the trend of intensity alterations that are ambiguous in the original spectra noda 2012 as shown in fig 2 a there were three positive auto peaks in the synchronous 2d ir cos map fig 2a centered at 1620 1399 and 1100 cm 1 table s1 demonstrating that these bondings varied in the same direction by contrast the asynchronous map was anti symmetric in regard to the diagonal and no cross peak was visualized fig 2b according to the sequential order rules negative signals of the cross peaks ψ x1 1100 and ψ 1620 1399 were observed representing that the binding of the co band 1100 cm 1 was preferentially occurred followed by carboxylic 1399 cm 1 and aromatic compounds 1620 cm 1 these findings indicate that hydrophilic groups are preferentially bound to mos2 than hydrophobic groups which was similar to the interactions of molecules with other enms adeleye and keller 2016 ouyang et al 2019 eps contained abundant aromatic compounds as evidenced by the suva280 table s2 and high fluorescence fig 3 a the fluorescent peaks at the excitation emission wavelengths of 220 230 300 350 and 270 280 300 350 nm in the 3d eem spectra of eps were assigned to aromatic proteins and byproduct like substances respectively chen et al 2003 these components diminished after interacting with mos2 fig 3b for example the peak fluorescence intensity at 225 325 nm decreased by 79 3 upon the supplement of mos2 fig s4 this was due to the complexation between aromatic molecules and mos2 sheng et al 2013 the high ratio of c c 284 8 ev 62 3 fragment in the c 1 s xps spectra of mos2 eps fig s5 supports the above findings moreover the eps compositions adsorbed on mos2 were identified in detail lc ms ms results showed that the number of proteins with their fractions of the total proteins scores more than 3 0 was twelve fig 3c since the interactions occurred between the cfgs and mos2 we calculated and compared the relative number of the cooh nh2 and sh groups which are the major backbones of amino acids in the proteins on mos2 table s3 and fig 3d the correlation of protein abundance with the relative number of the nh2 groups r 0 568 p 0 05 was negative while that of cooh r 0 562 p 0 05 and sh groups r 0 112 p 0 374 was positive fig s6 manifesting the crucial roles of cooh groups toward the mos2 protein interactions it was noted that noncovalent binding of the cooh and sh groups occurred due to the dissociation adsorption of oh and s h bonds min et al 2012 compared with s datively bonded structure to s h dissociated adsorption structure 0 523 ev molecule the activation barrier to the conversion of the cooh bonded structure to oh dissociated adsorption structure 0 274 ev molecule was easier to overcome min et al 2012 this might explain the fact that proteins with abundant cooh groups are preferentially bound to mos2 and keeps in accord with the ftir findings fig 2 gc ms results found that polysaccharides galactopyranosides and d sorbitol etc amino acids glycine and fatty acids myristic acid arachidic acid etc are the dominant low molecular weight metabolites on mos2 fig 3e and table s4 this is consistent with the emergence of co c 286 5 ev 26 8 and o c o peaks 288 5 ev 10 9 in the c1s spectra of mos2 eps altogether the multiple lines of evidences revealed that the adsorption of eps and subsequent influences on the properties of mos2 are susceptible to the deprotonated functional groups our findings are in accordance with recent studies that aromatic compounds from bacterial eps are correlated with structural disorder of mercuric sulfide zhang et al 2020 and that hydrophilic functional groups cooh and phenolic groups of colloids take part in the go reduction ouyang et al 2019 3 3 electrokinetic properties and aggregation kinetics of mos2 electrokinetic results suggested that mos2 is negatively charged and electrophoretic mobility epm increased from 1 096 10 8 to 2 572 10 8 m2 v 1 s 1 over the ph of 3 11 fig 4 a with the increase of eps the epm values of mos2 increased ascribing to the adsorption of negatively charged ligands on mos2 the response of d h to varying ph was similar to that of epm and the d h of mos2 was 436 8 308 6 267 3 253 1 and 242 5 nm ph 5 0 respectively after precipitation with 0 0 5 2 5 5 and 10 mg c l of eps fig 4b similar to other enms chowdhury et al 2013 yang et al 2016 the following variation of d h behind epm demonstrated that the aggregation of mos2 and mos2 eps with h is mainly derived from the reduction of electrostatic repulsive force as predicted by colloidal theory the enrichment of the negatively charged cfgs increased the sensitivity of mos2 eps to h resulting in the more dramatic variations in epm and d h than mos2 at ph below 5 0 these findings were supported by the zeta potential data in fig s7a the negative potentials of mos2 ranged from 12 8 to 29 6 mv while those of mos2 eps were higher especially at ph of 5 9 the changes in the electrokinetic or hydrodynamic properties signify that eps obviously improves the colloidal stability of mos2 in aqueous environment small angle x ray scattering saxs is a reliable tool for assessing the aggregation of nps thanh et al 2014 the scattered light intensity i q is a function of form factor and the trend of i q in the high and low q ranges corresponds to the growth and aggregation of nps respectively the i q values were approximate among the mos2 samples in the high q ranges fig 4c indicating the indistinguishable initial sizes of mos2 and mos2 eps this was likely due to the rapid formation of nps monomers at the initial precipitation stage which was not susceptible to eps in contrast the i q values in the low q ranges decreased with the increase of eps loading indicating that eps substantially mitigated the aggregation of mos2 this result was supported by the time dependent variations of d h aggregation kinetics experiments revealed that the d h of mos2 increased to 435 7 560 6 and 813 8 nm at 1800s in deionized water na and ca2 solutions respectively fig 4d 4f electrostatic repulsion is a major driving force that prevents mos2 from aggregating lin et al 2017 and electrolyte salts can suppress the magnitude of the electrical double layer of those negatively charged nps when eps concentration increased from 0 to 10 mg c l the k a values of mos2 6 66 10 8 and 28 3 nm min decreased to 0 03 0 52 and 12 2 nm min in deionized water na and ca2 solutions fig s7b respectively the steric hindrance effects derived from macromolecules have been confirmed as the mechanisms for nps stabilization feng et al 2019 the coordinated eps inhibited the bridging of mos2 thus leading to the attenuated aggregation of mos2 in addition hydrophilic functional groups of eps increased the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged nanoflakes which can explain the phenomenon that eps exhibit good stabilization performances toward mos2 in aquatic environments 3 4 eps inhibited the photochemical activity and dissolution of mos2 the degradation efficiency of mos2 toward methyl orange decreased from 50 6 to 18 7 with the increase of eps content fig 5 a implying that eps binding retarded the catalytic activity of mos2 the capability of nps to produce reactive intermediates was correlated with their chemical activity and biocompatibility sharma et al 2019 fig 5b 5d showed the epr signals of the spin adducts dmpo o2 dmpo oh and tempo 1o2 significantly mos2 exhibited highest capacity for 1o2 generation while the yield of o2 and oh was relatively lower which was in accord with a previous study of mos2 shang et al 2017 the intensities of the spin adducts were obviously weaker indicating that eps decreased the ros generation in the mos2 suspension photoluminescence pl spectra was measured to explore the potential mechanisms of the ros alteration the two peaks in the pl spectra of mos2 at 625 and 670 nm are relevant to the spin orbital splitting of valence band and direct excitonic transition respectively fig s8 splendiani et al 2010 the pl peak of mos2 depends on the electron donor level of band gap qiu et al 2013 the peak intensities after eps binding reduced and the position shifted toward the high energy direction 677 nm signifying that the band gap structure of mos2 was changed the calculation results confirmed that the band gap of mos2 eps 1 92 ev became wider than that of mos2 1 80 ev fig s9 generation of reactive intermediates was driven by the separation of the electron hole pairs on nanomaterials under light irradiation kisch 2017 the broadened band gap demonstrated that the cutoff wavelength 1242 375 band gap of mos2 became lower with eps binding decreasing the light utilization efficiency and the capability of mos2 to generate ros moreover the catalytically active sites of the chemically exfoliated mos2 were mostly located on the 1t polymorphs guardia et al 2014 the domains were grafted with negatively charged cfgs in eps according to the data given above fig 1j and fig 2 which should also contribute to the retarded catalytic activity of mos2 toward pollutant degradation in aquatic environments environmental persistence of enms is correlated with their applications and risks time dependent ionic release of mos2 was observed in oxygen saturated water fig 5e the low values of the mo concentration were present at initial time likely due to the peroxidation during sample preparation after 56 days of dissolution the content of soluble mo from pristine mos2 was 5 027 mg l which is remarkably higher than those from mos2 eps precipitates 4 176 3 932 3 205 and 2 513 mg l respectively these data indicated that eps enhanced the chemical stability of mos2 xps assay has revealed that eps adsorption promoted the surface oxidation of mos2 emergence of mo o bonding and c s bonding was formed the substitution of chalcogen atoms on the s containing functional groups with exogenous oxygen or carbon has shown to be chemically favorable lee et al 2019 santosh et al 2015 the improvement effect on the environmental persistence of mos2 by eps was likely due to rapid initial oxidation and carbon grafting preventing the dissolution of mos2 in aqueous media 3 5 eps mitigated the toxicity of mos2 to infantile zebrafish although eps significantly impact the physicochemical properties of mos2 in aquatic environments the risks associated with mos2 remain unknown as shown in fig 6 a hatching delay of larvae was remarkably induced upon the exposure of mos2 at 5 and 10 mg l 83 2 and 80 7 respectively while this phenomenon was not observed in the mos2 eps groups fig 6a this is likely due to the weakened interactions of mos2 with embryo chorion after the binding of hydrophilic cfgs zou et al 2020b a similar trend was observed for mortality rate fig s10a in contrast to the control and eps groups the malformation rate of larvae was significantly increased by mos2 exposure fig 6b the incidence of pericardial edema red arrows fig 6c which was the dominant deformity phenotype was highest fig 6d followed by yolk sac edema green arrows and tail malformation purple arrows the heart rate of larvae was also inhibited by mos2 fig 6e however eps apparently p 0 05 decreased the deformity rate and mitigated heartbeat inhibition induced by mos2 for example the incidences of deformity phenotypes in the mos2 eps 5 mg l 5 mg c l groups were similar to those of the control fig 6d numerous studies have shown that eps affected the toxicity of enms to water organisms joshi et al 2012 mu et al 2016 in this research the developmental toxicity of zebrafish induced by mos2 was more significant than that induced by mos2 eps demonstrating that eps can act as an environment friendly role in regulating the risk of mos2 in aquatic ecosystems the exposure of eps derived from freshwater algae and molybdate ion na2moo4 release from mos2 both had negligible inhibition effects on the early development of zebrafish fig 6a 6e implying that the decreased toxicity of mos2 after eps binding was not induced by the inhibited ionic release but by eps driven property alterations oxidative stress is an important mechanism for growth inhibition in fish zhang et al 2017 the relative ros fluorescence intensity in the mos2 and mos2 eps groups at 10 mg l was 158 1 and 71 6 higher than that in the control fig s10b and s10c respectively which keeps in accord with the toxicity results correspondingly a mmp loss was significantly observed in the mos2 groups but not in the mos2 eps groups fig 6f 6h and fig s10d the reduction mechanisms of oxidative stress affected by eps are complicated the morphology and structure can influence the cellular ros generation of enms zhao et al 2014 multilayer mos2 were visualized after eps binding from the afm images fig 1f and raman spectra fig 1g the epr results also revealed that the generation ability of free radicals by mos2 eps is significantly stronger than that by pristine mos2 these property alterations probably contributed to the attenuated oxidative damage in larvae from the mos2 eps groups moreover the cellular content of nps may directly determine the oxidative stress and toxicity in fish the body burdens of mos2 in zebrafish from the 1 5 and 10 mg l groups were 0 36 0 75 and 1 07 mg g dry weight after 7 days of exposure respectively fig s11 by contrast the mos2 content in the eps co exposed groups decreased by 35 7 42 6 and 41 8 respectively enms with weaker colloidal stability were easily aggregated and were more difficult to remove from the biological body seabra et al 2014 the reduced body burdens clearly suggested that the depuration of mos2 by zebrafish was accelerated after eps binding the rapid excretion of hydrophilic mos2 eps reduced the direct interaction of mos2 with larvae also contributing to the mitigated oxidative stress and developmental toxicity to freshwater organisms 4 conclusions and environmental implications in our study multiple analyses revealed that eps are adsorbed to the 1t polymorph of mos2 via hydrophilic effect and the preferential adsorption of the cooh groups morphological alterations and structural disorders e g band gap and phase alteration of mos2 after eps adsorption were observed and the dispersity of mos2 in water was improved the capability of mos2 to generate reactive intermediates o2 oh and 1o2 was inhibited due to the electron charge transfer of eps decreasing the catalytic activity of mos2 the rapid initial oxidation and carbon grafting by eps enhanced the chemical stability of mos2 moreover the above property alterations of mos2 induced by eps obviously mitigated its toxicity to infantile zebrafish the increasing applications will result in the inevitable release of mos2 to the water environment and pose great risks on ecosystems guiney et al 2018 the concept that enms would be modified or transformed is generally well received abbas et al 2020 caixeta et al 2020 however related studies about mos2 has been less well explored in the mechanistic study significant contribution of mos2 eps interactions and related mechanisms were firstly elucidated which will provides crucial scientific guidance for risk assessment of mos2 in aquatic ecosystems additionally during the application of mos2 in wastewater treatment and disinfection liu et al 2016 wang and mi 2017 the secretions from organisms will inevitably contact and interact with mos2 posing great challenges for the sustainability of mos2 based nanomaterials the roles of eps from waterborne organisms in the morphology stability and toxicity of mos2 can serve as valuable information while predicting its environmental fates assessing the risks or developing water treatment processes accordingly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

16608,molybdenum disulfide mos2 poses great potential in water treatment as a popular transition metal dichalcogenide arousing considerable concern regarding its fates and risk in aquatic environments this study revealed that the interplay with extracellular polymeric substances eps of freshwater algae significantly changed the properties and toxicity of mos2 to aquatic fish the predominant binding of aromatic compounds polysaccharides and carboxyl rich proteins in eps on the 1t polymorph of mos2 via hydrophilic effects and the preferential adsorption of carboxylic groups contributed to morphological alterations structural disorders band gap and phase alterations and the attenuated aggregation of mos2 in aqueous solutions electron charge transfer and n π interactions with eps decreased the catalytic activity of mos2 by inhibiting its capability of generating reactive intermediates the dissolution of mos2 slowed down after interacting with eps from 0 089 to 0 045 mg l per day owing to rapid initial oxidation i e forming mo o bond and carbon grafting notably the morphological and structural alterations after eps binding alleviated the toxicity e g malformation and oxidative stress of mos2 to infantile zebrafish our findings provide insights into the environmental fate and risk of mos2 by ubiquitous eps in natural waters serving as valuable information while developing water treatment processes accordingly graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aquatic environment engineered nanomaterials environmental fate environmental risk extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction recently molybdenum disulfide mos2 as a popular two dimensional 2d transition metal dichalcogenide tmd was discovered to display unique structure and activity arousing great enthusiasms for its wide application in energy storage lei et al 2018 electronics autere et al 2018 catalysis gupta and rao 2017 biomedicine leso et al 2019 and environmental protection i e wastewater treatment and disinfection liu et al 2016 wang and mi 2017 the increasing scientific and industrial applications would result in the inevitable release of mos2 to aquatic environments where they could pose great threats to the health of ecosystems guiney et al 2018 moreover natural processes e g molybdenum ore mining also lead to the generation of nano sized mos2 and expand its environmental capacity in waters krishnan et al 2019 in the last five years 7333 academic papers on mos2 were published according to the web of science the search date and search topic was september 1 2021 and molybdenum disulfide respectively among these studies many have reported the adverse effects of mos2 on aquatic organisms freshwater algae daphnia magna and zebrafish arefi oskoui et al 2021 li et al 2021 zou et al 2020a and concluded that mos2 is harmful to water ecosystem actually engineering nanomaterials enms would undergo physicochemical transformations after discharged to the environments which can alter their behaviors and risk however compared to other hot enms e g graphene titanium dioxide and copper nanoparticles adeleye et al 2014 adeleye and keller 2016 zhao et al 2014 the environmental processes and related impacts on the risks of mos2 were rarely concerned which deserve urgent investigations extracellular polymeric substances eps which are primarily from hydrobios and are composed of polysaccharides proteins lipids and other small molecules vo et al 2020 are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and are known to influence the fates and risk of enms adeleye et al 2014 louie et al 2016 for instance algal eps adsorption reduced the aggregation rate of silver nanoparticles agnps and increased their critical coagulation concentration adeleye and keller 2016 interactions with eps altered the surface topography and thickness of graphene oxide go nanoflakes and improved their colloidal stability causing negative biological effects on fish mu et al 2016 studies exploring the impacts of eps on the fates of enms revealed that intrinsic surface chemistry charge configuration and hydrophobicity of enms played crucial roles toward the interactions with eps adeleye and keller 2016 fulaz et al 2019 mos2 exists as a polymorph and displays diverse crystal structures including trigonal prismatic coordination and octahedral coordination kurapati et al 2016 it is unknown whether the proposed mechanisms are appropriate for mos2 because the structures and characteristics of mos2 are quite different from reported enms more importantly the modulation effects of eps on the toxicity of enms still remained not unified hessler et al 2012 mu et al 2016 therefore with the inevitable release of mos2 into the waters and great concerns were paid to its safety the basic interactions between mos2 and eps of waterborne organisms and how these interactions influence its fates morphology and stability etc and risk deserve further exploration mos2 with superior band gap structure displays high photochemical activity which was related to its environmental sustainability and oxidative damages to organisms by producing reactive oxygen species ros shang et al 2017 in the water mos2 will be inevitably exposed to active substances and light from natural sunlight or artificial irradiation monolayer mos2 can generate superoxide radicals o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh in aqueous solution under light irradiation shang et al 2017 humic acid ha reacted with mos2 leading to elevated peroxidase like activity and dispersibility zou et al 2018 both ha and fulvic acid can inhibit the generation of o2 and oh by mos2 in waters shang et al 2017 eps secreted by hydrophyte contain abundant charged functional groups such as cooh and och3 chakraborty et al 2021 of greatest concern is whether the energy transfer between eps and mos2 would occur and related chemical activities of mos2 would be altered in addition the covalent bonding and absence of lone electrons provide the ability for mos2 to resist ambient oxidation chhowalla et al 2013 in the presence of oxidants mos2 can be oxidized to form molybdate and sulfate wang et al 2016 zou et al 2019 therefore another key issue that remains unknown is whether the interactions of eps in the receiving water can impact the persistence i e dissolution of mos2 freshwater algae are ubiquitous in water ecosystem and eps are massively secreted which can sufficiently interact with enms adeleye and keller 2016 many studies have reported that mos2 exhibits toxicity to hydrophytes and fish li et al 2021 zou et al 2020a compared to the studies on mos2 alone the investigations on the risk of mos2 binding with eps in aquatic environments are more meaningful therefore this work investigated the impacts of eps derived from algae chlorella vulgaris on the topography structure colloidal dispersion chemical activity and stability of mos2 in waters zebrafish a model organism that universally coexists with algae in aquatic ecosystems was selected to explore the impacts of eps on the risk of mos2 while the underlying mechanisms associated with the alterations in the properties of mos2 were elucidated the findings have great implications for understanding the environmental behaviors and risks of tmds in water ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 extraction and characterization of the eps derived from freshwater algae soluble eps were extracted from the cultivation of chlorella vulgaris no fachb 8 which was purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china the microalgae were cultivated in blue green bg 11 medium and were kept in an illumination incubator 14 10 h light dark 25 0 c 80 humidity a chemical free and sonication based method was employed to extract eps from algae as described in the supplementary material sm meanwhile the content measurements of dissolved organic carbon doc total nitrogen carbohydrates and proteins in addition to the ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm suva280 zeta potential and surface chemistry of eps were also given in the sm 2 2 precipitation of mos2 in the presence of eps in aqueous media pristine mos2 chemically exfoliated single layer 99 no xf137 was purchased from nanjing xfnano tech co ltd china the mos2 was initially suspended in deionized water 500 mg l using ultrasonic dispersion 150 w in ice water and was centrifuged at 3000 g to separate it from inhomogeneous and large sized nps the precipitates were collected and lyophilized for the following tests eps concentration in water ecosystems would vary temporally and spatially based on water productivity and nutrient availability to analyze the mos2 eps interaction the mixed suspensions containing different concentrations 0 5 2 5 5 and 10 mg c l of eps and mos2 25 mg l were prepared and the ph of the matrices was adjusted to 7 4 7 5 using sodium 4 2 hydroxyethyl piperazine 1 ethanesulfonate all the experimental matrices were kept static in the dark for 72 h at room temperature to achieve adsorption equilibrium the mixtures were centrifuged at 10 000 g 4 c and the mos2 eps precipitates were successively collected washed and centrifuged the upper aqueous phase containing unbound eps was separated and doc concentration was measured 0 07 0 35 0 82 and 1 26 mg

analysis to explore the structural variation information of mos2 affected by eps synchronous and asynchronous two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos analyses were performed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir with the eps content as a perturbation mos2 concentration was 25 mg l and the eps concentration ranged from 0 5 to 10 mg c l the matrices ph 7 4 7 5 were kept under the dark for 72 h 150 rpm at 25 c the precipitates were then collected and freeze dried for the ftir measurement bruker tensor 27 germany specifically the mos2 or mos2 eps 0 3 mg were mixed with kbr powder 100 mg and pressed under the irradiation of an infrared lamp to eliminate the moisture influence each ftir spectra was recorded from 600 to 2400 cm 1 after an average of 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the synchronous and asynchronous 2dcos spectra were formed according to the method of noda and ozaki noda 2012 as shown in the sm 2 4 analysis of the eps composition bound to mos2 the fluorescence compositions of eps before and after interacting with mos2 were analyzed using three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 7100 hitachi japan as shown in the sm the molecules including proteins and small metabolites adsorbed on mos2 were identified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer lc ms ms thermo scientific usa and gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms agilent 5973 usa details of the separation procedures and ms analyses are described in the sm to evaluate the roles of the functional groups toward protein adsorption on mos2 the relative numbers of twenty amino acids and three functional groups cooh nh2 and sh groups in the identified proteins were counted based on the fasta files in the uniprot database see the sm 2 5 aggregation kinetics of mos2 in the presence of eps the aggregation experiments on mos2 were conducted at 25 c in the presence of eps 0 5 2 5 5 and 10 mg c l to prepare homogeneous suspensions and significantly observe the agglomeration of particles a relatively moderate concentration of mos2 at 10 mg l was selected in this assay the variations of hydrodynamic diameter d h in deionized water and electrolyte solutions 60 mm na or 1 mm ca2 were measured using dynamic light scattering dls malvern instruments uk equal volume 500 μl of mos2 or mos2 eps suspension was mixed with prepared solution deionized water nacl or cacl2 in a cuvette and was placed in dls instrument after vortexing the scattered light intensity at 90 was measured and each autocorrelation function was accumulated for 20 s in the initial aggregation process the initial aggregation stage was defined as the time from the initiation of the experiment t 0 to the time when the d h reached 1 5 fold higher than d h initial the whole measurements were conducted from 0 to 60 min and the initial aggregation rate k a was proportional to the initial rate of the increase in d h with time yang et al 2016 1 k a d d h t d t t 0 2 6 catalytic activity test and epr measurement to reveal the effect of eps binding on the chemical activity of mos2 the degradation tests of methyl orange were performed under simulated light irradiation using a xenon lamp 4 5 w m2 cel hxf300 ceaulight china to observe an obvious degradation phenomenon mos2 at a high dose 100 mg l was set in this test and the details were presented in the sm further the capability of mos2 25 mg l to generate reactive intermediates o2 oh and 1o2 before and after eps 10 mg l adsorption was determined using electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker e500 cw x band germany as displayed in the sm 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 0 2 m was used as a trapping agent of o2 and oh 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 0 2 m which can react with 1o2 to generate 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidone 1 oxyl tempo was used to monitor the 1o2 level 2 7 dissolution dynamics of the mos2 affected by eps

particles at the 7th 14th 21st 28th 35th 42nd 49th and 56th days through ultrafiltration centrifugation amicon ultra 15 3 kd millipore usa respectively the concentration of released mo species was quantified using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700 usa 2 8 exposure of nanomaterials to zebrafish embryos adult zebrafish ab strain were purchased from the zebrafish resource center wuhan china the zebrafish cultivation and embryo collection were shown in the sm for the toxicity experiments the nanomaterials were dispersed in e3 medium 5 mm nacl 0 33 mm cacl2 0 17 mm kcl 0 33 mm mgso4 ph 7 4 with an ice bath sonication for 20 min 150 w considering similar applications with other emerging enms e g agnps and titanium dioxide the environmental levels of mos2 should range from μg l to mg l gottschalk et al 2013 it was reported that mos2 at 1 10 mg l exhibited remarkable toxicity to organisms such as algae and zebrafish li et al 2021 zou et al 2020a hence to compare with recent toxicological studies of mos2 and other enms bour et al 2015 luo et al 2021 embryos were exposed to mos2 at 1 5 and 10 mg l for toxicity analyses given the temporally and spatially variation in natural aquatic environment adeleye and keller 2016 eps at 5 mg c l which is relatively realistic was selected embryos were exposed to e3 medium the control eps 5 mg c l mos2 1

malformation rates in zebrafish larvae were determined see the sm all the zebrafish procedures were approved by the henan normal university animal care committee and were in line with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee 2 9 statistical analysis all the samples were performed in triplicate and the results were presented as the mean the standard deviation sd the statistical significance was evaluated using the one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s test a p value less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant ibm spss 22 0 statistical software was used for the statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 eps induced morphological and structural alterations of mos2 transmission electron microscope tem images revealed that mos2 and mos2 eps exhibit translucent sheet like structures fig 1 a 1d and their diameters were similar accounting for 278 3 and 261 1 nm fig s1 respectively the atomic layer distance was 0 261 nm which is in line with a recent study uhlig et al 2019 the thickness is 1 52 nm as shown in atomic force microscopy afm image fig 1e revealing the monolayer structure of pristine mos2 irregular pores and jagged edges on and around the sheets are ascribed to intrinsic defects of mos2 hong et al 2015 the increased thickness of mos2 eps 4 57 nm fig 1f revealed the morphological alterations of nanosheets which is similar to the surface adsorption of biomacromolecule on enms ouyang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 meanwhile raman spectrometry in fig 1g showed that the raman phonon modes at 385 0 cm 1 and 402 3 cm 1 are related to the in plane e 2g 1 and out of plane a 1g lattice vibrations of mos2 lee et al 2010 respectively a notable finding was that e 2g 1 and a 1g peaks exhibited red maximally 3 5 cm 1 and blue maximally 2 7 cm 1 shifts respectively with the increase in eps content this can be explained by the molecule adsorption the chemically adsorbed eps on mos2 suppressed the atomic vibration thereby leading to the shifted constant vibration force cho et al 2015 further the layer number of mos2 was relevant to the difference in the e 2g 1 and a 1g peak positions velicky et al 2016 the broadened a 1g e 2g 1 shift of mos2 eps 23 4 cm 1 implied that the nanosheets were transformed from single to multiple layer approximately 3 layers fig s2 which agrees with the afm results fig 1f uv vis spectra showed that pristine mos2 exhibited an obvious absorption band at 217 nm fig 1h which was associated with the plasmon resonances in the 1t phase of mos2 eda et al 2011 this peak was blue shifted especially in the presence of 10 mg c l eps 4 nm reflecting the variations in the electronic structure of mos2 after eps binding the characteristic peaks 440 610 and 670 nm related to the 2h phase of mos2 voiry et al 2015 had no remarkable alterations fig 1i signifying that the grafting of eps is energetically favorable on the 1t polymorph rather than 2h polymorph of mos2 further evidences for the structural alterations were provided by the xps spectra fig 1j for the pristine mos2 and mos2 eps the mo 3d core level spectra consisted of two peaks located at 232 0 and 229 0 ev which were ascribed to mo4 3d3 2 and mo4 3d5 2 band respectively paredes et al 2016 the proportion of 1t phase in mos2 was 83 9 whereas that in mos2 eps were remarkably reduced 72 8 eps were adsorbed on the 1t phase and electronic transfer occurred between the two chemicals according to the uv vis spectra fig 1h and 1i likely resulting in the oxidation of mos2 and the decrease of 1t phase the emergence of mo o bond at 236 0 ev in mos2 eps provides support for this result in the s 2p core level spectra fig 1j a significant additional band appeared at 163 0 ev ascribing to the covalent bonding between s atoms and carbon containing functional groups cfgs paredes et al 2016 the binding energy of s 2p3 2 band was shifted 161 5 and 161 3 ev for mos2 and mos2 eps respectively also signifying that the mos2 eps hybridization occurred between eps and s atoms the peak of 2h polymorph of the s 2p band did not shift in contrast the bands related to the 1t polymorph shifted to lower binding energies these findings indicated that eps mainly interacted with the s atoms on the 1t phase resulting in the structural disorder of mos2 a significant signature in the epr spectra relevant to the mo s dangling bond of mos2 was observed g 2 0017 fig 1k which is consistent with the defects in the afm image fig 1e mos2 eps g 2 0045 had a larger width resonance line and a higher signature intensity than mos2 indicating that mos2 eps had higher levels of semiquinone type unpaired electron ouyang et al 2019 this should result from the surface electronic transfer initiated by the chromophoric oxygen containing functional groups ofgs of eps the optical performance and chemical stability of mos2 were affected by surface activities cho et al 2015 the electronic transfer with eps led to property changes and surface oxidation of mos2 which was supported by the peak shifts in the uv vis raman spectra and formation of mo o bond in the xps analysis 3 2 analysis of surface chemistry alteration and adsorbed eps compositions ftir spectra fig s3a exhibited strong bands at the wavenumbers corresponding to aromatic compounds 1632 cm 1 for c c and c o and amide fragments 1539 cm 1 for cn and nh of proteins in eps adeleye and keller 2016 the 1100 and 1399 cm 1 peaks are related to polysaccharides co and carboxylic compounds o c o respectively yin et al 2015 compared with mos2 the variations corresponding to the c c o c o and co bonds were showed in mos2 eps fig s3b which is consistent with the c s peak in xps the peak of nh bond was not found likely due to the weaker electrostatic interaction of mos2 with positively charged amino groups ouyang et al 2019 additionally the peak related to the c o bond in eps shifted from 1632 to 1620 cm 1 after adsorption onto mos2 implying the occurrence of n π interaction between mos2 and eps 2dcos analysis can explain the trend of intensity alterations that are ambiguous in the original spectra noda 2012 as shown in fig 2 a there were three positive auto peaks in the synchronous 2d ir cos map fig 2a centered at 1620 1399 and 1100 cm 1 table s1 demonstrating that these bondings varied in the same direction by contrast the asynchronous map was anti symmetric in regard to the diagonal and no cross peak was visualized fig 2b according to the sequential order rules negative signals of the cross peaks ψ x1 1100 and ψ 1620 1399 were observed representing that the binding of the co band 1100 cm 1 was preferentially occurred followed by carboxylic 1399 cm 1 and aromatic compounds 1620 cm 1 these findings indicate that hydrophilic groups are preferentially bound to mos2 than hydrophobic groups which was similar to the interactions of molecules with other enms adeleye and keller 2016 ouyang et al 2019 eps contained abundant aromatic compounds as evidenced by the suva280 table s2 and high fluorescence fig 3 a the fluorescent peaks at the excitation emission wavelengths of 220 230 300 350 and 270 280 300 350 nm in the 3d eem spectra of eps were assigned to aromatic proteins and byproduct like substances respectively chen et al 2003 these components diminished after interacting with mos2 fig 3b for example the peak fluorescence intensity at 225 325 nm decreased by 79 3 upon the supplement of mos2 fig s4 this was due to the complexation between aromatic molecules and mos2 sheng et al 2013 the high ratio of c c 284 8 ev 62 3 fragment in the c 1 s xps spectra of mos2 eps fig s5 supports the above findings moreover the eps compositions adsorbed on mos2 were identified in detail lc ms ms results showed that the number of proteins with their fractions of the total proteins scores more than 3 0 was twelve fig 3c since the interactions occurred between the cfgs and mos2 we calculated and compared the relative number of the cooh nh2 and sh groups which are the major backbones of amino acids in the proteins on mos2 table s3 and fig 3d the correlation of protein abundance with the relative number of the nh2 groups r 0 568 p 0 05 was negative while that of cooh r 0 562 p 0 05 and sh groups r 0 112 p 0 374 was positive fig s6 manifesting the crucial roles of cooh groups toward the mos2 protein interactions it was noted that noncovalent binding of the cooh and sh groups occurred due to the dissociation adsorption of oh and s h bonds min et al 2012 compared with s datively bonded structure to s h dissociated adsorption structure 0 523 ev molecule the activation barrier to the conversion of the cooh bonded structure to oh dissociated adsorption structure 0 274 ev molecule was easier to overcome min et al 2012 this might explain the fact that proteins with abundant cooh groups are preferentially bound to mos2 and keeps in accord with the ftir findings fig 2 gc ms results found that polysaccharides galactopyranosides and d sorbitol etc amino acids glycine and fatty acids myristic acid arachidic acid etc are the dominant low molecular weight metabolites on mos2 fig 3e and table s4 this is consistent with the emergence of co c 286 5 ev 26 8 and o c o peaks 288 5 ev 10 9 in the c1s spectra of mos2 eps altogether the multiple lines of evidences revealed that the adsorption of eps and subsequent influences on the properties of mos2 are susceptible to the deprotonated functional groups our findings are in accordance with recent studies that aromatic compounds from bacterial eps are correlated with structural disorder of mercuric sulfide zhang et al 2020 and that hydrophilic functional groups cooh and phenolic groups of colloids take part in the go reduction ouyang et al 2019 3 3 electrokinetic properties and aggregation kinetics of mos2 electrokinetic results suggested that mos2 is negatively charged and electrophoretic mobility epm increased from 1 096 10 8 to 2 572 10 8 m2 v 1 s 1 over the ph of 3 11 fig 4 a with the increase of eps the epm values of mos2 increased ascribing to the adsorption of negatively charged ligands on mos2 the response of d h to varying ph was similar to that of epm and the d h of mos2 was 436 8 308 6 267 3 253 1 and 242 5 nm ph 5 0 respectively after precipitation with 0 0 5 2 5 5 and 10 mg c l of eps fig 4b similar to other enms chowdhury et al 2013 yang et al 2016 the following variation of d h behind epm demonstrated that the aggregation of mos2 and mos2 eps with h is mainly derived from the reduction of electrostatic repulsive force as predicted by colloidal theory the enrichment of the negatively charged cfgs increased the sensitivity of mos2 eps to h resulting in the more dramatic variations in epm and d h than mos2 at ph below 5 0 these findings were supported by the zeta potential data in fig s7a the negative potentials of mos2 ranged from 12 8 to 29 6 mv while those of mos2 eps were higher especially at ph of 5 9 the changes in the electrokinetic or hydrodynamic properties signify that eps obviously improves the colloidal stability of mos2 in aqueous environment small angle x ray scattering saxs is a reliable tool for assessing the aggregation of nps thanh et al 2014 the scattered light intensity i q is a function of form factor and the trend of i q in the high and low q ranges corresponds to the growth and aggregation of nps respectively the i q values were approximate among the mos2 samples in the high q ranges fig 4c indicating the indistinguishable initial sizes of mos2 and mos2 eps this was likely due to the rapid formation of nps monomers at the initial precipitation stage which was not susceptible to eps in contrast the i q values in the low q ranges decreased with the increase of eps loading indicating that eps substantially mitigated the aggregation of mos2 this result was supported by the time dependent variations of d h aggregation kinetics experiments revealed that the d h of mos2 increased to 435 7 560 6 and 813 8 nm at 1800s in deionized water na and ca2 solutions respectively fig 4d 4f electrostatic repulsion is a major driving force that prevents mos2 from aggregating lin et al 2017 and electrolyte salts can suppress the magnitude of the electrical double layer of those negatively charged nps when eps concentration increased from 0 to 10 mg c l the k a values of mos2 6 66 10 8 and 28 3 nm min decreased to 0 03 0 52 and 12 2 nm min in deionized water na and ca2 solutions fig s7b respectively the steric hindrance effects derived from macromolecules have been confirmed as the mechanisms for nps stabilization feng et al 2019 the coordinated eps inhibited the bridging of mos2 thus leading to the attenuated aggregation of mos2 in addition hydrophilic functional groups of eps increased the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged nanoflakes which can explain the phenomenon that eps exhibit good stabilization performances toward mos2 in aquatic environments 3 4 eps inhibited the photochemical activity and dissolution of mos2 the degradation efficiency of mos2 toward methyl orange decreased from 50 6 to 18 7 with the increase of eps content fig 5 a implying that eps binding retarded the catalytic activity of mos2 the capability of nps to produce reactive intermediates was correlated with their chemical activity and biocompatibility sharma et al 2019 fig 5b 5d showed the epr signals of the spin adducts dmpo o2 dmpo oh and tempo 1o2 significantly mos2 exhibited highest capacity for 1o2 generation while the yield of o2 and oh was relatively lower which was in accord with a previous study of mos2 shang et al 2017 the intensities of the spin adducts were obviously weaker indicating that eps decreased the ros generation in the mos2 suspension photoluminescence pl spectra was measured to explore the potential mechanisms of the ros alteration the two peaks in the pl spectra of mos2 at 625 and 670 nm are relevant to the spin orbital splitting of valence band and direct excitonic transition respectively fig s8 splendiani et al 2010 the pl peak of mos2 depends on the electron donor level of band gap qiu et al 2013 the peak intensities after eps binding reduced and the position shifted toward the high energy direction 677 nm signifying that the band gap structure of mos2 was changed the calculation results confirmed that the band gap of mos2 eps 1 92 ev became wider than that of mos2 1 80 ev fig s9 generation of reactive intermediates was driven by the separation of the electron hole pairs on nanomaterials under light irradiation kisch 2017 the broadened band gap demonstrated that the cutoff wavelength 1242 375 band gap of mos2 became lower with eps binding decreasing the light utilization efficiency and the capability of mos2 to generate ros moreover the catalytically active sites of the chemically exfoliated mos2 were mostly located on the 1t polymorphs guardia et al 2014 the domains were grafted with negatively charged cfgs in eps according to the data given above fig 1j and fig 2 which should also contribute to the retarded catalytic activity of mos2 toward pollutant degradation in aquatic environments environmental persistence of enms is correlated with their applications and risks time dependent ionic release of mos2 was observed in oxygen saturated water fig 5e the low values of the mo concentration were present at initial time likely due to the peroxidation during sample preparation after 56 days of dissolution the content of soluble mo from pristine mos2 was 5 027 mg l which is remarkably higher than those from mos2 eps precipitates 4 176 3 932 3 205 and 2 513 mg l respectively these data indicated that eps enhanced the chemical stability of mos2 xps assay has revealed that eps adsorption promoted the surface oxidation of mos2 emergence of mo o bonding and c s bonding was formed the substitution of chalcogen atoms on the s containing functional groups with exogenous oxygen or carbon has shown to be chemically favorable lee et al 2019 santosh et al 2015 the improvement effect on the environmental persistence of mos2 by eps was likely due to rapid initial oxidation and carbon grafting preventing the dissolution of mos2 in aqueous media 3 5 eps mitigated the toxicity of mos2 to infantile zebrafish although eps significantly impact the physicochemical properties of mos2 in aquatic environments the risks associated with mos2 remain unknown as shown in fig 6 a hatching delay of larvae was remarkably induced upon the exposure of mos2 at 5 and 10 mg l 83 2 and 80 7 respectively while this phenomenon was not observed in the mos2 eps groups fig 6a this is likely due to the weakened interactions of mos2 with embryo chorion after the binding of hydrophilic cfgs zou et al 2020b a similar trend was observed for mortality rate fig s10a in contrast to the control and eps groups the malformation rate of larvae was significantly increased by mos2 exposure fig 6b the incidence of pericardial edema red arrows fig 6c which was the dominant deformity phenotype was highest fig 6d followed by yolk sac edema green arrows and tail malformation purple arrows the heart rate of larvae was also inhibited by mos2 fig 6e however eps apparently p 0 05 decreased the deformity rate and mitigated heartbeat inhibition induced by mos2 for example the incidences of deformity phenotypes in the mos2 eps 5 mg l 5 mg c l groups were similar to those of the control fig 6d numerous studies have shown that eps affected the toxicity of enms to water organisms joshi et al 2012 mu et al 2016 in this research the developmental toxicity of zebrafish induced by mos2 was more significant than that induced by mos2 eps demonstrating that eps can act as an environment friendly role in regulating the risk of mos2 in aquatic ecosystems the exposure of eps derived from freshwater algae and molybdate ion na2moo4 release from mos2 both had negligible inhibition effects on the early development of zebrafish fig 6a 6e implying that the decreased toxicity of mos2 after eps binding was not induced by the inhibited ionic release but by eps driven property alterations oxidative stress is an important mechanism for growth inhibition in fish zhang et al 2017 the relative ros fluorescence intensity in the mos2 and mos2 eps groups at 10 mg l was 158 1 and 71 6 higher than that in the control fig s10b and s10c respectively which keeps in accord with the toxicity results correspondingly a mmp loss was significantly observed in the mos2 groups but not in the mos2 eps groups fig 6f 6h and fig s10d the reduction mechanisms of oxidative stress affected by eps are complicated the morphology and structure can influence the cellular ros generation of enms zhao et al 2014 multilayer mos2 were visualized after eps binding from the afm images fig 1f and raman spectra fig 1g the epr results also revealed that the generation ability of free radicals by mos2 eps is significantly stronger than that by pristine mos2 these property alterations probably contributed to the attenuated oxidative damage in larvae from the mos2 eps groups moreover the cellular content of nps may directly determine the oxidative stress and toxicity in fish the body burdens of mos2 in zebrafish from the 1 5 and 10 mg l groups were 0 36 0 75 and 1 07 mg g dry weight after 7 days of exposure respectively fig s11 by contrast the mos2 content in the eps co exposed groups decreased by 35 7 42 6 and 41 8 respectively enms with weaker colloidal stability were easily aggregated and were more difficult to remove from the biological body seabra et al 2014 the reduced body burdens clearly suggested that the depuration of mos2 by zebrafish was accelerated after eps binding the rapid excretion of hydrophilic mos2 eps reduced the direct interaction of mos2 with larvae also contributing to the mitigated oxidative stress and developmental toxicity to freshwater organisms 4 conclusions and environmental implications in our study multiple analyses revealed that eps are adsorbed to the 1t polymorph of mos2 via hydrophilic effect and the preferential adsorption of the cooh groups morphological alterations and structural disorders e g band gap and phase alteration of mos2 after eps adsorption were observed and the dispersity of mos2 in water was improved the capability of mos2 to generate reactive intermediates o2 oh and 1o2 was inhibited due to the electron charge transfer of eps decreasing the catalytic activity of mos2 the rapid initial oxidation and carbon grafting by eps enhanced the chemical stability of mos2 moreover the above property alterations of mos2 induced by eps obviously mitigated its toxicity to infantile zebrafish the increasing applications will result in the inevitable release of mos2 to the water environment and pose great risks on ecosystems guiney et al 2018 the concept that enms would be modified or transformed is generally well received abbas et al 2020 caixeta et al 2020 however related studies about mos2 has been less well explored in the mechanistic study significant contribution of mos2 eps interactions and related mechanisms were firstly elucidated which will provides crucial scientific guidance for risk assessment of mos2 in aquatic ecosystems additionally during the application of mos2 in wastewater treatment and disinfection liu et al 2016 wang and mi 2017 the secretions from organisms will inevitably contact and interact with mos2 posing great challenges for the sustainability of mos2 based nanomaterials the roles of eps from waterborne organisms in the morphology stability and toxicity of mos2 can serve as valuable information while predicting its environmental fates assessing the risks or developing water treatment processes accordingly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

16609,hydrated electrons e aq e 2 9 v generated by advanced reduction processes arps have been proved to be a promising approach to eliminate various per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in water in this study the decomposition of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in a complex water matrix by e aq generated from the uv sulfite process was investigated the effect of ph 9 12 and co existing compounds chloride nitrate phosphate carbonate and humic acid on pfoa degradation efficiency was studied in addition the intermediates and possible degradation pathways were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms the results showed that the concentration of pfoa was below the detection limit 10 μg l after 1 h conditions c0 10 mg l initial ph 10 sulfite 10 mm while 89 defluorination was achieved after 24 h using a higher initial ph ph 12 greatly enhanced the pfoa degradation as 100 degradation and 98 defluorination were achieved after 24 h the presence of carbonate 5 mm nitrate 2 mm and humic acid 25 mg l showed a significant negative effect on pfoa degradation via a uv blocking effect or quenching of hydrated electrons while the presence of chloride and phosphate had a smaller effect on pfoa degradation even at extremely high concentrations of chloride 1 709 m ph 11 25 the defluorination ratio reached 97 after 24 h of reaction time during the process short chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas c 7 and hydrogen substituted compounds were detected which implies that chain shortening and h f change reactions had occurred moreover this confirmed the generation of sulfonated and unsaturated intermediates during the process which disclosed valuable new mechanistic insights into pfoa degradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctanoic acid advanced reduction process uv sulfite degradation intermediates ms analysis 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a group of anthropogenic compounds in which at least one or all hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon chain are replaced by fluorine because of their high thermal stability low chemical activity and good water resistant properties pfass have been widely used in many products such as food packaging firefighting foams textiles and personal care products cui et al 2020 gagliano et al 2020 wu et al 2020 global production and the wide application of pfass have caused worldwide contamination since the 1940s and pfass have drawn increasing attention due to their persistence toxicity and bioaccumulation bentel et al 2019 cui et al 2020 dixit et al 2020 a representative pfas compound perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa has been widely used in the production of everyday necessities in the construction industry and textile industry pfoa has been detected in natural water soils effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and even animal tissue in recent years ghisi et al 2019 li et al 2020 sunderland et al 2019 moreover the decomposition of pfoa has been found to be extremely slow in the natural environment due to the high strength of the carbon fluorine bond li et al 2020 sunderland et al 2019 in 2019 pfoa its salts and pfoa related compounds were listed as new persistent organic pollutants pops under annex a in the stockholm convention 2019 to restrict their production and application it was reported that kidney cancer testicular cancer ulcerative colitis thyroid disease hypercholesterolemia high cholesterol and pregnancy induced hypertension are related to high pfoa exposure kwiatkowski et al 2020 nicole 2013 therefore it is important to develop a feasible method to eliminate pfoa contamination from water to date several treatment techniques such as adsorption membrane separation biological treatment advanced oxidation processes aops advanced reduction process arps and photodecomposition have been investigated for eliminating organic pollution duan et al 2019 gagliano et al 2020 ross et al 2018 shang et al 2021 trojanowicz et al 2018 of these techniques aops have shown good degradation performance but poor defluorination efficiency for pfas which means that most of the long chain pfass were degraded to short chain pfass and further degradation was limited chen and zhang 2006 qian et al 2016 trojanowicz et al 2018 by comparison arps by using hydrated electrons e aq for pfas degradation have exhibited much higher defluorination and decomposition efficiency which makes this a promising method for controlling pfas pollution bao et al 2018 bentel et al 2019 gu et al 2017b the e aq e 2 9 v is a highly reactive and reductive species that can react with the halogen atoms in organic matter qu et al 2010 it can be generated from water or by some source chemicals like iodide sulfite or indole via uv radiation guo et al 2019 because they have the highest electronegativity the fluorine atoms in pfass exhibit a strong electron withdrawing ability which makes it possible to be attacked by e aq as a reaction center song et al 2013 so far sulfite is recognized as an ideal reductant that has widely been studied for pfas degradation by arps the generation of e aq from the photoionization of so3 2 eq 1 has proved to be an effective method for pfas degradation in the study by song et al 2013 a uv sulfite process was first used for pfoa reductive degradation and the defluorination ratio of pfoa reached 88 5 after 24 h another study investigated the kinetics and evaluated the associated toxicity of pfoa decomposition by a high photon flux uv sulfite process gu et al 2017b bentel et al 2020a 2020b 2019 recently revealed the degradation kinetics and mechanism of pfass with different functional groups and chain structures in one of their studies the photo reductive decay mechanism uv sulfite process of 34 representative pfass such as perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas cnf2n 1coo fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas cnf2n 1 ch2ch2 coo perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids pfsas cnf2n 1so3 and per and polyfluorodicarboxylic acids pfdicas ooc cnf2n coo were investigated in detail bentel et al 2019 1 so 3 2 h υ so 3 e aq the concentration of pfas reported in contaminated water has been usually at the ng l to μg l level ateia et al 2019b li et al 2020 which is uneconomic and inefficient for direct treatment by the reductive degradation process therefore some pretreatment methods like membrane technologies and sorption desorption are preferred to concentrate pfass before applying the uv sulfite process it has been reported that the concentration of pfas could be concentrated from 10 μg l to around 10 mg l by sorption desorption dixit et al 2020 which means that only 0 1 of the original volume of wastewater needs to be treated by the uv sulfite system after the uv sulfite treatment the pfas free wastewater effluent can be neutralized and further treated to remove salts by traditional methods however anions and organic substances such as carbonate phosphate nitrate chloride and humic acid ha usually exist in surface water or ground water and probably affect the reductive degradation efficiency of pfoa by using the uv sulfite process after an enrichment process the anions and organic substances are typically also concentrated in addition in the case of an ion exchange based concentration process the desorption eluent might be concentrated brine solution therefore the effect of a high concentration of anions and organic substances on pfoa degradation in the uv sulfite system should be evaluated so as to guide practical application so far only a few studies have investigated the effect of co existing compounds e g 10 mm nitrate and 1 mg l ha on pfoa reductive degradation guo et al 2019 song et al 2013 while research related to the effect of phosphate chloride carbonate and ha with high concentrations on pfoa degradation by the uv sulfite system is still lacking furthermore as some new intermediates were identified from the degraded samples for the first time in this study we believe that the current degradation pathways and mechanisms of pfoa in the uv sulfite process are incomplete and need further explanation in this study the effect of ph 9 12 and a high concentration of co existing compounds cl 50 1709 mm po4 3 5 25 mm co3 2 5 25 mm no3 1 12 5 mm and ha 10 50 mg l on pfoa degradation efficiency in the uv sulfite system was investigated next the degradation intermediates as well as possible degradation pathways and mechanisms were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms we identified new sulfonated and unsaturated intermediates that are now being reported for the first time which also revealed new information on the pfoa degradation pathways and mechanisms in the uv sulfite process the present findings have important implications for eliminating pfoa from concentrated water and understanding the degradation

intermediates were analyzed by xcalibur qual browser thermo all chemical compositions of the intermediates were generated by comparison with the database 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph the hydrated electron e aq is the one of the strongest reductive species e 2 9 v that can be used for breaking the c f bonds of pfas to achieve effective degradation and defluorination therefore generation of a large amount of e aq is the key step in the whole process the generation of e aq in the uv sulfite system is very sensitive to the solution ph bentel et al 2020a gu et al 2017b song et al 2013 in acidic conditions e aq will be rapidly quenched by reacting with protons via eq 2 gu et al 2017a on the other hand the quantum yield of e aq will be greatly enhanced in alkaline conditions by the reaction of h and oh via eq 3 gu et al 2017a and thus a high ph should be preferred 2 h e aq h k 2 3 10 10 m 1 s 1 3 h oh e aq h 2 o k 2 2 10 7 m 1 s 1 in this study the effect of ph 9 to 12 on pfoa degradation and defluorination performance was investigated and the results are shown in fig 2 a rapid degradation of pfoa was observed from ph 9 to 12 fig 2a as all degradation efficiencies exceeded 95 after 30 min and reached 100 within the first 1 h however the defluorination efficiency only reached 36 to 57 in the first 30 min fig 2b and many intermediates were observed in the ms spectra figs s5 s9 this indicates that although the decomposition of pfoa was rapid most of the pfoa molecules were transformed into other perfluorinated intermediates therefore when comparing degradation efficiencies the defluorination efficiency is a better indicator for evaluating the degradation performance compared to the residual pfoa concentration after 24 h reaction the defluorination efficiency reached 98 at ph 12 which was much higher than those at ph 9 11 85 to 89 similar results were observed in a previous study bentel et al 2020a these results indicate that strong alkaline conditions are beneficial for pfoa degradation and defluorination to better understand the degradation process the concentrations of intermediates can be used as indicators to evaluate the degradation performance however the determination of the exact concentration of the intermediates is hampered by the lack of standard samples thus the peak areas of the intermediates were used to estimate their relative abundance as too many intermediates were detected from the ms spectra only the six main intermediates generated were analyzed and are shown in fig 3 it is noteworthy that p1 p4 p6 p8 and p9 were first reported in this study due to the lack of standards accurate quantitative values of the intermediates are not available therefore we could only roughly calculate the quantitative value of these intermediates by assuming that their ionization ability in the ms was similar to that of pfoa a comparison of peak area of each important intermediate and pfoa standards was calculated and is summarized in table s1 a detailed discussion of these intermediates and mechanisms is given in section 3 4 as shown in fig 3 the peak areas of all representative intermediates at ph 12 after 2 h reaction were much smaller than those at ph 9 11 most of these intermediates were fully decomposed at ph 9 12 after 24 h reaction however as shown in fig 3d and e p6 and p8 were not fully degraded after 24 h reaction at ph 9 11 the abundance of p6 even accumulated during the reaction this indicates that p6 and p8 are recalcitrant intermediates which are probably resistant to the reductive degradation at ph 9 11 these results further prove that strong alkaline conditions are beneficial for e aq generation and will enhance degradation efficiency nevertheless extreme ph conditions might be uneconomical in real wastewater treatment thus ph 10 was chosen as a suitable parameter for further experiments 3 2 effect of co existing anions the concentration of pfas in contaminated water is usually at the level of ng l to μg l ateia et al 2019a hu et al 2016 sunderland et al 2019 which is too low to be treated directly by the uv sulfite process to increase the efficiency of the process concentration of the pfass before the degradation process is required it has been reported that ion exchange is one of the most effective methods to remove pfoa from water gao et al 2017 park et al 2020 and that a high concentration of naoh and or nacl solution is efficient for resin regeneration belkouteb et al 2020 dixit et al 2020 however the concentrated solution may also contain more common ions and organic substances which may affect the degradation performance du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 therefore we investigated the effect of co existing anions chloride phosphate carbonate and nitrate and humic acid on pfoa degradation in the uv sulfite system at ph 10 the effect of chloride on pfoa degradation and defluorination is shown in fig 4 a and b the presence of 50 150 mm chloride did not affect the defluorination and degradation efficiency the concentrations of pfoa were all below the detection limits after 1 h reaction and the defluorination in all cases reached around 90 after 24 h even in high salinity conditions 0 855 and 1 709 m fig s1 the defluorination efficiency was not negatively affected and reached 90 and 92 after 24 h the results imply that pfoa brine solution could be directly treated by the uv sulfite process despite a high ph value and or high chloride concentration unlike in aops where chloride might inhibit the degradation efficiency of an organic pollutant by reacting with oh or so4 the generation of chlorine radicals cl e 2 4 v han et al 2021 would be greatly inhibited due to the strong reductive conditions in the uv sulfite system therefore the effect of chloride on pfoa degradation in the uv sulfite system is not significant this is an advantage over aops when considering the treatment of the pfas desorption solution the presence of phosphate had an adverse effect on pfoa degradation and defluorination fig 4c and d when the concentration of phosphate was increased from 5 to 25 mm the defluorination efficiency decreased from 30 to 15 after 30 min reaction and from 90 to 82 after 24 h reaction this suggests that although the degradation of pfoa was inhibited at the beginning the final defluorination efficiencies were only slightly affected there was no uv blocking effect in the system as the phosphate does not absorb uv at 254 nm fig s2 however it has previously been reported that the logarithm of the rate constant for quenching e aq is linearly related to the number of the o h bonds in the phosphate molecule and the e aq decay kinetics depends slightly on the phosphate concentration with a rate constant of 2 105 l mol 1 s 1 at high ph levin et al 2007 thus the slight decrease in the defluorination efficiency could be attributed to the e aq quenching effect of the phosphate species although the inhibition effect of phosphate on pfoa degradation is weak the concentration of phosphate should be controlled to avoid the e aq quenching effect when considering practical application the inhibition effect of carbonate on the pfoa degradation and defluorination ratio was more significant than with phosphate and chloride as shown in fig 5 a the addition of 5 12 5 and 25 mm carbonate greatly decreased the final defluorination efficiency from 89 to 67 51 and 43 respectively the degradation of pfoa was inhibited fig 5b previously it was reported that 1 mm carbonate bicarbonate had no observable impact on dehalogenation in the uv sulfite system li et al 2014 however when the concentration of carbonate was 5 mm or higher in this study an obvious inhibition effect on pfoa degradation was observed as the uv254 absorbance of 25 mm carbonate fig s2 is very low the uv blocking effect was not the main reason for the decreased pfoa degradation efficiency the rate constant for the reaction of e aq and carbonate was reported to be 3 9 105 l mol 1 s 1 at ph 11 4 buxton et al 1988 which is higher than that of phosphate therefore the scavenging of e aq by carbonate was the most likely reason for the inhibition nitrate is known as an effective scavenger for e aq it has been proposed that the presence of nitrate would greatly suppress pfas degradation by rapidly reacting with e aq via eqs 4 6 cui et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to find a tolerable nitrate concentration level for the uv sulfite system to guide practical application the effect of nitrate on pfoa defluorination and degradation are shown in fig 5c and d in the presence of 1 mm nitrate the degradation of pfoa was greatly inhibited in the first 2 h as only 13 of pfoa was degraded and achieved 4 defluorination efficiency then 99 of pfoa was degraded and achieved 52 defluorination efficiency in the 4 h reaction this could be attributed to the fact that first all nitrate anions were consumed by hydrated electrons after which the degradation of pfoa started finally after 24 h reaction the defluorination efficiency reached 89 and a complete degradation of pfoa was observed when the concentration of nitrate exceeded 2 mm the degradation and defluorination of pfoa were significantly suppressed during the whole process only very weak defluorination and degradation of pfoa were observed after 24 h reaction although the concentrations of nitrate in contaminated surface water and groundwater are usually below 1 mm some pretreatment methods would be needed to remove a high concentration of nitrate from the desorption eluent before applying the uv sulfite process one feasible method is simply to increase the sulfite dosage as shown in fig s3 in the presence of 2 mm nitrate when the sulfite dosage was increased to 20 or 30 mm 99 defluorination and 100 degradation of pfoa were achieved after 24 h however a strong inhibition effect was still observed in the first 2 h this indicates that even though a higher sulfite dosage was able to remove extra nitrate and obtain high defluorination efficiency the reaction rate was the key factor that dominates the e aq production as the uv emission was the same in all experiments 4 no 3 e a q n o 3 2 k 1 0 10 10 m 1 s 1 5 no 3 2 h 2 o n o 3 h oh pk 7 5 6 n o 3 h no 2 oh 3 3 effect of humic acid the effect of humic acid ha on pfoa degradation is much more complicated than the effect of common anions it has been claimed that depending on the concentration ha will either enhance or inhibit the degradation of pfas compounds cui et al 2020 the results of this study are consistent with this statement as illustrated in fig 6 the presence of 10 mg l ha inhibited pfoa degradation in the first 2 h and after that enhanced the degradation and yielded a high defluorination efficiency 93 after 24 h however when the concentration of ha was increased to 25 and 50 mg l the degradation of pfoa was significantly suppressed fig 6a and only achieved 75 and 20 defluorination efficiency respectively after 24 h the inhibition could be attributed to three possible reasons firstly ha has been reported to have a uv blocking effect as it competes with sulfite for photons and thus reduces the production of e aq cui et al 2020 uyguner and bekbolet 2005 fig 6d illustrates the strong uv blocking effects observed at 254 nm in the presence of 10 25 and 50 mg l ha secondly hydrated electrons have been proved to be a promising reductive species for degrading organic contaminants in water li et al 2014 yu et al 2018 it has been reported that organic compounds with electron withdrawing groups e g f cl br no2 cooh and cho possess high reactivities with e aq li et al 2019 therefore ha with electron withdrawing groups might quench e aq and result in the inhibition of pfoa degradation thirdly the destruction of ha by uv or e aq might generate reactive species that could oxidize e aq and hence lead to a low degradation efficiency cui et al 2020 as for the promotion effect of ha guo et al 2019 reported that the presence of a low concentration of ha could promote pfoa degradation in the uv iodide system they proposed that the aromatic rings in ha could react with i2 formed during the generation of e aq generating π complexes to protect e aq from quenching by i2 then the electron donating groups in ha such as phenolic hydroxyl groups would release electrons and reduce i2 in π complexes to i which accelerates the cycling of iodide i hν254 i e aq i i i2 i2 e i and improves the generation of e aq eq 7 the generation of e aq from the uv sulfite system is similar to that in the uv iodide system eqs 1 and 7 moreover the transformation of sulfite species in the uv sulfite system eqs 8 10 cui et al 2020 is also similar to the cycling of iodide thus we propose that the continuous generation of e aq from the uv sulfite system at low ha concentrations might be similar to the uv iodide system that the ha might also serve as electron shuttles to reduce s2o6 2 to so3 2 and so3 and accelerate the generation of e aq 7 i h ν 254 i e aq 8 so 3 so 3 s 2 o 6 2 2 k 2 1 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 9 2 so 3 h 2 o so 4 2 h hso 3 k 3 k 2 0 37 10 s 2 o 6 2 e aq so 3 so 3 2 k 2 10 5 m 1 s 1 during the degradation process the brown color of ha gradually faded which indicates that decomposition of ha occurred the uv vis spectra also confirmed the decomposition of ha as shown in figs 6c and s4 the uv254 absorbance continued to decrease in all experiments as the reaction proceeded after 24 h reaction the uv254 absorbance of the 10 mg l ha sample decreased to 0 and 100 decomposition and 93 defluorination of pfoa were observed this indicates that ha was totally degraded by uv and e aq and the remaining sulfite was still able to generate enough e aq to achieve a high defluorination efficiency on the other hand the uv254 absorbance of samples with 25 and 50 mg l ha was still high 0 56 and 1 68 respectively after 24 h reaction and the defluorination efficiencies were significantly decreased to 75 and 20 respectively this result suggests that a high concentration of ha remained in the system and led to suppression therefore it could be inferred that the blocking effects were the main reason for the inhibition of the reductive degradation of pfoa once the ha was fully destroyed by uv and e aq the reductive degradation of pfoa could proceed with an enhanced reaction rate e g as in the experiment with 10 mg l of ha overall a high concentration of ha has a notable inhibition effect on pfoa degradation and should therefore be reduced to an acceptable level to improve the efficiency in addition other organic compounds with similar functional groups and aromatic structures probably have the same effect and need to be removed 3 4 degradation intermediates and mechanism in previous studies short chain pfcas and hydrogen containing intermediates generated from pfoa reductive degradation have been widely reported bentel et al 2020b cui et al 2020 wang et al 2017 and two degradation mechanisms decarboxylation hydroxylation elimination hydrolysis dheh and h f exchange have been proposed bentel et al 2019 gu et al 2017b in the study by bentel et al 2019 the structural dependence of the pfas degradation mechanism in the uv sulfite system was also well explained based on their experimental data and quantum computing they proposed that the dissociation of the fluorine atom or carboxyl group might occur and generate cnf2n 1 or cnf2n coo radicals once the pfca molecule is attacked by a hydrated electron qu et al 2010 performed pfoa reductive degradation in 18o water and proved that water was also involved in the pfoa chain shortening reaction song et al 2013 are the only researchers to have pointed out that sulfite radicals might also be involved in the reaction by reacting with cnf2n 1 to generate cnf2n 1 so3 via eq 11 no other sulfonated intermediates generated from pfoa reductive degradation have been reported 11 c n f 2 n 1 so 3 c n f 2 n 1 so 3 in this study eight sulfonated intermediates were firstly identified from the ms spectra by determining 34s section s2 in addition other important intermediates were also analyzed the proposed degradation pathways are shown in fig 7 the first important intermediate is p1 fig s5 m z 474 93 c7f14so3h coo which has a relatively high abundance at the beginning of the degradation reaction fig 3a based on the finding of p1 we deduced that cnf2n coo could also react with a sulfite radical to generate cnf2nso3 coo2 p2 fig s8 m z 394 98 c7f14h coo is the intermediate generated by the h f exchange of pfoa which has been reported in many studies bentel et al 2020b cui et al 2020 qu et al 2010 the detection of p1 and p2 indicates that apart from the h f exchange mechanism so3 f exchange also occurs in the uv sulfite reductive degradation process when a pfoa molecule is attacked by a hydrated electron one fluoride is dropped from the carbon chain and generates a c7f14 cooh radical and then this radical is combined with a sulfite radical to generate p1 according to bentel s calculation bentel et al 2020b the c f bonds at the α position adjacent to cooh and in the middle of the pfca carbon chain have relatively low bond dissociation energies bdes compared to other c f bonds which means that the dissociation of fluoride can occur in different places after being attacked by e aq and hence can generate c7f14 cooh radicals with different structures then the c7f14 cooh radicals could react with the sulfite radical or water to generate p1 or p2 therefore p1 p2 and other generated intermediates might have several isomers pfoa is the parent compound of p1 as can be seen in fig 2a after 30 min reaction at ph 10 only 0 4 mg l pfoa 4 remained and p1 was accumulated in the samples peak area of p1 7 78e 08 on the other hand the abundance of p1 only decreased to 40 peak area from 7 78e 08 to 3 14e 08 after 2 h fig 3a with a very limited precursor both results indicate that p1 is probably more resistant to reductive degradation compared to pfoa similar results were observed for other sulfonated intermediates p4 p6 and p9 it has been suggested that a sulfonate group grafted at the end of the chain would significantly increase the bdes of the c f bond at the α position and hence decrease the degradation and defluorination efficiency bentel et al 2019 therefore the low degradation rate of all of the sulfonated intermediates could be attributed to the high bdes of the c f bonds another important intermediate is p3 fig s9 m z 374 97 c7f13 coo an unsaturated intermediate with one carbon carbon double bond a possible mechanism for p3 generation is that two adjacent c f bonds on pfoa are simultaneously attacked by a hydrated electron and release two fluoride anions then a carbon carbon double bond is formed eq 12 apart from p3 p4 p5 and p6 also contain a carbon carbon double bond the decay of p4 and p6 in different ph conditions is shown in fig 3c and d this indicates that the generation of unsaturated intermediates is an essential pathway besides the detection of p8 fig s12 m z 392 98 c7f13hoh coo suggests that water might be involved in the fluoride exchange via eq 13 12 c 7 f 15 coo 2 e aq c 7 f 13 coo 2 f 13 c 7 f 15 coo 2 e aq h 2 o c 7 f 13 hoh coo 2 f moreover the detection of p9 fig s13 m z 430 94 c7f14h so3 also indicated two possible pathways one is that p5 is derived from p2 by decarboxylation and sulfonation eq 14 which is similar to the transformation of pfoa to pfos as shown in eq 11 another possible approach is that p5 is derived from p1 by reaction via eqs 15 and 16 14 15 16 c 7 f 14 s o 3 h 2 o e aq c 7 f 14 h so 3 o h overall the detection of a sulfonated intermediate unsaturated compounds and other intermediates proved that the degradation mechanism of pfoa in water in the uv sulfite system is much more complicated than ever previously reported the chemical structure of pfoa determines that each c f bond can be attacked by e aq and participate in the reaction therefore as shown in fig 7 the intermediates could be generated via various complicated approaches from different parent compounds to summarize four main reaction mechanisms between the c f bond hydrated electron water and sulfite radical are proposed here and are given in fig 8 when a single c f bond on pfoa or other perfluorinated intermediate is attacked by a e aq one fluoride will drop and form a radical that could react with water or a sulfite radical which means that h f exchange or so3 f exchange would occur fig 8a when two adjacent c f bonds are simultaneously attacked by two hydrated electrons the generated radical would either react with water to form hydrogen and a hydroxyl group hydrolysis or directly form a carbon carbon double bond to generate an unsaturated intermediate fig 8b 4 conclusions and perspectives a strong reducing species e aq generated by the uv sulfite process was successfully applied to pfoa degradation in the current study at ph 10 the degradation of pfoa reached 100 within 1 h and the defluorination of pfoa reached 89 after 24 h when the initial ph was increased to 12 the defluorination reached 98 after 24 h reaction this indicated that strong basic conditions ph 12 are highly beneficial for pfoa decomposition and almost all fluorine atoms in pfoa molecule could be finally mineralized into fluoride anions the uv sulfite process is resistant to a high concentration of chloride and phosphate whereas carbonate nitrate and humic acid have a greater inhibition effect on pfoa degradation the presence of carbonate 5 mm nitrate 2 mm or ha 25 mg l will greatly suppress pfoa degradation by the uv blocking effect and or fast consumption of e aq moreover conditions of extremely high salinity 1 709 m chloride ph 11 25 did not affect the pfoa degradation and defluorination which means that the current method has a great potential for practical application in pfoa degradation in desorption eluents and other concentrated wastewaters the detection of sulfonated intermediates proved that apart from e aq the sulfite radical might also participate in the reaction and generate recalcitrant sulfonated intermediates therefore future studies could focus more on the reaction conditions and mechanisms to help avoid the generation of sulfonated intermediates and subsequently improve the degradation efficiency furthermore the unsaturated intermediates and other newly discovered intermediates detected during the degradation processes indicate that additional previously unknown reaction mechanisms and pathways exist and need to be studied further

16609,hydrated electrons e aq e 2 9 v generated by advanced reduction processes arps have been proved to be a promising approach to eliminate various per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in water in this study the decomposition of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in a complex water matrix by e aq generated from the uv sulfite process was investigated the effect of ph 9 12 and co existing compounds chloride nitrate phosphate carbonate and humic acid on pfoa degradation efficiency was studied in addition the intermediates and possible degradation pathways were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms the results showed that the concentration of pfoa was below the detection limit 10 μg l after 1 h conditions c0 10 mg l initial ph 10 sulfite 10 mm while 89 defluorination was achieved after 24 h using a higher initial ph ph 12 greatly enhanced the pfoa degradation as 100 degradation and 98 defluorination were achieved after 24 h the presence of carbonate 5 mm nitrate 2 mm and humic acid 25 mg l showed a significant negative effect on pfoa degradation via a uv blocking effect or quenching of hydrated electrons while the presence of chloride and phosphate had a smaller effect on pfoa degradation even at extremely high concentrations of chloride 1 709 m ph 11 25 the defluorination ratio reached 97 after 24 h of reaction time during the process short chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas c 7 and hydrogen substituted compounds were detected which implies that chain shortening and h f change reactions had occurred moreover this confirmed the generation of sulfonated and unsaturated intermediates during the process which disclosed valuable new mechanistic insights into pfoa degradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctanoic acid advanced reduction process uv sulfite degradation intermediates ms analysis 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a group of anthropogenic compounds in which at least one or all hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon chain are replaced by fluorine because of their high thermal stability low chemical activity and good water resistant properties pfass have been widely used in many products such as food packaging firefighting foams textiles and personal care products cui et al 2020 gagliano et al 2020 wu et al 2020 global production and the wide application of pfass have caused worldwide contamination since the 1940s and pfass have drawn increasing attention due to their persistence toxicity and bioaccumulation bentel et al 2019 cui et al 2020 dixit et al 2020 a representative pfas compound perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa has been widely used in the production of everyday necessities in the construction industry and textile industry pfoa has been detected in natural water soils effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and even animal tissue in recent years ghisi et al 2019 li et al 2020 sunderland et al 2019 moreover the decomposition of pfoa has been found to be extremely slow in the natural environment due to the high strength of the carbon fluorine bond li et al 2020 sunderland et al 2019 in 2019 pfoa its salts and pfoa related compounds were listed as new persistent organic pollutants pops under annex a in the stockholm convention 2019 to restrict their production and application it was reported that kidney cancer testicular cancer ulcerative colitis thyroid disease hypercholesterolemia high cholesterol and pregnancy induced hypertension are related to high pfoa exposure kwiatkowski et al 2020 nicole 2013 therefore it is important to develop a feasible method to eliminate pfoa contamination from water to date several treatment techniques such as adsorption membrane separation biological treatment advanced oxidation processes aops advanced reduction process arps and photodecomposition have been investigated for eliminating organic pollution duan et al 2019 gagliano et al 2020 ross et al 2018 shang et al 2021 trojanowicz et al 2018 of these techniques aops have shown good degradation performance but poor defluorination efficiency for pfas which means that most of the long chain pfass were degraded to short chain pfass and further degradation was limited chen and zhang 2006 qian et al 2016 trojanowicz et al 2018 by comparison arps by using hydrated electrons e aq for pfas degradation have exhibited much higher defluorination and decomposition efficiency which makes this a promising method for controlling pfas pollution bao et al 2018 bentel et al 2019 gu et al 2017b the e aq e 2 9 v is a highly reactive and reductive species that can react with the halogen atoms in organic matter qu et al 2010 it can be generated from water or by some source chemicals like iodide sulfite or indole via uv radiation guo et al 2019 because they have the highest electronegativity the fluorine atoms in pfass exhibit a strong electron withdrawing ability which makes it possible to be attacked by e aq as a reaction center song et al 2013 so far sulfite is recognized as an ideal reductant that has widely been studied for pfas degradation by arps the generation of e aq from the photoionization of so3 2 eq 1 has proved to be an effective method for pfas degradation in the study by song et al 2013 a uv sulfite process was first used for pfoa reductive degradation and the defluorination ratio of pfoa reached 88 5 after 24 h another study investigated the kinetics and evaluated the associated toxicity of pfoa decomposition by a high photon flux uv sulfite process gu et al 2017b bentel et al 2020a 2020b 2019 recently revealed the degradation kinetics and mechanism of pfass with different functional groups and chain structures in one of their studies the photo reductive decay mechanism uv sulfite process of 34 representative pfass such as perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas cnf2n 1coo fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas cnf2n 1 ch2ch2 coo perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids pfsas cnf2n 1so3 and per and polyfluorodicarboxylic acids pfdicas ooc cnf2n coo were investigated in detail bentel et al 2019 1 so 3 2 h υ so 3 e aq the concentration of pfas reported in contaminated water has been usually at the ng l to μg l level ateia et al 2019b li et al 2020 which is uneconomic and inefficient for direct treatment by the reductive degradation process therefore some pretreatment methods like membrane technologies and sorption desorption are preferred to concentrate pfass before applying the uv sulfite process it has been reported that the concentration of pfas could be concentrated from 10 μg l to around 10 mg l by sorption desorption dixit et al 2020 which means that only 0 1 of the original volume of wastewater needs to be treated by the uv sulfite system after the uv sulfite treatment the pfas free wastewater effluent can be neutralized and further treated to remove salts by traditional methods however anions and organic substances such as carbonate phosphate nitrate chloride and humic acid ha usually exist in surface water or ground water and probably affect the reductive degradation efficiency of pfoa by using the uv sulfite process after an enrichment process the anions and organic substances are typically also concentrated in addition in the case of an ion exchange based concentration process the desorption eluent might be concentrated brine solution therefore the effect of a high concentration of anions and organic substances on pfoa degradation in the uv sulfite system should be evaluated so as to guide practical application so far only a few studies have investigated the effect of co existing compounds e g 10 mm nitrate and 1 mg l ha on pfoa reductive degradation guo et al 2019 song et al 2013 while research related to the effect of phosphate chloride carbonate and ha with high concentrations on pfoa degradation by the uv sulfite system is still lacking furthermore as some new intermediates were identified from the degraded samples for the first time in this study we believe that the current degradation pathways and mechanisms of pfoa in the uv sulfite process are incomplete and need further explanation in this study the effect of ph 9 12 and a high concentration of co existing compounds cl 50 1709 mm po4 3 5 25 mm co3 2 5 25 mm no3 1 12 5 mm and ha 10 50 mg l on pfoa degradation

chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms we identified new sulfonated and unsaturated intermediates that are now being reported for the first time which also revealed new information on the pfoa degradation pathways and mechanisms in the uv sulfite process the present findings have important implications for eliminating pfoa from concentrated water and understanding the degradation

hydrated electron e aq is the one of the strongest reductive species e 2 9 v that can be used for breaking the c f bonds of pfas to achieve effective degradation and defluorination therefore generation of a large amount of e aq is the key step in the whole process the generation of e aq in the uv sulfite system is very sensitive to the solution ph bentel et al 2020a gu et al 2017b song et al 2013 in acidic conditions e aq will be rapidly quenched by reacting with protons via eq 2 gu et al 2017a on the other hand the quantum yield of e aq will be greatly enhanced in alkaline conditions by the reaction of h and oh via eq 3 gu et al 2017a and thus a high ph should be preferred 2 h e aq h k 2 3 10 10 m 1 s 1 3 h oh e aq h 2 o k 2 2 10 7 m 1 s 1 in this study the effect of ph 9 to 12 on pfoa degradation and defluorination performance was investigated and the results are shown in fig 2 a rapid degradation of pfoa was observed from ph 9 to 12 fig 2a as all degradation efficiencies exceeded 95 after 30 min and reached 100 within the first 1 h however the defluorination efficiency only reached 36 to 57 in the first 30 min fig 2b and many intermediates were observed in the ms spectra figs s5 s9 this indicates that although the decomposition of pfoa was rapid most of the pfoa molecules were transformed into other perfluorinated intermediates therefore when comparing degradation efficiencies the defluorination efficiency is a better indicator for evaluating the degradation performance compared to the residual pfoa concentration after 24 h reaction the defluorination efficiency reached 98 at ph 12 which was much higher than those at ph 9 11 85 to 89 similar results were observed in a previous study bentel et al 2020a these results indicate that strong alkaline conditions are beneficial for pfoa degradation and defluorination to better understand the degradation process the concentrations of intermediates can be used as indicators to evaluate the degradation performance however the determination of the exact concentration of the intermediates is hampered by the lack of standard samples thus the peak areas of the intermediates were used to estimate their relative abundance as too many intermediates were detected from the ms spectra only the six main intermediates generated were analyzed and are shown in fig 3 it is noteworthy that p1 p4 p6 p8 and p9 were first reported in this study due to the lack of standards accurate quantitative values of the intermediates are not available therefore we could only roughly calculate the quantitative value of these intermediates by assuming that their ionization ability in the ms was similar to that of pfoa a comparison of peak area of each important intermediate and pfoa standards was calculated and is summarized in table s1 a detailed discussion of these intermediates and mechanisms is given in section 3 4 as shown in fig 3 the peak areas of all representative intermediates at ph 12 after 2 h reaction were much smaller than those at ph 9 11 most of these intermediates were fully decomposed at ph 9 12 after 24 h reaction however as shown in fig 3d and e p6 and p8 were not fully degraded after 24 h reaction at ph 9 11 the abundance of p6 even accumulated during the reaction this indicates that p6 and p8 are recalcitrant intermediates which are probably resistant to the reductive degradation at ph 9 11 these results further prove that strong alkaline conditions are beneficial for e aq generation and will enhance degradation efficiency nevertheless extreme ph conditions might be uneconomical in real wastewater treatment thus ph 10 was chosen as a suitable parameter for further experiments 3 2 effect of co existing anions the concentration of pfas in contaminated water is usually at the level of ng l to μg l ateia et al 2019a hu et al 2016 sunderland et al 2019 which is too low to be treated directly by the uv sulfite process to increase the efficiency of the process concentration of the pfass before the degradation process is required it has been reported that ion exchange is one of the most effective methods to remove pfoa from water gao et al 2017 park et al 2020 and that a high concentration of naoh and or nacl solution is efficient for resin regeneration belkouteb et al 2020 dixit et al 2020 however the concentrated solution may also contain more common ions and organic substances which may affect the degradation performance du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 therefore we investigated the effect of co existing anions chloride phosphate carbonate and nitrate and humic acid on pfoa degradation in the uv sulfite system at ph 10 the effect of chloride on pfoa degradation and defluorination is shown in fig 4 a and b the presence of 50 150 mm chloride did not affect the defluorination and degradation efficiency the concentrations of pfoa were all below the detection limits after 1 h reaction and the defluorination in all cases reached around 90 after 24 h even in high salinity conditions 0 855 and 1 709 m fig s1 the defluorination efficiency was not negatively affected and reached 90 and 92 after 24 h the results imply that pfoa brine solution could be directly treated by the uv sulfite process despite a high ph value and or high chloride concentration unlike in aops where chloride might inhibit the degradation efficiency of an organic pollutant by reacting with oh or so4 the generation of chlorine radicals cl e 2 4 v han et al 2021 would be greatly inhibited due to the strong reductive conditions in the uv sulfite system therefore the effect of chloride on pfoa degradation in the uv sulfite system is not significant this is an advantage over aops when considering the treatment of the pfas desorption solution the presence of phosphate had an adverse effect on pfoa degradation and defluorination fig 4c and d when the concentration of phosphate was increased from 5 to 25 mm the defluorination efficiency decreased from 30 to 15 after 30 min reaction and from 90 to 82 after 24 h reaction this suggests that although the degradation of pfoa was inhibited at the beginning the final defluorination efficiencies were only slightly affected there was no uv blocking effect in the system as the phosphate does not absorb uv at 254 nm fig s2 however it has previously been reported that the logarithm of the rate constant for quenching e aq is linearly related to the number of the o h bonds in the phosphate molecule and the e aq decay kinetics depends slightly on the phosphate concentration with a rate constant of 2 105 l mol 1 s 1 at high ph levin et al 2007 thus the slight decrease in the defluorination efficiency could be attributed to the e aq quenching effect of the phosphate species although the inhibition effect of phosphate on pfoa degradation is weak the concentration of phosphate should be controlled to avoid the e aq quenching effect when considering practical application the inhibition effect of carbonate on the pfoa degradation and defluorination ratio was more significant than with phosphate and chloride as shown in fig 5 a the addition of 5 12 5 and 25 mm carbonate greatly decreased the final defluorination efficiency from 89 to 67 51 and 43 respectively the degradation of pfoa was inhibited fig 5b previously it was reported that 1 mm carbonate bicarbonate had no observable impact on dehalogenation in the uv sulfite system li et al 2014 however when the concentration of carbonate was 5 mm or higher in this study an obvious inhibition effect on pfoa degradation was observed as the uv254 absorbance of 25 mm carbonate fig s2 is very low the uv blocking effect was not the main reason for the decreased pfoa degradation efficiency the rate constant for the reaction of e aq and carbonate was reported to be 3 9 105 l mol 1 s 1 at ph 11 4 buxton et al 1988 which is higher than that of phosphate therefore the scavenging of e aq by carbonate was the most likely reason for the inhibition nitrate is known as an effective scavenger for e aq it has been proposed that the presence of nitrate would greatly suppress pfas degradation by rapidly reacting with e aq via eqs 4 6 cui et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to find a tolerable nitrate concentration level for the uv sulfite system to guide practical application the effect of nitrate on pfoa defluorination and degradation are shown in fig 5c and d in the presence of 1 mm nitrate the degradation of pfoa was greatly inhibited in the first 2 h as only 13 of pfoa was degraded and achieved 4 defluorination efficiency then 99 of pfoa was degraded and achieved 52 defluorination efficiency in the 4 h reaction this could be attributed to the fact that first all nitrate anions were consumed by hydrated electrons after which the degradation of pfoa started finally after 24 h reaction the defluorination efficiency reached 89 and a complete degradation of pfoa was observed when the concentration of nitrate exceeded 2 mm the degradation and defluorination of pfoa were significantly suppressed during the whole process only very weak defluorination and degradation of pfoa were observed after 24 h reaction although the concentrations of nitrate in contaminated surface water and groundwater are usually below 1 mm some pretreatment methods would be needed to remove a high concentration of nitrate from the desorption eluent before applying the uv sulfite process one feasible method is simply to increase the sulfite dosage as shown in fig s3 in the presence of 2 mm nitrate when the sulfite dosage was increased to 20 or 30 mm 99 defluorination and 100 degradation of pfoa were achieved after 24 h however a strong inhibition effect was still observed in the first 2 h this indicates that even though a higher sulfite dosage was able to remove extra nitrate and obtain high defluorination efficiency the reaction rate was the key factor that dominates the e aq production as the uv emission was the same in all experiments 4 no 3 e a q n o 3 2 k 1 0 10 10 m 1 s 1 5 no 3 2 h 2 o n o 3 h oh pk 7 5 6 n o 3 h no 2 oh 3 3 effect of humic acid the effect of humic acid ha on pfoa degradation is much more complicated than the effect of common anions it has been claimed that depending on the concentration ha will either enhance or inhibit the degradation of pfas compounds cui et al 2020 the results of this study are consistent with this statement as illustrated in fig 6 the presence of 10 mg l ha inhibited pfoa degradation in the first 2 h and after that enhanced the degradation and yielded a high defluorination efficiency 93 after 24 h however when the concentration of ha was increased to 25 and 50 mg l the degradation of pfoa was significantly suppressed fig 6a and only achieved 75 and 20 defluorination efficiency respectively after 24 h the inhibition could be attributed to three possible reasons firstly ha has been reported to have a uv blocking effect as it competes with sulfite for photons and thus reduces the production of e aq cui et al 2020 uyguner and bekbolet 2005 fig 6d illustrates the strong uv blocking effects observed at 254 nm in the presence of 10 25 and 50 mg l ha secondly hydrated electrons have been proved to be a promising reductive species for degrading organic contaminants in water li et al 2014 yu et al 2018 it has been reported that organic compounds with electron withdrawing groups e g f cl br no2 cooh and cho possess high reactivities with e aq li et al 2019 therefore ha with electron withdrawing groups might quench e aq and result in the inhibition of pfoa degradation thirdly the destruction of ha by uv or e aq might generate reactive species that could oxidize e aq and hence lead to a low degradation efficiency cui et al 2020 as for the promotion effect of ha guo et al 2019 reported that the presence of a low concentration of ha could promote pfoa degradation in the uv iodide system they proposed that the aromatic rings in ha could react with i2 formed during the generation of e aq generating π complexes to protect e aq from quenching by i2 then the electron donating groups in ha such as phenolic hydroxyl groups would release electrons and reduce i2 in π complexes to i which accelerates the cycling of iodide i hν254 i e aq i i i2 i2 e i and improves the generation of e aq eq 7 the generation of e aq from the uv sulfite system is similar to that in the uv iodide system eqs 1 and 7 moreover the transformation of sulfite species in the uv sulfite system eqs 8 10 cui et al 2020 is also similar to the cycling of iodide thus we propose that the continuous generation of e aq from the uv sulfite system at low ha concentrations might be similar to the uv iodide system that the ha might also serve as electron shuttles to reduce s2o6 2 to so3 2 and so3 and accelerate the generation of e aq 7 i h ν 254 i e aq 8 so 3 so 3 s 2 o 6 2 2 k 2 1 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 9 2 so 3 h 2 o so 4 2 h hso 3 k 3 k 2 0 37 10 s 2 o 6 2 e aq so 3 so 3 2 k 2 10 5 m 1 s 1 during the degradation process the brown color of ha gradually faded which indicates that decomposition of ha occurred the uv vis spectra also confirmed the decomposition of ha as shown in figs 6c and s4 the uv254 absorbance continued to decrease in all experiments as the reaction proceeded after 24 h reaction the uv254 absorbance of the 10 mg l ha sample decreased to 0 and 100 decomposition and 93 defluorination of pfoa were observed this indicates that ha was totally degraded by uv and e aq and the remaining sulfite was still able to generate enough e aq to achieve a high defluorination efficiency on the other hand the uv254 absorbance of samples with 25 and 50 mg l ha was still high 0 56 and 1 68 respectively after 24 h reaction and the defluorination efficiencies were significantly decreased to 75 and 20 respectively this result suggests that a high concentration of ha remained in the system and led to suppression therefore it could be inferred that the blocking effects were the main reason for the inhibition of the reductive degradation of pfoa once the ha was fully destroyed by uv and e aq the reductive degradation of pfoa could proceed with an enhanced reaction rate e g as in the experiment with 10 mg l of ha overall a high concentration of ha has a notable inhibition effect on pfoa degradation and should therefore be reduced to an acceptable level to improve the efficiency in addition other organic compounds with similar functional groups and aromatic structures probably have the same effect and need to be removed 3 4 degradation intermediates and mechanism in previous studies short chain pfcas and hydrogen containing intermediates generated from pfoa reductive degradation have been widely reported bentel et al 2020b cui et al 2020 wang et al 2017 and two degradation mechanisms decarboxylation hydroxylation elimination hydrolysis dheh and h f exchange have been proposed bentel et al 2019 gu et al 2017b in the study by bentel et al 2019 the structural dependence of the pfas degradation mechanism in the uv sulfite system was also well explained based on their experimental data and quantum computing they proposed that the dissociation of the fluorine atom or carboxyl group might occur and generate cnf2n 1 or cnf2n coo radicals once the pfca molecule is attacked by a hydrated electron qu et al 2010 performed pfoa reductive degradation in 18o water and proved that water was also involved in the pfoa chain shortening reaction song et al 2013 are the only researchers to have pointed out that sulfite radicals might also be involved in the reaction by reacting with cnf2n 1 to generate cnf2n 1 so3 via eq 11 no other sulfonated intermediates generated from pfoa reductive degradation have been reported 11 c n f 2 n 1 so 3 c n f 2 n 1 so 3 in this study eight sulfonated intermediates were firstly identified from the ms spectra by determining 34s section s2 in addition other important intermediates were also analyzed the proposed degradation pathways are shown in fig 7 the first important intermediate is p1 fig s5 m z 474 93 c7f14so3h coo which has a relatively high abundance at the beginning of the degradation reaction fig 3a based on the finding of p1 we deduced that cnf2n coo could also react with a sulfite radical to generate cnf2nso3 coo2 p2 fig s8 m z 394 98 c7f14h coo is the intermediate generated by the h f exchange of pfoa which has been reported in many studies bentel et al 2020b cui et al 2020 qu et al 2010 the detection of p1 and p2 indicates that apart from the h f exchange mechanism so3 f exchange also occurs in the uv sulfite reductive degradation process when a pfoa molecule is attacked by a hydrated electron one fluoride is dropped from the carbon chain and generates a c7f14 cooh radical and then this radical is combined with a sulfite radical to generate p1 according to bentel s calculation bentel et al 2020b the c f bonds at the α position adjacent to cooh and in the middle of the pfca carbon chain have relatively low bond dissociation energies bdes compared to other c f bonds which means that the dissociation of fluoride can occur in different places after being attacked by e aq and hence can generate c7f14 cooh radicals with different structures then the c7f14 cooh radicals could react with the sulfite radical or water to generate p1 or p2 therefore p1 p2 and other generated intermediates might have several isomers pfoa is the parent compound of p1 as can be seen in fig 2a after 30 min reaction at ph 10 only 0 4 mg l pfoa 4 remained and p1 was accumulated in the samples peak area of p1 7 78e 08 on the other hand the abundance of p1 only decreased to 40 peak area from 7 78e 08 to 3 14e 08 after 2 h fig 3a with a very limited precursor both results indicate that p1 is probably more resistant to reductive degradation compared to pfoa similar results were observed for other sulfonated intermediates p4 p6 and p9 it has been suggested that a sulfonate group grafted at the end of the chain would significantly increase the bdes of the c f bond at the α position and hence decrease the degradation and defluorination efficiency bentel et al 2019 therefore the low degradation rate of all of the sulfonated intermediates could be attributed to the high bdes of the c f bonds another important intermediate is p3 fig s9 m z 374 97 c7f13 coo an unsaturated intermediate with one carbon carbon double bond a possible mechanism for p3 generation is that two adjacent c f bonds on pfoa are simultaneously attacked by a hydrated electron and release two fluoride anions then a carbon carbon double bond is formed eq 12 apart from p3 p4 p5 and p6 also contain a carbon carbon double bond the decay of p4 and p6 in different ph conditions is shown in fig 3c and d this indicates that the generation of unsaturated intermediates is an essential pathway besides the detection of p8 fig s12 m z 392 98 c7f13hoh coo suggests that water might be involved in the fluoride exchange via eq 13 12 c 7 f 15 coo 2 e aq c 7 f 13 coo 2 f 13 c 7 f 15 coo 2 e aq h 2 o c 7 f 13 hoh coo 2 f moreover the detection of p9 fig s13 m z 430 94 c7f14h so3 also indicated two possible pathways one is that p5 is derived from p2 by decarboxylation and sulfonation eq 14 which is similar to the transformation of pfoa to pfos as shown in eq 11 another possible approach is that p5 is derived from p1 by reaction via eqs 15 and 16 14 15 16 c 7 f 14 s o 3 h 2 o e aq c 7 f 14 h so 3 o h overall the detection of a sulfonated intermediate unsaturated compounds and other intermediates proved that the degradation mechanism of pfoa in water in the uv sulfite system is much more complicated than ever previously reported the chemical structure of pfoa determines that each c f bond can be attacked by e aq and participate in the reaction therefore as shown in fig 7 the intermediates could be generated via various complicated approaches from different parent compounds to summarize four main reaction mechanisms between the c f bond hydrated electron water and sulfite radical are proposed here and are given in fig 8 when a single c f bond on pfoa or other perfluorinated intermediate is attacked by a e aq one fluoride will drop and form a radical that could react with water or a sulfite radical which means that h f exchange or so3 f exchange would occur fig 8a when two adjacent c f bonds are simultaneously attacked by two hydrated electrons the generated radical would either react with water to form hydrogen and a hydroxyl group hydrolysis or directly form a carbon carbon double bond to generate an unsaturated intermediate fig 8b 4 conclusions and perspectives a strong reducing species e aq generated by the uv sulfite process was successfully applied to pfoa degradation in the current study at ph 10 the degradation of pfoa reached 100 within 1 h and the defluorination of pfoa reached 89 after 24 h when the initial ph was increased to 12 the defluorination reached 98 after 24 h reaction this indicated that strong basic conditions ph 12 are highly beneficial for pfoa decomposition and almost all fluorine atoms in pfoa molecule could be finally mineralized into fluoride anions the uv sulfite process is resistant to a high concentration of chloride and phosphate whereas carbonate nitrate and humic acid have a greater inhibition effect on pfoa degradation the presence of carbonate 5 mm nitrate 2 mm or ha 25 mg l will greatly suppress pfoa degradation by the uv blocking effect and or fast consumption of e aq moreover conditions of extremely high salinity 1 709 m chloride ph 11 25 did not affect the pfoa degradation and defluorination which means that the current method has a great potential for practical application in pfoa degradation in desorption eluents and other concentrated wastewaters the detection of sulfonated intermediates proved that apart from e aq the sulfite radical might also participate in the reaction and generate recalcitrant sulfonated intermediates therefore future studies could focus more on the reaction conditions and mechanisms to help avoid the generation of sulfonated intermediates and subsequently improve the degradation efficiency furthermore the unsaturated intermediates and other newly discovered intermediates detected during the degradation processes indicate that additional previously unknown reaction mechanisms and pathways exist and need to be studied further
