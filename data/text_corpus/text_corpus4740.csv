23700,this paper focuses on the application of auv in shallow sea which environment is more complicated than deep sea owing to independence of external signals inertial navigation system ins has become the most suitable navigation and positioning system for underwater vehicles however as the excessive reliance on sensor data the precision of ins can be affected by external environment especially heading angles from low cost sensors such as attitude and heading reference system ahrs and digital compass are susceptible to waves and magnetic interference therefore how to use data from low cost sensors becomes the key to improving navigation performance optimally pruned extreme learning machine op elm was presented as a more robust and general methodology in 2010 which make it possible to fuse data by using a more reliable method in this paper we propose an intelligent fusion module which is designed to obtain the full noise model for auv by judging the state of ahrs and tcm heading angles intelligent fusion module combines full noise model with credible data by using op elm to improve the accuracy of positioning and navigation our method has been demonstrated by a range of real data which rmse can at most improve by 86 4 in complex conditions than extended kalman filter s keywords auv data fusion op elm neural network 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicle auv is an indispensable instrument which is used in the complex underwater environment such as the ocean lee et al 2012 due to its flexibility and autonomy however when auv is in operation in shallow sea complex external environment such as ferromagnetic substance will have a serious effect on the direction of auv in addition the strong ocean currents also have certain influences on navigation therefore it is meaningful to overcome unfavorable factors in shallow sea to achieve high precision navigation for auv although gps is used as a significant sensor in unmanned vehicles or unmanned aerial vehicles uavs it is limited or even unusable for auv however simultaneous localization and mapping slam cheeseman et al 1987 leonard et al 1992 thrun 2002 can create a consistent map in real time and acquire estimated positioning information simultaneously even under water therefore slam has received considerable attention for underwater vehicles in unknown environment newman and leonard 2003 newman et al 2005 ribas et al 2006 which can provide feasible solution for the realization of autonomous navigation traditionally there are lots of sensors installed in auv including ahrs digital compass pressure sensor gps and doppler velocity log dvl which are mainly used for navigation and positioning most of them are used more frequently in motor vehicles and uavs however due to the low precision the merely usage of low cost sensors cannot provide satisfactory navigation performance for auv we take ahrs and digital compass as example ahrs contains a plurality of axial sensor which can provide heading pitch and roll angles for auv however surge acceleration deceleration and even other factors will inevitably bring angle errors once the angles especially heading angles are not accurate navigation performance of auv would not be guaranteed even though most of ahrs can be input external global navigation satellite system gnss signal to correct angle errors during the process of movement nevertheless gps is invalid in water so that the compensation of angle errors cannot be achieved and when it comes to digital compass it is vulnerable to interference of ferromagnetic substance thus merely using low cost sensors data cannot meet the demand for navigation of auv therefore many algorithms have been proposed to improve the performance of ahrs and digital compass the main method is dynamic compensation blank et al 1997 qiang et al 2009 schierbeek et al 2003 smith et al 2003 včelák et al 2006 wang et al 2014 there is no doubt that these methods have played a role in improving the angle accuracy of digital compass or ahrs however no matter temperature variation change of magnetic field or other factors the vast majority of methods only focus on only one factor ignoring the effects of other factors for example robert b smith et al 2003 proposed a three axis algebraic model which is used to numerically compensate for magnetic errors by only measuring magnetic field values similarity a temperature compensation method was presented by qiang fu for the mems accelerometer in the ahrs qiang et al 2009 different from these improved methods we propose an intelligent fusion module which focuses on seeking out the full noise model instead of compensating for low cost sensors the intelligent fusion module not only takes sensors error into account but also external environment op elm miche et al 2008a 2010 2008b is presented by miche y et al compared with support vector machine svm gunn 1998 smola and vapnik 1997 yang et al 2002 and elm huang et al 2012 2004 2006 op elm has been demonstrated to be more suitable to generate the intelligent fusion module for auv in this paper in this paper we take heading angles which are from digital compass or ahrs for example because some circumstance such as strong magnetic or violent acceleration deceleration may cause untrustworthy data for sensors we judge status of sensors data and adopt different full noise models which are obtained by op elm for credible sensors data in the intelligent fusion module the paper is organized as follows section 2 is the full noise model using op elm the intelligent fusion module for ahrs and digital compass will be presented in section 3 in section 4 the result of experiments with different datasets have verified the performance of the proposed algorithm finally we draw a conclusion of this work 2 the full noise model using op elm 2 1 traditional correction and the proposed full noise model for low cost sensors current ways for the improvement of navigation performance for auv which use low cost sensors are the compensation method traditional corrections of digital compass mainly include system error compensation soft magnetic compensation and hard magnetic compensation the system error usually comes from manufacture error and installation error of sensors in general system error is inherent in the digital compass and does not change with external factors wei chen proposed an easy to use and computation efficient correction utilizing the heading angles from gps to estimate the parameters of this model in the procedure miche et al 2010 j včelák focused on seeking methods to compensate error caused by sensors misalignment cross axis effect and drifts of temperature for sensors včelák et al 2006 although different methods were used to perform compass compensation the general principle of these methods is to get the parameters of compensation by executing many complex experiments following with one time compensation for compass hard magnetic interference are generated by magnetic dipole and it will cause a deviation to output of digital compass however for the compass the toughest thing is to deal with soft magnetic interference soft magnetic interference is caused by the distortion of the local magnetic field in the case of soft magnetic interference the measured curve will be an ellipse for these magnetic interference in the environment it is necessary to determine its spatial relationship with sensor to compensate the error of compass nevertheless auv which need to go to explore the unknown area is impossible to obtain the exact location of the magnetic interference substance for ahrs it has the problem of accumulated angle error what s more acceleration deceleration is inevitable in auv operation and the usage of gnss signal to correct the angles in underwater is invalid for ahrs therefore we need to make reasonable use of low cost sensors data to improve navigation performance different from the traditional angle correction the proposed method aims to improve the navigation performance by using data from low cost sensors directly rather than only consider the compensation of these low cost sensors as we mainly focus on large scale marine investigation and detection therefore the sway of auv in local area is avoided as much as possible assuming that tcm ahrs is not affected by external environment and the accuracy of them is high enough the heading angles of tcm ahrs will be consistent with course heading angles from gps in fact the factor of external interference and sensor errors are unavoidable so only considering one factor it is difficult to achieve high precision navigation on the basis of these problems we adopt neural network to generate the full noise model which describe the relationship between the sensors heading angles and course heading angles which comes from gps the course heading angles which are obtained from gps rather than the vehicle heading angles are treated as the truth heading angles for training the full noise model because the course heading angles from gps are the resultant heading angles which are generated by vehicle heading angles and all the other influencing factors on heading angles such as magnetic interference and water current this is why gps heading angles rather than vehicle heading angles are selected as the truth heading angles both in the module and in the following comparison as the certain number of samples can not cover the full range of inputs the generalization ability and prediction accuracy of the most types of neural network can not be guaranteed however extreme learning machine elm have been proved that it can outperform other conventional neural network in above circumstance xu et al 2016 elm was proposed by huang et al and the main novelty introduced by elm is to randomly choose the input weights and biases of the hidden nodes instead of learning these parameters op elm was presented as a more robust methodology which is based on the original elm algorithm it is verified and demonstrated in the following part that the performance of op elm exceeds other neural network such as svm and elm the specific calculation method of full noise model which uses op elm is in section 2 2 2 2 review of op elm the full noise model is treated as signal hidden layer feed forward neural networks slfns the output of slfns with n hidden nodes can be presented as 1 f n x i 1 n β i g ω i b i x x r n ω i r n β r n where g ω i b i x is the ith output of hidden layer neurons corresponding to the input β β i 1 β i 2 β i m t represents the connecting link between the ith hidden layer neurons and weight vector of output neurons for n arbitrary input sample where x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n r n and t i t i 1 t i 2 t i n r n given n hidden layer neurons and activation function g ω i b i x β i ω i and b i can be found out to make slfns close to the n samples with zero error 2 j 1 n β j g ω j b j x i t i i 1 2 n to simplify the above equation 2 can be written equivalently as 3 h β t h ω 1 ω n b i b n x 1 x n g ω 1 b 1 x 1 g ω n b n x 1 g ω 1 b 1 x n g ω n b n x n n n 4 β β 1 t β n t n m t t t 1 t t n t n m t in formula 4 h is the hidden output matrix of the neural network the ith column of h is the ith output of hidden layer neurons corresponding to inputs the training process of slfns is equivalent to find the least squares solution of linear system h β t it has been proved that the global optimal output weights can be written as 5 β ˆ h r where h is moore penrose inverse matrix of the hidden layer output matrix h to remove the useless neurons of the hidden layer op elm ranks the best neurons by multi response sparse regression mrsr as an extension of least angle regression lars mrsr provides a ranking of the kernels finally the leave one out loo validation method is used to select the actual best number of neurons the most specific details of the mrsr algorithm and loo algorithm can be found from two reported papers feng et al 2013 similä and tikka 2005 respectively then the full noise model is available the algorithm flow chart of full noise model is shown in fig 1 3 an intelligent fusion module for ahrs and digital compass 3 1 the equipped platform for the intelligent fusion module the intelligent fusion module can be installed in sailfish auv 210 b which is shown in fig 2 the specifications of the auv are displayed in table 1 the electronic control system of sailfish auv 210 b is displayed in fig 3 in the control center of sailfish auv sensors can be divided into five parts perception sensors motion control unit condition monitoring unit navigation sensors and task sensors the navigation sensors contain gps digital compass ahrs and dvl as a sensor assisted for navigation on water surface gps provides not only accurate location information but also dynamic heading angles the performance of heading angles will be measured in the next section as a typical digital compass tcm 5 is used to offer the angle data for sailfish auv the tcm5 combines 3 axis of pni corporation s patented magneto inductive mi magnetic sensors and a 3 axis mems accelerometer in a single module despite it has small size light weight no error accumulation and many other advantages tcm 5 is vulnerable to the influences of various ferromagnetic and electromagnetic interferences so it is very prone to have a deviation between the measurement angle and the true angle and there is no doubt that this would affect the accuracy of measurements unlike tcm 5 which uses magnetic sensor ahrs 100 integrates three mems gyroscopes based on coriolis effect mems gyroscope measures angular velocity by the changes of capacitance then the angle is integral by the angular velocity as the integral process inevitably has problems of error accumulation ahrs could not provide accurate heading angles especially in the case of long voyages in addition surge acceleration deceleration and other factors will inevitably bring additional error except for angle ahrs 100 can also acquire the acceleration data of auv 3 2 intelligent fusion module in sailfish auv we adopt tcm 5 and ahrs 100 respectively to measure the angle of auv based on the above advantages and disadvantages of the ahrs 100 and tcm 5 an ideal intelligent fusion module is proposed to generate a full noise model which uses ahrs heading angles and tcm heading angles fig 4 when auv is sailing in the water once the heading angles of tcm have been disturbed by the strong magnetic material the navigation of auv should be more dependent on the ahrs heading angles and on the contrary when ahrs is affected by external factors auv also mainly relays on heading angles which are from tcm 5 so the first step to design this module is to determine whether sensors are affected by the external environment a violent surge will cause the roll angles of auv to be large which will have a great impact on the measurement of ahrs angles therefore we assume that if the roll angles exceed a certain limit then the angle of ahrs is no longer credible since the angle of ahrs is obtained by integration of angular velocity there will no large angle changed in a short time if the difference between tcm heading angels and ahrs heading angles is greater than 10 we consider that tcm 5 is suffering from electromagnetic interferences according to the above mentioned principle we can get more credible sensor heading angles which is not subsceptible to other factors the whole description of intelligent fusion module is as follows when gps is valid the ahrs heading angles tcm heading angles and gps heading angles are sent into intelligent fusion module the judgment of the credible heading angles will be done between tcm and ahrs and the judgment criteria has been discussed above when we get the credible heading angles the credible heading angles will be used as input of op elm together with the true heading angles the credible heading angles from ahrs tcm utilize as training object while true heading angels from gps are set as training targets after the mapping of single hidden layer neural network in op elm the correspondence between the training object and target will be described by a model once the gps is invalid by judging the state of the new heading angles the intelligent fusion module selects the appropriate model to produce the fused heading angles in order to generate more accurate trajectory for auv this is the whole workflow of intelligent fusion module for auv intelligent fusion module is designed to seek out the relationship between the normal sensor heading angles and the real values gps heading angles using op elm in fact this relationship is the concentrated expression of a variety of noise in sensor or external environment op elm is used for different credible sensor heading angles to generate different full noise models in fig 5 when the fused heading models are produced the new data from tcm5 or ahrs 100 is entered into the intelligent fusion module then the fused heading angles are given by intelligent fusion module according to the suitable model fig 6 the fused heading angles are also calculated by op elm which combines the credible sensor data and the corresponding full noise model the key of intelligent fusion module is to determine the hidden neuron numbers for op elm and this part of the content will be discussed in section 4 3 3 3 performance evaluation the performance of the intelligent fusion module is evaluated by the root mean square error rmse the corresponding formula of rmse is defined as equation 6 6 ξ i 1 n x i x ˆ i 2 n where x ˆ i represents the vector of estimated state which is produced by the proposed intelligent fusion module while x i is the ground truth of the state vector n stands for the dimension of x 4 experiments and result analysis 4 1 the feasibility of using gps heading angles as true heading angles in this paper we expect to use low cost sensors to improve the accuracy of positioning and navigation rather than only correcting the error of low cost sensors although the heading error of low cost sensors could be corrected the navigation performance cannot be improved if we ignore the influence of complex condition of water and other factors however the course headings which are from gps includes not only the vehicle s headings but also the influence of other factors on the trajectory compared with the precise calculation of fine model we use op elm to establish the relationship between sensor headings and the course heading instead of finding all factors which eventually has an impact on the trajectory for auv this full noise model can be used to generate fused heading angles by estimating the current heading angles for auv which eliminate parts of influences from water and other factors and the fused heading angles has been certified to be more effective than the original sensor heading angles section 4 4 so the gps heading angles rather than the vehicle s heading angles are considered to be the ground truth the gps receiver used in sailfish auv is u blox6 however the frequency of gps is 1 hz while the frequency of ahrs or tcm is more than 10 hz so is it reasonable to use the gps heading angles as the true heading angles under the premise of ensuring the navigation performance and whether the accuracy of gps heading angles can meet the navigation needs we have carried out a series of experiments at menlou reservior yantai fig 7 the above questions will be answered in the following 4 1 1 update rate of gps heading angles in order to prove whether the update rate of gps heading angles can satisfy the requirement of auv s navigation we use different heading angles to calculate the trajectories respectively including gps heading angles the experiment results are shown in fig 8 we adopt ekf algorithm to calculate the sailfish auv s position in the fig 8 and gps trajectories are treated as real track as mentioned above the update rate of gps heading angles data is lower however as can be seen from fig 8 trajectories which use gps heading angles are nearly coincident with the real tracks gps trajectories in fig 8 a trajectory which use tcm heading angles is also closer to the real trajectory than ahrs the most likely cause of the deviation between trajectory which use ahrs heading angles and the real track in fig 8 a is that the acceleration deceleration generated by surge and other factors has an impact on ahrs heading angles it is also reflected that ahrs is vulnerable to the influence of interference of external environment it appears that tcm heading angles are more reliable than ahrs heading angles in the complex underwater water surface environment but in fig 8 b it is opposite the trajectory which use tcm heading angles is the worst one it is possible that tcm is disturbed by some unknown magnetic material in fig 8 the trajectories which use ahrs heading angles performs difference between a and b it seems that the results of using ahrs heading angles perform worse in straight runs than during turns actually the acceleration deceleration caused by water current and other factors have been reflected on the ahrs heading angles which are shown by the trajectories in fig 8 a auv which direction is also roughly perpendicular to the direction is vulnerable to the influence of acceleration which caused by water current thus with time goes the accumulative error of ahrs could not be eliminated but increase continuously compared with the straight runs the trajectory which uses ahrs heading angles in fig 8 b has a turn from the figure we can see the track before the turn still has a heading angles error with the real track while the heading angles error after the turn is smaller this is because during the turn process the acceleration deceleration which is caused by power system of auv has a greater influence on the ahrs heading angles than the external factors such as water flow after the turn as the navigation direction of auv has changed the negative effect of complex external environment would be weakened it is noticed that this negative effect of complex external environment still exists which is shown as the heading angles error between ahrs heading angles and the true angles in the remaining trajectory anyway the trajectories which use gps heading angles perform better than others in fact the control frequency of auv is 1 hz this means that heading angles of tcm ahrs obtained above 1 hz is redundant for auv s control and the update rate of gps heading angles happen to be matched exactly with the control rate 4 1 2 accuracy assessment of heading angles the calculation of gps heading angles mainly depends on the relative location information so the greatest advantage of gps heading angles is that it cannot be affected by other factors in other words having such characteristic gps heading angles are neither like ahrs heading angles which have error accumulation problem nor like tcm heading angles which are easy to be interfered by ferromagnetic matters this is the basis for gps heading angles to be true angles it seems that in the sensors manual the accuracy of gps heading angles 0 5 is not better than that of tcm 0 3 but according to fig 8 the performance of gps heading angles can meet the demand of navigation the accuracy of ekf for navigation which uses gps heading angles is higher than 5 fig 8 b and even as high as 1 fig 8 a the rmse of different trajectories are shown in fig 9 it is obvious that the rmse of trajectories which use gps heading angles are superior to others rmse of trajectories which use others heading angles in general the above analysis confirms that it is feasible to use gps heading angles as true heading angles 4 2 the model of motion and measurement for sailfish auv 201 b in this module of sailfish auv state vector mainly includes the position information and the heading angles value h of auv we denote the auv state vector as follow 7 x t x t y t h t t and the auv motion model is presented as 8 8 x t y t h t x t 1 v x t t 0 5 a x t t 2 y t 1 v y t t 0 5 a y t t 2 h t 1 ω t w t in equation 8 v x t and v y t represent the north and east velocity under global coordinate system while a x t and a y t stand for the acceleration which are corresponding to v x t and v y t ω is the angular velocity of the heading angles t is the time steps and w t is the process noise and it is assumed to be white noise it can be seen that the whole variables in the motion model are global variables however no matter the velocity of dvl or the acceleration of ahrs they are all based on their own local coordinate system so coordinate transformation need to be done before variables are used equation 9 12 show the process of transforming the velocity and acceleration from the local coordinate system into global coordinate system 9 v x t c o s p c o s r v d v l x c o s p s i n r v d v l y s i n p v d v l z 10 v y t s i n h

and the acceleration of ahrs in x direction under the local coordinate system the local coordinate system satisfies the right hand criterion and the x axis corresponds to the auv s forward direction the y axis is perpendicular to the x axis and the z axis is vertically down h p r represent heading angles pitch angles and roll angles of auv respectively the auv measurement model is shown as 13 and the only observation variable is the heading angles in this paper we primarily concern about the effect of heading angles on the track therefore we ignore the depth information in the motion model and measurement model 13 z t h t t 4 3 the selection of learning algorithm for intelligent fusion module in this part we got the full noise model corresponding to credible heading angels which are not affected by other factors then the credible heading angles which combine with other credible sensor data are used to produce the fused heading angles in the intelligent fusion module the selection of learning algorithm is very critical for acquisition of full noise model there are many neural network methods which have been used in several practical fields wilson and sharda 1994 maier and dandy 2000 including underwater robot ishii et al 1995 zhang et al 2009 neural network which has excellent capacity of parallel computing and adaptive learning can achieve optimal signal processing however the uncertainty of leaning error limits the application of neural network according to the characteristic of neural networks we compared many learning algorithms for the intelligent fusion module such as svm elm and op elm with different parameters since heading angles have the greatest influence on the navigation in the two dimensional plane and in order to avoid the interaction of too many variables we chose heading angles to be the experimental variable in the complex underwater water surface environment table 2 shows the error mean and the rmse value of ahrs 100 and tcm 5 in complex water environment in table 2 we can see that in the complex underwater water surface environment the heading angles of ahrs 100 and tcm 5 have been seriously affected by a variety of unknown factors so the average error between the ahrs heading angles and the true heading angles is 13 4 while this difference can be as high as 20 8 for tcm 5 however the rmse of ahrs 100 is higher than tcm 5 it explains why the angle deviation of tcm 5 is smaller than ahrs 100 table 3 is the error mean and rmse value of svm algorithm from table 3 we can draw the conclusion that when the penalty parameter value is 10 the error mean of svm is closer to the course heading angles although own the ideal error mean the deviation between the fused svm heading angles and the actual heading angles value in table 3 are not comparable to the tcm s in table 2 so we do not adopt svm for intelligent fusion module table 4 shows the error mean of elm and op elm algorithm with different number of hidden neurons in different activation functions too many hidden neurons will bring excessive time consumption we no longer continue to calculate the error mean which utilizes more hidden neurons the error mean are obtained by running the same algorithm with same parameter 10 times in this table the error mean of elm with activation function sig is unstable which range from 11 3 to 19 6 and it is obvious that the error mean produced by elm with activation function sin is worse than either ahrs 100 or tcm 5 in general although the tendency of the error mean of elm with activation function sin decreases with the increasing of the number of hidden neurons we don t consider this situation as it cannot meet our real time requirement compared with elm the error mean of proposed method which uses op elm is better in addition the op elm with different number of hidden neurons has more stable error mean which range is only from 10 5 to 12 0 in a word the error mean of elm with the hidden neurons 70 and 90 which activation function are sig and the error mean of op elm perform better than either ahrs 100 or tcm 5 table 5 illustrates the rmse of elm in different activation functions and op elm with different number of hidden neurons the rmse of elm with activation function sig and sin is also worse than the rmse of tcm 5 which cannot comparable to the rmse of op elm combined the results of tables 4 and 5 we can conclude that the minimum value of error mean and rmse is obtained when the number of hidden neurons for op elm is 90 so in this paper op elm with hidden neurons number 90 is chosen for intelligent fusion module since the fused heading angles which combine the full noise model with credible sensor are closer to the true angles 4 4 the experiments and result analysis of intelligent fusion module we conducted a series of experiments in tuandao qingdao china and menlou reservoir yantai china to test the intelligent fusion module fig 10 fig 10 is the graph of experimental scene and table 6 is operation scenarios of the different experiments at the beginning of experiment both tcm 5 and ahrs need to be calibrated not only hard iron effects but also soft iron effects should be compensated for auv the whole experiment is divided into two steps firstly the heading angles models are generated by training the sensors data then according to the heading angles models the fused heading are obtained from intelligent fusion module for auv navigation during these process gps has two different roles in the first step gps heading angles are used to train the heading angles model and in the second step the true tracks offered by gps are only used as the real trajectories while the gps heading angles are no longer used in this step in these experiments we chose the best parameters of the different algorithms so the number of hidden neurons for elm is 30 with the activation function sig in regard to svm the value of penalty parameter is selected to be 10 and the number of hidden neurons is determined to be 90 for op elm firstly we deal with heading angles of ahrs and tcm during the data handling stage the general principle is that in order to prevent transitions from 0 to 360 we calculate heading angles by using the initial heading angles plus the heading angles change value then the calculated heading angles are sent into intelligent fusion module to generate the fused heading angles at last the fused heading angles are used for auv fig 11 illustrates four groups of heading angles produced by different methods there are differences between the tcm heading angles ahrs heading angles and the gps heading angles in fig 11 a the fused heading angles generated by svm and elm are instable and can not be used for the actual application of navigation and positioning compared with other heading angles heading angles fused by the intelligent fusion module which use op elm are the closest to the true heading angles in fig 11 b the fused svm heading angles are still instable and the fused elm heading angles perform poor which heading angles are even not better than any single sensor s however the fused op elm heading angles which are selected for intelligent fusion module are better than others in fig 11 c and d the fused svm heading angles the fused elm heading angles and the fused op elm heading angles are almost coincident in general no matter large or small change in heading angles the fused op elm heading angles perform better than others based on the above analysis we have confirmed the feasibility and correctness of the op elm for the intelligent fusion module in fig 12 there are four groups of trajectories produced by different methods in this figure the green lines stand for gps trajectories which are the true tracks for auv the cyan lines represent the trajectories which use the fused svm heading angles according the operation conditions listed in table 6 different from other scenarios auv in scenario b is not influenced by ferromagnetic interference the performance of trajectory which uses tcm heading angles in fig 12 b is obviously better than that in other datasets this also implies that the effect of ferromagnetic on tcm heading angles are extremely bad compared with tcm trajectories the ahrs trajectories perform relatively stable to ferromagnetic interference the position error between ahrs trajectory and true track are mainly caused by water current it can be concluded that if the sensor is not susceptible to external interference the track which directly use the sensor data can offer more accurate navigation data than trajectory which use fused svm or elm heading angles however once the low cost sensors are influenced by unknown factors such as trajectories which use ahrs heading angles in fig 12 a b c d or trajectories which use tcm heading angles in fig 12 a c d the errors can not be controlled when it comes to trajectories which use fused svm and elm heading angles they are not consistent between all kinds of scenes based on the original elm algorithm op elm is proposed with additional steps to make it more robust and generic miche et al 2010 therefore the trajectories which use fused heading from op elm and is closest to true track in all scenario than others are more suitable for using in intelligent fusion module after overall consideration of these methods it is wise to select op elm for intelligent fusion module in fig 13 the error of heading angles which uses fused op elm heading angles are smallest fig 14 is the four groups of rmse produced by different methods the rmse of trajectories which use fused op elm heading angles in the intelligent fusion module is better than rmse of other trajectories as shown in fig 14 the accuracy of using the intelligent fusion module can be higher than tcm by 9 8 86 4 and higher than ahrs by 7 7 60 fig 15 shows the comparisons between the proposed method and other approaches choi et al 2007 gao et al 2013 loebis et al 2004 rigby et al 2006 besides of the proposed method ekf and ukf are directly used to fuse tcm heading angles and ahrs heading angles as a comparison the judgments of credible heading angles for ekf and ukf fusion algorithms are consistent with the proposed method table 7 and table 8 are the comparisons of average positioning error and average accuracy improvement for different approaches from the two table we can conclude that compared with trajectories which are generated by using ekf or ukf method to fused tcm and ahrs heading angles the trajectories which use proposed method performs better in accuracy 5 conclusion in this paper we proposed an intelligent fusion module based on op elm algorithm for low cost sensors firstly through a series of experiments we chose op elm as our learning algorithm for the intelligent fusion module to generate the full noise model for credible sensor heading angles then our intelligent fusion module was well demonstrated by a range of real datasets compared to directly use low cost sensors such as tcm5 or ahrs 100 data to execute ekf the proposed intelligent fusion module exhibited higher accuracy which rmse can at most improve by 86 4 in the complex conditions the experimental results verified the validity and efficiency of the proposed method for auv the intelligent fusion module can autonomously improve navigation performance and can reduce human intervention it is significant to the autonomy of the auv the application prospect of the proposed intelligent fusion module are very extensive which can be easily transplanted and extended to other sensors our future work will focus on applying this proposed method to dvl to generate more accurate positioning and navigation data and eventually build an intelligent navigation system for auv acknowledgement the paper is partially supported by the natural science foundation of china 41176076 31202036 51379198 and the high

23700,this paper focuses on the application of auv in shallow sea which environment is more complicated than deep sea owing to independence of external signals inertial navigation system ins has become the most suitable navigation and positioning system for underwater vehicles however as the excessive reliance on sensor data the precision of ins can be affected by external environment especially heading angles from low cost sensors such as attitude and heading reference system ahrs and digital compass are susceptible to waves and magnetic interference therefore how to use data from low cost sensors becomes the key to improving navigation performance optimally pruned extreme learning machine op elm was presented as a more robust and general methodology in 2010 which make it possible to fuse data by using a more reliable method in this paper we propose an intelligent fusion module which is designed to obtain the full noise model for auv by judging the state of ahrs and tcm heading angles intelligent fusion module combines full noise model with credible data by using op elm to improve the accuracy of positioning and navigation our method has been demonstrated by a range of real data which rmse can at most improve by 86 4 in complex conditions than extended kalman filter s keywords auv data fusion op elm neural network 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicle auv is an indispensable instrument which is used in the complex underwater environment such as the ocean lee et al 2012 due to its flexibility and autonomy however when auv is in operation in shallow sea complex external environment such as ferromagnetic substance will have a serious effect on the direction of auv in addition the strong ocean currents also have certain influences on navigation therefore it is meaningful to overcome unfavorable factors in shallow sea to achieve high precision navigation for auv although gps is used as a significant sensor in unmanned vehicles or unmanned aerial vehicles uavs it is limited or even unusable for auv however simultaneous localization and mapping slam cheeseman et al 1987 leonard et al 1992 thrun 2002 can create a consistent map in real time and acquire estimated positioning information simultaneously even under water therefore slam has received considerable attention for underwater vehicles in unknown environment newman and leonard 2003 newman et al 2005 ribas et al 2006 which can provide feasible solution for the realization of autonomous navigation traditionally there are lots of sensors installed in auv including ahrs digital compass pressure sensor gps and doppler velocity log dvl which are mainly used for navigation and positioning most of them are used more frequently in motor vehicles and uavs however due to the low precision the merely usage of low cost sensors cannot provide satisfactory navigation performance for auv we take ahrs and digital compass as example ahrs contains a plurality of axial sensor which can provide heading pitch and roll angles for auv however surge acceleration deceleration and even other factors will inevitably bring angle errors once the angles especially heading angles are not accurate navigation performance of auv would not be guaranteed even though most of ahrs can be input external global navigation satellite system gnss signal to correct angle errors during the process of movement nevertheless gps is invalid in water so that the compensation of angle errors cannot be achieved and when it comes to digital compass it is vulnerable to interference of ferromagnetic substance thus merely using low cost sensors data cannot meet the demand for navigation of auv therefore many algorithms have been proposed to improve the performance of ahrs and digital compass the main method is dynamic compensation blank et al 1997 qiang et al 2009 schierbeek et al 2003 smith et al 2003 včelák et al 2006 wang et al 2014 there is no doubt that these methods have played a role in improving the angle accuracy of digital compass or ahrs however no matter temperature variation change of magnetic field or other factors the vast majority of methods only focus on only one factor ignoring the effects of other factors for example robert b smith et al 2003 proposed a three axis algebraic model which is used to numerically compensate for magnetic errors by only measuring magnetic field values similarity a temperature compensation method was presented by qiang fu for the mems accelerometer in the ahrs qiang et al 2009 different from these improved methods we propose an intelligent fusion module which focuses on seeking out the full noise model instead of compensating for low cost sensors the intelligent fusion module not only takes sensors error into account but also external environment op elm miche et al 2008a 2010 2008b is presented by miche y et al compared with support vector machine svm gunn 1998 smola and vapnik 1997 yang et al 2002 and elm huang et al 2012 2004 2006 op elm has been demonstrated to be more suitable to generate the intelligent fusion module for auv in this paper in this paper we take heading angles which are from digital compass or ahrs for example because some circumstance such as strong magnetic or violent acceleration deceleration may cause untrustworthy data for sensors we judge status of sensors data and adopt different full noise models which are obtained by op elm for credible sensors data in the intelligent fusion module the paper is organized as follows section 2 is the full noise model using op elm the intelligent fusion module for ahrs and digital compass will be presented in section 3 in section 4 the result of experiments with different datasets have verified the performance of the proposed algorithm finally we draw a conclusion of this work 2 the full noise model using op elm 2 1 traditional correction and the proposed full noise model for low cost sensors current ways for the improvement of navigation performance for auv which use low cost sensors are the compensation method traditional corrections of digital compass mainly include system error compensation soft magnetic compensation and hard magnetic compensation the system error usually comes from manufacture error and installation error of sensors in general system error is inherent in the digital compass and does not change with external factors wei chen proposed an easy to use and computation efficient correction utilizing the heading angles from gps to estimate the parameters of this model in the procedure miche et al 2010 j včelák focused on seeking methods to compensate error caused by sensors misalignment cross axis effect and drifts of temperature for sensors včelák et al 2006 although different methods were used to perform compass compensation the general principle of these methods is to get the parameters of compensation by executing many complex experiments following with one time compensation for compass hard magnetic interference are generated by magnetic dipole and it will cause a deviation to output of digital compass however for the compass the toughest thing is to deal with soft magnetic interference soft magnetic interference is caused by the distortion of the local magnetic field in the case of soft magnetic interference the measured curve will be an ellipse for these magnetic interference in the environment it is necessary to determine its spatial relationship with sensor to compensate the error of compass nevertheless auv which need to go to explore the unknown area is impossible to obtain the exact location of the magnetic interference substance for ahrs it has the problem of accumulated angle error what s more acceleration deceleration is inevitable in auv operation and the usage of gnss signal to correct the angles in underwater is invalid for ahrs therefore we need to make reasonable use of low cost sensors data to improve navigation performance different from the traditional angle correction the proposed method aims to improve the navigation performance by using data from low cost sensors directly rather than only consider the compensation of these low cost sensors as we mainly focus on large scale marine investigation and detection therefore the sway of auv in local area is avoided as much as possible assuming that tcm ahrs is not affected by external environment and the accuracy of them is high enough the heading angles of tcm ahrs will be consistent with course heading angles from gps in fact the factor of external interference and sensor errors are unavoidable so only considering one factor it is difficult to achieve high precision navigation on the basis of these problems we adopt neural network to generate the full noise model which describe the relationship between the sensors heading angles and course heading angles which comes from gps the course heading angles which are obtained from gps rather than the vehicle heading angles are treated as the truth heading angles for training the full noise model because the course heading angles from gps are the resultant heading angles which are generated by vehicle heading angles and all the other influencing factors on heading angles such as magnetic interference and water current this is why gps heading angles rather than vehicle heading angles are selected as the truth heading angles both in the module and in the following comparison as the certain number of samples can not cover the full range of inputs the generalization ability and prediction accuracy of the most types of neural network can not be guaranteed however extreme learning machine elm have been proved that it can outperform other conventional neural network in above circumstance xu et al 2016 elm was proposed by huang et al and the main novelty introduced by elm is to randomly choose the input weights and biases of the hidden nodes instead of learning these parameters op elm was presented as a more robust methodology which is based on the original elm algorithm it is verified and demonstrated in the following part that the performance of op elm exceeds other neural network such as svm and elm the specific calculation method of full noise model which uses op elm is in section 2 2 2 2 review of op elm the full noise model is treated as signal hidden layer feed forward neural networks slfns the output of slfns with n hidden nodes can be presented as 1 f n x i 1 n β i g ω i b i x x r n ω i r n β r n where g ω i b i x is the ith output of hidden layer neurons corresponding to the input β β i 1 β i 2 β i m t represents the connecting link between the ith hidden layer neurons and weight vector of output neurons for n arbitrary input sample where x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n r n and t i t i 1 t i 2 t i n r n given n hidden layer neurons and activation function g ω i b i x β i ω i and b i can be found out to make slfns close to the n samples with zero error 2 j 1 n β j g ω j b j x i t i i 1 2 n to simplify the above equation 2 can be written equivalently as 3 h β t h ω 1 ω n b i b n x 1 x n g ω 1 b 1 x 1 g ω n b n x 1 g ω 1 b 1 x n g ω n b n x n n n 4 β β 1 t β n t n m t t t 1 t t n t n m t in formula 4 h is the hidden output matrix of the neural network the ith column of h is the ith output of hidden layer neurons corresponding to inputs the training process of slfns is equivalent to find the least squares solution of linear system h β t it has been proved that the global optimal output weights can be written as 5 β ˆ h r where h is moore penrose inverse matrix of the hidden layer output matrix h to remove the useless neurons of the hidden layer op elm ranks the best neurons by multi response sparse regression mrsr as an extension of least angle regression lars mrsr provides a ranking of the kernels finally the leave one out loo validation method is used to select the actual best number of neurons the most specific details of the mrsr algorithm and loo algorithm can be found from two reported papers feng et al 2013 similä and tikka 2005 respectively then the full noise model is available the algorithm flow chart of full noise model is shown in fig 1 3 an intelligent fusion module for ahrs and digital compass 3 1 the equipped platform for the intelligent fusion module the intelligent fusion module can be installed in sailfish auv 210 b which is shown in fig 2 the specifications of the auv are displayed in table 1 the electronic control system of sailfish auv 210 b is displayed in fig 3 in the control center of sailfish auv sensors can be divided into five parts perception sensors motion control unit condition monitoring unit navigation sensors and task sensors the navigation sensors contain gps digital compass ahrs and dvl as a sensor assisted for navigation on water surface gps provides not only accurate location information but also dynamic heading angles the performance of heading angles will be measured in the next section as a typical digital compass tcm 5 is used to offer the angle data for sailfish auv the tcm5 combines 3 axis of pni corporation s patented magneto inductive mi magnetic sensors and a 3 axis mems accelerometer in a single module despite it has small size light weight no error accumulation and many other advantages tcm 5 is vulnerable to the influences of various ferromagnetic and electromagnetic interferences so it is very prone to have a deviation between the measurement angle and the true angle and there is no doubt that this would affect the accuracy of measurements unlike tcm 5 which uses magnetic sensor ahrs 100 integrates three mems gyroscopes based on coriolis effect mems gyroscope measures angular velocity by the changes of capacitance then the angle is integral by the angular velocity as the integral process inevitably has problems of error accumulation ahrs could not provide accurate heading angles especially in the case of long voyages in addition surge acceleration deceleration and other factors will inevitably bring additional error except for angle ahrs 100 can also acquire the acceleration data of auv 3 2 intelligent fusion module in sailfish auv we adopt tcm 5 and ahrs 100 respectively to measure the angle of auv based on the above advantages and disadvantages of the ahrs 100 and tcm 5 an ideal intelligent fusion module is proposed to generate a full noise model which uses ahrs heading angles and tcm heading angles fig 4 when auv is sailing in the water once the heading angles of tcm have been disturbed by the strong magnetic material the navigation of auv should be more dependent on the ahrs heading angles and on the contrary when ahrs is affected by external factors auv also mainly relays on heading angles which are from tcm 5 so the first step to design this module is to determine whether sensors are affected by the external environment a violent surge will cause the roll angles of auv to be large which will have a great impact on the measurement of ahrs angles therefore we assume that if the roll angles exceed a certain limit then the angle of ahrs is no longer credible since the angle of ahrs is obtained by integration of angular velocity there will no large angle changed in a short time if the difference between tcm heading angels and ahrs heading angles is greater than 10 we consider that tcm 5 is suffering from electromagnetic interferences according to the above mentioned principle we can get more credible sensor heading angles which is not subsceptible to other factors the whole description of intelligent fusion module is as follows when gps is valid the ahrs heading angles tcm heading angles and gps heading angles are sent into intelligent fusion module the judgment of the credible heading angles will be done between tcm and ahrs and the judgment criteria has been discussed above when we get the credible heading angles the credible heading angles will be used as input of op elm together with the true heading angles the credible heading angles from ahrs tcm utilize as training object while true heading angels from gps are set as training targets after the mapping of single hidden layer neural network in op elm the correspondence between the training object and target will be described by a model once the gps is invalid by judging the state of the new heading angles the intelligent fusion module selects the appropriate model to produce the fused heading angles in order to generate more accurate trajectory for auv this is the whole workflow of intelligent fusion module for auv intelligent fusion module is designed to seek out the relationship between the normal sensor heading angles and the real values gps heading angles using op elm in fact this relationship is the concentrated expression of a variety of noise in sensor or external environment op elm is used for different credible sensor heading angles to generate different full noise models in fig 5 when the fused heading models are produced the new data from tcm5 or ahrs 100 is entered into the intelligent fusion module then the fused heading angles are given by intelligent fusion module according to the suitable model fig 6 the fused heading angles are also calculated by op elm which combines the credible sensor data and the corresponding full noise model the key of intelligent fusion module is to determine the hidden neuron numbers for op elm and this part of the content will be discussed in section 4 3 3 3 performance evaluation the performance of the intelligent fusion module is evaluated by the root mean square error rmse the corresponding formula of rmse is defined as equation 6 6 ξ i 1 n x i x ˆ i 2 n where x ˆ i represents the vector of estimated state which is produced by the proposed intelligent fusion module while x i is the ground truth of the state vector n stands for the dimension of x 4 experiments and result analysis 4 1 the feasibility of using gps heading angles as true heading angles in this paper we expect to use low cost sensors to improve the accuracy of positioning and navigation rather than only correcting the error of low cost sensors although the heading error of low cost sensors could be corrected the navigation performance cannot be improved if we ignore the influence of complex condition of water and other factors however the course headings which are from gps includes not only the vehicle s headings but also the influence of other factors on the trajectory compared with the precise calculation of fine model we use op elm to establish the relationship between sensor headings and the course heading instead of finding all factors which eventually has an impact on the trajectory for auv this full noise model can be used to generate fused heading angles by estimating the current heading angles for auv which eliminate parts of influences from water and other factors and the fused heading angles has been certified to be more effective than the original sensor heading angles section 4 4 so the gps heading angles rather than the vehicle s heading angles are considered to be the ground truth the gps receiver used in sailfish auv is u blox6 however the frequency of gps is 1 hz while the frequency of ahrs or tcm is more than 10 hz so is it reasonable to use the gps heading angles as the true heading angles under the premise of ensuring the navigation performance and whether the accuracy of gps heading angles can meet the navigation needs we have carried out a series of experiments at menlou reservior yantai fig 7 the above questions will be answered in the following 4 1 1 update rate of gps heading angles in order to prove whether the update rate of gps heading angles can satisfy the requirement of auv s navigation we use different heading angles to calculate the trajectories respectively including gps heading angles the experiment results are shown in fig 8 we adopt ekf algorithm to calculate the sailfish auv s position in the fig 8 and gps trajectories are treated as real track as mentioned above the update rate of gps heading angles data is lower however as can be seen from fig 8 trajectories which use gps heading angles are nearly coincident with the real tracks gps trajectories in fig 8 a trajectory which use tcm heading angles is also closer to the real trajectory than ahrs the most likely cause of the deviation between trajectory which use ahrs heading angles and the real track in fig 8 a is that the acceleration deceleration generated by surge and other factors has an impact on ahrs heading angles it is also reflected that ahrs is vulnerable to the influence of interference of external environment it appears that tcm heading angles are more reliable than ahrs heading angles in the complex underwater water surface environment but in fig 8 b it is opposite the trajectory which use tcm heading angles is the worst one it is possible that tcm is disturbed by some unknown magnetic material in fig 8 the trajectories which use ahrs heading angles performs difference between a and b it seems that the results of using ahrs heading angles perform worse in straight runs than during turns actually the acceleration deceleration caused by water current and other factors have been reflected on the ahrs heading angles which are shown by the trajectories in fig 8 a auv which direction is also roughly perpendicular to the direction is vulnerable to the influence of acceleration which caused by water current thus with time goes the accumulative error of ahrs could not be eliminated but increase continuously compared with the straight runs the trajectory which uses ahrs heading angles in fig 8 b has a turn from the figure we can see the track before the turn still has a heading angles error with the real track while the heading angles error after the turn is smaller this is because during the turn process the acceleration deceleration which is caused by power system of auv has a greater influence on the ahrs heading angles than the external factors such as water flow after the turn as the navigation direction of auv has changed the negative effect of complex external environment would be weakened it is noticed that this negative effect of complex external environment still exists which is shown as the heading angles error between ahrs heading angles and the true angles in the remaining trajectory anyway the trajectories which use gps heading angles perform better than others in fact the control frequency of auv is 1 hz this means that heading angles of tcm ahrs obtained above 1 hz is redundant for auv s control and the update rate of gps heading angles happen to be matched exactly with the control rate 4 1 2 accuracy assessment of heading angles the calculation of gps heading angles mainly depends on the relative location information so the greatest advantage of gps heading angles is that it cannot be affected by other factors in other words having such characteristic gps heading angles are neither like ahrs heading angles which have error accumulation problem nor like tcm heading angles which are easy to be interfered by ferromagnetic matters this is the basis for gps heading angles to be true angles it seems that in the sensors manual the accuracy of gps heading angles 0 5 is not better than that of tcm 0 3 but according to fig 8 the performance of gps heading angles can meet the demand of navigation the accuracy of ekf for navigation which uses gps heading angles is higher than 5 fig 8 b and even as high as 1 fig 8 a the rmse of different trajectories are shown in fig 9 it is obvious that the rmse of trajectories which use gps heading angles are superior to others rmse of trajectories which use others heading angles in general the above analysis confirms that it is feasible to use gps heading angles as true heading angles 4 2 the model of motion and measurement for sailfish auv 201 b in this module of sailfish auv state vector mainly includes the position information and the heading angles value h of auv we denote the auv state vector as follow 7 x t x t y t h t t and the auv motion model is presented as 8 8 x t y t h t x t 1 v x t t 0 5 a x t t 2 y t 1 v y t t 0 5 a y t t 2 h t 1 ω t w t in equation 8 v x t and v y t represent the north and east velocity under global coordinate system while a x t and a y t stand for the acceleration which are corresponding to v x t and v y t ω is the angular velocity of the heading angles t is the time steps and w t is the process noise and it is assumed to be white noise it can be seen that the whole variables in the motion model are global variables however no matter the velocity of dvl or the acceleration of ahrs they are all based on their own local coordinate system so coordinate transformation need to be done before variables are used equation 9 12 show the process of transforming the velocity and acceleration from the local coordinate system into global coordinate system 9 v x t c o s p c o s r v d v l x c o s p s i n r v d v l y s i n p v d v l z 10 v y t s i n h

and the acceleration of ahrs in x direction under the local coordinate system the local coordinate system satisfies the right hand criterion and the x axis corresponds to the auv s forward direction the y axis is perpendicular to the x axis and the z axis is vertically down h p r represent heading angles pitch angles and roll angles of auv respectively the auv measurement model is shown as 13 and the only observation variable is the heading angles in this paper we primarily concern about the effect of heading angles on the track therefore we ignore the depth information in the motion model and measurement model 13 z t h t t 4 3 the selection of learning algorithm for intelligent fusion module in this part we got the full noise model corresponding to credible heading angels which are not affected by other factors then the credible heading angles which combine with other credible sensor data are used to produce the fused heading angles in the intelligent fusion module the selection of learning algorithm is very critical for acquisition of full noise model there are many neural network methods which have been used in several practical fields wilson and sharda 1994 maier and dandy 2000 including underwater robot ishii et al 1995 zhang et al 2009 neural network which has excellent capacity of parallel computing and adaptive learning can achieve optimal signal processing however the uncertainty of leaning error limits the application of neural network according to the characteristic of neural networks we compared many learning algorithms for the intelligent fusion module such as svm elm and op elm with different parameters since heading angles have the greatest influence on the navigation in the two dimensional plane and in order to avoid the interaction of too many variables we chose heading angles to be the experimental variable in the complex underwater water surface environment table 2 shows the error mean and the rmse value of ahrs 100 and tcm 5 in complex water environment in table 2 we can see that in the complex underwater water surface environment the heading angles of ahrs 100 and tcm 5 have been seriously affected by a variety of unknown factors so the average error between the ahrs heading angles and the true heading angles is 13 4 while this difference can be as high as 20 8 for tcm 5 however the rmse of ahrs 100 is higher than tcm 5 it explains why the angle deviation of tcm 5 is smaller than ahrs 100 table 3 is the error mean and rmse value of svm algorithm from table 3 we can draw the conclusion that when the penalty parameter value is 10 the error mean of svm is closer to the course heading angles although own the ideal error mean the deviation between the fused svm heading angles and the actual heading angles value in table 3 are not comparable to the tcm s in table 2 so we do not adopt svm for intelligent fusion module table 4 shows the error mean of elm and op elm algorithm with different number of hidden neurons in different activation functions too many hidden neurons will bring excessive time consumption we no longer continue to calculate the error mean which utilizes more hidden neurons the error mean are obtained by running the same algorithm with same parameter 10 times in this table the error mean of elm with activation function sig is unstable which range from 11 3 to 19 6 and it is obvious that the error mean produced by elm with activation function sin is worse than either ahrs 100 or tcm 5 in general although the tendency of the error mean of elm with activation function sin decreases with the increasing of the number of hidden neurons we don t consider this situation as it cannot meet our real time requirement compared with elm the error mean of proposed method which uses op elm is better in addition the op elm with different number of hidden neurons has more stable error mean which range is only from 10 5 to 12 0 in a word the error mean of elm with the hidden neurons 70 and 90 which activation function are sig and the error mean of op elm perform better than either ahrs 100 or tcm 5 table 5 illustrates the rmse of elm in different activation functions and op elm with different number of hidden neurons the rmse of elm with activation function sig and sin is also worse than the rmse of tcm 5 which cannot comparable to the rmse of op elm combined the results of tables 4 and 5 we can conclude that the minimum value of error mean and rmse is obtained when the number of hidden neurons for op elm is 90 so in this paper op elm with hidden neurons number 90 is chosen for intelligent fusion module since the fused heading angles which combine the full noise model with credible sensor are closer to the true angles 4 4 the experiments and result analysis of intelligent fusion module we conducted a series of experiments in tuandao qingdao china and menlou reservoir yantai china to test the intelligent fusion module fig 10 fig 10 is the graph of experimental scene and table 6 is operation scenarios of the different experiments at the beginning of experiment both tcm 5 and ahrs need to be calibrated not only hard iron effects but also soft iron effects should be compensated for auv the whole experiment is divided into two steps firstly the heading angles models are generated by training the sensors data then according to the heading angles models the fused heading are obtained from intelligent fusion module for auv navigation during these process gps has two different roles in the first step gps heading angles are used to train the heading angles model and in the second step the true tracks offered by gps are only used as the real trajectories while the gps heading angles are no longer used in this step in these experiments we chose the best parameters of the different algorithms so the number of hidden neurons for elm is 30 with the activation function sig in regard to svm the value of penalty parameter is selected to be 10 and the number of hidden neurons is determined to be 90 for op elm firstly we deal with heading angles of ahrs and tcm during the data handling stage the general principle is that in order to prevent transitions from 0 to 360 we calculate heading angles by using the initial heading angles plus the heading angles change value then the calculated heading angles are sent into intelligent fusion module to generate the fused heading angles at last the fused heading angles are used for auv fig 11 illustrates four groups of heading angles produced by different methods there are differences between the tcm heading angles ahrs heading angles and the gps heading angles in fig 11 a the fused heading angles generated by svm and elm are instable and can not be used for the actual application of navigation and positioning compared with other heading angles heading angles fused by the intelligent fusion module which use op elm are the closest to the true heading angles in fig 11 b the fused svm heading angles are still instable and the fused elm heading angles perform poor which heading angles are even not better than any single sensor s however the fused op elm heading angles which are selected for intelligent fusion module are better than others in fig 11 c and d the fused svm heading angles the fused elm heading angles and the fused op elm heading angles are almost coincident in general no matter large or small change in heading angles the fused op elm heading angles perform better than others based on the above analysis we have confirmed the feasibility and correctness of the op elm for the intelligent fusion module in fig 12 there are four groups of trajectories produced by different methods in this figure the green lines stand for gps trajectories which are the true tracks for auv the cyan lines represent the trajectories which use the fused svm heading angles according the operation conditions listed in table 6 different from other scenarios auv in scenario b is not influenced by ferromagnetic interference the performance of trajectory which uses tcm heading angles in fig 12 b is obviously better than that in other datasets this also implies that the effect of ferromagnetic on tcm heading angles are extremely bad compared with tcm trajectories the ahrs trajectories perform relatively stable to ferromagnetic interference the position error between ahrs trajectory and true track are mainly caused by water current it can be concluded that if the sensor is not susceptible to external interference the track which directly use the sensor data can offer more accurate navigation data than trajectory which use fused svm or elm heading angles however once the low cost sensors are influenced by unknown factors such as trajectories which use ahrs heading angles in fig 12 a b c d or trajectories which use tcm heading angles in fig 12 a c d the errors can not be controlled when it comes to trajectories which use fused svm and elm heading angles they are not consistent between all kinds of scenes based on the original elm algorithm op elm is proposed with additional steps to make it more robust and generic miche et al 2010 therefore the trajectories which use fused heading from op elm and is closest to true track in all scenario than others are more suitable for using in intelligent fusion module after overall consideration of these methods it is wise to select op elm for intelligent fusion module in fig 13 the error of heading angles which uses fused op elm heading angles are smallest fig 14 is the four groups of rmse produced by different methods the rmse of trajectories which use fused op elm heading angles in the intelligent fusion module is better than rmse of other trajectories as shown in fig 14 the accuracy of using the intelligent fusion module can be higher than tcm by 9 8 86 4 and higher than ahrs by 7 7 60 fig 15 shows the comparisons between the proposed method and other approaches choi et al 2007 gao et al 2013 loebis et al 2004 rigby et al 2006 besides of the proposed method ekf and ukf are directly used to fuse tcm heading angles and ahrs heading angles as a comparison the judgments of credible heading angles for ekf and ukf fusion algorithms are consistent with the proposed method table 7 and table 8 are the comparisons of average positioning error and average accuracy improvement for different approaches from the two table we can conclude that compared with trajectories which are generated by using ekf or ukf method to fused tcm and ahrs heading angles the trajectories which use proposed method performs better in accuracy 5 conclusion in this paper we proposed an intelligent fusion module based on op elm algorithm for low cost sensors firstly through a series of experiments we chose op elm as our learning algorithm for the intelligent fusion module to generate the full noise model for credible sensor heading angles then our intelligent fusion module was well demonstrated by a range of real datasets compared to directly use low cost sensors such as tcm5 or ahrs 100 data to execute ekf the proposed intelligent fusion module exhibited higher accuracy which rmse can at most improve by 86 4 in the complex conditions the experimental results verified the validity and efficiency of the proposed method for auv the intelligent fusion module can autonomously improve navigation performance and can reduce human intervention it is significant to the autonomy of the auv the application prospect of the proposed intelligent fusion module are very extensive which can be easily transplanted and extended to other sensors our future work will focus on applying this proposed method to dvl to generate more accurate positioning and navigation data and eventually build an intelligent navigation system for auv acknowledgement the paper is partially supported by the natural science foundation of china 41176076 31202036 51379198 and the high

23701,to reduce the mass of underwater vehicles and the temperature gradient of battery racks the methods of element birth and death is used to study topology optimization first with an objective function based on the minimum configuration flexibility the optimization results can be obtained by varying the proportion of optimization second the structural minimum temperature gradient is considered as the objective function to achieve a further topology optimization by varying the proportion of optimization finally under the condition of a given topology optimization ratio the thermal stress coupled topology optimization is applied by changing the proportion of the thermal load to the stress load the corresponding battery frame structures are obtained and the correctness of the mathematical model is verified index items topology optimization battery rack multi objective auv 1 introduction the ocean is a treasure trove of resources that have not been fully exploited fully utilizing marine resources has a special significance because of the lack of per capita resources of our country autonomous underwater vehicles auvs represent an effective tool for the development and use of the ocean they have become increasingly widely used in the fields of scientific research military industry etc increasingly more countries have adopted electric propulsion systems because electric propulsion systems benefit from their simple structure and they are not affected by back pressure numerous high energy battery groups configured in series or parallel are required to meet auv power demands for example high specific energy and high specific power lithium batteries have been widely used in auvs however the auv compact battery compartment is a closed and compact space and the method of thermal equilibrium has many limitations therefore there exists a series of security problems for the application of lithium battery packs in lithium powered underwater vehicles on the one hand the battery rack is strongly impacted by the large load in the process of vehicle emission which can destroy the battery rack structure and affect the energy supply of the whole system such that the system cannot operate normally on the other hand for underwater vehicles powered by a large number of lithium batteries the underwater vehicle navigation process generates substantial heat and causes local temperature differences in the battery compartment which affect the normal performance of the battery groups researchers have only considered the structure of the battery frame for analysis or the thermal characteristics for the battery frame design the thermal coupling problem is rarely involved to address the problem of the heat conduction topology optimization of a heat

concern a single aspect of analysis this paper will concern two aspects thermal load and force load for analysing topology optimization the battery rack structure and the mechanical properties of the materials will change when the temperature rises and the battery rack stress deformation will affect the overall temperature distribution therefore design and analysis for the thermal stress coupled topology optimization of the battery rack is extremely important the main contributions of this paper are two fold i based on the established topology optimization model for only the mechanical and thermal load a mathematical model of topology optimization is established ii taking the optimization design of the underwater vehicle battery frame as an example a practical model is used to verify the correctness of the above thermal coupling topology optimization model the optimization of the underwater vehicle battery structure is also performed in addition according to the machining practical process and topology optimization results the paper chooses a volume optimization ratio for the further study finally the paper obtains topology optimization results under different coefficient ratios of force load and thermal load 2 analysis and modelling of thermal stress coupled topology optimization before analysing the topology optimization model of coupled thermal mechanical interactions the topology optimization models under the action of force loads or thermal loads are first analysed for the analysis of force loads only structural flexibility minimization is taken as the goal to establish a topological optimization model according to the methods of element birth and death leng and zhang 2011 when analysing thermal loads only the element birth and death technology can be used to minimize the total temperature gradient finally based on the above two models the thermal stress coupled model is established using the element birth and death method when taking unit stress and temperature of unit as the objective function the corresponding flow diagram is shown in fig 1 2 1 topology optimization model under force load based on the mechanics the structural rigidity and structural flexibility can be defined as 1 k σ ε c f t u where k is the rigidity of the structure σ is the structural stress ε is the structural strain c is the structural flexibility f is the finite element stress vector and u is the finite element strain vector as shown in equation 1 the structural rigidity is the transpose of the stiffness matrix and a greater rigidity of the structure results in a greater stress that is required for the deformation of the structure in addition in the case of stress the strain is inversely proportional to the stiffness therefore structural rigidity is an ideal criterion to measure the strength of the structure under force loads with the objective function based on structural flexibility the volume fraction and the maximum stress are the constraint conditions for minimizing the structural flexibility the mathematical model of the topology optimization can be expressed as 2 find x x 1 x n t ω min c x f t u st v f

optimization f is the proportion of optimization σ j is the stress value of node j n is the number of elements and σ is the maximum stress before optimization during the optimization process the volume constraint is used as the termination condition the units whose stiffness is relatively small are cut off constantly and units with greater rigidity are retained eventually the preserved units will constitute the topology optimization results the corresponding optimization process is shown in fig 2 2 2 topology optimization model under thermal load to make the whole model temperature distribution more uniform the temperature gradient of whole model is used as the objective function to describe the uniformity of the temperature distribution under thermal forces only the topology optimization model of the steady state heat conduction problem is established under the given boundary conditions the constraint condition is the battery frame volume and the element birth and death technology is used the mathematical model of the topology optimization can be expressed as 3 find t min f t t t t t st k t p v i 1 n v i v 0 f t t 1 1 1 t t 1 n i 1 n t i where k is the heat conduction matrix t is the temperature of the node array p is the thermal load vector t is the average temperature of the nodes t i is the node temperature of node i n is the total number of nodes in the design area and v i is the unit volume note that a higher temperature results in a greater contribution to the overall temperature distribution high temperature units are reserved while lower temperature units are removed to satisfy the premise of the set proportion topology optimization therefore the overall temperature gradient within the model is minimized a topology optimization flow chart only under thermal load is shown in fig 3 2 3 topology optimization model under force loads and thermal loads the finite element units characterized by a large stress and high temperature should be retained because the contributions to the overall structure are greater combined with the unit birth and death technology other elements should be considered in the deletion design to satisfy the volume constraint and so that the desired structure can be acquired the method of weighted coefficients is used to address the multi objective problem which can combine single objectives with certain weights therefore the multi objective problem can be converted into a single objective problem the corresponding weighted optimization objective function can be expressed as follows 4 find t t 1 t n t ω max f w t i t min t max t min 1 w σ i σ min σ max σ min st v i 1 n v i v 0 f σ i σ i 0 n t i t min t max i 0 n where t is the temperature matrix f is the topology optimization objective function t i is the cell temperature of element i t min is the unit minimum temperature t max is the unit maximum temperature σ i is the stress value of element i σ min is the unit minimum stress value σ max is the unit maximum stress value and ω is the proportion of the thermal load in the topology optimization for each finite element the temperature and the stress value of each element are summed according to the given weights under the combined action units with smaller values are deleted to satisfy the set volume optimization ratio and the retained units are the result obtained under the corresponding weight value the corresponding finite element units are shown in fig 4 the method of topology optimization based on the numerical method exhibits a similar phenomenon whereby checkerboard and mesh dependence problems can occur in the topology optimization the essence of the problem is the solution of the continuous problem which does not exist or is only an approximation to the real and optimal solutions of the discrete equation li et al 2001 yang et al 1999 in this paper a convolution filtering factor first order sensitivity method is adopted to address the problem of checkerboard and mesh dependences according to kumar et al 2016 liu and huang 2016 and the experimental results are also improved the main process is expressed as follows 5 α j i 1 m v i α i v 6 f ρ i i n i ω x i ρ i f p i ρ e i n e ω x i 7 ω x i max r min δ i j 0 where α j is the node sensitivity of the finite element unit α i is the element sensitivity v i is the relative cell volume m is the sensitivity of adjacent

important component of the battery compartment the battery rack not only performs the function of connecting and fixing the battery but also bears impact loads during launching and dissipates the heat from the battery compartment 3 1 the analysis of the battery compartment structure in an auv in this paper taking a type of auv battery compartment structure as an example each small battery pack is composed of 27 batteries in parallel and the battery compartment of the whole vehicle includes 7 small battery groups the battery rack structure and battery compartment are closely linked and the battery compartment is connected to the craft shell by a thermal bridge the structure sectional view of the battery compartment and the names of the corresponding components are shown in fig 5 3 2 the analysis of the force and heat dissipation process of the structure of the battery rack as shown in fig 6 the battery rack structure and the inner wall of the battery compartment are tightly combined the underwater vehicle obtains a large acceleration in a short period of time consequently the battery rack bears a larger impact load during launching because the 27 cells of each small battery pack are identical and because the cross sectional area of the battery is small the force distribution of the battery rack can be assumed to be uniform the problem can be simplified as being a static load because of the relatively small thickness and small diameter of the battery choosing one of the small battery groups as the research object the corresponding relationship can be obtained as follows 8 f m a f 27 f where m is the mass of the monomer battery k g f is the impulsive load by the monomer battery on the battery rack n a is the acceleration of the auv m 2 s and f is the resultant force of each battery rack n during emission and navigation the battery compartment temperature increase rapidly in a short period of time because the battery pack generates substantial heat if the heat cannot be dissipated promptly it will further affect the normal performance of the battery pack according to heat transfer theory and the knowledge of battery compartment characteristics the mathematical model of the heat generation and the heat transfer model can be established first the internal battery work will produce substantial heat which will increase the temperature of the battery second the temperature of the battery rack will increase correspondingly because the battery rack and the battery pack are closely linked finally heat is delivered to the outer walls of the auv through a thermal bridge or air between the outer wall of the battery compartment and the inner wall of the auv the heat transfer flow chart is shown in fig 6 4 analysis and topology optimization design of the battery rack structure in an auv based on the thermal stress coupled topology optimization model the variable density method and birth and death technology the topology optimization of the heat load and force load are considered separately then the topology optimization under the combined action of thermal loads and force loads is considered 4 1 grid division and the optimization results of the battery rack under the force load the initial structure of the battery rack is shown in fig 7 where the bottom of the blind hole is defined as a non design area because this is where the battery is fixed and installed we take young s modulus as 5 1 gpa poisson s ratio as 0 3 and the impact load to which each cell is subjected as approximately 5 n solid92 has a quadratic displacement behavior and is well suited to model irregular meshes the element is defined by ten nodes having three degrees of freedom at each node translations in the nodal x y and z directions the element can also simulate plasticity creep swelling stress stiffening large deflections and large strains with 20 nodes each node has three degrees of freedom for meshing grids closest to the batteries were refined with smaller element because of the concentrated stresses and the number is approximately 50000 the results of the meshing are shown in fig 8 after applying the impact load to the battery rack different topology optimization ratios are chosen under the same convergence condition the optimization results obtained and the corresponding flexibility curves are shown in fig 9 under the same conditions for convergence the battery rack structure can be obtained through different volume constraints on the battery frame topology optimization the minimum of the flexibility of the overall battery rack structure change with the volume constraint is shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows that the flexibility of battery rack value becomes increasingly larger with increasing volume constraints the structure of the battery rack can satisfy the impact load requirements when the volume fraction is too small but the retention volume of the battery rack is excessive and not conducive to reducing the auv s overall mass although the remaining structure can satisfy the requirements of stress and strain in theory when the volume constraint is too great but this is difficult to implement in practice the change process of battery frame is basically consistent with theoretical analysis and verifies the validity of model under force load 4 2 the optimization process and results for the battery rack under thermal load the conventional lithium battery operating temperature is 20 c 60 c the performance of lithium batteries and their discharge capacity will decrease accordingly if the temperature is lower than 0 or subject to a high ambient temperature thus the working temperature of a lithium battery is 0 c 40 c to make the results more realistic this experiment takes 30 c as the maximum temperature of the battery rack and 15 c as the temperature of the battery compartment outer boundary combined with the temperature distribution of the battery rack the reduced temperature distribution diagram of the battery rack is shown in fig 11 according to the temperature distribution of the battery rack the minimum temperature gradient is minimized as the objective function combined with the cell birth and death method the optimized structure and the corresponding temperature distribution of the battery rack are shown in fig 12 the variation of temperature difference with the topology optimization ratio is shown in fig 13 the high temperature region should be retained because of the greater contribution to the heat conduction and the low temperature region should be deleted when the optimization is performed the regions of low temperature are deleted in turn to satisfy the volume constraints figs 12 and 13 show that with increasing of topology optimization ratio the temperature gradient in the battery rack gradually decreases and the corresponding volume also gradually decreases which is consistent with the model calculation results 4 3 optimization process and results for the battery rack under force load and thermal load the battery frame will be subjected to impact loads and thermal loads during navigation and launching the stress and temperature distribution of battery frame structure before topology optimization are shown in fig 14 according to practical application that the quality of battery rack is reduced by forty percent at least and combined with the calculation and analysis of section 4 1 and 4 2 topology optimization ratio f 0 4 is selected for the further topology optimization of the battery rack in an auv for varying scaling factors w for the battery frame structure the temperature distribution and the stress distribution are shown in fig 15 according to the comparison of figs 14 and 15 the structure of the battery rack is gradually stabilized with increasing w under f 0 4 when w is less than 0 6 the battery rack structure changes more obviously when w is greater than or equal to 0 6 the battery rack structure remains basically unchanged when w 1 or w 0 the multi objective topology optimization is transformed into a single objective problem where the temperature and stress affect the battery rack structure separately by comparing fig 9 e with fig 15 a and fig 12 d with fig 15 r the correctness and validity of the thermodynamic coupling topology optimization model is verified in the application 5 conclusion in this paper using theoretical analysis combined with a realistic situation we establish the thermodynamic coupled topology optimization model the model is then applied to the design and

stress distribution based on theoretical knowledge we established a topology optimization model for a coupled thermal load and force load ii underwater vehicles produce substantial heat during the

to ensure the normal operation of the battery pack the established topology optimization model of the coupled thermal load and force load is adopted to design the battery rack in an auv optimization results under different proportions of force load and thermal load are obtained under the same topology optimization ratio therefore the coupled thermo mechanical model is proved to be correct

mathematical model is verified index items topology optimization battery rack multi objective auv 1 introduction the ocean is a treasure trove of resources that have not been fully exploited fully utilizing marine resources has a special significance because of the lack of per capita resources of our country autonomous underwater vehicles auvs represent an effective tool for the development and use of the ocean they have become increasingly widely used in the fields of scientific research military industry etc increasingly more countries have adopted electric propulsion systems because electric propulsion systems benefit from their simple structure and they are not affected by back pressure numerous high energy battery groups configured in series or parallel are required to meet auv power demands for example high specific energy and high specific power lithium batteries have been widely used in auvs however the auv compact battery compartment is a closed and compact space and the method of thermal equilibrium has many limitations therefore there exists a series of security problems for the application of lithium battery packs in lithium powered underwater vehicles on the one hand the battery rack is strongly impacted by the large load in the process of vehicle emission which can destroy the battery rack structure and affect the energy supply of the whole system such that the system cannot operate normally on the other hand for underwater vehicles powered by a large number of lithium batteries the underwater vehicle navigation process generates substantial heat and causes local temperature differences in the battery compartment which affect the normal performance of the battery groups researchers have only considered the structure of the battery frame for

analysis of the battery rack in an auv our conclusions are as follows i based on the topology optimization models of the force load and the thermal load and combining models of heat transfer and stress distribution based on theoretical knowledge we established a topology optimization model for a coupled thermal load and force load ii underwater vehicles produce substantial heat during the navigation process and the battery rack experiences a greater impact load thus the battery rack structure has to not only withstand the force load but also attempt to reduce the temperature gradient to ensure the normal operation of the battery pack the established topology optimization model of the coupled thermal load and force load is adopted to design the battery rack in an auv optimization results under different proportions of force load and thermal load are obtained under the same topology optimization ratio therefore the coupled thermo mechanical model is proved to be correct

23702,in this paper a comprehensive study on the parametric and auto parametric instability of taut moorings due to combined hydrodynamic and ice loads is conducted in this regard a modal analysis is performed that includes the geometric nonlinearity of the mooring cables along with the combined effect of hydrodynamic and ice loads the stability of the mooring cable around the 2 1 internal resonance region is analysed in the presence of out of plane ice load which is calculated using a semi empirical ice load penetration evolution it is shown that the geometric nonlinearity along with coupled hydrody namic and ice loads play an important role in the modal interaction which may lead to the large amplitude vibrations i e instability stability boundaries near the 2 1 resonance region are determined through simulations by observing the onset of the oscillation in the out of plane modes beyond this boundary the instability or jump in the response may occur and this could lead to the fatigue failure of the mooring cables a parametric study on the stability boundary based on varying cable pretension and fairlead slope is also conducted this reveals that increasing the cable pretension and the fairlead slope can effectively mitigate the parametric and auto parametric instability in out of plane modes of mooring cables keywords parametric instability moorings ice load resonance stability boundary 1 introduction station keeping system for arctic floaters such as mooring cable requires an innovative engineering design coupled with a detailed investigation on its resistance against the impact loading the ice induced vibration together with the wave and current actions imposes a strong demand on the mooring cable design it is well known that the structures supported by flexible cables such as cable stayed bridges mooring systems etc are often prone to large amplitude vibrations due to large flexibility and complex loadinuations frg sitom surrounding medium nayfeh and pai 2004 these large amplitude vibrations of long flexible cables are often attributed to the internal resonance phenomena the geometrical and or mechanical control parameters under certain excitation frequency enhance modal coupling even in the absence of external excitation rega 2004 theoretically considering the geometric nonlinearity gives a different combination of quadratic and cubic nonlinearities which explains various types of planar and non planar internal resonance phenomena of suspended cables gonzalez buelga et al 2008 srinil et al srinil et al 2007 srinil and rega 2007 in a series of articles on planar 2 1 resonant multi modal analysis of horizontal inclined cables reported that the quadratic and cubic nonlinearities of system are resonantly coupled with the amplitudes frequencies dynamic configurations and the velocities associated with the resonant nonlinear normal modes gonzalez buelga et al 2008 demonstrated that the nonlinear coupling between the in plane and out of plane motions influences the parametric and auto parametric excitation of the inclined cables it is also reported that the out of plane response of an inclined cable may become unstable when the in plane excitation frequency is close to the second natural frequency macdonald et al macdonald et al 2010 extended this theory and generalized it for any natural frequency a comprehensive study of the parametric and auto parametric cable dynamics can be found in wagg and neild wagg and nield 2009 it should be noted that in most of these analyses the effect of the surrounding medium is neglected coupled fluid structure interaction effect due the hydrodynamic force chakrabarti 1987 on the cable due to the drag and inertia can lead to more complex dynamic behaviour cables used in mooring systems are often exposed to strong hydrodynamic forces which can lead to much more complex planar and non planar internal resonance phenomena of suspended cables iyengar and rao 1988 mooring system of arctic floaters involving long flexible cable may experience a multiple internal resonance due to combined hydrodynamic and ice forces however the standard mathematical models in commercial software which are often used in the design of station keeping systems with moorings do not even consider the higher order terms in strain formulation geometric nonlinearity and thereby generally ignores the internal resonance phenomena in literature a few theoretical studies howell and triantafyllou 1993 zhu et al 1999 can be found that deal with the stability of coupled floater mooring systems and it was reported that the floater exhibits a chaotic motion due to cable snapping however these studies were also limited to linear cable dynamics gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 proposed a mathematical model for the underwater cable that can deal with both geometric and material nonlinearities however it is worth mentioning that a model to analyse various planar non planar e g 2 1 3 1 internal resonance phenomena due to the inherent combination of system quadratic and cubic nonlinearities in the case of submerged cables is lacking a typical example where such phenomena may trigger is the level ice loads encountered by the floaters in the arctic such floaters are typically equipped with disconnection or reconnection mechanism for mooring system to avoid larger ice features such as iceberg and multi year ridge ice however the station keeping system still needs to withstand strong and harsh loading situations originating from its interaction with single year level ice which generates forces due to the breaking sliding rotation of ice floe against the floater therefore the present manuscript delves deeper into the dynamics of submerged cables focusing on the 2 1 internal resonance phenomena in the presence of combined hydrodynamic and ice loads estimating ice load on a floating structure is difficult due to the uncertainty associated with a broad range and variety of ice features and constitutive properties there has been a lot of effort to predict the ice load both experimentally and theoretically however most of the theories utilized in predicting the ice load are primarily based on fixed offshore structures such as jack up rig gravity based concrete platform and bridge piers iso 19906 2010 it is well known that the impact of ice load on a floater mooring system is fundamentally different from the fixed structure due to the flexibility exerted by the mooring system lu et al 2014 2015 aksnes 2010 2011 studied ice load on an arctic floater from a level ice field assuming three distinct phases i e breaking rotation and sliding typically in an arctic floater downward breaking slope at the ice level is preferred since this assists in the ice breaking under flexure lohne 2012 typically the bending strength 0 5 mpa of ice is much smaller in comparison to the ice crushing strength 2 0 mpa thus reducing the global ice load as well as the potential of ice induced vibration triggered by ice crushing the breaking of level ice when in contact with the downward breaking slope occurs within a very short period just as the tensile stress at the top of the level ice exceeds the fairly small tensile strength of the ice next follows a rotation phase of the broken ice pieces subsequently the broken ice floe slides along the slope of the floater and a new cycle of ice breaking rotating sliding begins numerical modelling of level ice field is usually done by assuming it to be an infinite thin plate supported on a winkler type elastic foundation nevel 1958 1961 details of this method can be found in kerr 1976 squire et al 1976 and literature cited therein even though this method is widely used for ice loading prediction modelling of complex ice fracture such as breaking crack propagation broken ice field and rubble formation requires additional treatment which are empirical and or ad hoc formalism to model the breaking of ice subsequent crack propagation and rubble formation several numerical methods like discrete element method dem smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph are used see e g ji et al 2013 das and ehlers 2015 however the results from these methods are often not verified due to the lack of data for comparison and uncertainty involved in the phenomena ji et al 2013 furthermore the extreme uncertainties associated with the ice properties and ice structure interaction mechanisms result in significant scatters in the predicted ice load values using different numerical tools as a result many studies apply the two dimensional beam on an elastic foundation based theories to analyse the failure of an ice sheet interacting with a sloping structure e g lu et al 2014 croasdale and cammaert 1994 subsequent studies employ the solution to calculate the ice breaking loads for various types of sloping structures kotras et al 1983 lubbad and loset 2011 in this work the elastic foundation theory by croasdale croasdale and cammaert 1994 is implemented in a commercial hydrodynamics and mooring analysis package to estimate the ice load on floating platform in the present study an attempt is made to investigate the stability of a cable in a situation involving coupled hydrodynamic and ice loads a unidirectional periodic loading is considered and thereby the floater will have two translational motions i e surge and heave the floater motions will cause a support excitation at the pinned connection between the floater and mooring this phenomenon is modelled as a base excitation at the top support point of the mooring cable an analytical model based on modal analysis of underwater submerged cable considering its geometric nonlinearity is presented introducing the geometric nonlinearity into the model enables coupling between the different modes which is not included in the standard linear analysis of integrated mooring system the support excitation frequency is chosen to be close to the cable s natural frequency of the second in plane mode therefore the in plane mode is excited directly ice load is applied at the fairlead from an out of plane direction as a pulse load hence the out of plane mode is excited parametrically it is observed that the out of plane mode responses show instability under certain base excitation amplitude i e the responses due to the pulse load from the ice impact never decay the instability in the responses arises from the interaction between the different modes i e auto parametric excitation which cannot be captured by the linear analysis this phenomenon may lead to the fatigue failure of the mooring cables numerous simulations are carried out to determine the stability boundary of different out of plane modes for various amplitudes and excitation frequencies the stability boundaries are also determined using the harmonic balance method to verify the results obtained from the modal analysis the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the particulars of the problem are addressed and a method to calculate the ice impact load along with the cable model is presented detailed mathematical formulation for modal analysis of a taut cable is also presented in the same section section 3 contains a comparison of the proposed model with experiments for validation in section 4 the key results obtained from stability analysis of taut mooring cable subjected to coupled hydrodynamic and ice loads are presented finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 problem description and methodology in this study the stability of a mooring cable is analysed in the presence of a unidirectional periodic load and out of plane ice load the floater motion will cause a significant movement at the fairlead connection this is mathematically modelled as a base excitation in the present study to keep the formulation simple a unidirectional wave is assumed and therefore the floater will oscillate in the x z plane it is assumed that the connection point between the floater and mooring will experience the same displacement and acceleration as that of the floater for simplicity of the model this base excitation at the top connection point of the mooring is assumed as a sinusoidal displacement time history it should be noted that the base excitation frequency is assumed to be close to the second natural frequency of the mooring cables it is also assumed that the bottom point of the mooring is pinned to the seabed and the top point is pinned to the floater the primary focus is to investigate the stability of the out of plane modes near the 2 1 resonance region in the presence of out of plane ice load ice load on the mooring fairlead is estimated using a developed ice load formulation for floating structures and implemented in a commercial package harp offshore dynamics inc hu using this formulation an estimation of fairlead acceleration time history is obtained for ice load the mooring which experiences the maximum load is studied for the stability in this work fig 1 depicts a schematic diagram of the problem illustrating wave and ice loading over a generic floater methodology to predict the out of plane ice load is presented in the next subsection here it should be mentioned that in the present study mooring system is considered to be very steep but the method would also work in less steep moorings less water depth or longer mooring lines 2 1 estimation of ice load in this study an idealized load versus penetration evolution is utilized to estimate the load on floating structure using penetration as the only governing parameter fig 2 illustrates the ice load formulation implemented in a commercially available coupled floater and mooring systems analysis software harp it is assumed that the ice field is made up of managed ice and the size of ice floes are large enough to exert the assumed load hence ice structure interaction can be estimated as a combination of three distinct phases viz breaking phase flexural failure of ice rotation phase and sliding phase of the managed ice the peak ice load from first first year level ice can be estimated using the formulation based on 2d beam bending on an elastic foundation derived by croasdale and cammaert 1994 the ice load in the horizontal direction f h on an arctic floater with downward breaking slope is given as timco and cornet 1997 1 f h c 3 d σ f ρ w g h 5 e 0 25 1 π 2 l 4 d c 4 t s h d ρ w ρ i g where c 3 0 68 ξ 3 ξ 4 c 4 ξ 3 ξ 3 ξ 4 cot α ξ 3 μ cos α sin α and ξ 4 μ sin α cos α here in eq 1 μ is the coefficient of friction h is thickness of the first year level ice t s is the depth of ice rubble and generally assumed to be equal to the draught of the cone section the slope angle α is taken as negative for downward sloping cones and it is measured from the same horizontal plane the relation between the vertical and horizontal force is given by croasdale and cammaert 1994 as 2 f h f v μ cos α sin α μ sin α cos α f v ξ a loss of contact between the ice and the floating structure is assumed and this is indicated by the load drop right before the breaking phase begins as shown in fig 2 in this formulation it is assumed that ice load evolves with the extent of ice penetration ice penetration is defined as the relative displacement between the drifting level ice and the floating structure hence the drift velocity v i c e of level ice field does not influence peak ice load but it has a significant effect on the ice load evolution the load during the rotation phase f l and breaking f t depends on both vessel and ice properties based on the model tests by aksnes 2011 the current manuscript assumes the load during the rotation phase f l and breaking f t to be 15 and 10 of the peak load respectively the duration of each loading phase is assumed to be constant throughout the simulation this duration multiplied by the ice drift velocity v i c e gives the ice penetration associated with each loading phase as indicated in fig 2 the sum of ice penetration during rotation sliding phase δ d and the load drop phase δ r is equal to the ice breaking length according to model tests reported by aksnes 2011 the ice breaking length ranges between 5 and 7 times its thickness h whereas the duration of the ice breaking phase depicted in fig 2 as the sum of δ p and δ f is assumed to be 6 s coupled floater mooring analysis is performed using hull and riser mooring program harp in which the ice load floater penetration algorithm is implemented as user subroutine harp provides the ice load algorithm with the displacement velocity and acceleration at the reference point of the floater centre of water plane in each time step the subroutine then derives the body force for the next time step corresponding to the penetration replaced by relative displacement for a floater and supplies it to the coupled analysis program in the next step the combined analysis program calculates the floater motion using the applied force the coupled analysis continues to run in this manner for the total duration of the analysis fig 3 presents the proposed algorithm as a coupled iterative cycle 2 2 modelling of cable dynamics a brief description of the cable dynamics equations is presented in this section consider a simply supported inclined cable of length l with end points at a and b as shown in fig 1 the line joining a and b i e the chord line of the cable is assumed to be the x axis of the coordinate system it is assumed that this chord line and the equilibrium position of the sagged cable due to the gravity are in the x z plane therefore the motion of the cable in the x z plane is referred to as the in plane motion and in the direction perpendicular to the x z plane i e the y direction is referred to as the out of plane motion the angle of inclination of the cable θ is defined by the angle made by the chord line with the horizontal the deflections of the cable in x y and z directions are represented as u v and w respectively the static deflections of the cable in x y and z directions due to the sag are given as 3 u s 0 v s 0 and w s ρ g a cos θ t s x l x 2 x 2 2 respectively here t s x is the tension in cable due to sag ρ is the density of the cable material g is the acceleration due to gravity a is the cross sectional area of the cable it should be noted that the suffix s represents the quantities referred to the static equilibrium state 2 2 1 equation of motion governing differential equations of the cable vibrations are given as wagg and nield 2009 warnitchai et al 1995 in plane 4 t d x 2 w s x 2 t s x t d x 2 w d x 2 f z a ρ a 2 w d t 2 out of plane 5 t s x t d x 2 v d x 2 f y a ρ a 2 v d t 2 here t d x is the dynamic tension the suffix d represents the quantities of the dynamic state and f y and f z represent the force per unit area in the y and z directions respectively in this study it is assumed that the constitutive property of the cable is linear elastic therefore the dynamic tension t d x can be written in terms of the dynamic strain ε d as 6 t d x a e ε d where e is the young s modulus the dynamic strain ε d can be expressed using the finite strain theory as 7 ε d u d x 1 2 v d x 2 1 2 w d x 2 d w s d x w d x to derive a general formulation for the cable with support motion the boundary condition at the top at x 0 is considered as u 0 t u a t v 0 t v a t and w 0 t w a t and at the bottom at x l is taken as u l t u b t v l t v b t and w l t w b t 2 2 2 quasi static analysis for support motion here it should be noted that the boundary conditions are time varying and therefore the cable responses can be separated into two components viz the quasi static and the modal components quasi static component satisfies the time varying boundary condition whereas the modal component satisfies the static simply supported boundary condition therefore splitting the dynamic components into quasi static and modal components yields 8 u d u q u m v d v q v m and w d w q w m subsequently the strain in the cable can be written by substituting eq 8 into eq 7 as 9 ε d u q x d w s d x w q x w m x 1 2 v m x 2 1 2 w q x 2 2 d w q d x w m x w m x 2 since the support excitation is considered only in the x z plane the quasi static component of the displacement in the out of plane direction turns out to be zero subsequently the displacement field due to the base excitation at the top support of the cable can be obtained as see wagg and nield 2009 warnitchai et al 1995 for the detailed derivation 10 u q u a e q e u b u a x l λ 2 4 e q e u b u a x l 2 x l 2 4 3 x l 3 1 2 w b w a γ a l t s x x l x l 2 v q v a v b v a x l w q w a w b w a x l γ e q a 2 l 2 t s x 2 u b u a x l x

that the axial modal motion is small compared to the vertical and or out of plane modal motions and thus it is neglected i e u m 0 modal displacement should satisfy the simply supported boundary condition at both ends of the cable i e u 0 t 0 v 0 t 0 w 0 t 0 u l t 0 v l t 0 and w l t 0 modal components of the displacement response can be written as 13 u m x t 0 v m x t n 1 ϕ n x y n t w m x t n 1 ψ n x z n t where the expression for the mode shapes is given as ϕ n x sin n π x l for n 1 2 3 14 ψ n x sin n π x l for n 1 2 3 in this context it should be mentioned that the assumed mode shapes are determined by satisfying the simply supported boundary condition here it is important to note that odd in plane modes are approximated using a sinusoidal expression this may incur some error in the odd in plane modes however in the present paper only one even mode is considered and this assumption has no influence on the results presented next the standard galerkin method is applied to convert the governing partial differential equations of cables into a set of non linear ordinary differential equations using the variational technique see wagg and nield 2009 warnitchai et al 1995 for the detailed derivation by multiplying eq 4 by ϕ n substituting eqs 9 10 and 13 and then integrating the equation over the length finally gives the out of plane modal motions as 15 m y n y n 2 ξ y n y n ω y n 2 y n k v n k y n y k 2 z k 2 k 2 β n k y n z k 2 η n u b u a y n ζ n v a 1 n 1 v b f y n similarly the in plane cable motion can be obtained by multiplying eq 5 by ψ n substituting eqs 9 10 and 13 and then integrating the equation over the length as 16 m z n z n 2 ξ z n z n ω z n 2 z n k v n k y n y k 2 z k 2 k 2 β n k z n z k k β n k y k 2 z k 2 2 η n u b u a z n ζ n w a 1 n 1 w b α n u b u a f z n here in eqs 15 and 16 n represents the n th mode therefore the generalized displacements of the cable in the n th out of plane and in plane modes are symbolized as y n and z n the quantities m y n and m z n are the modal masses and taken as m y n m z n 1 2 ρ a l where ρ is the density of the cable material the terms v n k β n k ζ n α n η n and k n are as follows 17 v n k e a π

natural frequencies are given respectively as 18 ω y n n π l σ s ρ and ω z n n π l σ s ρ 1 k n the modal components of the external in plane f y n and out of plane forces f z n acting on the cable respectively are given by 19 f y n 0 l f y ϕ n d x f z n 0 l f z ψ n d x 2 2 4 modal analysis of underwater taut cable in this section a modal based procedure for the underwater cable is presented the cable model presented above does not consider the drag and inertia added mass forces due to the fluid structure interaction in the present paper the effects of these forces are included in the modal analysis assuming that the characteristic structural dimension of the mooring cable is smaller than the water wavelength the wave forces are formulated using the modified morison equation relative velocity model which is composed of two components the inertia and drag forces the hydrodynamic force per unit length of the cable is given as 20 f i c m a i v i w c a a i u i c d a d v i w v i w c d a d u i u i where a i ρ w a and a d 1 2 ρ w d c m c a and c d c d are the inertia added mass and drag coefficients v i w and v i w are the instantaneous local water particle velocity and acceleration u i and u i are the velocity and acceleration of the cable respectively ρ w is the water density d is the diameter of the cable the suffix i symbolises the force component in the vector direction the modal component of the morison forces can be obtained using the relation given in eq 19 in which the force terms f y and f z are the vector components of the morison force in the y and z directions therefore the modal component of the morison force in the out of plane direction can be obtained as 21 f y n 0 l c a a i k 1 ϕ k y k ϕ n d x 0 l c d a d k 1 ϕ k y k k 1 ϕ k y k ϕ n d x here it should be noted that in eq 20 the fluid particle velocity v i w and acceleration v i w in the out of plane direction turns out to be zero since a unidirectional wave is assumed therefore eq 21 can be further simplified as 22 f y n c a a i l 2 y n c d a d l cos π n 1 2 cos π n 2 3 π n y n y n the relationships used in the simplification of eq 21 are as follows 23 0 l ϕ n ϕ k d x 0 n k l 2 n k 0 l ϕ n 2 ϕ k d x 0 n k l cos π n 1 2 cos π n 2 3 π n n k 0 l ϕ n d x l n π 1 1 n 1 similarly the in plane modal component of the morison force can be obtained as 24 f y n 0 l c m a i v y w ψ n d x 0 l c a a i k 1 ψ n y k ψ n d x 0 l c d a d v y w v y w ψ n d x 0 l c d a d k 1 ψ n y k k 1 ψ n y k ψ n d x assuming the fluid particle velocity to be constant around the cable for simplicity eq 24 reduces to 25 f z n c m a i l n π 1 1 n 1 v z w c a a i l n π 1 1 n 1 z n c d a d l cos π n 1 2 cos π n 2 3 π n v z w v z w c d a d l cos π n 1 2 cos π n 2 3 π n z n z n it is to be noted that for the simplification of eq 24 the expressions of eq 23 are used since the same mode shapes are assumed for both in plane and out of plane motions as mentioned earlier the prime focus of this study is to investigate 2 1 internal resonance phenomenon between the modes this occurs when the excitation frequency is twice and or close to twice the first out of plane natural frequency of the mooring cable it is experimentally observed that the first in plane mode is sufficiently separated in frequency from the first out of plane mode and will not excite for the frequency ranges considered in investigating the 2 1 internal resonance it is assumed that the contribution from the other modes is negligible for the frequency ranges considered therefore in the present study only the second in plane mode and first two out of plane modes are considered in the present analysis a unidirectional wave is considered whereby the floater will have the surge and heave motions and this will eventually excite the cable through the vertical and horizontal support motions the surge and heave motions of the floater directly excite the cable through the connection between the floater and mooring therefore the support motions due to the surge and heave can be represented by temporally varying the displacement field u a t and w a t respectively the ice load due to the impact is also considered through the base excitation the displacement field is represented by v a t the boundary condition at the cable upper support at x 0 will be u 0 t u a t v 0 t v a t and w 0 t w a t lower support of the cable is assumed to be pinned to the sea bed at x l boundary condition are u l t 0 v l t 0 and w l t 0 it is assumed that the amplitude δ and the frequency ω of the surge and heave motions during the steady state response are the same therefore in eqs 15 and 16 the end condition can be substituted as u a δ and w a δ where δ δcos ω t in the present study it is assumed that the ice floe imparts a sudden acceleration to the fairlead from the out of plane direction this phenomenon is modelled by the term ζ n v a of eq 15 where v a is assumed to have a time history profile with a rectangular pulse of very small duration the modal frequencies of the out of plane and second in plane modes are related as ω z 2 ω y 2 2 ω y 1 now denoting ω z 2 ω y 2 ω 2 and ω y 1 ω 1 the modal equation of motion for the second in plane and first two out of plane modes can be written using eqs 15 and 16 as 26 y 1 2 ξ y 1 ω 1 y 1 ω 1 2 y 1 w 11 y 1 3 w 12 y 1 y 2 2 z 2 2 n 1 δ y 1 c a r y 1 c d r y 1 y 1 27 y 2 2 ξ

are as follows 29 w n k v n k m n n 2 η n m b 2 ζ n m c a r c a a i l 2 m c d r c d a d 4 l 3 π m in the present study eqs 26 28 are solved numerically to obtain the modal response of the cable these equations are also investigated via scaling and averaging technique the objective of this numerical and theoretical investigations is to obtain the stability boundaries in terms of the frequency amplitude response curve 2 2 5 simulation in order to solve these simultaneous ordinary differential equations newmark s time integration scheme is adopted using this method eqs 26 28 at time any given time t j 1 can be written as 30 m x j 1 c x j 1 k x t x j 1 f j 1 here in eq 30 mass matrix m is the coefficient of the vector x y 1 y 2 z 2 damping matrix is the coefficients of the linear damping vector x y 1 y 2 z 2 nonlinear stiffness k x t is the coefficients of the vector x y 1 y 2 z 2 f is the force vector constructed by the terms from the morison force and base excitation at each time increment δ t j t j 1 t j the incremental elastic force can be written as 31 k x t x j 1 k x t x j k t δ x j where k t is the tangent stiffness at x j substituting eq 31 into eq 30 gives 32 m x j 1 c x j 1 k t δ x j f j 1 k x t x j the error introduced due to the replacement of secant stiffness matrix by the tangent stiffness matrix is reduced through iterations at each time step tolerance is kept as below 0 1 2 2 6 scaling and averaging the set of ordinary differential equations eqs 26 28 is also examined via scaling and averaging technique the objective of this analysis is to determine the modal amplitudes of directly excited modes and stability of other modes to this end these equations are scaled in the standard lagrange form given as 33 x i j ω 1 2 x i j ε x i o ε 2 where ε is a small parameter in eq 33 time scale τ is introduced and it is transformed using the relationship τ 1 μ t the symbols and represent the first and second order derivatives with respect to τ respectively here a new representation of the variables is introduced y 1 y 2 z 2 x 11 x 22 x 32 where second subscript in x i j represents whether the variable is related to the first or second mode it is assumed that the base excitation frequency ω is close to the natural frequency of the second mode so frequency of the base excitation can be written in the form ω 2 ω 1 1 μ neglecting the higher order terms

and x i j s are treated as constant during the integration and the subscript a represents their average value 2 2 7 stability boundaries in the present study the in plane motion is directly excited due to the wave induced base excitation the increase in the amplitude of the base excitation can excite either of the two out of plane modes in frequency amplitude parameter space this marks as the boundary of the semi trivial solution therefore the localized stability of each out of plane mode is analysed about zero response to trace the boundary of the semi trivial solution in frequency amplitude parameter space assuming that the other out of plane mode has zero amplitude now for each mode eqs 39 and 40 can be written in the form 45 x i j c a x i j s a ε a s x i j c a x i j s a here in eq 45 the matrix a s contains the coefficients of x i j c a and x i j s a in the matrix a s the amplitudes of the second out of plane are considered to be zero and also the higher order terms are neglected now the eigenvalues of matrix a s are determined to trace the stability boundary for a small excitation amplitude the eigenvalues have negative real parts with the increase in excitation amplitude the real part of one of the eigenvalues turns out to be zero this gives the stability boundary of the first out of plane mode as the roots of the following equations 46 w 12 2 z 2 a 4 8 w 12 μ ω 1 2 z 2 a 2 16 ω 1 4 μ 2 ξ y 2 2 c a 2 4 n 1 2 δ 2 4 ω 1 2 n 1 δ c a 0 similarly it can be obtained for the second out of plane mode as 47 3 w 12 2 12 c a w 12 ω 1 2 z 2 a 4 32 w 12 μ ω 1 2 4 c a

observation of gonzalez buelga et al 2008 in this model test a cable of length 1 98 m was used with an angle of inclination 20 0 the static tension of the cable was 205 n cable diameter was 0 8 mm with a mass of 0 67 kg m the young s modulus was taken as same that of steel i e 200 gpa a disturbance in the form of a 0 02 s 0 1 mm s amplitude pulse is applied to the two out of plane modes and the stability of modes is assessed the stability boundary for the first out of plane mode is estimated by solving the modal equation of motions considering the two out of plane and one in plane modes from eqs 15 16 and 20 for the morison force for various values of the base excitation amplitude and frequency in this context it should be noted also that the model test was carried out in the air and the morison forces due to air drag and inertia are included in the model the density of air was chosen to be 1 225 kg m3 drag and inertia coefficients are considered as 1 0 and 2 2 respectively excitation amplitude is gradually increased keeping the same excitation frequency to find a point at which slight increase or decrease in the amplitude causes growth in the first out of plane mode it is important to note that the base excitation is provided at the lower support of the cable in the experiments therefore in the simulation it is replicated using the end conditions u a 0 w a 0 u b δ and w b δ where δ δcos ω t the out of plane pulse load is provided by the term ζ n v b of eq 15 in fig 4 the stability boundary obtained from numerical simulation is compared with the experimental results of gonzalez buelga et al 2008 it is observed that the difference in the results between the numerical predictions and experimental measurements is less than 2 therefore it can be concluded that the stability points predicted from the simulation show good agreement with the experimental measurements the deviation in the results can be attributed to the fact that a cable with uniform density is used in the numerical simulations whereas to attain the intended mass of the cable lead weights were attached at 60 mm interval in experimental analysis in fig 4 the stability boundary obtained by neglecting the hydrodynamic forces are also plotted for comparison it can be observed that the inclusion hydrodynamic forces cause a reduction in the amplitude required for cable to become unstable for a particular frequency the maximum difference in amplitude required for the instability of cable can reduce up to 20 if the drag and inertia effects are considered in a mooring system design the hydrodynamic effects will be even more since the water being a denser material will have a large influence on the drag and inertia forces however these effects were neglected in the earlier study on parametric and auto parametric instability of cables as well as in the mooring system design in the next section a comprehensive study on the parametric and auto parametric instability of taut mooring cables in the presence of coupled hydrodynamic and ice load is presented 4 results and discussion in the present study a modal instability analysis of the mooring system of an arctic floater with a downward slope is performed the study assumes a complex loading situation the wave load from the in plane direction and ice load from the out of plane direction the wave load on the fairlead is assumed as a harmonic excitation whereas the ice load on the floater is assumed as a pulse load the prediction of the pulse load function is done through a numerical simulation presented is section 2 1 with this loading scenario a series of simulations is carried out to investigate the effect of geometric nonlinearity in the stability of mooring cable under the out of plane pulse load from the ice floe the effect of the morison forces for the modal instability of cable is also investigated 4 1 ice load acceleration ice load time history on the floater is determined by employing the coupled ice floater interaction program which comprises of a commercially available coupled floater and mooring system analysis software harp and a user defined function for the ice load at each time step based on both ice and floater movement a floater with circular hull and radially symmetric mooring system with 12 taut cables is utilized for the analysis table 1 lists the hydrodynamic and mooring parameters of the floater fig 5 displays the panel model of the floater and mooring system simulations are carried out by varying ice thickness h 1 m 1 5 m and 3 m and drift velocity v i c e 0 01 m s and 0 05 m s keeping all the other parameters constant in fig 6 the ice load time history on the floater from each of the simulation is presented it can be clearly seen from fig 6 that the peak load primarily depends on the ice thickness whereas drift velocity influences the number of ice events it can be observed that if the drift velocity is increased keeping the ice thickness constant e g fig 6a and d the number of ice breaking events reduces this can be attributed to those situations when the drift velocity of ice becomes less than the velocity of the floater now the stability analysis of the mooring which experiences the maximum load is performed using the ice load case presented in fig 6 this load is utilized as the source of out of plane pulse load for the mooring instability analysis the out of plane pulse load is provided to the fairlead through an out of plane acceleration the out of plane acceleration on the floater is estimated from the acceleration time history obtained from harp simulation the peak pulse acceleration a floater experienced by the floater for the load case as presented in fig 6a turns out to be 0 02 m s2 and in all the calculations this pulse acceleration at the fairlead is utilized here it should be noted that sudden acceleration of the floater and fairlead are assumed to be the same i e a floater a fairlead in this study an initial delay of 200 s is prescribed before the first ice feature comes in contact with the floater this delay ensures the realistic stable condition of the floater under wave loading the overall influence of the stable ice load portion on the mooring instability is not significant thus this value is neglected and assumed to be zero to particularly identify the instability characteristics the implication of just one ice breaking event is investigated i e one transient load event to research its influence on the instability effectively building on the explanation in section 2 1 behind the potential of orthogonal ice load an independent ice floe is considered this allows to employ a transient ice load function with a single peak as shown in fig 6a to interact with the floater from an orthogonal direction to the wave 4 2 linear versus nonlinear cable dynamics in this study a comparison between linear and non linear cable dynamics is presented in this regard eqs 26 28 are solved numerically using newmark s method in the linearized version of the cable dynamics equation the terms associated with the geometric nonlinearity terms involving w 11 w 12 w 21 and w 22 are ignored therefore the cable is excited directly through the term b δ in the in plane mode and parametric terms terms involving n 1 n 2 due to the wave induced motion of the floater here it should be noted that in both linear and nonlinear analysis the terms due to morison forces are included during simulation in figs 7 and 8 the modal responses for the same loading condition is presented considering the linear and nonlinear cable dynamics base excitation amplitude frequency and acceleration in the floater due to the ice load are kept same for both cases it can be clearly seen from fig 7a that the response of the first out of plane mode due to the pulse ice load on the floater gradually decays in the linear analysis however in the nonlinear analysis it continuously oscillates and never decays as shown in fig 8a a growth in modal response also can be observed in the second out of plane mode from fig 8b a few harmonics of the response are shown in the inset of fig 8a and b which clearly depicts the growth in the response after the application of the ice load the simulations with the geometric nonlinearity include cubic stiffness terms and also modal coordinates are multiplied with one another this can excite the other responses through the modal coupling which is ignored in the linear analysis 4 3 effect of morison forces nonlinear cable dynamics simulations are also carried out to investigate the effect of the morison forces which are introduced in the modal analysis of the underwater cable in fig 9 the modal response of the cable is plotted without considering the effect of the morison forces keeping all the other parameters same it can be observed that the modal responses do not display an instability in the out of plane modes i e growth in the response however this is in contrast to the responses plotted in fig 8 in which the morison forces are considered along with the geometric nonlinearity this can be attributed to the nonlinear force due to the added mass contains acceleration of the surrounding fluid and drag contains terms which are square of velocity leading to the modal instability of the cable therefore it is important to obtain the stability boundaries i e frequency amplitude response curves for the designers utility 4 4 stability boundaries stability boundaries are determined both theoretically and numerically in order to obtain the stability boundary of the first out of plane mode eqs 46 and 48 are solved together for various values of the base excitation frequency similarly eqs 47 and 48 are solved together to obtain the stability boundary of the second out of plane mode stability of the out of plane modes is also tested numerically by solving eqs 26 28 for various values of the base excitation amplitude and frequency for a particular value of excitation frequency the excitation amplitude is gradually increased to find the instability in the out of plane modes fig 10 a features frequency amplitude response parenting to the stability boundary of first out of plane mode a similar method of determining the stability boundaries presented in the model validation section is used in this case as well to identify the stability boundary for a particular excitation frequency the amplitude of base excitation due to wave load is varied keeping all the other parameters constant here it should be noted that even though wave load is varied ice load i e fairlead excitation is kept constant at the boundary for a particular frequency a slight increase amplitude makes the modal response from stable to unstable it should be noted also that the point of inflection in the stability curve is shifted due to the inclusion of morison forces see ref gonzalez buelga et al 2008 inflection point of the stability curve is near ω ω 2 1 this is due to the inclusion of the added mass term of the morison equation which changes the natural frequency of the coupled system it is also observed that the first out of plane roots obtained solving eqs 46 and 48 oscillate from one solution value to another this can be attributed to the neglecting of higher order terms in scaling average schemes because of which this scheme is unable to produce actual frequency amplitude response curve for system involving strong nonlinearity in fig 10b the stability region for the second out of plane mode obtained from both theoretical solution and simulation is depicted the stability boundaries by the numerical simulation are identified as the point at which a slight increase or decrease in the amplitude causes an instability in fig 10b markers indicate stable response whereas markers indicate unstable a significant difference in results between the simulation and scaling averaging method can be observed for ω ω 2 1 this difference is due to the fact that the lower stability boundary does not represent zero initial condition used in the simulation also neglecting the higher order terms in scaling average schemes can be a source of this difference as discussed earlier a similar shift in the inflection point of the stability curve can be observed in the second out of plane mode as well in fig 11 the response of the second in plane mode is presented for two different cases i without morison forces and ii with morison forces the response of the second in plane mode is obtained for various values of the excitation amplitude keeping excitation frequency same at ω ω 2 1 by finding the roots of eq 48 it can be observed that the hysteretic region the region marked in fig 6 op for the case without morison force and op m for the case with morison forces where there are two stable solutions for the second in plane mode has increased with the inclusion of morison forces the lower saddle node of the bifurcation p m occurs for a higher magnitude of the excitation amplitude instability in the out of plane modes occurs when the excitation amplitude exceeds beyond the point p m at point p m the amplitude of the second in plane mode jumps to r m i e larger solution curve it can be observed that the jump in the amplitude of the second in plane response becomes larger with the inclusion of morison forces distance between p m and r m is greater than p and r the steady state amplitude of the second in plane response obtained from simulation agrees well with the results obtained from the scaling averaging 4 5 effect of mooring cable pretension and fairlead slope on stability boundaries in fig 12 a and b a parametric study on the stability boundaries is presented by varying mooring cable pretension and fairlead slope respectively simulations are carried out for three values of mooring cable pretension viz 500 kn 1000 kn and 1500 kn keeping all the other parameters constant stability boundary for second out of plane mode is plotted in fig 12a for various values of cable pretension it can be observed that with the increase in the cable pretension the amplitude of base excitation required to cause the instability in cable is more the difference in the required amplitude of base excitation to cause the instability can go up to a maximum of 30 if the cable tension is increased from 500 kn to 1500 kn therefore it can be prescribed that increase in the cable pretension can be used as a potential method to mitigate the parametric and auto parametric instability in morning system in fig 12b another parametric study on the stability boundary is presented by varying the fairlead slope and keeping all the other parameters constant as provided in table 1 here it should be noted that in this study the fairlead slope is varied keeping water depth constant and therefore the cable length is varied it can be clearly seen from fig 12b that with the increase in fairlead slope the amplitude of base excitation required to cause the instability in the mooring cables increases increase in the fairlead slope from 20 to 30 causes a maximum of 30 increase in the amplitude required to produce the instability in mooring cable therefore it can be concluded that the fairlead slope plays a significant role in designing a stable mooring system and can effectively be used to reduce the instability in the mooring system 5 conclusion it can be concluded from the present study that the geometric nonlinearity plays an important role in the modal interaction i e the auto parametric excitation of the cable which may lead to the large vibration and instability in an ice floe field furthermore the coupled hydrodynamic and ice load significantly influences the modal coupling which leads to reduction in the amplitude of base excitation required to cause an instability in cable therefore in the mooring system design for arctic environment it is recommended to consider the effect of coupled hydrodynamic and ice load along with the higher order terms of strain tensor however the present state of the art in the offshore industry tends to ignore this phenomenon the stability boundaries in terms of frequency amplitude response curve for out of plane modes are identified near the 2 1 internal resonance region furthermore the stability boundaries are studied as a function of cable pretension and fairlead slope it is found that the cable pretension and the fairlead slope can be used as potential methods to control the parametric and auto parametric instability in the morning system these findings can aid the industry in the design stage of mooring system wherein the line design variables can be selected judiciously to avoid the internal resonance phenomenon the present study can be extended by considering various other internal resonance phenomena which may occur due to the coupling of different modes one of the extension to the present study can be considered as modelling of the surrounding fluid domain with navier stokes equation which will remove the empirically assigned values of drag and inertia coefficients in the morison equation furthermore a simple semi empirical model for predicting ice load is used in the present study which can be extended by considering more realistic phenomenological model for ice floe considering the breaking crack propagation rotation and rubble formation in reality combined hydrodynamic and ice loads may come from any direction the loading condition chosen in this particular manuscript can be considered as a subset of the complex loading situation that an arctic floater mooring system may encounter and this may eventually lead to more complex dynamic responses such internal resonance phenomena is quite common in real engineering problems which can lead to undesired large amplitude variations into flexible cables in this paper it is shown theoretically that the dynamics of underwater mooring cables are strongly nonlinear which involves internal coupling between modes and parametric coupling with external effects using a simple condition of combined hydrodynamic and ice loads this can eventually lead to instability of underwater cable due to internal resonance phenomena this work can be experimentally investigated further by studying the parametric and autoparametric instability of underwater cable to apply it efficiently in real engineering applications acknowledgment this work done at the keppel nus corporate laboratory was

23702,in this paper a comprehensive study on the parametric and auto parametric instability of taut moorings due to combined hydrodynamic and ice loads is conducted in this regard a modal analysis is performed that includes the geometric nonlinearity of the mooring cables along with the combined effect of hydrodynamic and ice loads the stability of the mooring cable around the 2 1 internal resonance region is analysed in the presence of out of plane ice load which is calculated using a semi empirical ice load penetration evolution it is shown that the geometric nonlinearity along with coupled hydrody namic and ice loads play an important role in the modal interaction which may lead to the large amplitude vibrations i e instability stability boundaries near the 2 1 resonance region are determined through simulations by observing the onset of the oscillation in the out of plane modes beyond this boundary the instability or jump in the response may occur and this could lead to the fatigue failure of the mooring cables a parametric study on the stability boundary based on varying cable pretension and fairlead slope is also conducted this reveals that increasing the cable pretension and the fairlead slope can effectively mitigate the parametric and auto parametric instability in out of plane modes of mooring cables keywords parametric instability moorings ice load resonance stability boundary 1 introduction station keeping system for arctic floaters such as mooring cable requires an innovative engineering design coupled with a detailed investigation on its resistance against the impact loading the ice induced vibration together with the wave and current actions imposes a strong demand on the mooring cable design it is well known that the structures supported by flexible cables such as cable stayed bridges mooring systems etc are often prone to large amplitude vibrations due to large flexibility and complex loadinuations frg sitom surrounding medium nayfeh and pai 2004 these large amplitude vibrations of long flexible cables are often attributed to the internal resonance phenomena the geometrical and or mechanical control parameters under certain excitation frequency enhance modal coupling even in the absence of external excitation rega 2004 theoretically considering the geometric nonlinearity gives a different combination of quadratic and cubic nonlinearities which explains various types of planar and non planar internal resonance phenomena of suspended cables gonzalez buelga et al 2008 srinil et al srinil et al 2007 srinil and rega 2007 in a series of articles on planar 2 1 resonant multi modal analysis of horizontal inclined cables reported that the quadratic and cubic nonlinearities of system are resonantly coupled with the amplitudes frequencies dynamic configurations and the velocities associated with the resonant nonlinear normal modes gonzalez buelga et al 2008 demonstrated that the nonlinear coupling between the in plane and out of plane motions influences the parametric and auto parametric excitation of the inclined cables it is also reported that the out of plane response of an inclined cable may become unstable when the in plane excitation frequency is close to the second natural frequency macdonald et al macdonald et al 2010 extended this theory and generalized it for any natural frequency a comprehensive study of the parametric and auto parametric cable dynamics can be found in wagg and neild wagg and nield 2009 it should be noted that in most of these analyses the effect of the surrounding medium is neglected coupled fluid structure interaction effect due the hydrodynamic force chakrabarti 1987 on the cable due to the drag and inertia can lead to more complex dynamic behaviour cables used in mooring systems are often exposed to strong hydrodynamic forces which can lead to much more complex planar and non planar internal resonance phenomena of suspended cables iyengar and rao 1988 mooring system of arctic floaters involving long flexible cable may experience a multiple internal resonance due to combined hydrodynamic and ice forces however the standard mathematical models in commercial software which are often used in the design of station keeping systems with moorings do not even consider the higher order terms in strain formulation geometric nonlinearity and thereby generally ignores the internal resonance phenomena in literature a few theoretical studies howell and triantafyllou 1993 zhu et al 1999 can be found that deal with the stability of coupled floater mooring systems and it was reported that the floater exhibits a chaotic motion due to cable snapping however these studies were also limited to linear cable dynamics gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 proposed a mathematical model for the underwater cable that can deal with both geometric and material nonlinearities however it is worth mentioning that a model to analyse various planar non planar e g 2 1 3 1 internal resonance phenomena due to the inherent combination of system quadratic and cubic nonlinearities in the case of submerged cables is lacking a typical example where such phenomena may trigger is the level ice loads encountered by the floaters in the arctic such floaters are typically equipped with disconnection or reconnection mechanism for mooring system to avoid larger ice features such as iceberg and multi year ridge ice however the station keeping system still needs to withstand strong and harsh loading situations originating from its interaction with single year level ice which generates forces due to the breaking sliding rotation of ice floe against the floater therefore the present manuscript delves deeper into the dynamics of submerged cables focusing on the 2 1 internal resonance phenomena in the presence of combined hydrodynamic and ice loads estimating ice load on a floating structure is difficult due to the uncertainty associated with a broad range and variety of ice features and constitutive properties there has been a lot of effort to predict the ice load both experimentally and theoretically however most of the theories utilized in predicting the ice load are primarily based on fixed offshore structures such as jack up rig gravity based concrete platform and bridge piers iso 19906 2010 it is well known that the impact of ice load on a floater mooring system is fundamentally different from the fixed structure due to the flexibility exerted by the mooring system lu et al 2014 2015 aksnes 2010 2011 studied ice load on an arctic floater from a level ice field assuming three distinct phases i e breaking rotation and sliding typically in an arctic floater downward breaking slope at the ice level is preferred since this assists in the ice breaking under flexure lohne 2012 typically the bending strength 0 5 mpa of ice is much smaller in comparison to the ice crushing strength 2 0 mpa thus reducing the global ice load as well as the potential of ice induced vibration triggered by ice crushing the breaking of level ice when in contact with the downward breaking slope occurs within a very short period just as the tensile stress at the top of the level ice exceeds the fairly small tensile strength of the ice next follows a rotation phase of the broken ice pieces subsequently the broken ice floe slides along the slope of the floater and a new cycle of ice breaking rotating sliding begins numerical modelling of level ice field is usually done by assuming it to be an infinite thin plate supported on a winkler type elastic foundation nevel 1958 1961 details of this method can be found in kerr 1976 squire et al 1976 and literature cited therein even though this method is widely used for ice loading prediction modelling of complex ice fracture such as breaking crack propagation broken ice field and rubble formation requires additional treatment which are empirical and or ad hoc formalism to model the breaking of ice subsequent crack propagation and rubble formation several numerical methods like discrete element method dem smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph are used see e g ji et al 2013 das and ehlers 2015 however the results from these methods are often not verified due to the lack of data for comparison and uncertainty involved in the phenomena ji et al 2013 furthermore the extreme uncertainties associated with the ice properties and ice structure interaction mechanisms result in significant scatters in the predicted ice load values using different numerical tools as a result many studies apply the two dimensional beam on an elastic foundation based theories to analyse the failure of an ice sheet interacting with a sloping structure e g lu et al 2014 croasdale and cammaert 1994 subsequent studies employ the solution to calculate the ice breaking loads for various types of sloping structures kotras et al 1983 lubbad and loset 2011 in this work the elastic foundation theory by croasdale croasdale and cammaert 1994 is implemented in a commercial hydrodynamics and mooring analysis package to estimate the ice load on floating platform in the present study an attempt is made to investigate the stability of a cable in a situation involving coupled hydrodynamic and ice loads a unidirectional periodic loading is considered and thereby the floater will have two translational motions i e surge and heave the floater motions will cause a support excitation at the pinned connection between the floater and mooring this phenomenon is modelled as a base excitation at the top support point of the mooring cable an analytical model based on modal analysis of underwater submerged cable considering its geometric nonlinearity is presented introducing the geometric nonlinearity into the model enables coupling between the different modes which is not included in the standard linear analysis of integrated mooring system the support excitation frequency is chosen to be close to the cable s natural frequency of the second in plane mode therefore the in plane mode is excited directly ice load is applied at the fairlead from an out of plane direction as a pulse load hence the out of plane mode is excited parametrically it is observed that the out of plane mode responses show instability under certain base excitation amplitude i e the responses due to the pulse load from the ice impact never decay the instability in the responses arises from the interaction between the different modes i e auto parametric excitation which cannot be captured by the linear analysis this phenomenon may lead to the fatigue failure of the mooring cables numerous simulations are carried out to determine the stability boundary of different out of plane modes for various amplitudes and excitation frequencies the stability boundaries are also determined using the harmonic balance method to verify the results obtained from the modal analysis the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the particulars of the problem are addressed and a method to calculate the ice impact load along with the cable model is presented detailed mathematical formulation for modal analysis of a taut cable is also presented in the same section section 3 contains a comparison of the proposed model with experiments for validation in section 4 the key results obtained from stability analysis of taut mooring cable subjected to coupled hydrodynamic and ice loads are presented finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 problem description and methodology in this study the stability of a mooring cable is analysed in the presence of a unidirectional periodic load and out of plane ice load the floater motion will cause a significant movement at the fairlead connection this is mathematically modelled as a base excitation in the present study to keep the formulation simple a unidirectional wave is assumed and therefore the floater will oscillate in the x z plane it is assumed that the connection point between the floater and mooring will experience the same displacement and acceleration as that of the floater for simplicity of the model this base excitation at the top connection point of the mooring is assumed as a sinusoidal displacement time history it should be noted that the base excitation frequency is assumed to be close to the second natural frequency of the mooring cables it is also assumed that the bottom point of the mooring is pinned to the seabed and the top point is pinned to the floater the primary focus is to investigate the stability of the out of plane modes near the 2 1 resonance region in the presence of out of plane ice load ice load on the mooring fairlead is estimated using a developed ice load formulation for floating structures and implemented in a commercial package harp offshore dynamics inc hu using this formulation an estimation of fairlead acceleration time history is obtained for ice load the mooring which experiences the maximum load is studied for the stability in this work fig 1 depicts a schematic diagram of the problem illustrating wave and ice loading over a generic floater methodology to predict the out of plane ice load is presented in the next subsection here it should be mentioned that in the present study mooring system is considered to be very steep but the method would also work in less steep moorings less water depth or longer mooring lines 2 1 estimation of ice load in this study an idealized load versus penetration evolution is utilized to estimate the load on floating structure using penetration as the only governing parameter fig 2 illustrates the ice load formulation implemented in a commercially available coupled floater and mooring systems analysis software harp it is assumed that the ice field is made up of managed ice and the size of ice floes are large enough to exert the assumed load hence ice structure interaction can be estimated as a combination of three distinct phases viz breaking phase flexural failure of ice rotation phase and sliding phase of the managed ice the peak ice load from first first year level ice can be estimated using the formulation based on 2d beam bending on an elastic foundation derived by croasdale and cammaert 1994 the ice load in the horizontal direction f h on an arctic floater with downward breaking slope is given as timco and cornet 1997 1 f h c 3 d σ f ρ w g h 5 e 0 25 1 π 2 l 4 d c 4 t s h d ρ w ρ i g where c 3 0 68 ξ 3 ξ 4 c 4 ξ 3 ξ 3 ξ 4 cot α ξ 3 μ cos α sin α and ξ 4 μ sin α cos α here in eq 1 μ is the coefficient of friction h is thickness of the first year level ice t s is the depth of ice rubble and generally assumed to be equal to the draught of the cone section the slope angle α is taken as negative for downward sloping cones and it is measured from the same horizontal plane the relation between the vertical and horizontal force is given by croasdale and cammaert 1994 as 2 f h f v μ cos α sin α μ sin α cos α f v ξ a loss of contact between the ice and the floating structure is assumed and this is indicated by the load drop right before the breaking phase begins as shown in fig 2 in this formulation it is assumed that ice load evolves with the extent of ice penetration ice penetration is defined as the relative displacement between the drifting level ice and the floating structure hence the drift velocity v i c e of level ice field does not influence peak ice load but it has a significant effect on the ice load evolution the load during the rotation phase f l and breaking f t depends on both vessel and ice properties based on the model tests by aksnes 2011 the current manuscript assumes the load during the rotation phase f l and breaking f t to be 15 and 10 of the peak load respectively the duration of each loading phase is assumed to be constant throughout the simulation this duration multiplied by the ice drift velocity v i c e gives the ice penetration associated with each loading phase as indicated in fig 2 the sum of ice penetration during rotation sliding phase δ d and the load drop phase δ r is equal to the ice breaking length according to model tests reported by aksnes 2011 the ice breaking length ranges between 5 and 7 times its thickness h whereas the duration of the ice breaking phase depicted in fig 2 as the sum of δ p and δ f is assumed to be 6 s coupled floater mooring analysis is performed using hull and riser mooring program harp in which the ice load floater penetration algorithm is implemented as user subroutine harp provides the ice load algorithm with the displacement velocity and acceleration at the reference point of the floater centre of water plane in each time step the subroutine then derives the body force for the next time step corresponding to the penetration replaced by relative displacement for a floater and supplies it to the coupled analysis program in the next step the combined analysis program calculates the floater motion using the applied force the coupled analysis continues to run in this manner for the total duration of the analysis fig 3 presents the proposed algorithm as a coupled iterative cycle 2 2 modelling of cable dynamics a brief description of the cable dynamics equations is presented in this section consider a simply supported inclined cable of length l with end points at a and b as shown in fig 1 the line joining a and b i e the chord line of the cable is assumed to be the x axis of the coordinate system it is assumed that this chord line and the equilibrium position of the sagged cable due to the gravity are in the x z plane therefore the motion of the cable in the x z plane is referred to as the in plane motion and in the direction perpendicular to the x z plane i e the y direction is referred to as the out of plane motion the angle of inclination of the cable θ is defined by the angle made by the chord line with the horizontal the deflections of the cable in x y and z directions are represented as u v and w respectively the static deflections of the cable in x y and z directions due to the sag are given as 3 u s 0 v s 0 and w s ρ g a cos θ t s x l x 2 x 2 2 respectively here t s x is the tension in cable due to sag ρ is the density of the cable material g is the acceleration due to gravity a is the cross sectional area of the cable it should be noted that the suffix s represents the quantities referred to the static equilibrium state 2 2 1 equation of motion governing differential equations of the cable vibrations are given as wagg and nield 2009 warnitchai et al 1995 in plane 4 t d x 2 w s x 2 t s x t d x 2 w d x 2 f z a ρ a 2 w d t 2 out of plane 5 t s x t d x 2 v d x 2 f y a ρ a 2 v d t 2 here t d x is the dynamic tension the suffix d represents the quantities of the dynamic state and f y and f z represent the force per unit area in the y and z directions respectively in this study it is assumed that the constitutive property of the cable is linear elastic therefore the dynamic tension t d x can be written in terms of the dynamic strain ε d as 6 t d x a e ε d where e is the young s modulus the dynamic strain ε d can be expressed using the finite strain theory as 7 ε d u d x 1 2 v d x 2 1 2 w d x 2 d w s d x w d x to derive a general formulation for the cable with support motion the boundary condition at the top at x 0 is considered as u 0 t u a t v 0 t v a t and w 0 t w a t and at the bottom at x l is taken as u l t u b t v l t v b t and w l t w b t 2 2 2 quasi static analysis for support motion here it should be noted that the boundary conditions are time varying and therefore the cable responses can be separated into two components viz the quasi static and the modal components quasi static component satisfies the time varying boundary condition whereas the modal component satisfies the static simply supported boundary condition therefore splitting the dynamic components into quasi static and modal components yields 8 u d u q u m v d v q v m and w d w q w m subsequently the strain in the cable can be written by substituting eq 8 into eq 7 as 9 ε d u q x d w s d x w q x w m x 1 2 v m x 2 1 2 w q x 2 2 d w q d x w m x w m x 2 since the support excitation is considered only in the x z plane the quasi static component of the displacement in the out of plane direction turns out to be zero subsequently the displacement field due to the base excitation at the top support of the cable can be obtained as see wagg and nield 2009 warnitchai et al 1995 for the detailed derivation 10 u q u a e q e u b u a x l λ 2 4 e q e u b u a x l 2 x l 2 4 3 x l 3 1 2 w b w a γ a l t s x x l x l 2 v q v a v b v a x l w q w a w b w a x l γ e q a 2 l 2 t s x 2 u b u a x l x

that the axial modal motion is small compared to the vertical and or out of plane modal motions and thus it is neglected i e u m 0 modal displacement should satisfy the simply supported boundary condition at both ends of the cable i e u 0 t 0 v 0 t 0 w 0 t 0 u l t 0 v l t 0 and w l t 0 modal components of the displacement response can be written as 13 u m x t 0 v m x t n 1 ϕ n x y n t w m x t n 1 ψ n x z n t where the expression for the mode shapes is given as ϕ n x sin n π x l for n 1 2 3 14 ψ n x sin n π x l for n 1 2 3 in this context it should be mentioned that the assumed mode shapes are determined by satisfying the simply supported boundary condition here it is important to note that odd in plane modes are approximated using a sinusoidal expression this may incur some error in the odd in plane modes however in the present paper only one even mode is considered and this assumption has no influence on the results presented next the standard galerkin method is applied to convert the governing partial differential equations of cables into a set of non linear ordinary differential equations using the variational technique see wagg and nield 2009 warnitchai et al 1995 for the detailed derivation by multiplying eq 4 by ϕ n substituting eqs 9 10 and 13 and then integrating the equation over the length finally gives the out of plane modal motions as 15 m y n y n 2 ξ y n y n ω y n 2 y n k v n k y n y k 2 z k 2 k 2 β n k y n z k 2 η n u b u a y n ζ n v a 1 n 1 v b f y n similarly the in plane cable motion can be obtained by multiplying eq 5 by ψ n substituting eqs 9 10 and 13 and then integrating the equation over the length as 16 m z n z n 2 ξ z n z n ω z n 2 z n k v n k y n y k 2 z k 2 k 2 β n k z n z k k β n k y k 2 z k 2 2 η n u b u a z n ζ n w a 1 n 1 w b α n u b u a f z n here in eqs 15 and 16 n represents the n th mode therefore the generalized displacements of the cable in the n th out of plane and in plane modes are symbolized as y n and z n the quantities m y n and m z n are the modal masses and taken as m y n m z n 1 2 ρ a l where ρ is the density of the cable material the terms v n k β n k ζ n α n η n and k n are as follows 17 v n k e a π

natural frequencies are given respectively as 18 ω y n n π l σ s ρ and ω z n n π l σ s ρ 1 k n the modal components of the external in plane f y n and out of plane forces f z n acting on the cable respectively are given by 19 f y n 0 l f y ϕ n d x f z n 0 l f z ψ n d x 2 2 4 modal analysis of underwater taut cable in this section a modal based procedure for the underwater cable is presented the cable model presented above does not consider the drag and inertia added mass forces due to the fluid structure interaction in the present paper the effects of these forces are included in the modal analysis assuming that the characteristic structural dimension of the mooring cable is smaller than the water wavelength the wave forces are formulated using the modified morison equation relative velocity model which is composed of two components the inertia and drag forces the hydrodynamic force per unit length of the cable is given as 20 f i c m a i v i w c a a i u i c d a d v i w v i w c d a d u i u i where a i ρ w a and a d 1 2 ρ w d c m c a and c d c d are the inertia added mass and drag coefficients v i w and v i w are the instantaneous local water particle velocity and acceleration u i and u i are the velocity and acceleration of the cable respectively ρ w is the water density d is the diameter of the cable the suffix i symbolises the force component in the vector direction the modal component of the morison forces can be obtained using the relation given in eq 19 in which the force terms f y and f z are the vector components of the morison force in the y and z directions therefore the modal component of the morison force in the out of plane direction can be obtained as 21 f y n 0 l c a a i k 1 ϕ k y k ϕ n d x 0 l c d a d k 1 ϕ k y k k 1 ϕ k y k ϕ n d x here it should be noted that in eq 20 the fluid particle velocity v i w and acceleration v i w in the out of plane direction turns out to be zero since a unidirectional wave is assumed therefore eq 21 can be further simplified as 22 f y n c a a i l 2 y n c d a d l cos π n 1 2 cos π n 2 3 π n y n y n the relationships used in the simplification of eq 21 are as follows 23 0 l ϕ n ϕ k d x 0 n k l 2 n k 0 l ϕ n 2 ϕ k d x 0 n k l cos π n 1 2 cos π n 2 3 π n n k 0 l ϕ n d x l n π 1 1 n 1 similarly the in plane modal component of the morison force can be obtained as 24 f y n 0 l c m a i v y w ψ n d x 0 l c a a i k 1 ψ n y k ψ n d x 0 l c d a d v y w v y w ψ n d x 0 l c d a d k 1 ψ n y k k 1 ψ n y k ψ n d x assuming the fluid particle velocity to be constant around the cable for simplicity eq 24 reduces to 25 f z n c m a i l n π 1 1 n 1 v z w c a a i l n π 1 1 n 1 z n c d a d l cos π n 1 2 cos π n 2 3 π n v z w v z w c d a d l cos π n 1 2 cos π n 2 3 π n z n z n it is to be noted that for the simplification of eq 24 the expressions of eq 23 are used since the same mode shapes are assumed for both in plane and out of plane motions as mentioned earlier the prime focus of this study is to investigate 2 1 internal resonance phenomenon between the modes this occurs when the excitation frequency is twice and or close to twice the first out of plane natural frequency of the mooring cable it is experimentally observed that the first in plane mode is sufficiently separated in frequency from the first out of plane mode and will not excite for the frequency ranges considered in investigating the 2 1 internal resonance it is assumed that the contribution from the other modes is negligible for the frequency ranges considered therefore in the present study only the second in plane mode and first two out of plane modes are considered in the present analysis a unidirectional wave is considered whereby the floater will have the surge and heave motions and this will eventually excite the cable through the vertical and horizontal support motions the surge and heave motions of the floater directly excite the cable through the connection between the floater and mooring therefore the support motions due to the surge and heave can be represented by temporally varying the displacement field u a t and w a t respectively the ice load due to the impact is also considered through the base excitation the displacement field is represented by v a t the boundary condition at the cable upper support at x 0 will be u 0 t u a t v 0 t v a t and w 0 t w a t lower support of the cable is assumed to be pinned to the sea bed at x l boundary condition are u l t 0 v l t 0 and w l t 0 it is assumed that the amplitude δ and the frequency ω of the surge and heave motions during the steady state response are the same therefore in eqs 15 and 16 the end condition can be substituted as u a δ and w a δ where δ δcos ω t in the present study it is assumed that the ice floe imparts a sudden acceleration to the fairlead from the out of plane direction this phenomenon is modelled by the term ζ n v a of eq 15 where v a is assumed to have a time history profile with a rectangular pulse of very small duration the modal frequencies of the out of plane and second in plane modes are related as ω z 2 ω y 2 2 ω y 1 now denoting ω z 2 ω y 2 ω 2 and ω y 1 ω 1 the modal equation of motion for the second in plane and first two out of plane modes can be written using eqs 15 and 16 as 26 y 1 2 ξ y 1 ω 1 y 1 ω 1 2 y 1 w 11 y 1 3 w 12 y 1 y 2 2 z 2 2 n 1 δ y 1 c a r y 1 c d r y 1 y 1 27 y 2 2 ξ

are as follows 29 w n k v n k m n n 2 η n m b 2 ζ n m c a r c a a i l 2 m c d r c d a d 4 l 3 π m in the present study eqs 26 28 are solved numerically to obtain the modal response of the cable these equations are also investigated via scaling and averaging technique the objective of this numerical and theoretical investigations is to obtain the stability boundaries in terms of the frequency amplitude response curve 2 2 5 simulation in order to solve these simultaneous ordinary differential equations newmark s time integration scheme is adopted using this method eqs 26 28 at time any given time t j 1 can be written as 30 m x j 1 c x j 1 k x t x j 1 f j 1 here in eq 30 mass matrix m is the coefficient of the vector x y 1 y 2 z 2 damping matrix is the coefficients of the linear damping vector x y 1 y 2 z 2 nonlinear stiffness k x t is the coefficients of the vector x y 1 y 2 z 2 f is the force vector constructed by the terms from the morison force and base excitation at each time increment δ t j t j 1 t j the incremental elastic force can be written as 31 k x t x j 1 k x t x j k t δ x j where k t is the tangent stiffness at x j substituting eq 31 into eq 30 gives 32 m x j 1 c x j 1 k t δ x j f j 1 k x t x j the error introduced due to the replacement of secant stiffness matrix by the tangent stiffness matrix is reduced through iterations at each time step tolerance is kept as below 0 1 2 2 6 scaling and averaging the set of ordinary differential equations eqs 26 28 is also examined via scaling and averaging technique the objective of this analysis is to determine the modal amplitudes of directly excited modes and stability of other modes to this end these equations are scaled in the standard lagrange form given as 33 x i j ω 1 2 x i j ε x i o ε 2 where ε is a small parameter in eq 33 time scale τ is introduced and it is transformed using the relationship τ 1 μ t the symbols and represent the first and second order derivatives with respect to τ respectively here a new representation of the variables is introduced y 1 y 2 z 2 x 11 x 22 x 32 where second subscript in x i j represents whether the variable is related to the first or second mode it is assumed that the base excitation frequency ω is close to the natural frequency of the second mode so frequency of the base excitation can be written in the form ω 2 ω 1 1 μ neglecting the higher order terms of ε eqs 26 28 can be written in a standard lagrange form as in new scaled domain 34 y 1 ω 1 2 y 1 ε 2 ξ y 1 ω 1 y 1 n 1 δ y 1 2 μ ω 1 2 y 1 w 11 y 1 3 w 12 y 1 y 2 2 z 2 2 c a n y 1 y 1 c d n y 1 y 1

and x i j s are treated as constant during the integration and the subscript a represents their average value 2 2 7 stability boundaries in the present study the in plane motion is directly excited due to the wave induced base excitation the increase in the amplitude of the base excitation can excite either of the two out of plane modes in frequency amplitude parameter space this marks as the boundary of the semi trivial solution therefore the localized stability of each out of plane mode is analysed about zero response to trace the boundary of the semi trivial solution in frequency amplitude parameter space assuming that the other out of plane mode has zero amplitude now for each mode eqs 39 and 40 can be written in the form 45 x i j c a x i j s a ε a s x i j c a x i j s a here in eq 45 the matrix a s contains the coefficients of x i j c a and x i j s a in the matrix a s the amplitudes of the second out of plane are considered to be zero and also the higher order terms are neglected now the eigenvalues of matrix a s are determined to trace the stability boundary for a small excitation amplitude the eigenvalues have negative real parts with the increase in excitation amplitude the real part of one of the eigenvalues turns out to be zero this gives the stability boundary of the first out of plane mode as the roots of the following equations 46 w 12 2 z 2 a 4 8 w 12 μ ω 1 2 z 2 a 2 16 ω 1 4 μ 2 ξ y 2 2 c a 2 4 n 1 2 δ 2 4 ω 1 2 n 1 δ c a 0 similarly it can be obtained for the second out of plane mode as 47 3 w 12 2 12 c a w 12 ω 1 2 z 2 a 4 32 w 12 μ ω 1 2 4 c a w 12 ω 1 2 z 2 a 2 64 ω 1 4 μ 2 ξ y 2 2 c a 2 4 μ c a 0 and for the second in plane mode stability boundary turns out to be 48 9 w 22 2 z 2 a 6 48 w 22 μ ω 2 2 24 c a w 22 ω 2 2 z 2 a 4 64 ω 2 4 μ 2 ξ

observation of gonzalez buelga et al 2008 in this model test a cable of length 1 98 m was used with an angle of inclination 20 0 the static tension of the cable was 205 n cable diameter was 0 8 mm with a mass of 0 67 kg m the young s modulus was taken as same that of steel i e 200 gpa a disturbance in the form of a 0 02 s 0 1 mm s amplitude pulse is applied to the two out of plane modes and the stability of modes is assessed the stability boundary for the first out of plane mode is estimated by solving the modal equation of motions considering the two out of plane and one in plane modes from eqs 15 16 and 20 for the morison force for various values of the base excitation amplitude and frequency in this context it should be noted also that the model test was carried out in the air and the morison forces due to air drag and inertia are included in the model the density of air was chosen to be 1 225 kg m3 drag and inertia coefficients are considered as 1 0 and 2 2 respectively excitation amplitude is gradually increased keeping the same excitation frequency to find a point at which slight increase or decrease in the amplitude causes growth in the first out of plane mode it is important to note that the base excitation is provided at the lower support of the cable in the experiments therefore in the simulation it is replicated using the end conditions u a 0 w a 0 u b δ and w b δ where δ δcos ω t the out of plane pulse load is provided by the term ζ n v b of eq 15 in fig 4 the stability boundary obtained from numerical simulation is compared with the experimental results of gonzalez buelga et al 2008 it is observed that the difference in the results between the numerical predictions and experimental measurements is less than 2 therefore it can be concluded that the stability points predicted from the simulation show good agreement with the experimental measurements the deviation in the results can be attributed to the fact that a cable with uniform density is used in the numerical simulations whereas to attain the intended mass of the cable lead weights were attached at 60 mm interval in experimental analysis in fig 4 the stability boundary obtained by neglecting the hydrodynamic forces are also plotted for comparison it can be observed that the inclusion hydrodynamic forces cause a reduction in the amplitude required for cable to become unstable for a particular frequency the maximum difference in amplitude required for the instability of cable can reduce up to 20 if the drag and inertia effects are considered in a mooring system design the hydrodynamic effects will be even more since the water being a denser material will have a large influence on the drag and inertia forces however these effects were neglected in the earlier study on parametric and auto parametric instability of cables as well as in the mooring system design in the next section a comprehensive study on the parametric and auto parametric instability of taut mooring cables in the presence of coupled hydrodynamic and ice load is presented 4 results and discussion in the present study a modal instability analysis of the mooring system of an arctic floater with a downward slope is performed the study assumes a complex loading situation the wave load from the in plane direction and ice load from the out of plane direction the wave load on the fairlead is assumed as a harmonic excitation whereas the ice load on the floater is assumed as a pulse load the prediction of the pulse load function is done through a numerical simulation presented is section 2 1 with this loading scenario a series of simulations is carried out to investigate the effect of geometric nonlinearity in the stability of mooring cable under the out of plane pulse load from the ice floe the effect of the morison forces for the modal instability of cable is also investigated 4 1 ice load acceleration ice load time history on the floater is determined by employing the coupled ice floater interaction program which comprises of a commercially available coupled floater and mooring system analysis software harp and a user defined function for the ice load at each time step based on both ice and floater movement a floater with circular hull and radially symmetric mooring system with 12 taut cables is utilized for the analysis table 1 lists the hydrodynamic and mooring parameters of the floater fig 5 displays the panel model of the floater and mooring system simulations are carried out by varying ice thickness h 1 m 1 5 m and 3 m and drift velocity v i c e 0 01 m s and 0 05 m s keeping all the other parameters constant in fig 6 the ice load time history on the floater from each of the simulation is presented it can be clearly seen from fig 6 that the peak load primarily depends on the ice thickness whereas drift velocity influences the number of ice events it can be observed that if the drift velocity is increased keeping the ice thickness constant e g fig 6a and d the number of ice breaking events reduces this can be attributed to those situations when the drift velocity of ice becomes less than the velocity of the floater now the stability analysis of the mooring which experiences the maximum load is performed using the ice load case presented in fig 6 this load is utilized as the source of out of plane pulse load for the mooring instability analysis the out of plane pulse load is provided to the fairlead through an out of plane acceleration the out of plane acceleration on the floater is estimated from the acceleration time history obtained from harp simulation the peak pulse acceleration a floater experienced by the floater for the load case as presented in fig 6a turns out to be 0 02 m s2 and in all the calculations this pulse acceleration at the fairlead is utilized here it should be noted that sudden acceleration of the floater and fairlead are assumed to be the same i e a floater a fairlead in this study an initial delay of 200 s is prescribed before the first ice feature comes in contact with the floater this delay ensures the realistic stable condition of the floater under wave loading the overall influence of the stable ice load portion on the mooring instability is not significant thus this value is neglected and assumed to be zero to particularly identify the instability characteristics the implication of just one ice breaking event is investigated i e one transient load event to research its influence on the instability effectively building on the explanation in section 2 1 behind the potential of orthogonal ice load an independent ice floe is considered this allows to employ a transient ice load function with a single peak as shown in fig 6a to interact with the floater from an orthogonal direction to the wave 4 2 linear versus nonlinear cable dynamics in this study a comparison between linear and non linear cable dynamics is presented in this regard eqs 26 28 are solved numerically using newmark s method in the linearized version of the cable dynamics equation the terms associated with the geometric nonlinearity terms involving w 11 w 12 w 21 and w 22 are ignored therefore the cable is excited directly through the term b δ in the in plane mode and parametric terms terms involving n 1 n 2 due to the wave induced motion of the floater here it should be noted that in both linear and nonlinear analysis the terms due to morison forces are included during simulation in figs 7 and 8 the modal responses for the same loading condition is presented considering the linear and nonlinear cable dynamics base excitation amplitude frequency and acceleration in the floater due to the ice load are kept same for both cases it can be clearly seen from fig 7a that the response of the first out of plane mode due to the pulse ice load on the floater gradually decays in the linear analysis however in the nonlinear analysis it continuously oscillates and never decays as shown in fig 8a a growth in modal response also can be observed in the second out of plane mode from fig 8b a few harmonics of the response are shown in the inset of fig 8a and b which clearly depicts the growth in the response after the application of the ice load the simulations with the geometric nonlinearity include cubic stiffness terms and also modal coordinates are multiplied with one another this can excite the other responses through the modal coupling which is ignored in the linear analysis 4 3 effect of morison forces nonlinear cable dynamics simulations are also carried out to investigate the effect of the morison forces which are introduced in the modal analysis of the underwater cable in fig 9 the modal response of the cable is plotted without considering the effect of the morison forces keeping all the other parameters same it can be observed that the modal responses do not display an instability in the out of plane modes i e growth in the response however this is in contrast to the responses plotted in fig 8 in which the morison forces are considered along with the geometric nonlinearity this can be attributed to the nonlinear force due to the added mass contains acceleration of the surrounding fluid and drag contains terms which are square of velocity leading to the modal instability of the cable therefore it is important to obtain the stability boundaries i e frequency amplitude response curves for the designers utility 4 4 stability boundaries stability boundaries are determined both theoretically and numerically in order to obtain the stability boundary of the first out of plane mode eqs 46 and 48 are solved together for various values of the base excitation frequency similarly eqs 47 and 48 are solved together to obtain the stability boundary of the second out of plane mode stability of the out of plane modes is also tested numerically by solving eqs 26 28 for various values of the base excitation amplitude and frequency for a particular value of excitation frequency the excitation amplitude is gradually increased to find the instability in the out of plane modes fig 10 a features frequency amplitude response parenting to the stability boundary of first out of plane mode a similar method of determining the stability boundaries presented in the model validation section is used in this case as well to identify the stability boundary for a particular excitation frequency the amplitude of base excitation due to wave load is varied keeping all the other parameters constant here it should be noted that even though wave load is varied ice load i e fairlead excitation is kept constant at the boundary for a particular frequency a slight increase amplitude makes the modal response from stable to unstable it should be noted also that the point of inflection in the stability curve is shifted due to the inclusion of morison forces see ref gonzalez buelga et al 2008 inflection point of the stability curve is near ω ω 2 1 this is due to the inclusion of the added mass term of the morison equation which changes the natural frequency of the coupled system it is also observed that the first out of plane roots obtained solving eqs 46 and 48 oscillate from one solution value to another this can be attributed to the neglecting of higher order terms in scaling average schemes because of which this scheme is unable to produce actual frequency amplitude response curve for system involving strong nonlinearity in fig 10b the stability region for the second out of plane mode obtained from both theoretical solution and simulation is depicted the stability boundaries by the numerical simulation are identified as the point at which a slight increase or decrease in the amplitude causes an instability in fig 10b markers indicate stable response whereas markers indicate unstable a significant difference in results between the simulation and scaling averaging method can be observed for ω ω 2 1 this difference is due to the fact that the lower stability boundary does not represent zero initial condition used in the simulation also neglecting the higher order terms in scaling average schemes can be a source of this difference as discussed earlier a similar shift in the inflection point of the stability curve can be observed in the second out of plane mode as well in fig 11 the response of the second in plane mode is presented for two different cases i without morison forces and ii with morison forces the response of the second in plane mode is obtained for various values of the excitation amplitude keeping excitation frequency same at ω ω 2 1 by finding the roots of eq 48 it can be observed that the hysteretic region the region marked in fig 6 op for the case without morison force and op m for the case with morison forces where there are two stable solutions for the second in plane mode has increased with the inclusion of morison forces the lower saddle node of the bifurcation p m occurs for a higher magnitude of the excitation amplitude instability in the out of plane modes occurs when the excitation amplitude exceeds beyond the point p m at point p m the amplitude of the second in plane mode jumps to r m i e larger solution curve it can be observed that the jump in the amplitude of the second in plane response becomes larger with the inclusion of morison forces distance between p m and r m is greater than p and r the steady state amplitude of the second in plane response obtained from simulation agrees well with the results obtained from the scaling averaging 4 5 effect of mooring cable pretension and fairlead slope on stability boundaries in fig 12 a and b a parametric study on the stability boundaries is presented by varying mooring cable pretension and fairlead slope respectively simulations are carried out for three values of mooring cable pretension viz 500 kn 1000 kn and 1500 kn keeping all the other parameters constant stability boundary for second out of plane mode is plotted in fig 12a for various values of cable pretension it can be observed that with the increase in the cable pretension the amplitude of base excitation required to cause the instability in cable is more the difference in the required amplitude of base excitation to cause the instability can go up to a maximum of 30 if the cable tension is increased from 500 kn to 1500 kn therefore it can be prescribed that increase in the cable pretension can be used as a potential method to mitigate the parametric and auto parametric instability in morning system in fig 12b another parametric study on the stability boundary is presented by varying the fairlead slope and keeping all the other parameters constant as provided in table 1 here it should be noted that in this study the fairlead slope is varied keeping water depth constant and therefore the cable length is varied it can be clearly seen from fig 12b that with the increase in fairlead slope the amplitude of base excitation required to cause the instability in the mooring cables increases increase in the fairlead slope from 20 to 30 causes a maximum of 30 increase in the amplitude required to produce the instability in mooring cable therefore it can be concluded that the fairlead slope plays a significant role in designing a stable mooring system and can effectively be used to reduce the instability in the mooring system 5 conclusion it can be concluded from the present study that the geometric nonlinearity plays an important role in the modal interaction i e the auto parametric excitation of the cable which may lead to the large vibration and instability in an ice floe field furthermore the coupled hydrodynamic and ice load significantly influences the modal coupling which leads to reduction in the amplitude of base excitation required to cause an instability in cable therefore in the mooring system design for arctic environment it is recommended to consider the effect of coupled hydrodynamic and ice load along with the higher order terms of strain tensor however the present state of the art in the offshore industry tends to ignore this phenomenon the stability boundaries in terms of frequency amplitude response curve for out of plane modes are identified near the 2 1 internal resonance region furthermore the stability boundaries are studied as a function of cable pretension and fairlead slope it is found that the cable pretension and the fairlead slope can be used as potential methods to control the parametric and auto parametric instability in the morning system these findings can aid the industry in the design stage of mooring system wherein the line design variables can be selected judiciously to avoid the internal resonance phenomenon the present study can be extended by considering various other internal resonance phenomena which may occur due to the coupling of different modes one of the extension to the present study can be considered as modelling of the surrounding fluid domain with navier stokes equation which will remove the empirically assigned values of drag and inertia coefficients in the morison equation furthermore a simple semi empirical model for predicting ice load is used in the present study which can be extended by considering more realistic phenomenological model for ice floe considering the breaking crack propagation rotation and rubble formation in reality combined hydrodynamic and ice loads may come from any direction the loading condition chosen in this particular manuscript can be considered as a subset of the complex loading situation that an arctic floater mooring system may encounter and this may eventually lead to more complex dynamic responses such internal resonance phenomena is quite common in real engineering problems which can lead to undesired large amplitude variations into flexible cables in this paper it is shown theoretically that the dynamics of underwater mooring cables are strongly nonlinear which involves internal coupling between modes and parametric coupling with external effects using a simple condition of combined hydrodynamic and ice loads this can eventually lead to instability of underwater cable due to internal resonance phenomena this work can be experimentally investigated further by studying the parametric and autoparametric instability of underwater cable to apply it efficiently in real engineering applications acknowledgment this work done at the keppel nus corporate laboratory was

good agreement of results keywords green sea loads regular waves cfd naval hydro pack vof 1 introduction in the field of offshore and marine engineering wave loading poses a wide range of different challenges which are important in the design process one of the more difficult wave related problems to describe and reliably estimate is the green sea load green sea or water on deck is a consequence of a highly nonlinear interaction between the floating structure and the free surface waves which comprise incident diffracted and radiated waves the complex origin of the phenomenon renders the prediction of green sea occurrence challenging apart from that violent two phase flow develops once the water is on the deck which is difficult to predict via simplified flow theories green sea effect cause both local and global structural loads which can endanger the structural integrity and therefore must be taken into account in the design process given the complexity of the problem experimental and numerical means are currently utilised to calculate green sea loads according to tamarel et al temarel et al 2016 both experimental and numerical methods available today are not mature to reliably assess green sea loads hence further research is needed to establish confidence in both fields as a result a wide variety of methods have been developed and applied in recent years greco et al 2012 used the numerical solver developed by greco and lugni 2012 to calculate wave loads on a patrol ship including green sea loads with comparison to experiments lu et al 2012 developed a time domain numerical method based on finite volume fv method used for green sea load simulations xu 2013 used smoothed particle hydrodynamics to simulate breaking waves plunging onto a deck zhao et al 2014 studied the influence of structure motion on the pressure loads due to green sea effects using a fv based method kim et al 2013 used a linear method for assessing the ship motion and a nonlinear viscous method to calculate green sea loads on a container vessel ruggeri et al 2013 used wamit software based on the potential flow model and a viscous fv code starccm to devise guidelines for green

vessel in this work a detailed validation study of green sea loads on a static structure is conducted experimental results published by lee et al 2012 are used for the comparison nine regular wave cases are investigated including the uncertainty analysis of numerical and experimental results naval hydro software pack is used for numerical simulations which is an extension of the collocated fv based cfd open source software foam extend weller et al 1998 jasak 2009 the naval hydro package is specialised for viscous two phase large scale flows nonlinear stream function regular wave theory by rienecker and fenton 1981 is used for wave generation the potential wave flow and cfd are coupled in a one way fashion using implicit relaxation zones jasak et al 2015 by imposing the wave solution at the boundaries of the domain and gradually transitioning to the nonlinear cfd solution towards the middle of the domain the interface is captured using the volume of fluid vof method where a novel geometric approach developed by roenby et al 2016 is employed called isoadvector free surface boundary conditions are discretised using the ghost fluid method gfm vukčević 2016 providing a infinitesimally sharp pressure and density gradient distribution at the interface the aim of this paper is to assess the accuracy and feasibility of a modern naval hydrodynamics cfd software for predicting green sea loads in order to reduce the possible sources of error to a minimum a simple static geometry is analysed with publicly available experimental results lee et al 2012 since numerical simulations of wave induced motions and loads have been validated using the naval hydro package in the past vukčević 2016 vukčević et al 2015 2016 jasak et al 2014 green sea load validation is the missing piece for conducting complete numerical simulations with moving bodies where green sea loads are calculated this paper is organised as follows in the second chapter the numerical method is outlined the third chapter gives basic information about experimental measurements that are used for comparison in the fourth chapter the numerical simulations of green sea loads are described in detail including the simulation set up uncertainty analysis procedure and comparison of the results with the experiments finally a brief conclusion is given 2 numerical model in this section the numerical model used in this work is presented governing equations describing two phase incompressible and viscous flow are 1 u 0 2 u t uu ν u 1 ρ p d where u denotes the velocity field ν stands for the kinematic viscosity of the corresponding phase ρ is the density while p d stands for dynamic pressure 3 p d p ρ g x here p is the absolute pressure g is the gravitational acceleration while x denotes the radii vector note that the momentum equation has been divided through by the density assuming a two phase free surface system of incompressible immiscible fluids eq 1 and eq 2 are discretised in collocated fv fashion yielding the pressure and momentum equation vukčević et al 2017 respectively the equations are solved implicitly eq 2 is valid for both phases where the discontinuity of dynamic pressure and density at the interface is taken into account with the gfm vukčević 2016 vukčević et al 2017 the dynamic pressure and density jump conditions are a consequence of normal stress balance at the free surface the tangential stress balance is modelled approximately while the surface tension is neglected the two jump conditions arising from the normal stress balance are 4 p d p d ρ ρ g x 5 1 ρ p d 1 ρ p d 0 superscripts and denote the water and air phase respectively eq 4 states that the jump of dynamic pressure across the interface is proportional to the jump in density while eq 5 states that the jump of specific dynamic pressure gradient is zero the jump conditions are introduced into the discretisation via specialised discretisation schemes ensuring that eq 4 and eq 5 are satisfied the reader is referred to vukčević et al 2017 for details in order to advect the interface a geometric vof method called isoavector roenby et al 2016 is used standard advection equation is used in order to transport the volume fraction variable α 6 α t α u 0 written for a finite control volume p and discretised in time using the first order accurate euler method eq 6 states 7 v p α p t δ t α p t d v t t δ t s p α n u d s d τ where v p is the volume of the control volume p s p is the closed boundary surface of the control volume n is the unit normal vector of the boundary surface while τ denotes the time integration variable for a surface boundary discretised with a finite number of faces the closed surface integral is replaced with a sum of surface integrals across the faces 8 v p α p t δ t α p t f t t δ t s f α n f u d s f d τ where f denotes the face index the volume integral of the temporal term is discretised assuming a second order accurate fv method jasak 1996 instead of evaluating the temporal and surface integrals in eq 8 by employing conventional discretisation schemes in the isoadvector method they are integrated explicitly directly from the information about the moving iso surface of the volume fraction representing the interface through a polyhedral cell in this way sub grid resolution is achieved for interface advection this results in a sharp interface and bounded volume fraction field the reader is directed to roenby et al 2016 for more details on the isoadvector method 2 1 wave modelling regular waves are imposed into the cfd domain via implicit relaxation zones jasak et al 2015 relaxation zones are regions in the computational domain where the theoretical wave solution is imposed by smoothly transitioning to the calculated cfd solution the same method is used to dampen the waves at the outlet where the cfd solution is gradually replaced by the imposed solution the incident wave in this case a stream function wave model rienecker and fenton 1981 is used which is fully nonlinear permitting a shorter cfd domain since the wave nonlinearities are resolved outside of the cfd domain 3 green sea experiments the experimental tests were performed in the towing tank of seoul national university with the details and results published in lee et al 2012 a simplified model of a fpso vessel is used where three different bow shape configurations are tested the computations in this work are performed for one of the geometries called rect0 in the original paper lee et al 2012 the structure is static in order to reduce the number of possible sources of error when comparing the results ten pressure gauges are positioned at the deck of the model the geometry of the model and position of pressure gauges are shown in fig 1 a vertical wall is positioned at the deck to simulate the breakwater pressure data is measured for nine incident wave cases with wave parameters shown in table 1 pressure gauges are labelled as indicated in fig 1 in a separate figure for clarity in lee et al 2012 detailed experimental results are presented for pressure peaks of individual gauges the reported values are average pressure peaks over 35 incident wave periods maximum and minimum values of peaks are also reported enabling the assessment of periodic uncertainty however from the elastic structural response point of view the integral of force i e pressure is more relevant than extremely short force peaks for that reason additional post processing of raw experimental data is performed in order to establish the average pressure time integral in one wave period as well as maximum and minimum values the total experimental uncertainties are calculated as the superposition of measuring uncertainties bias and precision limit of pressure gauges and of periodic uncertainty of the pressure peak or pressure integral in time the bias and precision limit are stated in lee et al 2012 periodic uncertainty is calculated as 9 u e p ϕ max ϕ min n e where ϕ denotes an arbitrary measured item in one wave period such as pressure peak or pressure integral while n e stands for the number of periods included in the analysis ϕ max and ϕ min are the maximum and minimum values measured during n e periods total experimental uncertainty is then 10 u e t u e m 2 u e p 2 where u e m stands for measuring uncertainties comprised of bias and precision limit of the pressure gauges 4 green sea simulations in this section the simulations of green sea loading are presented first the simulation setup is described in detail followed by a brief description of the numerical uncertainty analysis used in this work second the results are shown where first a sensitivity study is performed regarding domain size in order to justify the reduction of the domain size described below next the results are compared to experimental data followed by a short discussion finally another sensitivity study is performed regarding the interface capturing method where the isoadvector method is compared to the conventional algebraic vof method rusche 2002 4 1 simulation setup simulations have been performed for all wave cases for geometry rect0 with vertical stem four grids are used for each wave case in order to establish the numerical uncertainty while the results from the finest grid are used as reference results for the comparison fig 2 shows the computational domain for wave 4 as an example with indicated boundaries the wall on the deck is simulated as a domain boundary hence the deck of the model is not included beyond the wall it is assumed that this simplification does not influence the flow on the deck despite the symmetry of the computational domain with respect to the longitudinal plane the violent flow occurring on deck during the green water phenomenon is not necessarily symmetric hence the full domain is simulated as opposed to only half the characteristics of fine grids for all wave cases are presented in table 2 here l is the domain length while l r indicates the length of inlet and outlet relaxation zones λ δ x and a δ z denote the number of cells per wave length and wave amplitude respectively h denotes the height of the domain above the deck in metres where different heights are used depending on the wave amplitude and expected wave run up against the wall the freeboard height is 0 045 m above the free surface lee et al 2012 δ z d e c k denotes the height of the cell above the deck at certain height from the deck the cell height is linearly increased towards the top boundary in order to reduce the number of cells also the cell size is reduced linearly in the horizontal direction from the inlet boundary towards the structure hence λ δ x is measured next to the structure fig 3 shows the computational grid in the longitudinal central plane and on the surface of the structure used for wave 4 note that the coarse grid is presented for better visibility of grid lines the simple geometry of the structure enables fully structured and orthogonal grids to be generated depth and breadth of the domain are constant for all wave cases where the depth is d 1 m and breadth b 3 m it should be noted here that the depth of the wave tank in the experiments was 3 5 m however only 1 m is included in the simulation in order to save computational time to avoid influence of this simplification wave velocity from the stream function wave theory is prescribed at the bottom in order to make it transparent to the flow this treatment assumes that the diffracted wave field is negligible at the depth of 1 m similarly the breadth is also reduced from 8 to 3 m with relaxation zones near the starboard and portside boundaries preventing reflection of the diffracted wave field considering the violent free surface flows at the deck and the explicit nature of the isoadvector method the time step is adjusted during the simulation to maintain a maximum fixed courant fredrich lewy cfl number of c o 0 75 the same c o is used in all simulations and on all grids which results in consistent time step variation on different grids for reference average time step for wave 1 on fine grid is 0 0006 s while for wave 9 it is 0 001 s as indicated in fig 1 the circular pressure gauges are 18 mm in diameter cells used on the deck are rectangular where the horizontal dimensions of the cell which correspond to the spatial discretisation of the deck surface ranges from 4 to 13 mm depending on the grid hence the deck surface discretisation resolution is always higher compared to the area of the pressure gauge used in the experiment as stated in lee et al 2012 the sampling rate of pressure gauges used in the experiment is 5 khz corresponding to a time step of 0 0002 s which is comparable to time steps used in the simulations no turbulence modelling is used in this work since it can be considered to have a negligible influence on pressure distribution at the structure moreover the pressure and velocity gradients in the flow on deck are extremely violent rendering standard single phase wall bounded models inapplicable the influence of turbulence should however be investigated in the future 4 2 uncertainty analysis the total numerical uncertainty is dominated by discretisation and periodic uncertainty since the iterative uncertainty is kept low by using sufficient number of nonlinear correctors per time step and converging linear systems to a tight tolerance 10 9 in order to assess the discretisation uncertainty a grid and time step refinement uncertainty study is performed with the least squares approach developed by eca hoekstra eça and hoekstra 2014 in case of unsteady flow the time step has to be varied as well as the grid resolution eça and hoekstra 2008 in this work the time step is reduced simultaneously with the cell size by maintaining a fixed cfl number for the least squares approach at least four refinement levels are needed in order to calculate the uncertainty constant refinement ratio of r 2 is used for all wave cases which is defined as the ratio between spatial and temporal resolution between adjacent refinement levels r h i 1 h i τ i 1 τ i where h i stands for the representative cell size of refinement level i while τ i stands for the time step since c o changes linearly with the cell size τ also varies linearly hence the condition r τ i 1 τ i is satisfied table 3 lists the number of cells for all grids and wave cases all simulations were performed on processors intel xeon e5 2637 v3 15m cache 3 50 ghz cpu time per wave period on eight cores for the coarse grid ranges between 1 3 and 1 9 h while on the fine grid it ranges from 7 3 to 15 6 h depending on the wave case according to eca hoekstra eça and hoekstra 2014 the uncertainty assessment begins with assessing the error of discretisation 11 ε i α h i p h i τ i h i 2 1 3 using the least squares fit here α is an unknown constant and p is the obtained order of accuracy the least squares fit is obtained by minimising the following function 12 s ϕ 0 α p i 1 n ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p 2 where ϕ 0 denotes the estimate of the exact solution while n denotes the number of refinement levels minimisation of eq 12 leads to a nonlinear system of equations which needs to be solved iteratively in case the observed order of accuracy p is larger than two the first or second order terms are used i e the following are solved 13 ε 1 i α h i ε 2 i α h i 2 and the fit with smaller standard deviation is used if p 0 5 first and second order terms are retained in addition to eq 13 14 ε 12 i α 1 h i α 2 h i 2 where the fit with the smallest standard deviation is used standard deviation is calculated as 15 σ i 1 n ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p 2 n 3 once ε ϕ 0 and σ are known the uncertainty of the result can be established if the data is well behaved the following expression is used for assessing the refinement uncertainty 16 u i f s ε i σ ϕ i ϕ f i t where f s is the safety factor while ϕ f i t presents the least squares fitted value of the solution for grid i the data is well behaved if σ δ where δ expresses the data range 17 δ ϕ max ϕ min n 1 where ϕ max and ϕ min represent the maximum and minimum value from all refinement levels in case the data is not well behaved i e σ δ the uncertainty is assessed as 18 u i 3 σ δ ε i σ ϕ i ϕ f i t in this work the uncertainty is assessed for the finest refinement level i e in the above expressions i 4 since the discretisation uncertainty study theoretically requires a smooth variable in time the uncertainty is assessed for the vertical force exerted on the deck i e the spatial integral of pressure instead of the pressure measured at gauge locations total computational uncertainty is assessed as the superposition of the discretisation and periodic uncertainty 19 u c t u c d 2 u c p 2 where u c d denotes the discretisation uncertainty established using eq 16 or eq 18 while u c p represents the periodic uncertainty calculated in the same manner as for the experimental data 20 u c p ϕ max ϕ min n c where n c denotes the number of periods included in the analysis fig 4 shows the signal of vertical force acting on the deck for wave 6 for every wave case 20 wave periods are simulated where the last 14 are used in the analysis to avoid initial transient effects numerical discretisation uncertainties calculated with the vertical force on deck are summarised in table 4 for all wave cases where f 0 max denotes the estimated exact solution corresponding to ϕ 0 in eq 12 of vertical force peak f max while i 0 denotes the estimated exact solution for the force integral i e force impulse f max and i are calculated as 21 f max i 1 n c f i max n c 22 i i 1 n c 0 t f i t d t n c where f i max denotes the force peak for period i while t denotes the wave period in table 4 u c d f and u c d i denote the discretisation uncertainty for force peak f max and force impulse i respectively uncertainties show large differences from one wave case to another however they remain below 10 for most items and go as low as 0 03 the outliers are wave 4 and 6 with uncertainties higher than 10 4 3 results as stated earlier two sets of results are compared within this study the average pressure peak during one period 23 p max i 1 n c p i max n c where p i max denotes the pressure peak during i th wave period the average pressure time integral over one wave period 24 p i 1 n c 0 t p i t d t n c although the pressure peak that occurs during green sea event is an obvious quantity for comparison it is not necessarily relevant for the structural response if the pressure peak lasts a very short amount of time it will not influence the structural response on the other hand it is a known fact that in numerical simulations high pressure peaks can occur when a free surface impacts against a solid boundary hence to provide a more complete comparison the pressure integral in time is also compared fig 5 shows an example of the pressure signal in time measured by gauge 7 for wave 9 where extremely transient pressure peaks can be seen large differences in pressure peaks increase the periodic pressure peak uncertainty which is observed in the results shown below however the integral of pressure in time is not sensitive to high transient peaks for gauges further away from the wall pressure peaks are less prominent as shown in fig 6 where gauge 1 pressure signal is shown for the same wave case in order to accurately capture the total pressure at the horizontal deck during a complete wave period it is necessary to capture the thinnest layer of water that can occur during the wave recession from the deck in order to achieve that at least one cell centre is needed between the free surface and deck at all times it can be observed in table 2 that different cell sizes are used at the deck for different wave cases the minimum depth of water on deck depends on wave amplitude and period waves with shorter period give a smaller amount of time for the water to pour down from the deck similarly larger wave amplitude implies more water on deck fig 7 sequentially shows one period of a green sea event for wave 3 where the thin layer of water can be seen after the collapse of water run up against the wall 4 3 1 influence of the domain size as stated earlier breadth and depth of the domain were reduced with respect to experimental setup in order to reduce the number of cells the breadth was reduced from 8 to 3 m while the depth of 1 m is used instead of 3 5 m depth was reduced by prescribing the incident wave velocity at the bottom boundary hence the wave diffraction effects were neglected from this depth on breadth was reduced where similar boundary condition is imposed relaxation zones were prescribed near the side boundaries in order to eliminate diffracted waves and prevent reflection in order to test the validity of these assumptions and to assess their influence on pressure results two additional tests are performed with different domain breadth and depth tests are performed for one wave only on the coarsest refinement level wave 7 case is used for this comparison for two reasons it is in the group of longest waves where limited depth could have the greatest influence and because it exhibited poorest agreement with the experiment as shown below hence if these assumptions are not valid an improvement in result quality should be exhibited the first test is performed by increasing the breadth of the computational domain from 3 to 6 m while keeping the rest of the dimensions fixed side boundary conditions and size of the relaxation zones are not changed in the second test the depth is increased from 1 m to 3 5 m corresponding to the experimental setup in this case the velocity boundary condition on the bottom is changed from incident wave velocity to non slip non permeable wall boundary condition fig 8 shows the comparison of the three cfd results and experimental results for pressure peaks results denoted with cfd correspond to the original setup used in this study obtained on the coarsest refinement level the remaining two cfd results are denoted with the changed dimension with respect to the original setup the influence of the domain size is almost none for most wave gauges except for gauge 7 and 8 where a very small change is observed fig 9 shows the comparison for pressure integrals the variation of the domain size had a negligible influence on the pressure integrals for all gauges hence the simplifications made to reduce the number of cells had no influence on the results and are justified 4 3 2 pressure peaks the comparison of pressure peak results with corresponding uncertainties are shown in figs 10 18 complete results with uncertainties are given in tabular form in sec a 1 the average value of the pressure peak is denoted on the y axis while the x axis denotes the index of the pressure gauge as indicated in fig 1 the error bars present the total numerical and experimental uncertainties eq 19 and eq 10 respectively cfd stands for the result obtained using the present numerical methods while efd stands for experimental fluid dynamics results for wave 1 are presented in fig 10 relative differences between the results are considerable however the absolute difference is not large since the pressure load for this case is small the uncertainties are similar for most gauges except for a few where experimental results exhibit higher uncertainties this wave case has the smallest amplitude requiring higher mesh resolution pressure peaks for wave 2 shown in fig 11 show similar agreement as wave 1 with slightly larger numerical uncertainties for wave 3 results in fig 12 show good agreement with experimental results for eight out of nine gauges the uncertainty intervals overlap and the trend is very well captured wave 4 shows good agreement in fig 13 where uncertainty intervals overlap for all gauges while the uncertainties are similar between the numerical and experimental result for wave 5 pressure peaks in fig 14 correspond well to experimental data with gauge 8 and 9 showing larger discrepancies gauge 7 8 and 9 are located close to the wall where the most violent flow occurs making the pressure in that area more challenging to predict and increasing the periodic uncertainties for wave 6 both experimental and numerical results shown in fig 15 predict considerably higher pressure peaks for gauge 7 near the wall than the gauges further from the wall results agree well for gauges further from the wall however significant over estimation is observed for gauges 7 and 8 as well as high uncertainties the high uncertainties for gauges 7 and 8 are the consequence of extremely transient pressure peaks in the numerical result as shown in fig 5 for this case numerical uncertainties are relatively large for all gauges due to high grid uncertainties as shown in table a6 unlike other cases results for wave 7 show significant underestimation when comparing to the experimental data as shown in fig 16 the trends however are well captured the uncertainties are generally smaller than experimental uncertainties except for gauges 7 and 8 for wave 8 the results shown in fig 17 show good agreement with the experiment with low uncertainties where gauge 7 stands out with higher uncertainties in this case as for wave 7 the pressure peaks are underestimated but the difference is significantly smaller as in majority of cases the trend is well captured wave 9 exhibits good agreement for gauges further from the wall as shown on fig 18 whereas gauges next to the wall show over prediction with larger uncertainties originating mostly from periodic uncertainties see table a9 the over prediction might also be related to compressibility effects which will be investigated in the future 4 3 3 pressure integrals the comparison of integrals of pressure in time for all wave cases is shown in figs 19 27 complete results with uncertainties are given in tabular form in sec a 2 same as for the pressure peaks the x axis on the graphs denotes the pressure gauge label while integral of pressure p is shown on the y axis the numerical results of pressure integrals for wave 1 shown in fig 19 exhibit very low uncertainties while the agreement with experimental results is similar as for pressure peaks for wave 2 results in fig 20 show that the trend is well captured while the values are somewhat underestimated numerical uncertainties are similar for all gauges in fig 21 pressure integrals for wave 3 show good agreement with the experiment with smaller uncertainties for experimental measurements for this wave case pressure peaks show better agreement than the time integrals which are generally underestimated for wave 4 good agreement is achieved as indicated in fig 22 with higher numerical uncertainties comparing to the experiment the high numerical uncertainties originate from discretisation uncertainties while periodic uncertainty has a minor contribution see table a13 for wave 5 fig 23 shows good agreement with overlapping uncertainty intervals except for gauge 7 and 9 numerical uncertainties are generally smaller than experimental for this case in fig 24 uncertainty intervals for wave 6 are overlapping for nine out of ten gauges the only outlier being gauge 9 same as for pressure peaks for this wave case numerical uncertainties are larger than experimental due to large grid uncertainty as for pressure peaks wave 7 exhibits considerable under estimation for pressure integrals shown in fig 25 with small uncertainties and good prediction of the trend the consistent underestimation of pressure in this case should be investigated from both numerical and experimental side the difference might be caused by transversal reflection occurring in the experiment due to finite tank breadth which is not present in the numerical simulation also compressibility effects may influence the results hence the effect of compressibility will be investigated in the future wave 8 again shows good trend agreement and low uncertainties in fig 26 however the values are underestimated larger difference is observed in this case than for pressure peaks for wave 9 shown in fig 27 the trend is well captured with lower numerical uncertainties than experimental results unlike pressure peaks here the values are underestimated for most gauges except gauge number 10 4 4 discussion overall the results for both pressure peaks and integrals exhibit good agreement with the experimental data pressure peaks compare better with experiments for pressure gauges further from the wall where the influence of water impingement is smaller however for waves 1 to 5 the peaks are well predicted even close to the wall with acceptable uncertainties while waves 6 to 9 exhibit higher uncertainties and deviations for pressure gauge 7 which is next to the wall and at the centre line wave 6 shows very large deviation and uncertainty for gauge 8 which is an outlier in the results and should be investigated for long waves i e 7 to 9 pressure peaks exhibit small uncertainties and well captured trends the results agree well with the experimental data for wave 8 and 9 while wave 7 shows significant under estimation pressure integrals are predicted well for all gauges for waves 1 to 6 where the uncertainty intervals overlap trends agree with experiments as well except for waves 1 and 4 where difference in trends is observed for waves 7 to 9 the uncertainties are very low and the trends are captured accurately however the values are significantly underestimated the under estimation is smaller for higher amplitudes i e wave 7 shows the largest difference this consistent underestimation of pressure for waves with λ 3 75 m will be investigated in the future the difference could indicate an inconsistency between the numerical simulations and experiments with regards to the wave elevation and reflection regarding wave steepness in individual cases no correlation can be seen in the graphs between trends of the curves discrepancies and wave steepness on the other hand the trends show similarities between waves with the same wave length while the wave height only influences the magnitude of pressure loads thus it can be concluded that wave celerity has a larger influence on the character of the green water event than wave steepness in this case overall summary of pressure peak and integral result comparison is given in table 5 for each wave the average absolute and relative difference between numerical and experimental result across all pressure gauges is given e denotes the difference of numerical and experimental result which is expressed in absolute values and in percentages relative to the experimental result where the indices p max and p stand for pressure peak and integral respectively for pressure peaks absolute difference ranges from 30 to 70 pa for wave cases 1 to 5 while the difference increases for waves 6 to 9 ranging from 130 to 250 pa however the relative differences show smaller variation except for wave 7 where larger discrepancies occur average relative difference for pressure peaks for all cases is 21 pressure integrals show smaller relative differences with the average difference across all wave cases of 18 from the practical engineering point of view the differences for small waves 1 2 and 3 are of smaller importance due to the small absolute value of pressure loads on the other hand larger differences for waves 6 and 7 should be investigated further since these would have a larger influence on the structural design due to higher absolute pressure loads 4 5 influence of the interface advection method to compare the performance of the isoadvector method for interface advection an additional simulation is carried out for wave 9 where conventional algebraic vof method is used with interface compression rusche 2002 fig 28 shows the pressure peak results for wave 9 where in addition to experimental and numerical results the numerical results with conventional algebraic vof are given fig 29 presents the comparison of the temporal integral of pressure note that in these graphs only the periodic uncertainty is included for numerical results since the refinement study has not been performed with the algebraic vof method the results are similar for pressure peaks except for pressure gauges 7 and 8 where higher values are obtained with the algebraic vof pressure integral results agree well between the two simulations however the algebraic vof exhibits slightly larger underestimation with respect to the experimental data fig 30 sequentially shows a visual comparison of volume fraction field α for simulation where isoadvector and algebraic vof are used with isoadvector the interface is confined within a single cell even when very violent free surface flow occurs with algebraic vof the interface is smeared and the geometry of the free surface is described less precisely being a more complex method isoadvector requires a larger number of operations comparing to the algebraic vof hence an increase in cpu time is expected both simulations are performed using 24 cores on intel xeon processor e5 2637 v3 simulation with the algebraic vof took 37 5 h while the simulation using isoadvector took 45 h to compute hence an increased cost of 20 is exhibited in this case note that the increase in computational cost depends on the cost of the pressure velocity coupling algorithm used in the solution procedure 5 conclusion a comprehensive set of numerical simulations of green sea loads have been conducted using the fv based cfd software called naval hydro pack which is based on foam extend the ghost fluid method is applied for discretisation of the free surface boundary conditions while the geometric isoadvector method is used for interface capturing all results are compared to experimental data in order to validate the present method for green sea load calculation a case of a static simplified fpso model is used with a breakwater on deck with regular incident waves nine wave cases are analysed with varying amplitude and steepness where the pressure at ten locations on deck is measured uncertainties are assessed for both experimental and numerical data yielding a comprehensive comparison detailed uncertainty analysis of numerical results is performed via grid and time step resolution study as well as periodic uncertainty analysis compared pressure related quantities are the average pressure peak and time integral of pressure during the wave period comparison of pressure peaks shows good overall agreement with comparable uncertainties between experimental and numerical data trends of peak pressure across pressure gauges agree well with experiments for seven out of nine wave cases where the two smallest waves wave 1 and 2 showed some discrepancy values and uncertainty intervals overlap for the majority of pressure gauges for waves 3 4 5 6 and 9 waves 1 and 2 show reasonable agreement while waves 7 and 8 show underestimation of experimental results for temporal pressure integrals trends are well captured for waves 2 3 5 6 7 8 and 9 while waves 1 and 4 show slightly different trends values correspond well for waves 1 3 4 5 and 6 while integrals for wave 2 and 9 are slightly underestimated waves 7 and 8 show larger underestimation which requires further investigation on both numerical and experimental side overall results show reasonable accuracy and high level of confidence comparable uncertainty between numerical and experimental results show that similar precision can be expected in terms of pressure on deck future work will involve prediction of realistic green sea loads for offshore objects in

23703,an extensive verification and validation for green sea load simulations is presented the calculations are performed using the naval hydro pack a library based on foam extend which is an open source computational fluid dynamics software the geometric volume of fluid method is used for interface advection while the ghost fluid method is employed to discretise the free surface boundary conditions at the interface pressure measured at the deck of a fixed structure is compared to experimental data for nine regular waves verification is performed using four refinement levels in order to reliably assess numerical uncertainties a detailed uncertainty analysis comprises both numerical and experimental data comparable uncertainties are exhibited in simulations and experiments with good agreement of results keywords green sea loads regular waves cfd naval hydro pack vof 1 introduction in the field of offshore and marine engineering wave loading poses a wide range of different challenges which are important in the design process one of the more difficult wave related problems to describe and reliably estimate is the green sea load green sea or water on deck is a consequence of a highly nonlinear interaction between the floating structure and the free surface waves which comprise incident diffracted and radiated waves the complex origin of the phenomenon renders the prediction of green sea occurrence challenging apart from that violent two phase flow develops once the water is on the deck which is difficult to predict via simplified flow theories green sea effect cause both local and global structural loads which can endanger the structural integrity and therefore must be taken into account in the design process given the complexity of the problem experimental and numerical means are currently utilised to calculate green sea loads according to tamarel et al temarel et al 2016 both experimental and numerical methods available today are not mature to reliably assess green sea loads hence further research is needed to establish confidence in both fields as a result a wide variety of methods have been developed and applied in recent years greco et al 2012 used the numerical solver developed by greco and lugni 2012 to calculate wave loads on a patrol ship including green sea loads with comparison to experiments lu et al 2012 developed a time domain numerical method based on finite volume fv method used for green sea load simulations xu 2013 used smoothed particle hydrodynamics to simulate breaking waves plunging onto a deck zhao et al 2014 studied the influence of structure motion on the pressure loads due to green sea effects using a fv based method kim et al 2013 used a linear method for assessing the ship motion and a nonlinear viscous method to calculate green sea loads on a container vessel ruggeri et al 2013 used wamit software based on the potential flow model and a viscous fv code starccm to devise guidelines for green sea load calculations joga et al 2014 compared two viscous fv codes with experimental results of water ingress into open ship holds during green sea events pakozdi et al 2014 coupled a potential flow based method and a viscous model to conduct simulations of green sea events zhu et al 2009 conducted numerical simulations of green sea events for a floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel in this work a detailed validation study of green sea loads on a static structure is conducted experimental results published by lee et al 2012 are used for the comparison nine regular wave cases are investigated including the uncertainty analysis of numerical and experimental results naval hydro software pack is used for numerical simulations which is an extension of the collocated fv based cfd open source software foam extend weller et al 1998 jasak 2009 the naval hydro package is specialised for viscous two phase large scale flows nonlinear stream function regular wave theory by rienecker and fenton 1981 is used for wave generation the potential wave flow and cfd are coupled in a one way fashion using implicit relaxation zones jasak et al 2015 by imposing the wave solution at the boundaries of the domain and gradually transitioning to the nonlinear cfd solution towards the middle of the domain the interface is captured using the volume of fluid vof method where a novel geometric approach developed by roenby et al 2016 is employed called isoadvector free surface boundary conditions are discretised using the ghost fluid method gfm vukčević 2016 providing a infinitesimally sharp pressure and density gradient distribution at the interface the aim of this paper is to assess the accuracy and feasibility of a modern naval hydrodynamics cfd software for predicting green sea loads in order to reduce the possible sources of error to a minimum a simple static geometry is analysed with publicly available experimental results lee et al 2012 since numerical simulations of wave induced motions and loads have been validated using the naval hydro package in the past vukčević 2016 vukčević et al 2015 2016 jasak et al 2014 green sea load validation is the missing piece for conducting complete numerical simulations with moving bodies where green sea loads are calculated this paper is organised as follows in the second chapter the numerical method is outlined the third chapter gives basic information about experimental measurements that are used for comparison in the fourth chapter the numerical simulations of green sea loads are described in detail including the simulation set up uncertainty analysis procedure and comparison of the results with the experiments finally a brief conclusion is given 2 numerical model in this section the numerical model used in this work is presented governing equations describing two phase incompressible and viscous flow are 1 u 0 2 u t uu ν u 1 ρ p d where u denotes the velocity field ν stands for the kinematic viscosity of the corresponding phase ρ is the density while p d stands for dynamic pressure 3 p d p ρ g x here p is the absolute pressure g is the gravitational acceleration while x denotes the radii vector note that the momentum equation has been divided through by the density assuming a two phase free surface system of incompressible immiscible fluids eq 1 and eq 2 are discretised in collocated fv fashion yielding the pressure and momentum equation vukčević et al 2017 respectively the equations are solved implicitly eq 2 is valid for both phases where the discontinuity of dynamic pressure and density at the interface is taken into account with the gfm vukčević 2016 vukčević et al 2017 the dynamic pressure and density jump conditions are a consequence of normal stress balance at the free surface the tangential stress balance is modelled approximately while the surface tension is neglected the two jump conditions arising from the normal stress balance are 4 p d p d ρ ρ g x 5 1 ρ p d 1 ρ p d 0 superscripts and denote the water and air phase respectively eq 4 states that the jump of dynamic pressure across the interface is proportional to the jump in density while eq 5 states that the jump of specific dynamic pressure gradient is zero the jump conditions are introduced into the discretisation via specialised discretisation schemes ensuring that eq 4 and eq 5 are satisfied the reader is referred to vukčević et al 2017 for details in order to advect the interface a geometric vof method called isoavector roenby et al 2016 is used standard advection equation is used in order to transport the volume fraction variable α 6 α t α u 0 written for a finite control volume p and discretised in time using the first order accurate euler method eq 6 states 7 v p α p t δ t α p t d v t t δ t s p α n u d s d τ where v p is the volume of the control volume p s p is the closed boundary surface of the control volume n is the unit normal vector of the boundary surface while τ denotes the time integration variable for a surface boundary discretised with a finite number of faces the closed surface integral is replaced with a sum of surface integrals across the faces 8 v p α p t δ t α p t f t t δ t s f α n f u d s f d τ where f denotes the face index the volume integral of the temporal term is discretised assuming a second order accurate fv method jasak 1996 instead of evaluating the temporal and surface integrals in eq 8 by employing conventional discretisation schemes in the isoadvector method they are integrated explicitly directly from the information about the moving iso surface of the volume fraction representing the interface through a polyhedral cell in this way sub grid resolution is achieved for interface advection this results in a sharp interface and bounded volume fraction field the reader is directed to roenby et al 2016 for more details on the isoadvector method 2 1 wave modelling regular waves are imposed into the cfd domain via implicit relaxation zones jasak et al 2015 relaxation zones are regions in the computational domain where the theoretical wave solution is imposed by smoothly transitioning to the calculated cfd solution the same method is used to dampen the waves at the outlet where the cfd solution is gradually replaced by the imposed solution the incident wave in this case a stream function wave model rienecker and fenton 1981 is used which is fully nonlinear permitting a shorter cfd domain since the wave nonlinearities are resolved outside of the cfd domain 3 green sea experiments the experimental tests were performed in the towing tank of seoul national university with the details and results published in lee et al 2012 a simplified model of a fpso vessel is used where three different bow shape configurations are tested the computations in this work are performed for one of the geometries called rect0 in the original paper lee et al 2012 the structure is static in order to reduce the number of possible sources of error when comparing the results ten pressure gauges are positioned at the deck of the model the geometry of the model and position of pressure gauges are shown in fig 1 a vertical wall is positioned at the deck to simulate the breakwater pressure data is measured for nine incident wave cases with wave parameters shown in table 1 pressure gauges are labelled as indicated in fig 1 in a separate figure for clarity in lee et al 2012 detailed experimental results are presented for pressure peaks of individual gauges the reported values are average pressure peaks over 35 incident wave periods maximum and minimum values of peaks are also reported enabling the assessment of periodic uncertainty however from the elastic structural response point of view the integral of force i e pressure is more relevant than extremely short force peaks for that reason additional post processing of raw experimental data is performed in order to establish the average pressure time integral in one wave period as well as maximum and minimum values the total experimental uncertainties are calculated as the superposition of measuring uncertainties bias and precision limit of pressure gauges and of periodic uncertainty of the pressure peak or pressure integral in time the bias and precision limit are stated in lee et al 2012 periodic uncertainty is calculated as 9 u e p ϕ max ϕ min n e where ϕ denotes an arbitrary measured item in one wave period such as pressure peak or pressure integral while n e stands for the number of periods included in the analysis ϕ max and ϕ min are the maximum and minimum values measured during n e periods total experimental uncertainty is then 10 u e t u e m 2 u e p 2 where u e m stands for measuring uncertainties comprised of bias and precision limit of the pressure gauges 4 green sea simulations in this section the simulations of green sea loading are presented first the simulation setup is described in detail followed by a brief description of the numerical uncertainty analysis used in this work second the results are shown where first a sensitivity study is performed regarding domain size in order to justify the reduction of the domain size described below next the results are compared to experimental data followed by a short discussion finally another sensitivity study is performed regarding the interface capturing method where the isoadvector method is compared to the conventional algebraic vof method rusche 2002 4 1 simulation setup simulations have been performed for all wave cases for geometry rect0 with vertical stem four grids are used for each wave case in order to establish the numerical uncertainty while the results from the finest grid are used as reference results for the comparison fig 2 shows the computational domain for wave 4 as an example with indicated boundaries the wall on the deck is simulated as a domain boundary hence the deck of the model is not included beyond the wall it is assumed that this simplification does not influence the flow on the deck despite the symmetry of the computational domain with respect to the longitudinal plane the violent flow occurring on deck during the green water phenomenon is not necessarily symmetric hence the full domain is simulated as opposed to only half the characteristics of fine grids for all wave cases are presented in table 2 here l is the domain length while l r indicates the length of inlet and outlet relaxation zones λ δ x and a δ z denote the number of cells per wave length and wave amplitude respectively h denotes the height of the domain above the deck in metres where different heights are used depending on the wave amplitude and expected wave run up against the wall the freeboard height is 0 045 m above the free surface lee et al 2012 δ z d e c k denotes the height of the cell above the deck at certain height from the deck the cell height is linearly increased towards the top boundary in order to reduce the number of cells also the cell size is reduced linearly in the horizontal direction from the inlet boundary towards the structure hence λ δ x is measured next to the structure fig 3 shows the computational grid in the longitudinal central plane and on the surface of the structure used for wave 4 note that the coarse grid is presented for better visibility of grid lines the simple geometry of the structure enables fully structured and orthogonal grids to be generated depth and breadth of the domain are constant for all wave cases where the depth is d 1 m and breadth b 3 m it should be noted here that the depth of the wave tank in the experiments was 3 5 m however only 1 m is included in the simulation in order to save computational time to avoid influence of this simplification wave velocity from the stream function wave theory is prescribed at the bottom in order to make it transparent to the flow this treatment assumes that the diffracted wave field is negligible at the depth of 1 m similarly the breadth is also reduced from 8 to 3 m with relaxation zones near the starboard and portside boundaries preventing reflection of the diffracted wave field considering the violent free surface flows at the deck and the explicit nature of the isoadvector method the time step is adjusted during the simulation to maintain a maximum fixed courant fredrich lewy cfl number of c o 0 75 the same c o is used in all simulations and on all grids which results in consistent time step variation on different grids for reference average time step for wave 1 on fine grid is 0 0006 s while for wave 9 it is 0 001 s as indicated in fig 1 the circular pressure gauges are 18 mm in diameter cells used on the deck are rectangular where the horizontal dimensions of the cell which correspond to the spatial discretisation of the deck surface ranges from 4 to 13 mm depending on the grid hence the deck surface discretisation resolution is always higher compared to the area of the pressure gauge used in the experiment as stated in lee et al 2012 the sampling rate of pressure gauges used in the experiment is 5 khz corresponding to a time step of 0 0002 s which is comparable to time steps used in the simulations no turbulence modelling is used in this work since it can be considered to have a negligible influence on pressure distribution at the structure moreover the pressure and velocity gradients in the flow on deck are extremely violent rendering standard single phase wall bounded models inapplicable the influence of turbulence should however be investigated in the future 4 2 uncertainty analysis the total numerical uncertainty is dominated by discretisation and periodic uncertainty since the iterative uncertainty is kept low by using sufficient number of nonlinear correctors per time step and converging linear systems to a tight tolerance 10 9 in order to assess the discretisation uncertainty a grid and time step refinement uncertainty study is performed with the least squares approach developed by eca hoekstra eça and hoekstra 2014 in case of unsteady flow the time step has to be varied as well as the grid resolution eça and hoekstra 2008 in this work the time step is reduced simultaneously with the cell size by maintaining a fixed cfl number for the least squares approach at least four refinement levels are needed in order to calculate the uncertainty constant refinement ratio of r 2 is used for all wave cases which is defined as the ratio between spatial and temporal resolution between adjacent refinement levels r h i 1 h i τ i 1 τ i where h i stands for the representative cell size of refinement level i while τ i stands for the time step since c o changes linearly with the cell size τ also varies linearly hence the condition r τ i 1 τ i is satisfied table 3 lists the number of cells for all grids and wave cases all simulations were performed on processors intel xeon e5 2637 v3 15m cache 3 50 ghz cpu time per wave period on eight cores for the coarse grid ranges between 1 3 and 1 9 h while on the fine grid it ranges from 7 3 to 15 6 h depending on the wave case according to eca hoekstra eça and hoekstra 2014 the uncertainty assessment begins with assessing the error of discretisation 11 ε i α h i p h i τ i h i 2 1 3 using the least squares fit here α is an unknown constant and p is the obtained order of accuracy the least squares fit is obtained by minimising the following function 12 s ϕ 0 α p i 1 n ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p 2 where ϕ 0 denotes the estimate of the exact solution while n denotes the number of refinement levels minimisation of eq 12 leads to a nonlinear system of equations which needs to be solved iteratively in case the observed order of accuracy p is larger than two the first or second order terms are used i e the following are solved 13 ε 1 i α h i ε 2 i α h i 2 and the fit with smaller standard deviation is used if p 0 5 first and second order terms are retained in addition to eq 13 14 ε 12 i α 1 h i α 2 h i 2 where the fit with the smallest standard deviation is used standard deviation is calculated as 15 σ i 1 n ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p 2 n 3 once ε ϕ 0 and σ are known the uncertainty of the result can be established if the data is well behaved the following expression is used for assessing the refinement uncertainty 16 u i f s ε i σ ϕ i ϕ f i t where f s is the safety factor while ϕ f i t presents the least squares fitted value of the solution for grid i the data is well behaved if σ δ where δ expresses the data range 17 δ ϕ max ϕ min n 1 where ϕ max and ϕ min represent the maximum and minimum value from all refinement levels in case the data is not well behaved i e σ δ the uncertainty is assessed as 18 u i 3 σ δ ε i σ ϕ i ϕ f i t in this work the uncertainty is assessed for the finest refinement level i e in the above expressions i 4 since the discretisation uncertainty study theoretically requires a smooth variable in time the uncertainty is assessed for the vertical force exerted on the deck i e the spatial integral of pressure instead of the pressure measured at gauge locations total computational uncertainty is assessed as the superposition of the discretisation and periodic uncertainty 19 u c t u c d 2 u c p 2 where u c d denotes the discretisation uncertainty established using eq 16 or eq 18 while u c p represents the periodic uncertainty calculated in the same manner as for the experimental data 20 u c p ϕ max ϕ min n c where n c denotes the number of periods included in the analysis fig 4 shows the signal of vertical force acting on the deck for wave 6 for every wave case 20 wave periods are simulated where the last 14 are used in the analysis to avoid initial transient effects numerical discretisation uncertainties calculated with the vertical force on deck are summarised in table 4 for all wave cases where f 0 max denotes the estimated exact solution corresponding to ϕ 0 in eq 12 of vertical force peak f max while i 0 denotes the estimated exact solution for the force integral i e force impulse f max and i are calculated as 21 f max i 1 n c f i max n c 22 i i 1 n c 0 t f i t d t n c where f i max denotes the force peak for period i while t denotes the wave period in table 4 u c d f and u c d i denote the discretisation uncertainty for force peak f max and force impulse i respectively uncertainties show large differences from one wave case to another however they remain below 10 for most items and go as low as 0 03 the outliers are wave 4 and 6 with uncertainties higher than 10 4 3 results as stated earlier two sets of results are compared within this study the average pressure peak during one period 23 p max i 1 n c p i max n c where p i max denotes the pressure peak during i th wave period the average pressure time integral over one wave period 24 p i 1 n c 0 t p i t d t n c although the pressure peak that occurs during green sea event is an obvious quantity for comparison it is not necessarily relevant for the structural response if the pressure peak lasts a very short amount of time it will not influence the structural response on the other hand it is a known fact that in numerical simulations high pressure peaks can occur when a free surface impacts against a solid boundary hence to provide a more complete comparison the pressure integral in time is also compared fig 5 shows an example of the pressure signal in time measured by gauge 7 for wave 9 where extremely transient pressure peaks can be seen large differences in pressure peaks increase the periodic pressure peak uncertainty which is observed in the results shown below however the integral of pressure in time is not sensitive to high transient peaks for gauges further away from the wall pressure peaks are less prominent as shown in fig 6 where gauge 1 pressure signal is shown for the same wave case in order to accurately capture the total pressure at the horizontal deck during a complete wave period it is necessary to capture the thinnest layer of water that can occur during the wave recession from the deck in order to achieve that at least one cell centre is needed between the free surface and deck at all times it can be observed in table 2 that different cell sizes are used at the deck for different wave cases the minimum depth of water on deck depends on wave amplitude and period waves with shorter period give a smaller amount of time for the water to pour down from the deck similarly larger wave amplitude implies more water on deck fig 7 sequentially shows one period of a green sea event for wave 3 where the thin layer of water can be seen after the collapse of water run up against the wall 4 3 1 influence of the domain size as stated earlier breadth and depth of the domain were reduced with respect to experimental setup in order to reduce the number of cells the breadth was reduced from 8 to 3 m while the depth of 1 m is used instead of 3 5 m depth was reduced by prescribing the incident wave velocity at the bottom boundary hence the wave diffraction effects were neglected from this depth on breadth was reduced where similar boundary condition is imposed relaxation zones were prescribed near the side boundaries in order to eliminate diffracted waves and prevent reflection in order to test the validity of these assumptions and to assess their influence on pressure results two additional tests are performed with different domain breadth and depth tests are performed for one wave only on the coarsest refinement level wave 7 case is used for this comparison for two reasons it is in the group of longest waves where limited depth could have the greatest influence and because it exhibited poorest agreement with the experiment as shown below hence if these assumptions are not valid an improvement in result quality should be exhibited the first test is performed by increasing the breadth of the computational domain from 3 to 6 m while keeping the rest of the dimensions fixed side boundary conditions and size of the relaxation zones are not changed in the second test the depth is increased from 1 m to 3 5 m corresponding to the experimental setup in this case the velocity boundary condition on the bottom is changed from incident wave velocity to non slip non permeable wall boundary condition fig 8 shows the comparison of the three cfd results and experimental results for pressure peaks results denoted with cfd correspond to the original setup used in this study obtained on the coarsest refinement level the remaining two cfd results are denoted with the changed dimension with respect to the original setup the influence of the domain size is almost none for most wave gauges except for gauge 7 and 8 where a very small change is observed fig 9 shows the comparison for pressure integrals the variation of the domain size had a negligible influence on the pressure integrals for all gauges hence the simplifications made to reduce the number of cells had no influence on the results and are justified 4 3 2 pressure peaks the comparison of pressure peak results with corresponding uncertainties are shown in figs 10 18 complete results with uncertainties are given in tabular form in sec a 1 the average value of the pressure peak is denoted on the y axis while the x axis denotes the index of the pressure gauge as indicated in fig 1 the error bars present the total numerical and experimental uncertainties eq 19 and eq 10 respectively cfd stands for the result obtained using the present numerical methods while efd stands for experimental fluid dynamics results for wave 1 are presented in fig 10 relative differences between the results are considerable however the absolute difference is not large since the pressure load for this case is small the uncertainties are similar for most gauges except for a few where experimental results exhibit higher uncertainties this wave case has the smallest amplitude requiring higher mesh resolution pressure peaks for wave 2 shown in fig 11 show similar agreement as wave 1 with slightly larger numerical uncertainties for wave 3 results in fig 12 show good agreement with experimental results for eight out of nine gauges the uncertainty intervals overlap and the trend is very well captured wave 4 shows good agreement in fig 13 where uncertainty intervals overlap for all gauges while the uncertainties are similar between the numerical and experimental result for wave 5 pressure peaks in fig 14 correspond well to experimental data with gauge 8 and 9 showing larger discrepancies gauge 7 8 and 9 are located close to the wall where the most violent flow occurs making the pressure in that area more challenging to predict and increasing the periodic uncertainties for wave 6 both experimental and numerical results shown in fig 15 predict considerably higher pressure peaks for gauge 7 near the wall than the gauges further from the wall results agree well for gauges further from the wall however significant over estimation is observed for gauges 7 and 8 as well as high uncertainties the high uncertainties for gauges 7 and 8 are the consequence of extremely transient pressure peaks in the numerical result as shown in fig 5 for this case numerical uncertainties are relatively large for all gauges due to high grid uncertainties as shown in table a6 unlike other cases results for wave 7 show significant underestimation when comparing to the experimental data as shown in fig 16 the trends however are well captured the uncertainties are generally smaller than experimental uncertainties except for gauges 7 and 8 for wave 8 the results shown in fig 17 show good agreement with the experiment with low uncertainties where gauge 7 stands out with higher uncertainties in this case as for wave 7 the pressure peaks are underestimated but the difference is significantly smaller as in majority of cases the trend is well captured wave 9 exhibits good agreement for gauges further from the wall as shown on fig 18 whereas gauges next to the wall show over prediction with larger uncertainties originating mostly from periodic uncertainties see table a9 the over prediction might also be related to compressibility effects which will be investigated in the future 4 3 3 pressure integrals the comparison of integrals of pressure in time for all wave cases is shown in figs 19 27 complete results with uncertainties are given in tabular form in sec a 2 same as for the pressure peaks the x axis on the graphs denotes the pressure gauge label while integral of pressure p is shown on the y axis the numerical results of pressure integrals for wave 1 shown in fig 19 exhibit very low uncertainties while the agreement with experimental results is similar as for pressure peaks for wave 2 results in fig 20 show that the trend is well captured while the values are somewhat underestimated numerical uncertainties are similar for all gauges in fig 21 pressure integrals for wave 3 show good agreement with the experiment with smaller uncertainties for experimental measurements for this wave case pressure peaks show better agreement than the time integrals which are generally underestimated for wave 4 good agreement is achieved as indicated in fig 22 with higher numerical uncertainties comparing to the experiment the high numerical uncertainties originate from discretisation uncertainties while periodic uncertainty has a minor contribution see table a13 for wave 5 fig 23 shows good agreement with overlapping uncertainty intervals except for gauge 7 and 9 numerical uncertainties are generally smaller than experimental for this case in fig 24 uncertainty intervals for wave 6 are overlapping for nine out of ten gauges the only outlier being gauge 9 same as for pressure peaks for this wave case numerical uncertainties are larger than experimental due to large grid uncertainty as for pressure peaks wave 7 exhibits considerable under estimation for pressure integrals shown in fig 25 with small uncertainties and good prediction of the trend the consistent underestimation of pressure in this case should be investigated from both numerical and experimental side the difference might be caused by transversal reflection occurring in the experiment due to finite tank breadth which is not present in the numerical simulation also compressibility effects may influence the results hence the effect of compressibility will be investigated in the future wave 8 again shows good trend agreement and low uncertainties in fig 26 however the values are underestimated larger difference is observed in this case than for pressure peaks for wave 9 shown in fig 27 the trend is well captured with lower numerical uncertainties than experimental results unlike pressure peaks here the values are underestimated for most gauges except gauge number 10 4 4 discussion overall the results for both pressure peaks and integrals exhibit good agreement with the experimental data pressure peaks compare better with experiments for pressure gauges further from the wall where the influence of water impingement is smaller however for waves 1 to 5 the peaks are well predicted even close to the wall with acceptable uncertainties while waves 6 to 9 exhibit higher uncertainties and deviations for pressure gauge 7 which is next to the wall and at the centre line wave 6 shows very large deviation and uncertainty for gauge 8 which is an outlier in the results and should be investigated for long waves i e 7 to 9 pressure peaks exhibit small uncertainties and well captured trends the results agree well with the experimental data for wave 8 and 9 while wave 7 shows significant under estimation pressure integrals are predicted well for all gauges for waves 1 to 6 where the uncertainty intervals overlap trends agree with experiments as well except for waves 1 and 4 where difference in trends is observed for waves 7 to 9 the uncertainties are very low and the trends are captured accurately however the values are significantly underestimated the under estimation is smaller for higher amplitudes i e wave 7 shows the largest difference this consistent underestimation of pressure for waves with λ 3 75 m will be investigated in the future the difference could indicate an inconsistency between the numerical simulations and experiments with regards to the wave elevation and reflection regarding wave steepness in individual cases no correlation can be seen in the graphs between trends of the curves discrepancies and wave steepness on the other hand the trends show similarities between waves with the same wave length while the wave height only influences the magnitude of pressure loads thus it can be concluded that wave celerity has a larger influence on the character of the green water event than wave steepness in this case overall summary of pressure peak and integral result comparison is given in table 5 for each wave the average absolute and relative difference between numerical and experimental result across all pressure gauges is given e denotes the difference of numerical and experimental result which is expressed in absolute values and in percentages relative to the experimental result where the indices p max and p stand for pressure peak and integral respectively for pressure peaks absolute difference ranges from 30 to 70 pa for wave cases 1 to 5 while the difference increases for waves 6 to 9 ranging from 130 to 250 pa however the relative differences show smaller variation except for wave 7 where larger discrepancies occur average relative difference for pressure peaks for all cases is 21 pressure integrals show smaller relative differences with the average difference across all wave cases of 18 from the practical engineering point of view the differences for small waves 1 2 and 3 are of smaller importance due to the small absolute value of pressure loads on the other hand larger differences for waves 6 and 7 should be investigated further since these would have a larger influence on the structural design due to higher absolute pressure loads 4 5 influence of the interface advection method to compare the performance of the isoadvector method for interface advection an additional simulation is carried out for wave 9 where conventional algebraic vof method is used with interface compression rusche 2002 fig 28 shows the pressure peak results for wave 9 where in addition to experimental and numerical results the numerical results with conventional algebraic vof are given fig 29 presents the comparison of the temporal integral of pressure note that in these graphs only the periodic uncertainty is included for numerical results since the refinement study has not been performed with the algebraic vof method the results are similar for pressure peaks except for pressure gauges 7 and 8 where higher values are obtained with the algebraic vof pressure integral results agree well between the two simulations however the algebraic vof exhibits slightly larger underestimation with respect to the experimental data fig 30 sequentially shows a visual comparison of volume fraction field α for simulation where isoadvector and algebraic vof are used with isoadvector the interface is confined within a single cell even when very violent free surface flow occurs with algebraic vof the interface is smeared and the geometry of the free surface is described less precisely being a more complex method isoadvector requires a larger number of operations comparing to the algebraic vof hence an increase in cpu time is expected both simulations are performed using 24 cores on intel xeon processor e5 2637 v3 simulation with the algebraic vof took 37 5 h while the simulation using isoadvector took 45 h to compute hence an increased cost of 20 is exhibited in this case note that the increase in computational cost depends on the cost of the pressure velocity coupling algorithm used in the solution procedure 5 conclusion a comprehensive set of numerical simulations of green sea loads have been conducted using the fv based cfd software called naval hydro pack which is based on foam extend the ghost fluid method is applied for discretisation of the free surface boundary conditions while the geometric isoadvector method is used for interface capturing all results are compared to experimental data in order to validate the present method for green sea load calculation a case of a static simplified fpso model is used with a breakwater on deck with regular incident waves nine wave cases are analysed with varying amplitude and steepness where the pressure at ten locations on deck is measured uncertainties are assessed for both experimental and numerical data yielding a comprehensive comparison detailed uncertainty analysis of numerical results is performed via grid and time step resolution study as well as periodic uncertainty analysis compared pressure related quantities are the average pressure peak and time integral of pressure during the wave period comparison of pressure peaks shows good overall agreement with comparable uncertainties between experimental and numerical data trends of peak pressure across pressure gauges agree well with experiments for seven out of nine wave cases where the two smallest waves wave 1 and 2 showed some discrepancy values and uncertainty intervals overlap for the majority of pressure gauges for waves 3 4 5 6 and 9 waves 1 and 2 show reasonable agreement while waves 7 and 8 show underestimation of experimental results for temporal pressure integrals trends are well captured for waves 2 3 5 6 7 8 and 9 while waves 1 and 4 show slightly different trends values correspond well for waves 1 3 4 5 and 6 while integrals for wave 2 and 9 are slightly underestimated waves 7 and 8 show larger underestimation which requires further investigation on both numerical and experimental side overall results show reasonable accuracy and high level of confidence comparable uncertainty between numerical and experimental results show that similar precision can be expected in terms of pressure on deck future work will involve prediction of realistic green sea loads for offshore objects in

23704,innovative formulation of new algorithm s is still a great challenge in scientific research community for solving any real time non linear problems based on the above notion in this study the method of lines mol in addition with the newly introduced embedded rkarms 4 4 technique is adapted for numerical prediction of water levels owing to the interaction of tide and surge associated with a cyclone to perform the desired task initially a transformation is carried out to convert the vertically integrated shallow water equations in cartesian coordinates with boundary conditions into ordinary differential equations odes of initial valued which are solved by the rkarms 4 4 technique to attain results the model is specifically designed for the coast of bangladesh to incorporate coastal complexities along the region of interest with minimum cost one way nested models are used a stable tidal condition is generated applying the m 2 tidal constituent along the southern open boundary of the parent model the newly designed model is applied to compute water levels due to combined effect of tide and surge associated with the recent severe storm aila along the coast of bangladesh simulated results show the new approach performs well and ensures conformity with observation keywords method of lines storm surge nested grid finite difference method rkarms 4 4 method truncation errors 1 introduction the coastal region of bangladesh is frequently assailed by surges associated with tropical storms and a severe devastation takes place during each storm paul and ismail 2012a the reasons behind the devastation are that surge levels along the region are influenced by some well known factors such as complex land sea interface offshore islands shallow bathymetry huge discharge through the three major rivers padma brahmaputra and meghna and other rivers etc debsarma 2009 paul et al 2014 thus an effective model capable of forecasting water level accurately for the region is highly desirable paul and ismail 2013 due to the scientific advancement and availability of information technology some numerical models for this region have already been proved to be useful for disaster planning and coastal management and research is still being carried out for finding out more accurate method towards the same paul et al 2014 however designing of new innovative techniques still and forever plays major role in research and in its development to determine best solution for any real time problem senthilkumar and paul 2012 from the literature point of view it is seen that the mol is a very powerful method for the treatment of boundary value problems bvps arising in mathematics engineering and physical sciences and can be applied to all major classes of partial differential equations pdes it has the advantages of less computational time no relative convergence problems and numerical stability sun et al 1993 ismail et al 2007 paul et al 2014 the method is more effective than the regular finite difference method fdm in terms of accuracy sadiku and gorcia 2000 recently emphasis is also given on the solution of shallow water equations swes with the use of the mol ismail et al 2007 solved swes using the mol in simulating the indonesian tsunami of 2004 along the coastal belt of peninsular malaysia and thailand based on the study of ismail et al 2007 paul et al 2014 investigated storm surge problem for the first time using the mol along the coast of bangladesh where they found the mol to be a suitable tool to predict water level associated with a storm in an efficient way over the fdm with respect to the facts mentioned above it is to be pointed out here that paul et al 2014 conducted their study using the mol in addition with the well established classical 4th order runge kutta rk 4 4 method according to them one of the main advantages of the mol over the fdm is that the efficiency of the results can be increased in coordination with some well established ode solvers it is to be noted here that there are some difficulties in implementing the rk 4 4 method in estimating numerical solution one of which is the absence of error estimation procedure yaacob and sanugi 1998 several methods have been developed to overcome these weaknesses specifically this is done by introducing the procedure that can estimate the errors in the numerical results yaacob and sanugi 1998 worth mentioning of the methods are due to merson 1957 and fehlberg 1969 evans and yaakub 1995 and yaakub and evans 1999 introduced an embedded rk 4 4 method which is actually two different rk methods namely rk arithmetic mean rkam and rk contra harmonic mean rkcom of the same order 4 yaacob and sanugi 1998 adapted a much simpler rk embedded method of order 4 based on the harmonic mean for solving ivps where they were able to reduce computational cost for complicated problems recently a new fourth order embedded rkahem 4 4 method and algorithm based on rk arithmetic mean rkam 4 4 and rk heronien mean rkhem 4 4 with error control were proposed by senthilkumar 2009 to solve the real time application problems in image processing under cellular neural network cnn environment ponalagusamy and senthilkumar 2009 introduced a novel embedded fourth order rk root mean square rkarms 4 4 method to investigate raster cnn simulation this embedded method was developed using rkam 4 4 and rk root men square rkrms 4 4 methods a detailed illustration related to local truncation error lte global truncation error gte error estimates ees and its behavioural characteristics for controlling fourth order and four stage rk numerical algorithms is addressed in senthilkumar 2009 in this paper we intend to solve swes in cartesian coordinates adapting the mol in addition with the newly proposed rkarms 4 4 method for the prediction of water levels due to the combined effect of tide and surge associated with a storm along the coast of bangladesh the purpose of the study is to test whether the efficiency of the results obtained in paul et al 2014 can be increased by the new approach adopted in this study the present work will improve on that of paul et al 2014 who used a resolution of grids capable of incorporating only major offshore islands along the coast of bangladesh the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 deals with theoretical foundation the data sources are presented in section 3 a short note on the rkarms 4 4 technique and its lte are addressed in section 4 including ee in section 5 numerical procedures are discussed in detail simulated results analysis and model validation are presented in section 6 and the conclusion is given in section 7 2 theoretical foundation as in paul et al 2014 in the formulation of the model a system of rectangular cartesian coordinates is used in which the origin o is set at the undisturbed level of the sea surface o x and o y point towards the south and east respectively and o z is directed vertically upwards the displaced position of the sea surface is given by z ζ x y t and the position of the sea floor by z h x y then the depth averaged equation of continuity can be given by 1 ζ t x ζ h u y ζ h v and the depth averaged x and y components of the momentum equation can respectively be given by 2 u t u u x v u y f v g ζ x t x ρ ζ h c f u u 2 v 2 1 2 ζ h 3 v t u v x v v y f u g ζ y t y ρ ζ h c f v u 2 v 2 1 2 ζ h where pressure is taken as hydrostatic and the sea bottom friction is parameterized in terms of a conventional quadratic law in the above equations u and v represent the reynolds averaged components of velocity in the directions of x and y respectively f 2 ω sin ϕ the coriolis parameter where ω 7 29 10 5 rad s 1 is the angular speed of the earth rotation and ϕ is the latitude wherever necessary of the place of interest g the acceleration due to gravity ρ 1 03 10 3 k g m 3 the density of the sea water assumed to be homogeneous c f the bottom friction coefficient t x t y represents the components of wind stress in this study surface stresses are parameterized by the conventional quadratic law see paul et al 2014 4 t x t y ρ a c d u a 2 v a 2 1 2 u a v a where c d and ρ a are the drag coefficient and air density respectively and u a and v a are the respective x and y components of the surface wind in our study we used c d 0 0028 a value used by most modelers following paul et al 2014 we have used the empirical formula due to jelesnianski 1965 for the surface wind field over the model domain and is given by 5 v a v 0 r a r 3 for all r a r v 0 r r a for all r a r where v 0 is the maximum sustained wind at the radial distance r from the eye of the cyclone and r a is any radial distance from the eye at which the wind field is desired it is to be noted here that there are various formulae for generating surface wind field but the reason behind the use of the above formula can be found in paul and ismail 2012a b 2 1 boundary conditions the boundaries of the model fall into two categories namely closed boundaries representing coastal and island boundaries and open boundaries the component of current along the outward directed normal to the coastal and island boundaries is considered as zero and for open boundaries a condition of radiation type is used for the coarser grid model to allow the disturbance generated within the model area to go out through the open boundary see paul and ismail 2013 it is to be noted here that the boundaries of our analysis area are treated as straight lines in the open sea following roy 1995 the western eastern and southern boundary conditions of the coarser grid model are respectively given by 6 v g h 1 2 ζ 0 7 v g h 1 2 ζ 0 8 u g h 1 2 ζ 2 g h 1 2 a sin 2 π t t φ where a φ and t are the amplitude phase and period respectively of the tidal constituent 3 the data sources bathymetric data of the present study were compiled from the british admiralty chart bac the meteorological input data were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd the observed water level data were procured from the bangladesh inland water transport authority biwta 4 a short note on the rkarms 4 4 method basically the embedded methods are designed to produce an estimation of the lte to control the error with adaptive step size h they are actually two methods built into one one with order p and one with order p 1 the novelty of the rkarms 4 4 method is that it is an embedded method from the runge kutta family combining arithmetic mean with root mean square the method presented in rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 has been dubbed as rkarms 4 4 method and is a method of order o h 4 with an error estimator of order o h 5 by performing one extra calculation the error in the solution can be estimated and controlled by using the higher order embedded method that allows for an adaptive step size to be determined automatically a brief description of the method is given below as in paul and senthilkumar 2016 the rkam 4 4 method in the butcher array form can be written as 9 y n 1 y n h 3 k 1 k 2 2 k 2 k 3 2 k 3 k 4 2 where k 1 f x n y n k 2 f x n h 2 y n h k 1 2 k 3 f x n h 2 y n h k 2 2 k 4 f x n h y n h k 3 the fourth order runge kutta root mean square rkrms 4 4 method with butcher array can be written in the modified form as see paul and senthilkumar 2016 the rkrms 4 4 method due to yaakub and evans 1993 is given by 10 y n 1 y n h 3 k 1 2 k 2 2 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 2 k 3 2 k 4 2 2 where k 1 f x n y n k 2 f x n 1 2 h y n 1 2 h k 1 k 3 f x n 1 2 h y n 1 16 h k 1 7 16 h k 2 k 4 f x n h y n 1 8 h k 1 17 56 h k 2 33 28 h k 3 it is well known that combination of rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 eqs 9 and 10 leads to give a new formation of rkarms 4 4 and is formulated by ponalagusamy and senthilkumar 2009 as k 1 f x n y n k 1 k 2 f x n h 2 y n h k 1 2 k 2 k 3 f x n h 2 y n h k 2 2 k 4 f x n h y n h k 3 k 3 f x n 1 2 h y n 1 16 h k 1 7 16 h k 2 k 3 k 4 f x n h y n 1 8 h k 1 17 56 h k 2 33 28 h k 3 k 4 11 y n 1 y n h 3 k 1 k 2 2 k 2 k 3 2 k 3 k 4 2 12 y n 1 y n h 3 k 1 2 k 2 2 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 2 k 3 2 k 4 2 2 the embedded rkarms 4 4 method can be expressed in form as 13 hence b t y n 1 a m y n h 3 k 1 k 2 2 k 2 k 3 2 k 3 k 4 2 and 14 b ˆ t y n 1 r m s y n h 3 k 1 2 k 2 2 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 2 k 3 2 k 4 2 2 and the estimation of the lte e t b t b ˆ t in the rkarms 4 4 method four stages are required to obtain the solution which share the same set of vectors k 1 and k 2 using b t and b ˆ t approximately but k 3 and k 4 use b t while k 3 and k 4 use b ˆ t where k represents slope at that point 4 1 derivation of the lte and ee for rkarms 4 4 method according to lotkin 1951 and ralston 1957 the ee for the fourth order rk schemes is given by ψ x n y n h 73 720 m l 4 where l and m are positive constants to control the step size h eqs 9 and 10 are used to obtain an estimate of the lte for the new rkarms 4 4 method as 15 l t e y n 1 y n 1 the respective lets for the rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 methods are 16 y n 1 a m y n l t e a m 17 and n 1 r m s y n l t e r m s where y n 1 a m and y n 1 r m s are the numerical approximations at x n 1 obtained from rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 respectively and l t e a m and l t e r m s are the ltes in rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 respectively the ee at x n 1 is computed through the difference between the results obtained by the methods rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 which is given by 18 y n 1 a m y n 1 r m s l t e a m l t e r m s the ltes for the rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 methods are respectively given by see senthilkumar 2009 19 l t e a m h 5 2880 24 f f y 4 f 4 f y y y y 2 f 3 f y f y y y 6 f 3 f y y 2 36 f 2 f y 2 f y y and 20 l t e r m s h 5 184320 429 f f y 4 64 f 4 f y y y y 48 f 3 f y f y y y 96 f 3 f y y 2 2454 f 2 f y 2 f y y the absolute difference between l t e a m and l t e r m s is given by 21 l t e a m l t e r m s h 5 184320 1107 f f y 4 128 f 4 f y y y y 176 f 3 f y f y y y 288 f 3 f y y 2 4758 f 2 f y 2 f y y at this juncture it is vital to point out that the ee control for the rkarms 4 4 method is obtained by computing the difference between the results obtained by the rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 methods therefore from eq 21 ee is expressed as see table 1 22 e e y a m y r m s 6457 184320 5 numerical procedures 5 1 grid nesting procedure the coastal region of bangladesh is complex in nature see fig 1 a high resolution of grids may incorporate the complexities closely but the same resolution of grids for the whole region of interest leads to increase computational cost see paul and ismail 2012a an economical way to incorporate the facts into account is the grid nesting paul et al 2016 because it allows specification of high resolution in a desired region of interest only with lower resolution elsewhere see paul et al 2014 which in turns save computational cost as is required for a model of practical forecasting roy et al 1999 there are two types of grid nesting one way and two way nesting but one way grid technique is simpler and requires less computer time which is used in most nested ocean models yu and zhang 2002 thus in our study one way nested model is applied following paul et al 2016 a high resolution fine grid model fgm is nested into a coarse grid model cgm and a very fine grid model vfgm is again nested into the fgm the fgm is designed in such a way that it can be capable of incorporating all major islands with complex land sea interfaces on the other hand the vfgm is designed in a way so that it can be capable of incorporating complexities of the meghna estuarine area closely the domains grid spacing and number of computational points of the models are presented in table 2 where the nesting of the models with their accurate resolutions are shown in fig 2 for understanding the facts that how they resolve the complexities of the coast with the banalities mentioned above the coupling of the models cgm fgm and vfgm is made following paul et al 2016 along the north east corner of the vfgm meghna river is considered between 90 40 ο 90 6 ο e following roy 1995 the discharge of the river is incorporated through 23 u b u q b h ζ where q and b are the fresh water discharge and the breadth of the river respectively 5 2 discretization of spatial derivatives the governing equations given by eqs 1 3 as well as the boundary conditions given by eqs 6 8 are discretized by a central finite difference method for spatial derivatives using the arakawa c grid by considering the discrete points in the x y plane defined by x i i 1 δ x i 1 2 3 m even y j j 1 δ x j 1 2 3 n odd the description behind the choice of m and n to be even and odd respectively can be found in paul et al 2014 when the discretizations are made eqs 1 3 along with the boundary conditions 6 8 can be found to have forms presented in the appendix the discretization made here is similar to the ones presented in paul et al 2014 but due to subsequent related convenience they are presented here also 5 3 solution by the novel rkarms 4 4 algorithm for every grid point x i y j eq i see appendix can be put to the following form 24 ζ t i j f 1 ζ l m k u l m k v l m k h l m where l i 1 i i 1 m j 1 j j 1 i 2 4 m 2 and j 3 5 n 2 again for every grid point x i y j where i 3 5 m 1 and j 3 5 n 2 one finds eq ii presented in the appendix to the following form 25 u t i j f 2 ζ l m k 1 u l m k v l m k h l m where l i 2 i 1 i i 1 i 2 and m j 2 j 1 j j 1 j 2 finally for every point x i y j eq iii see appendix can be seen to the following form 26 v t i j f 3 ζ l m k 1 u l m k v l m k h l m where l i 2 i 1 i i 1 i 2 m j 2 j 1 j j 1 j 2 i 2 4 m 2 and j 2 4 n 1 in eqs 24 26 the suffix k indicates that the variable will be calculated at the current time whereas k 1 indicates the same for advanced time the known values of ζ l m k ζ l m k 1 u l m k v l m k and h l m on the right hand side of eqs 24 26 will be used as the initial conditions for solving the corresponding equation at every time step first eq 24 with the initial conditions and the defined values of the parameters involved is solved by the rkarms 4 4 method after obtaining the values of the variable ζ at the points specified by eq i boundary conditions given by eqs iv vi are used to yield the values of ζ at the boundary points then a weighted average procedure is adopted to obtain the values of ζ at the remaining necessary grid points path of the storm and wind field are then generated with the help of eqs 4 and 5 and eq 25 is then solved for u component of velocity and finally eq 26 is solved for v component of velocity the same procedure is continued for all the models for each time step of the solution process the only difference here is in the boundary conditions for the different models as can be found in detail in paul et al 2016 along the northern open boundary of the vfgm u b is computed at points 1 j using eq 23 in which u on the rhs is replaced by u 3 j where j 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 5 4 numerical values used in our study we have used c f 0 0026 c d 0 0028 see roy et al 1999 it is pertinent to point out here that the value of the parameter c d may vary between 0 0025 and 0 0030 paul et al 2016 following jain et al 2007 we have used q 5100 00 m 3 s 1 the initial values of ξ u and v are taken as zero to represent a cold start an initial time step of 60 s is used to ensure courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability criterion the rest of the parameters concerned in the problem have been assumed to have their standard values for validation and complete investigation of the model results the time variation information of the storm through which the simulation is made is required which is presented in the following subsection 5 5 cyclone arrival time and its characteristics cyclone aila that hit south western coastal region of bangladesh on 25 may 2009 is taken into account to fulfill the entire criterion for instance the complete investigation comparison of the proposed model and technique and validation of the obtained simulated results with observations according to a report from the bmd a low formed over southwest bay and adjoining area at 0600 utc of 21 may 2009 it moved northwards and at 0300 utc of 23 may it intensified into a well marked low over southwest bay and adjoining west central bay at 0900 utc of the same day the system again intensified into a depression and moved northwards and after 2100 utc of the same day it changed its direction and moved north northeastwards and intensified further into a deep depression then the system moved northwards into northwest bay and adjoining west central bay and developed into a cyclonic storm aila at 1200 utc of 24 may which developed into a severe cyclonic storm at 0600 utc of 25 may and about 0800 utc of the same day the system started to cross west bengal khulna bangladesh coast near sagar island of india and then moved continuously northwards at about 1200 utc of 25 may the central position of the system positioned over kolkata india and adjoining areas of india and bangladesh during the next 3 4 h the system completed crossing the coast and lay centered at west bengal and adjoining western parts of bangladesh the positions of the storm aila fig 3 and its natures at different times are shown in table 3 where the data were received from the bmd 6 discussion of results and model validation we computed our results for 80 h from 1200 utc of 22 may to 2000 utc of 25 may 2009 for each of the displaying results and they were presented for the last 48 h from 2000 utc of 23 may to 2000 utc of 25 may at some coastal locations of bangladesh shown in fig 1 comparison of our model simulated results with observed time series data is limited because of scarcity of authentic time series of observed data fig 4 depicts our model simulated time series surge levels in the absence of astronomical tide associated with the cyclone aila our computed peak surge values in the absence of astronomical tide can be found to range between 1 82 and 3 71 m fig 4 according to a report from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa there was a storm surge between 3 05 and 3 96 m high along the western coastline of bangladesh during the time of landfall further according to the indian meteorological department a storm surge of about 2 3 m above astronomical tide was realized over the coastal areas of west bengal and adjoining bangladesh coasts thus our computed surge heights compare well with observed ranges the study was also conducted employing forward in time and central in space finite difference method see paul and ismail 2013 and employing the mol in coordination with the rk 4 4 method see paul et al 2014 using the same nested models same number of grids same coupling system of the nested models same set of equations with same boundary conditions and same values for the parameters used in the study comparisons of water levels due to surge simulated by the present study and the other two methods of interest at hiron point and chittagong are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that surge levels computed by our model compare well with the ones computed by the fdm and by employing the mol in coordination with the rk 4 4 method surge levels computed by our model for other places also compared well with the ones computed by the said two methods but other such figures are excluded due to the sake of brevity the model simulated time series of water levels due to tide surge and their interaction at hiron point char chenga hatiya and chittagong are presented in fig 6 fig 6 also includes interaction effect total water level due to the interaction of tide and surge minus surge minus tide of tide and surge it can be inferred from fig 6 that tide dominates surge when the storm is away from the coast and surge dominates tide when it approaches the coast in each of the three stations it is found that the interaction effect of tide and surge for our region of concern cannot be neglected which can affect the timing and extreme water levels during storm events the same analysis can also be found in paul et al 2016 thus tide and surge should properly be interacted in order to better estimates of extreme sea level in coastal defense our model simulated time series of water levels due to the interaction of tide and surge with the observed data from the biwta within the period of displaying results at hiron point char chenga and chittagong are delineated in fig 7 time series of water levels due to the interaction of tide and surge computed by the fdm and the mol in coordination with the rk 4 4 method are also presented in the same figure the figure fig 7 shows that the simulated water levels by the present study are in good agreement with the observed data and are found to be comparable well with the results obtained by the two mentioned established methods we could not compare our computed results with observed data at the remaining stations shown in fig 1 as they are data poor regions but time series of total water levels due to the interaction of tide and surge are presented in fig 8 and the peak total water levels estimated by the study along with the corresponding results by the other two methods of interest are presented in table 4 with some reported results and the results obtained in paul et al 2016 for better understanding the peak total water levels as simulated by the model came out to be 2 63 5 62 m figs 7 8 table 4 paul et al 2016 simulated 3 30 5 97 m high total water levels along these areas according to roy et al 2009 the total water level associated with the storm aila at the time of landfall was 4 5 m by a report from the bmd the cyclone aila made landfall between 0800 and 0900 utc of 25 may over bangladesh coast khulna when the local astronomical tide was at peak see subsection 5 5 our computed result presented in fig 6a validates the fact also based on a report from the bmd the central point of the storm aila positioned over kolkata india and adjoining areas of india and bangladesh at about 1200 utc 25 may fig 3 thus our computed water levels due to the interaction of tide and surge see figs 6 8 are found to be consistent with the sequence of events data and landfall time mentioned above it can also be seen from table 4 that the results by the present study are comparable with the results by the other two considered methods and a little bit closer to the results presented in paul et al 2016 over the other two methods it can be inferred from figs 4 8 that the peak water levels due to surge and interaction of tide and surge at each location increase with time as the storm approaches the coast and finally there is a recession an early recession at hiron point can be found see figs 7 and 8 to occur after about 0700 utc of 25 may and the recession reaches up to 1 05 m at 1500 utc of 25 may fig 6a it can also be observed from figs 7 and 8 that the beginning of recession at a location delays with the increase in its east longitude which is as to be expected to test the model efficiency and to make comparison the root mean square error rmse analyses are carried out between observed data and computed total water levels by the present study and by the two considered methods our evaluated rmse values are presented in table 5 the rmse values presented in the study of paul et al 2016 are also depicted in table 5 for comparison it can be seen from table 5 that the performance of our model is considerable and a little bit better over the other two methods of interest with regard to the obtained rmse values also the rmse values estimated in the study are found closer to those obtained in paul et al 2016 over the of other two methods however the model used in the investigation of paul et al 2016 show a better performance the reason behind may be the consideration of inverse barometric effect which is out of scope of the present study it is to be noted down here that the coast of bangladesh is familiar for its complexities and to represent in detail the real complexities a very high grid resolution is required murty et al 1986 thus we have tested the effect of grid resolution on water level total in this regard the model was run without nesting the vfgm and with a changed grid resolution of the vfgm number of computational grids 190 145 grid resolution along x axis 720 73 m grid resolution along y axis 1142 39 m the results for the peak total water levels are presented in fig 9 it can be seen from the figure fig 9 that with the changed grid resolution of the vfgm the obtained model simulates water levels that are very close to the simulated results from the present study thus the grid resolution used in the study can be accepted but when the study is conducted without vfgm the results can be found to be affected considerably along the meghna estuarine area where we used the vfgm thus grid resolution can be an important factor in surge level prediction accuracy for the region of interest consequently the present work in this regard will improve on that of paul et al 2014 who used a resolution of grids capable of incorporating only major offshore islands along the coast of bangladesh at this juncture it is important to point out again that the resolutions of the other models namely cgm and fgm are relatively low where the fgm is designed in such a way that it can incorporate coastal complexities and all big offshore islands see fig 2 whereas in the cgm it is not possible to incorporate the complexities thus different models can be found to incorporate the coastal complexities and bottom topographic details with varying degrees of accuracy and hence they produce different results on the other hand a grid with improved resolution is required near the coast to take into account the coastal complexities rahman et al 2017 which is unnecessary away from the coast and an operational forecasting model should be capable of computing water levels efficiently with minimum cost roy et al 1999 in this regard the present study can meet the requirement as the nested model reduce computational cost incorporating coastal complexities to the desired accuracy on the other hand the mol approach minimizes computational effort and cost it has the advantages of computational efficiency numerical stability and a significant benefit of using sophisticated ode integrator finally in rkarms 4 4 technique there is a facility of controlling step size which in turn can produce accurate results and reduce computational cost in our computation time step size δ t is used as 60 s although we have presented our results taking time step δ t as 60 s we have also computed our results taking different time steps namely 90 s 30 s 20 s and 10 s the results obtained employing the mol in coordination with both the rkarms 4 4 and rk 4 4 methods in each case generally agreed the respective results presented in each case and no numerical instability was achieved but the fdm failed to ensure stability for some time steps mentioned above in order to compare the computational costs in computing total water levels by the methods the codes were run on the same computer intel r core tm i5 with time step 60 s the computational time in the case of the present study was found to be a little bit more 1 m 3 s in comparison with the other two mol 54 s fdm 59 s but with the use of higher time step it can be reduced as there is a facility in rkarms 4 4 in controlling step size based on the lte to test this the model was run with an initial time step of δ t 90 s and in this case computational time was found to be less 52 s with the same accuracy in contrast with that of the time step of 60 s see table 5 but fdm failed to run fully with the said time step 90 s and in the case of the mol in coordination with the rk 4 4 method the model run time was comparable with that of the present study but there was a problem of accuracy in the obtained results see table 5 it is pertinent to pinpoint out here that in the rk 4 4 method there are no facilities of controlling step size which may be useful in order to assess the accuracy of numerical integration in our present study we did not estimate water current which is important for a hydrodynamic model also we have conducted our study with including only the major tidal constituent m 2 also the results along the western coastal region can be improved with the use of very fine resolution of grids but the facts would be incorporated in a future paper 7 conclusion in this study vertically integrated swes in cartesian coordinates are solved using the mol with the aid of the newly introduced rkarms 4 4 method to predict water levels due to the combined effect of tide and surge associated with a storm along the coast of bangladesh our simulated water levels due to the combined effect of tide and surge are found to be in good agreement with observations and are found to be a little bit better in comparison with those obtained by employing the standard fdm and the mol with the rk 4 4 method with regard to the rmse values indeed the mol approach is found to minimize computational effort and cost it has the advantages of computational efficiency numerical stability and a significant benefit of using sophisticated ode integrator on the other hand in rkarms 4 4 technique there is a facility of controlling step size which in turn can produce accurate results and reduce computational cost on the other hand the nested model reduce computational cost incorporating coastal complexities to the desired accuracy thus based on the newly proposed approach a significant operational forecasting mechanism can be developed for the coast of bangladesh which can serve as a better software tool for the prediction of storm surge furthermore the obtained and validated benchmarking results can be taken as an evident base reference for the future development of research and its related potential areas of applications acknowledgements the authors are

23704,innovative formulation of new algorithm s is still a great challenge in scientific research community for solving any real time non linear problems based on the above notion in this study the method of lines mol in addition with the newly introduced embedded rkarms 4 4 technique is adapted for numerical prediction of water levels owing to the interaction of tide and surge associated with a cyclone to perform the desired task initially a transformation is carried out to convert the vertically integrated shallow water equations in cartesian coordinates with boundary conditions into ordinary differential equations odes of initial valued which are solved by the rkarms 4 4 technique to attain results the model is specifically designed for the coast of bangladesh to incorporate coastal complexities along the region of interest with minimum cost one way nested models are used a stable tidal condition is generated applying the m 2 tidal constituent along the southern open boundary of the parent model the newly designed model is applied to compute water levels due to combined effect of tide and surge associated with the recent severe storm aila along the coast of bangladesh simulated results show the new approach performs well and ensures conformity with observation keywords method of lines storm surge nested grid finite difference method rkarms 4 4 method truncation errors 1 introduction the coastal region of bangladesh is frequently assailed by surges associated with tropical storms and a severe devastation takes place during each storm paul and ismail 2012a the reasons behind the devastation are that surge levels along the region are influenced by some well known factors such as complex land sea interface offshore islands shallow bathymetry huge discharge through the three major rivers padma brahmaputra and meghna and other rivers etc debsarma 2009 paul et al 2014 thus an effective model capable of forecasting water level accurately for the region is highly desirable paul and ismail 2013 due to the scientific advancement and availability of information technology some numerical models for this region have already been proved to be useful for disaster planning and coastal management and research is still being carried out for finding out more accurate method towards the same paul et al 2014 however designing of new innovative techniques still and forever plays major role in research and in its development to determine best solution for any real time problem senthilkumar and paul 2012 from the literature point of view it is seen that the mol is a very powerful method for the treatment of boundary value problems bvps arising in mathematics engineering and physical sciences and can be applied to all major classes of partial differential equations pdes it has the advantages of less computational time no relative convergence problems and numerical stability sun et al 1993 ismail et al 2007 paul et al 2014 the method is more effective than the regular finite difference method fdm in terms of accuracy sadiku and gorcia 2000 recently emphasis is also given on the solution of shallow water equations swes with the use of the mol ismail et al 2007 solved swes using the mol in simulating the indonesian tsunami of 2004 along the coastal belt of peninsular malaysia and thailand based on the study of ismail et al 2007 paul et al 2014 investigated storm surge problem for the first time using the mol along the coast of bangladesh where they found the mol to be a suitable tool to predict water level associated with a storm in an efficient way over the fdm with respect to the facts mentioned above it is to be pointed out here that paul et al 2014 conducted their study using the mol in addition with the well established classical 4th order runge kutta rk 4 4 method according to them one of the main advantages of the mol over the fdm is that the efficiency of the results can be increased in coordination with some well established ode solvers it is to be noted here that there are some difficulties in implementing the rk 4 4 method in estimating numerical solution one of which is the absence of error estimation procedure yaacob and sanugi 1998 several methods have been developed to overcome these weaknesses specifically this is done by introducing the procedure that can estimate the errors in the numerical results yaacob and sanugi 1998 worth mentioning of the methods are due to merson 1957 and fehlberg 1969 evans and yaakub 1995 and yaakub and evans 1999 introduced an embedded rk 4 4 method which is actually two different rk methods namely rk arithmetic mean rkam and rk contra harmonic mean rkcom of the same order 4 yaacob and sanugi 1998 adapted a much simpler rk embedded method of order 4 based on the harmonic mean for solving ivps where they were able to reduce computational cost for complicated problems recently a new fourth order embedded rkahem 4 4 method and algorithm based on rk arithmetic mean rkam 4 4 and rk heronien mean rkhem 4 4 with error control were proposed by senthilkumar 2009 to solve the real time application problems in image processing under cellular neural network cnn environment ponalagusamy and senthilkumar 2009 introduced a novel embedded fourth order rk root mean square rkarms 4 4 method to investigate raster cnn simulation this embedded method was developed using rkam 4 4 and rk root men square rkrms 4 4 methods a detailed illustration related to local truncation error lte global truncation error gte error estimates ees and its behavioural characteristics for controlling fourth order and four stage rk numerical algorithms is addressed in senthilkumar 2009 in this paper we intend to solve swes in cartesian coordinates adapting the mol in addition with the newly proposed rkarms 4 4 method for the prediction of water levels due to the combined effect of tide and surge associated with a storm along the coast of bangladesh the purpose of the study is to test whether the efficiency of the results obtained in paul et al 2014 can be increased by the new approach adopted in this study the present work will improve on that of paul et al 2014 who used a resolution of grids capable of incorporating only major offshore islands along the coast of bangladesh the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 deals with theoretical foundation the data sources are presented in section 3 a short note on the rkarms 4 4 technique and its lte are addressed in section 4 including ee in section 5 numerical procedures are discussed in detail simulated results analysis and model validation are presented in section 6 and the conclusion is given in section 7 2 theoretical foundation as in paul et al 2014 in the formulation of the model a system of rectangular cartesian coordinates is used in which the origin o is set at the undisturbed level of the sea surface o x and o y point towards the south and east respectively and o z is directed vertically upwards the displaced position of the sea surface is given by z ζ x y t and the position of the sea floor by z h x y then the depth averaged equation of continuity can be given by 1 ζ t x ζ h u y ζ h v and the depth averaged x and y components of the momentum equation can respectively be given by 2 u t u u x v u y f v g ζ x t x ρ ζ h c f u u 2 v 2 1 2 ζ h 3 v t u v x v v y f u g ζ y t y ρ ζ h c f v u 2 v 2 1 2 ζ h where pressure is taken as hydrostatic and the sea bottom friction is parameterized in terms of a conventional quadratic law in the above equations u and v represent the reynolds averaged components of velocity in the directions of x and y respectively f 2 ω sin ϕ the coriolis parameter where ω 7 29 10 5 rad s 1 is the angular speed of the earth rotation and ϕ is the latitude wherever necessary of the place of interest g the acceleration due to gravity ρ 1 03 10 3 k g m 3 the density of the sea water assumed to be homogeneous c f the bottom friction coefficient t x t y represents the components of wind stress in this study surface stresses are parameterized by the conventional quadratic law see paul et al 2014 4 t x t y ρ a c d u a 2 v a 2 1 2 u a v a where c d and ρ a are the drag coefficient and air density respectively and u a and v a are the respective x and y components of the surface wind in our study we used c d 0 0028 a value used by most modelers following paul et al 2014 we have used the empirical formula due to jelesnianski 1965 for the surface wind field over the model domain and is given by 5 v a v 0 r a r 3 for all r a r v 0 r r a for all r a r where v 0 is the maximum sustained wind at the radial distance r from the eye of the cyclone and r a is any radial distance from the eye at which the wind field is desired it is to be noted here that there are various formulae for generating surface wind field but the reason behind the use of the above formula can be found in paul and ismail 2012a b 2 1 boundary conditions the boundaries of the model fall into two categories namely closed boundaries representing coastal and island boundaries and open boundaries the component of current along the outward directed normal to the coastal and island boundaries is considered as zero and for open boundaries a condition of radiation type is used for the coarser grid model to allow the disturbance generated within the model area to go out through the open boundary see paul and ismail 2013 it is to be noted here that the boundaries of our analysis area are treated as straight lines in the open sea following roy 1995 the western eastern and southern boundary conditions of the coarser grid model are respectively given by 6 v g h 1 2 ζ 0 7 v g h 1 2 ζ 0 8 u g h 1 2 ζ 2 g h 1 2 a sin 2 π t t φ where a φ and t are the amplitude phase and period respectively of the tidal constituent 3 the data sources bathymetric data of the present study were compiled from the british admiralty chart bac the meteorological input data were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd the observed water level data were procured from the bangladesh inland water transport authority biwta 4 a short note on the rkarms 4 4 method basically the embedded methods are designed to produce an estimation of the lte to control the error with adaptive step size h they are actually two methods built into one one with order p and one with order p 1 the novelty of the rkarms 4 4 method is that it is an embedded method from the runge kutta family combining arithmetic mean with root mean square the method presented in rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 has been dubbed as rkarms 4 4 method and is a method of order o h 4 with an error estimator of order o h 5 by performing one extra calculation the error in the solution can be estimated and controlled by using the higher order embedded method that allows for an adaptive step size to be determined automatically a brief description of the method is given below as in paul and senthilkumar 2016 the rkam 4 4 method in the butcher array form can be written as 9 y n 1 y n h 3 k 1 k 2 2 k 2 k 3 2 k 3 k 4 2 where k 1 f x n y n k 2 f x n h 2 y n h k 1 2 k 3 f x n h 2 y n h k 2 2 k 4 f x n h y n h k 3 the fourth order runge kutta root mean square rkrms 4 4 method with butcher array can be written in the modified form as see paul and senthilkumar 2016 the rkrms 4 4 method due to yaakub and evans 1993 is given by 10 y n 1 y n h 3 k 1 2 k 2 2 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 2 k 3 2 k 4 2 2 where k 1 f x n y n k 2 f x n 1 2 h y n 1 2 h k 1 k 3 f x n 1 2 h y n 1 16 h k 1 7 16 h k 2 k 4 f x n h y n 1 8 h k 1 17 56 h k 2 33 28 h k 3 it is well known that combination of rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 eqs 9 and 10 leads to give a new formation of rkarms 4 4 and is formulated by ponalagusamy and senthilkumar 2009 as k 1 f x n y n k 1 k 2 f x n h 2 y n h k 1 2 k 2 k 3 f x n h 2 y n h k 2 2 k 4 f x n h y n h k 3 k 3 f x n 1 2 h y n 1 16 h k 1 7 16 h k 2 k 3 k 4 f x n h y n 1 8 h k 1 17 56 h k 2 33 28 h k 3 k 4 11 y n 1 y n h 3 k 1 k 2 2 k 2 k 3 2 k 3 k 4 2 12 y n 1 y n h 3 k 1 2 k 2 2 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 2 k 3 2 k 4 2 2 the embedded rkarms 4 4 method can be expressed in form as 13 hence b t y n 1 a m y n h 3 k 1 k 2 2 k 2 k 3 2 k 3 k 4 2 and 14 b ˆ t y n 1 r m s y n h 3 k 1 2 k 2 2 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 2 k 3 2 k 4 2 2 and the estimation of the lte e t b t b ˆ t in the rkarms 4 4 method four stages are required to obtain the solution which share the same set of vectors k 1 and k 2 using b t and b ˆ t approximately but k 3 and k 4 use b t while k 3 and k 4 use b ˆ t where k represents slope at that point 4 1 derivation of the lte and ee for rkarms 4 4 method according to lotkin 1951 and ralston 1957 the ee for the fourth order rk schemes is given by ψ x n y n h 73 720 m l 4 where l and m are positive constants to control the step size h eqs 9 and 10 are used to obtain an estimate of the lte for the new rkarms 4 4 method as 15 l t e y n 1 y n 1 the respective lets for the rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 methods are 16 y n 1 a m y n l t e a m 17 and n 1 r m s y n l t e r m s where y n 1 a m and y n 1 r m s are the numerical approximations at x n 1 obtained from rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 respectively and l t e a m and l t e r m s are the ltes in rkam 4 4 and rkrms 4 4 respectively the ee at x n 1 is computed through the difference between the

rkrms 4 4 methods therefore from eq 21 ee is expressed as see table 1 22 e e y a m y r m s 6457 184320 5 numerical procedures 5 1 grid nesting procedure the coastal region of bangladesh is complex in nature see fig 1 a high resolution of grids may incorporate the complexities closely but the same resolution of grids for the whole region of interest leads to increase computational cost see paul and ismail 2012a an economical way to incorporate the facts into account is the grid nesting paul et al 2016 because it allows specification of high resolution in a desired region of interest only with lower resolution elsewhere see paul et al 2014 which in turns save computational cost as is required for a model of practical forecasting roy et al 1999 there are two types of grid nesting one way and two way nesting but one way grid technique is simpler and requires less computer time which is used in most nested ocean models yu and zhang 2002 thus in our study one way nested model is applied following paul et al 2016 a high resolution fine grid model fgm is nested into a coarse grid model cgm and a very fine grid model vfgm is again nested into the fgm the fgm is designed in such a way that it can be capable of incorporating all major islands with complex land sea interfaces on the other hand the vfgm is designed in a way so that it can be capable of incorporating complexities of the meghna estuarine area closely the domains grid spacing and number of computational points of the models are presented in table 2 where the nesting of the models with their accurate resolutions are shown in fig 2 for understanding the facts that how they resolve the complexities of the coast with the banalities mentioned above the coupling of the models cgm fgm and vfgm is made following paul et al 2016 along the north east corner of the vfgm meghna river is considered between 90 40 ο 90 6 ο e following roy 1995 the discharge of the river is incorporated through 23 u b u q b h ζ where q and b are the fresh water discharge and the breadth of the river respectively 5 2 discretization of spatial derivatives the governing equations given by eqs 1 3 as well as the boundary conditions given by eqs 6 8 are discretized by a central finite difference method for spatial derivatives using the arakawa c grid by considering the discrete points in the x y plane defined by x i i 1 δ x i 1 2 3 m even y j j 1 δ x j 1 2 3 n odd the description behind the choice of m and n to be even and odd respectively can be found in paul et al 2014 when the discretizations are made eqs 1 3 along with the boundary conditions 6 8 can be found to have forms presented in the appendix the discretization made here is similar to the ones presented in paul et al 2014 but due to subsequent related convenience they are presented here also 5 3 solution by the novel rkarms 4 4 algorithm for every grid point x i y j eq i see appendix can be put to the following form 24 ζ t i j f 1 ζ l m k u l m k v l m k h l m where l i 1 i i 1 m j 1 j j 1 i 2 4 m 2 and j 3 5 n 2 again for every grid point x i y j where i 3 5 m 1 and j 3 5 n 2 one finds eq ii presented in the appendix to the following form 25 u t i j f 2 ζ l m k 1 u l m k v l m k h l m where l i 2 i 1 i i 1 i 2 and m j 2 j 1 j j 1 j 2 finally for every point x i y j eq iii see appendix can be seen to the following form 26 v t i j f 3 ζ l m k 1 u l m k v l m k h l m where l i 2 i 1 i i 1 i 2 m j 2 j 1 j j 1 j 2 i 2 4 m 2 and j 2 4 n 1 in eqs 24 26 the suffix k indicates that the variable will be calculated at the current time whereas k 1 indicates the same for advanced time the known values of ζ l m k ζ l m k 1 u l m k v l m k and h l m on the right hand side of eqs 24 26 will be used as the initial conditions for solving the corresponding equation at every time step first eq 24 with the initial conditions and the defined values of the parameters involved is solved by the rkarms 4 4 method after obtaining the values of the variable ζ at the points specified by eq i boundary conditions given by eqs iv vi are used to yield the values of ζ at the boundary points then a weighted average procedure is adopted to obtain the values of ζ at the remaining necessary grid points path of the storm and wind field are then generated with the help of eqs 4 and 5 and eq 25 is then solved for u component of velocity and finally eq 26 is solved for v component of velocity the same procedure is continued for all the models for each time step of the solution process the only difference here is in the boundary conditions for the different models as can be found in detail in paul et al 2016 along the northern open boundary of the vfgm u b is computed at points 1 j using eq 23 in which u on the rhs is replaced by u 3 j where j 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 5 4 numerical values used in our study we have used c f 0 0026 c d 0 0028 see roy et al 1999 it is pertinent to point out here that the value of the parameter c d may vary between 0 0025 and 0 0030 paul et al 2016 following jain et al 2007 we have used q 5100 00 m 3 s 1 the initial values of ξ u and v are taken as zero to represent a cold start an initial time step of 60 s is used to ensure courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability criterion the rest of the parameters concerned in the problem have been assumed to have their standard values for validation and complete investigation of the model results the time variation information of the storm through which the simulation is made is required which is presented in the following subsection 5 5 cyclone arrival time and its characteristics cyclone aila that hit south western coastal region of bangladesh on 25 may 2009 is taken into account to fulfill the entire criterion for instance the complete investigation comparison of the proposed model and technique and validation of the obtained simulated results with observations according to a report from the bmd a low formed over southwest bay and adjoining area at 0600 utc of 21 may 2009 it moved northwards and at 0300 utc of 23 may it intensified into a well marked low over southwest bay and adjoining west central bay at 0900 utc of the same day the system again intensified into a depression and moved northwards and after 2100 utc of the same day it changed its direction and moved north northeastwards and intensified further into a deep depression then the system moved northwards into northwest bay and adjoining west central bay and developed into a cyclonic storm aila at 1200 utc of 24 may which developed into a severe cyclonic storm at 0600 utc of 25 may and about 0800 utc of the same day the system started to cross west bengal khulna bangladesh coast near sagar island of india and then moved continuously northwards at about 1200 utc of 25 may the central position of the system positioned over kolkata india and adjoining areas of india and bangladesh during the next 3 4 h the system completed crossing the coast and lay centered at west bengal and adjoining western parts of bangladesh the positions of the storm aila fig 3 and its natures at different times are shown in table 3 where the data were received from the bmd 6 discussion of results and model validation we computed our results for 80 h from 1200 utc of 22 may to 2000 utc of 25 may 2009 for each of the displaying results and they were presented for the last 48 h from 2000 utc of 23 may to 2000 utc of 25 may at some coastal locations of bangladesh shown in fig 1 comparison of our model simulated results with observed time series data is limited because of scarcity of authentic time series of observed data fig 4 depicts our model simulated time series surge levels in the absence of astronomical tide associated with the cyclone aila our computed peak surge values in the absence of astronomical tide can be found to range between 1 82 and 3 71 m fig 4 according to a report from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa there was a storm surge between 3 05 and 3 96 m high along the western coastline of bangladesh during the time of landfall further according to the indian meteorological department a storm surge of about 2 3 m above astronomical tide was realized over the coastal areas of west bengal and adjoining bangladesh coasts thus our computed surge heights compare well with observed ranges the study was also conducted employing forward in time and central in space finite difference method see paul and ismail 2013 and employing the mol in coordination with the rk 4 4 method see paul et al 2014 using the same nested models same number of grids same coupling system of the nested models same set of equations with same boundary conditions and same values for the parameters used in the study comparisons of water levels due to surge simulated by the present study and the other two methods of interest at hiron point and chittagong are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that surge levels computed by our model compare well with the ones computed by the fdm and by employing the mol in coordination with the rk 4 4 method surge levels computed by our model for other places also compared well with the ones computed by the said two methods but other such figures are excluded due to the sake of brevity the model simulated time series of water levels due to tide surge and their interaction at hiron point char chenga hatiya and chittagong are presented in fig 6 fig 6 also includes interaction effect total water level due to the interaction of tide and surge minus surge minus tide of tide and surge it can be inferred from fig 6 that tide dominates surge when the storm is away from the coast and surge dominates tide when it approaches the coast in each of the three stations it is found that the interaction effect of tide and surge for our region of concern cannot be neglected which can affect the timing and extreme water levels during storm events the same analysis can also be found in paul et al 2016 thus tide and surge should properly be interacted in order to better estimates of extreme sea level in coastal defense our model simulated time series of water levels due to the interaction of tide and surge with the observed data from the biwta within the period of displaying results at hiron point char chenga and chittagong are delineated in fig 7 time series of water levels due to the interaction of tide and surge computed by the fdm and the mol in coordination with the rk 4 4 method are also presented in the same figure the figure fig 7 shows that the simulated water levels by the present study are in good agreement with the observed data and are found to be comparable well with the results obtained by the two mentioned established methods we could not compare our computed results with observed data at the remaining stations shown in fig 1 as they are data poor regions but time series of total water levels due to the interaction of tide and surge are presented in fig 8 and the peak total water levels estimated by the study along with the corresponding results by the other two methods of interest are presented in table 4 with some reported results and the results obtained in paul et al 2016 for better understanding the peak total water levels as simulated by the model came out to be 2 63 5 62 m figs 7 8 table 4 paul et al 2016 simulated 3 30 5 97 m high total water levels along these areas according to roy et al 2009 the total water level associated with the storm aila at the time of landfall was 4 5 m by a report from the bmd the cyclone aila made landfall between 0800 and 0900 utc of 25 may over bangladesh coast khulna when the local astronomical tide was at peak see subsection 5 5 our computed result presented in fig 6a validates the fact also based on a report from the bmd the central point of the storm aila positioned over kolkata india and adjoining areas of india and bangladesh at about 1200 utc 25 may fig 3 thus our computed water levels due to the interaction of tide and surge see figs 6 8 are found to be consistent with the sequence of events data and landfall time mentioned above it can also be seen from table 4 that the results by the present study are comparable with the results by the other two considered methods and a little bit closer to the results presented in paul et al 2016 over the other two methods it can be inferred from figs 4 8 that the peak water levels due to surge and interaction of tide and surge at each location increase with time as the storm approaches the coast and finally there is a recession an early recession at hiron point can be found see figs 7 and 8 to occur after about 0700 utc of 25 may and the recession reaches up to 1 05 m at 1500 utc of 25 may fig 6a it can also be observed from figs 7 and 8 that the beginning of recession at a location delays with the increase in its east longitude which is as to be expected to test the model efficiency and to make comparison the root mean square error rmse analyses are carried out between observed data and computed total water levels by the present study and by the two considered methods our evaluated rmse values are presented in table 5 the rmse values presented in the study of paul et al 2016 are also depicted in table 5 for comparison it can be seen from table 5 that the performance of our model is considerable and a little bit better over the other two methods of interest with regard to the obtained rmse values also the rmse values estimated in the study are found closer to those obtained in paul et al 2016 over the of other two methods however the model used in the investigation of paul et al 2016 show a better performance the reason behind may be the consideration of inverse barometric effect which is out of scope of the present study it is to be noted down here that the coast of bangladesh is familiar for its complexities and to represent in detail the real complexities a very high grid resolution is required murty et al 1986 thus we have tested the effect of grid resolution on water level total in this regard the model was run without nesting the vfgm and with a changed grid resolution of the vfgm number of computational grids 190 145 grid resolution along x axis 720 73 m grid resolution along y axis 1142 39 m the results for the peak total water levels are presented in fig 9 it can be seen from the figure fig 9 that with the changed grid resolution of the vfgm the obtained model simulates water levels that are very close to the simulated results from the present study thus the grid resolution used in the study can be accepted but when the study is conducted without vfgm the results can be found to be affected considerably along the meghna estuarine area where we used the vfgm thus grid resolution can be an important factor in surge level prediction accuracy for the region of interest consequently the present work in this regard will improve on that of paul et al 2014 who used a resolution of grids capable of incorporating only major offshore islands along the coast of bangladesh at this juncture it is important to point out again that the resolutions of the other models namely cgm and fgm are relatively low where the fgm is designed in such a way that it can incorporate coastal complexities and all big offshore islands see fig 2 whereas in the cgm it is not possible to incorporate the complexities thus different models can be found to incorporate the coastal complexities and bottom topographic details with varying degrees of accuracy and hence they produce different results on the other hand a grid with improved resolution is required near the coast to take into account the coastal complexities rahman et al 2017 which is unnecessary away from the coast and an operational forecasting model should be capable of computing water levels efficiently with minimum cost roy et al 1999 in this regard the present study can meet the requirement as the nested model reduce computational cost incorporating coastal complexities to the desired accuracy on the other hand the mol approach minimizes computational effort and cost it has the advantages of computational efficiency numerical stability and a significant benefit of using sophisticated ode integrator finally in rkarms 4 4 technique there is a facility of controlling step size which in turn can produce accurate results and reduce computational cost in our computation time step size δ t is used as 60 s although we have presented our results taking time step δ t as 60 s we have also computed our results taking different time steps namely 90 s 30 s 20 s and 10 s the results obtained employing the mol in coordination with both the rkarms 4 4 and rk 4 4 methods in each case generally agreed the respective results presented in each case and no numerical instability was achieved but the fdm failed to ensure stability for some time steps mentioned above in order to compare the computational costs in computing total water levels by the methods the codes were run on the same computer intel r core tm i5 with time step 60 s the computational time in the case of the present study was found to be a little bit more 1 m 3 s in comparison with the other two mol 54 s fdm 59 s but with the use of higher time step it can be reduced as there is a facility in rkarms 4 4 in controlling step size based on the lte to test this the model was run with an initial time step of δ t 90 s and in this case computational time was found to be less 52 s with the same accuracy in contrast with that of the time step of 60 s see table 5 but fdm failed to run fully with the said time step 90 s and in the case of the mol in coordination with the rk 4 4 method the model run time was comparable with that of the present study but there was a problem of accuracy in the obtained results see table 5 it is pertinent to pinpoint out here that in the rk 4 4 method there are no facilities of controlling step size which may be useful in order to assess the accuracy of numerical integration in our present study we did not estimate water current which is important for a hydrodynamic model also we have conducted our study with including only the major tidal constituent m 2 also the results along the western coastal region can be improved with the use of very fine resolution of grids but the facts would be incorporated in a future paper 7 conclusion in this study vertically integrated swes in cartesian coordinates are solved using the mol with the aid of the newly introduced rkarms 4 4 method to predict water levels due to the combined effect of tide and surge associated with a storm along the coast of bangladesh our simulated water levels due to the combined effect of tide and surge are found to be in good agreement with observations and are found to be a little bit better in comparison with those obtained by employing the standard fdm and the mol with the rk 4 4 method with regard to the rmse values indeed the mol approach is found to minimize computational effort and cost it has the advantages of computational efficiency numerical stability and a significant benefit of using sophisticated ode integrator on the other hand in rkarms 4 4 technique there is a facility of controlling step size which in turn can produce accurate results and reduce computational cost on the other hand the nested model reduce computational cost incorporating coastal complexities to the desired accuracy thus based on the newly proposed approach a significant operational forecasting mechanism can be developed for the coast of bangladesh which can serve as a better software tool for the prediction of storm surge furthermore the obtained and validated benchmarking results can be taken as an evident base reference for the future development of research and its related potential areas of applications acknowledgements the authors are
