16960,modeling of anaerobic digestion ad is crucial to better understand the process dynamics and to improve the digester performance this is an essential yet difficult task due to the complex and unknown interactions within the system the application of well developed data mining technologies such as machine learning ml and microbial gene sequencing techniques are promising in overcoming these challenges in this study we investigated the feasibility of 6 ml algorithms using genomic data and their corresponding operational parameters from 8 research groups to predict methane yield for classification models random forest rf achieved accuracies of 0 77 using operational parameters alone and 0 78 using genomic data at the bacterial phylum level alone the combination of operational parameters and genomic data improved the prediction accuracy to 0 82 p 0 05 for regression models a low root mean square error of 0 04 relative root mean square error 8 6 was acquired by neural network using genomic data at the bacterial phylum level alone feature importance analysis by rf suggested that chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaeta were the top 5 most important phyla although their relative abundances were ranging only from 0 1 to 3 1 the important features identified could provide guidance for early warning and proactive management of microbial communities this study demonstrated the promising application of ml techniques for predicting and controlling ad performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords machine learning anaerobic digestion genomic data performance prediction control strategy 1 introduction with the growing global concern around increasing depletion of non renewable fossil energy and the aggravated environmental pollution the search for alternative methods to develop and utilize sustainable energy has been a topic of major demand anaerobic digestion ad is a well recognized process that converts organic waste and wastewater into biomethane to harvest energy which is a promising means of addressing global energy needs and providing multiple environmental benefits linville et al 2015 naroznova et al 2016 according to the us epa s report in 2018 more than 1200 industrial grade anaerobic digesters were operated incorporating water resource recovery facilities and other 248 digesters were operated on livestock farms pennington 2018 in europe over 17 240 operational ad plants produced 63 3 twh of electricity from biogas equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of 14 6 million european households in 2014 association 2015 the ad process generally involves four interrelated phases hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis that require the complex synergy of multiple groups of anaerobic microorganisms during each stage appels et al 2011 the quantities and activities of these microorganisms behind this four stage process and the performance of ad could be influenced by factors such as waste wastewater types organic loading rates olrs volatile fatty acid compositions temperatures and hydraulic retention times hrts mcleod et al 2015 rabii et al 2019 wang et al 2018 due to the diversity and variability of feed streams and the complexity of the ad microbial process the operation of anaerobic digesters has experienced issues with unexpected perturbations in biogas production organic reduction leading to inferior digestion performance and high operation cost mata alvarez et al 2014 weiland 2010 modeling of ad process is crucial to better understand the process dynamics and to improve the digester performance lauwers et al 2013 during the last two decades a few mechanistic models were constructed using differential mass balance equations to reflect the dynamic process ramírez rivas 2013 a well known mechanistic model anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 which contains a set of reaction kinetic equations that could simulate the biochemical related to the microbial community and physicochemical related to the liquid or gaseous state of the variables processes has been widely used to simulate the ad system batstone et al 2002 the adm1 model improves the understanding of the ad process the prediction of the system s behavior under different conditions reducing the experimental requirements costs risk and time donoso bravo et al 2011 however its performance is limited by the insufficient consideration of physicochemical and biochemical processes due to the complexity of the metabolic pathways and microbial species involved batstone et al 2015 the synergistic pathways and the latent connections between the reactor performance and the kinetic parameters still need more explicit analysis nguyen et al 2019 for these reasons the adm1 model has its limitations to predict the performance of ad in practice recent improvements in computational power have afforded the development of machine learning ml as a data mining and model development tool for pattern recognition statistics and optimization witten et al 2016 in contrast to mechanistic models following mass and energy balances or physical and chemical laws ml models make data driven predictions and have been proven to be a powerful tool in microbial ecology and systems biology research the data mining techniques provide a means to analyze high dimensional microbial community data or other metagenomic features such as gene families or metabolic pathways and find the hidden trends among the data qu et al 2019 yu and liu 2003 recently ml models have been used to predict the ad performance based on feedstock characteristics and or process parameters xu et al dong and chen examined the neural networks nnet and support vector machines svm respectively to numerically predict methane production from digestion dong and chen 2019 xu et al 2014 clercq et al trained a number of ml models using different algorithms including tree boosting algorithms and k nearest neighbors knn to predict the anaerobic digester performance based on fluctuating values of biowaste input de clercq et al 2019 wang et al used both random forest rf and logistic regression multiclass glmnet to predict the methane production using defined components in substrate as input feature wang et al 2020 moreover ml models also have been applied to understand and optimize the ad process the hybrid of artificial neural network ann and genetic algorithm ga was used to simulate ad process and to optimize biogas production based on feedstock characteristics abu qdais et al 2010 barik and murugan 2015 kazemi et al used different data driven methods to evaluate the relationship between vfa concentration and operation conditions during ad process kazemi et al 2020 xu et al developed ml models to predict and optimize the ad performance with the addition of zero valent iron using operational conditions as inputs xu et al 2021 vendruscolo et al applied a ml approach to microbiome community data to identify the key functional microbes in ad systems vendruscolo et al 2020 however these models based on feedstock characteristics or genomic data provide limited understanding of the ad system and prediction ability with space for improvement with the recent development of 16s rrna gene sequencing techniques community analysis emerges as a novel method to decipher which components of the microbial community can influence the macroscopic properties osman et al 2018 in various bioreactors although certain microbial species have been found to affect the reactor performance the complexity of the metabolic pathways and the diverse microbial communities calls for the use of ml predictions about changes in macroscopic properties lesnik and liu used artifical neural network ann to predict the changes of microbial community composition as the result of various environmental stresses in microbial fuel cells lesnik and liu 2017 cai et al employed classification models using various machine learning algorithms to predict substrate types by microbial community compositions cai et al 2019 unfortunately the use of these techniques in ad systems using genomic data have not been applied according to published research the ml development based on the different taxonomic levels and the identification of key microbial species have not been fully studied and discussed in ad and any other systems the identification of the important bacterial and or archaeal groups in determining the ad performance using ml tools have not been fully studied yet in addition the conventional ad operational parameters such as waste types hrts and volatile fatty acids vfas affect the microbial communities and the system performance thus incorporating genomic data and operational parameters into the dataset could potentially lead to a novel model with accurate prediction this study provides a proof of concept of developing ml models using genomic data and operational parameters to predict ad performance and improve the understanding of the ad process samples collected from different research groups were used for the model training and validation to determine the most suitable algorithms for predicting methane yield six traditional ml algorithms including glmnet rf knn svm nnet and extreme gradient boosting xgboost were used to develop regression and classification models the feature importance analysis by rf was used to gain insights in reactor performance variations and microbial community shifts the most important bacterial and archaeal groups at different levels that could affect methane production were identified and discussed a potential control strategy based on the developed models was proposed and discussed to guide future operations 2 materials and methods 2 1 dataset details genomic datasets 50 samples from lab scale ad reactors and their corresponding operational parameters were collected from 8 research groups allen et al 2014 chen et al 2018 guo et al 2014 leite et al 2016 li et al 2016 peng et al 2018 tan et al 2019 zamanzadeh et al 2016 table s1 showed the sample details the operational parameters include vfas mg l temperature mesophilic thermophilic olrs g vs l d hrt day and waste types sequences of 18 samples were carried out by roche 454 sequencing and the remaining 32 samples were sequenced by illumina sequencing on the miseq platform there were 30 samples for food waste feed 9 samples for macro algae feed 8 samples for piggery bagasse feed and 3 samples for sewage sludge feed 15 samples were under the thermophilic condition and the remaining 35 samples were under the mesophilic condition 2 2 sequence analysis and dataset pretreatment the raw sequencing data was obtained from national center for biotechnology information and analyzed using the previously described method as detailed in text s1 in si cai et al 2019 the input datasets for ml algorithms included the phylum and order taxonomic levels of bacteria with a relative abundance higher than 0 1 the order level and genus level of archaea with a relative abundance higher than 0 1 the operational parameters alone and the combination of operational parameters and bacterial relative abundances the input datasets were normalized before the model development the goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values in this study all the data points were normalized from 0 to 1 using the following equation 1 x n e w x x m i n x m a x x m i n 2 3 ml model development glmnet rf nnet knn svm and xgboost were selected for the development of both classification and regression models because they were commonly used in prediction fields and were reported as the foremost classifiers at producing high accuracy cai et al 2019 noi et al 2017 wainer 2016 the brief description and parameter settings of these 6 algorithms were presented in text s2 in si the inputs for each algorithm include genomic data and operational parameters the output for regression model was methane yield l g vs which was obtained or calculated based on the data from the original publications the output for classification model was methane yield that was classified into 3 equal width bins ranging from minimum to the maximum namely low 0 1 l g vs to 0 25 l g vs medium 0 25 l g vs to 0 4 l g vs and high 0 4 l g vs to 0 55 l g vs respectively the whole datasets were randomly separated into training datasets and validation datasets with a ratio of 8 2 based on the scaling law guyon 1997 multivariate analyses including principal component analysis pca and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds were performed using the scikit learn package under the python platform to examine the correlations between inputs and output buitinck et al 2013 2 4 prediction accuracy evaluation for each algorithm datasets were randomly separated into training n 40 and validation groups n 10 classification models which predict the types of methane yield were evaluated by accuracy and kappa coefficient accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified instances out of all instances kappa coefficients were used to measure the inter rater reliability for classification models kappa coefficients 0 indicate no agreement 0 0 0 20 slight agreement 0 21 0 40 as fair 0 41 0 60 as moderate and 0 61 0 80 substantial wan et al 2015 the following evaluation data were resampled for 30 times to get mean accuracy and kappa coefficients regression models which predict the specific methane yields were also developed and evaluated the prediction accuracy was determined by direct comparison between real methane production and predicted methane production using root means square error rmse and relative rmse which were calculated as described previously barnston 1992 the importance of each selected feature was evaluated by mean decrease gini mdg and incnodepurity for the classification model and the regression model respectively using caret r package kuhn 2008 3 results 3 1 predicting ad performance by ml using operational parameters statistically methods pca and nmds were implemented first to preliminarily investigate the correlation between operational parameters and methane yield the first two principal coordinates were displayed to visualize the dissimilarity distances and variation between samples fig 1 the pca showed clear distribution between different methane yields which indicated that the different operation conditions would affect the ad performance similar results were also found with the nmds analysis using operational parameters fig s1 although pca nmds could demonstrate the distinct distribution under different operation conditions it may miss some hidden relationships between the original input features and the output features during the dimensional reduction which limited the application of these methods on the prediction of the ad systems therefore the hidden correlation between input and output features calls for advanced data mining techniques to predict ad performance based on operation conditions to examine the feasibility of predicting ad performance using ml models 6 ml algorithms were evaluated in terms of their accuracy and kappa values in predicting methane yield fig 2 the model developed using rf demonstrated the highest accuracy 0 77 0 04 corresponding to a kappa value of 0 67 0 06 presenting substantial reliability according to the standards for the strength of agreement the relative high accuracy 0 77 achieved using rf was possibly due to its advantage in handling categorical data and unbalanced data pal 2005 the prediction of the models trained by glmnet svm and nnet showed similar accuracy 0 75 the prediction accuracy using the xgbost algorithm was 0 72 which was higher than the accuracy obtained in a previous study 0 66 using the same algorithm de clercq et al 2019 the accuracy of knn model was 0 70 0 07 with the kappa value of 0 54 0 08 moderate reliability which was the lowest possibly due to its inability to handle imbalanced dataset de carvalho and prati 2018 the accuracy has the potential to be further improved by increasing the number of input features on the other hand the operational parameters may affect the microbial communities which was increasingly believed to be one of the most critical parameters that determine the ad performance thus expanding the datasets especially including microbial community data might greatly enhance the prediction accuracy and improve the understanding of the ad process such as the identification of the key microbial players and the relationships between microbial species and methane yield 3 2 predicting ad performance by ml using genomic data qualitatively linking the species richness and evenness to ad performance could improve the prediction accuracy and reveal the latent relationships between methane yield and operational parameters therefore the microbial communities of 50 samples from different research labs were first characterized in terms of the relative abundance of bacterial and archaea then the 6 ml algorithms discussed previously were used to develop classification and regression models to predict the performance of ad systems using bacterial and archaeal genomic data separately the importance of the community members on ad performance was also evaluated 3 2 1 characterization of microbial communities corresponding to methane yield the taxonomic distributions of the bacterial and archaeal communities corresponding to the three methane yield groups at different taxonomical levels were illustrated in fig 3 for bacterial communities the relative abundances of the most dominant phylum firmicutes were 45 8 41 and 46 8 for low medium and high methane yields respectively followed by the phylum bacteroidetes with the abundance of 29 11 and 22 interestingly the relative abundance of phylum thermotagae among the three groups had a significant difference only 0 5 of the thermotagae were in the low methane yield group but 35 and 13 were in the medium and high methane yield groups at order level all three methane yield groups harbored clostridiales with the relative abundance of 32 29 and 33 followed by bacteroides 28 9 and 28 and thermoanaerobacterales 12 6 and 13 which were the common constituents of anaerobic digester as for the order petrotogales its distribution was significantly different for the low 0 4 medium 31 and high 11 groups the taxonomic distributions of the archaeal communities were analyzed at order and genus levels since all the archaeal communities belong to the phylum euryarchaeota compared to the bacterial communities the archaeal communities were less diversified as illustrated in fig 3 the dominant order was methanosarcinales accounting for 53 57 and 74 for low medium and high methane yield respectively the second most dominant order was methanobacteriales accounting for 30 37 and 18 respectively the communities of the low methane yield groups showed the highest population of methanomicrobiales 12 at genus level methanosarcina accounting for 49 51 was the most dominant genus in all three groups followed by methanothermobacter accounting for 14 37 and 14 for the low medium and high groups respectively methanoculleus was the most sensitive genus under the different groups with high abundance in the low methane yields groups 12 but low relative abundance in the medium 0 78 and high 4 methane yield groups 3 2 2 prediction of methane yield using classification models the distribution of methane yield according to bacterial genomic data phylum level was also analyzed by the pca however there is no clear difference between the distribution of high methane yield and that of medium methane yield fig s2 due to the dimensionality reduction process therefore it is necessary to develop machine learning models using various algorithms to predict the reactor performance and to better understand the process dynamics all 6 ml algorithms were trained and evaluated to study their prediction abilities using the different taxonomic ranks of bacterial genomic data table s2 the initial model was trained and validated using the dataset including 26 phyla which included all the phylum with relative abundance higher than 0 1 as shown in fig 4 a the algorithm that generated the most accurate prediction was rf with an accuracy of 0 78 0 04 corresponding to a kappa value of 0 65 0 06 the nnet svm glmnet and xgboost algorithms achieved a slight decrease in accuracy range from 0 66 to 0 71 with kappa values ranging from 0 49 to 0 60 the knn showed the lowest prediction performance with an accuracy of 0 60 0 03 and a kappa value of 0 35 0 06 possibility due to the lack of sensitivity of knn handling imbalanced dataset zhang and zhou 2007 these ml algorithms were also evaluated using the dataset including 92 orders as shown in fig 4b the rf algorithm also achieved the highest accuracy of 0 757 0 047 and a kappa value of 0 628 0 072 the nnet algorithm using the order dataset produced a slight increase of accuracy 4 and kappa value 6 compared with the phyla based model the svm showed the lowest prediction performance with 0 660 0 053 accuracy and 0 471 0 076 kappa value which is still considered as moderate inter agreement kappa 0 4 wan et al 2015 the low prediction performance of svm could be due to its high sensitivity to the large number of features which may cause overfitting during resampling each time cawley and talbot 2010 the ml algorithms were not evaluated using the genomic data at genus level because the large number of features and the limited number of samples could cause problems such as model overfitting and curse of dimensionality the 6 ml algorithms were also evaluated using the different taxonomic ranks of archaeal genomic data fig 4c and fig 4d at order level the model was trained using 4 dominant orders with the abundance higher than 0 1 rf and xgboost showed the highest prediction performance with the accuracy values of 0 68 0 06 and 0 66 0 06 respectively followed by knn nnet and svm with the accuracy values of 0 59 0 05 0 51 0 06 and 0 46 0 05 respectively the glmnet gave the lowest prediction accuracy with an accuracy value of 0 42 0 06 possibly due to the insufficient input features which may lead to the failure of identifying the relationship between the input and methane yield groups at genus level 17 dominant genera abundance 0 1 were used to evaluate the 6 ml algorithms the prediction accuracy of rf and xgboost were both 0 73 0 05 with kappa values of 0 59 0 07 and 0 58 0 07 which were slightly increased compared with the order based model p 0 05 the prediction performance of glmnet accuracy 0 68 0 05 kappa 0 52 0 07 increased significantly p 0 05 compared with the order based model accuracy 0 42 0 06 kappa 0 11 0 08 the svm s performance was the worst among the 6 algorithms which was only 0 52 0 06 with a kappa value of 0 47 0 10 due to the same reason discussed previously rf showed the best prediction performance among different taxonomic levels bacterial phyla bacterial orders archaeal orders and archaeal genera possibly due to its capability of handling a great deal of input variables without variable deletion pal 2005 although rf produced an insignificant increase of 1 using bacterial phyla dataset compared with using operational parameters p 0 05 in this study using the genomic data has a higher potential for further improvement due to the large number of valuable features the prediction performance of ml algorithms using bacterial datasets achieved higher accuracy than using archaeal datasets based on the collected data indicating a strong relationship between methane production and bacterial community involved in the hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis of the ad process in these studies the lower archaeal taxonomic level from order to genus increased the prediction accuracy since more valuable information about the functions of the communities could be provided by the genus level jang et al 2014 however the decrease of the bacterial taxonomic level from phylum to order failed to improve the prediction accuracy possibly due to the imbalanced dataset of bacterial only 50 data points with 26 phyla 92 orders the accuracy could be improved significantly by increasing the number of the samples and further identifying the valuable features 3 2 3 feature importance evaluation feature importance was evaluated using rf to quantify the importance of each taxonomic unit on ad performance the importance of phyla and orders on methane yield was shown in fig 5 the phyla chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaetae were the top 5 most important features with relative abundance ranging from 0 1 to 3 1 which have been proven to play significant roles during the ad process zhao et al 2017 the phylum spirochaetae was the most important discriminating feature with an mdg value of 3 71 corresponding to a relative abundance of 1 1 spirochaetae has been reported to degrade propionate butyrate valerate and other organic compounds into acetate which could be directly consumed by methanogens shen et al 2018 the second most important feature was fibrobacteres with an mdg value of 3 47 corresponding to a relative abundance of 0 2 fibrobacteres is a typical phylum that has been reported to break down cellulose in its peri cytoplasm for absorption chen et al 2019 as for phylum chloroflexi the mdg value was 3 33 with a relative abundance of 3 1 chloroflexi was reported as the dominant acidogenic bacterium in ad capable of degrading amino acids glycerol glucose and other polysaccharides yi et al 2014 the mdg value of actinobacteria was 2 93 with a relative abundance of 4 9 actinobacteria plays the important role in hydrolysis and acidogenesis process within the phylum actinobacteria a large quantity of sequences were associated with the propionate producing bacteria nelson et al 2011 proteobacteria with an mdg value of 2 81 corresponding to a relative abundance of 3 5 could involve in the hydrolysis and acidification of ad system as proteobacteria contains several members capable of utilizing the glucose propionate butyrate and acetate de vrieze et al 2015 nelson et al 2011 at order level the most influential features included erysipelotrichales mdg 2 05 desulfovibrionales mdg 1 78 anaerolineales mdg 1 75 fibrobacterales mdg 1 66 and bacillales mdg 1 37 however these orders were grouped into minors only with the relative abundance of 1 0 0 1 3 0 0 2 and 0 1 respectively fig 5b the functions of these orders were related to the anaerobic hydrolysis and acidification process except desulfovibrionales de vrieze et al 2015 ramasamy et al 2013 yamada et al 2007 desulfovibrionales is sulfate reducing bacteria which belong to the phylum proteobacteria with an increase in sulfate level methane formation decreased while the sulfide production increased and sulfate reducing bacteria predominantly consumed hydrogen mizuno et al 1998 moreover the difference of key microbials at phylum and order level was also noticed for example erysipelotrichales is the suborder of bacteria of the phylum firmicutes which was identified as the minor important predictor at phylum level while erysipelotrichales was considered as the important predictor at order level the difference of microbial community abundances between phylum and order levels led to the different type and number of inputs to the ml models which affected the model prediction accuracy and the feature importance identification cai et al 2019 the feature importance of the orders and genera of archaea were also identified at order level the most important predictor mdg 7 68 was methanomicrobiales with relative abundance of 7 8 on the other hand the methanosarcinales which had an average relative abundance of 59 2 was less important mdg 5 54 compared to the methanomicrobiales and the thermoplasmatales mdg 6 73 at genus level the methanoculleus mdg 4 20 and methanobrevibacter mdg 4 16 were the most important features the genus methanoculleus is the key methanogen genera in ad process which is related to the stability of the ad performance suarez et al 2018 the species within in methanobrevibacter were found to be the dominant methanogens in mesophilic anaerobic digester which were reported to be resistant to total ammonia nitrogen tan and vfas concentrations molaey et al 2018 the ranking of the predictors might be affected by input features and data size further study is warranted to verify the rankings these feature important results suggested that the high relative abundance microbes might not play the critical roles in determining the methane yield for example in the phyla bacterial dataset firmicutes 43 7 and bacteroidetes 23 2 were dominant in all digesters which can contribute to the hydrolysis and acidification processes in ad systems ma et al 2019 however firmicutes mdg 0 64 and bacteroidetes mdg 1 16 were identified as the relatively less important features on the contrary the relative abundances of the top 5 predictors at phylum level were low with a range of 0 2 3 1 in other words some strong predictors among the phylum level were the low abundant constituents similarly at order level clostridiales mdg 0 27 was also considered the weak predictor even this order was reported to play a key role in the fermentative hydrogen production ziganshin et al 2016 thus the functionally critical species might not be critical as well in quantitatively determining the ad performance similar results also could be generated from archaeal datasets this is a novel finding of this study however further studies are warranted to unravel such a unique phenomenon 3 2 4 prediction of methane yield using regression models the feasibility of numerical prediction of methane production using the 6 ml algorithms at various taxonomical levels were also evaluated table s3 the accuracy was examined by comparing predicted values with the real values in the validation dataset which were represented by rmse for the bacterial dataset all 6 algorithms demonstrated promising prediction accuracy for most validations though the accuracy for higher methane production was generally low at phylum level fig 6 nnet yielded the best prediction accuracy rmse 0 039 followed by knn rmse 0 048 and xgboost rmse 0 051 with the methane yield ranging from 0 1 to 0 55 l ch4 g vsadd for all the samples in this study svm had the worst prediction accuracy rmse 0 121 possibly due to its high sensitivity to noisy data cawley and talbot 2010 the prediction accuracy at order level was also examined and found similar to that at phylum level the most accurate algorithm was nnet with the lowest rmse 0 046 the svm 0 138 also showed the worst performance among 6 algorithms compared to the bacterial regression model the numerical prediction of methane production among the archaeal community showed different results fig 7 at order level the rf and nnet had the highest accuracy values with rmse of 0 043 and 0 042 the rmses of xgboost glmnet svm and knn were 0 146 0 093 0 127 and 0 140 respectively the accuracy of all algorithms at genus level showed similar results with the rmses 0 053 for rf and 0 046 for nnet and 0 122 0 184 for the remaining algorithms the feature importance of the regression model at different taxonomic ranks were also evaluated fig s3 at phylum level the phyla chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaetae were considered as the most important features although their rankings were varying from the feature importance generated by classification models the reason might be the different focuses of these two models the feature importance of the regression model focused on identifying the important microbes that affect the numeric change of the methane yield similar results also could be concluded at different taxonomic levels these results demonstrated that the nnet algorithm had the best performance using the genomic data at all the taxonomic levels the rmse were 0 039 relative rmse 8 7 0 046 relative rmse 10 2 0 042 relative rmse 9 3 and 0 046 relative rmse 10 2 at bacterial phylum level bacterial order level archaeal order level and archaeal genus level respectively in our previous study the lowest rmse was obtained by svm 68 6 ml l d with the data range of 259 0 to 573 8 ml l d wang et al 2020 using the operational parameters as the only input indicating that the prediction performance using conventional operational parameters relative rmse 21 8 was lower than using genomic dataset the algorithm s accuracy has the potential to be further improved through modifications on feature selection and optimization of algorithm parameters 3 3 predicting ad performance by ml using both operational parameters and genomic data although using either operational parameters or genomic data can predict the performance of ad process with the accuracy of ranging from 0 60 to 0 78 the prediction accuracy has potential to be further improved by combining the operational parameters and genomic data as input therefore the classification models using 6 algorithms were evaluated in terms of their prediction abilities using the combined dataset fig 8 the input features contain the 5 operational parameters mentioned in section 3 1 and the 26 bacterial phyla in section 3 2 which demonstrated highest accuracy compared to using bacterial order dataset and archaeal dataset as input for classification models the accuracy values of all algorithms were higher than 0 7 and the kappa values remained above 0 6 substantial agreement the algorithm that achieved the most accurate prediction was rf with an accuracy of 0 82 0 05 which was higher than that using genomic data alone accuracy 0 78 0 04 kappa 0 65 0 06 and using operational parameters alone accuracy 0 77 0 04 kappa 0 67 0 06 the regression models using 6 different ml algorithms were also developed and evaluated fig s4 the xgboost and rf showed best prediction among six algorithms with rmse of 0 056 and 0 068 respectively rmse were 0 114 0 134 and 0 126 for glmnet knn and svm respectively the reason that the rmse of nnet 0 094 increased comparing with regression model using phyla datasets possibly due to the limitation of nnet algorithms itself not all regions operational parameters from the input domain are conductive to find the adversarial result and lead to extreme neural network output variations papernot et al 2016 the feature importance was also determined by rf to quantify the impact of the operational parameters and bacterial groups on ad performance fig 9 the top 5 strongest predictors were proteobacteria mdg 2 71 chloroflexi mdg 2 64 fibrobacteres mdg 2 63 actinobacteria mdg 2 61 and spirochaetae mdg 2 34 which were also the top 5 strongest predictors using bacterial phylum dataset the waste type mdg 2 21 and the vfas mdg 1 56 were identified as the influential predictors top 10 most important predictors indicating that these operational parameters could also be critical in determining ad performance the olrs mdg 1 02 and hrts mdg 0 72 which could be manipulated directly were considered as the influential parameters that could affect the ad performance temperature mdg 0 59 was not a significant feature among all operational parameters possibly due to the only two narrow categories mesophilic or thermophilic were labeled in this study 4 discussion the operation of anaerobic digesters has experienced issues with unexpected perturbations in biogas production organic reduction due to the diversity and variability of feed streams and complexity of the ad microbial process which impedes the ad applications mata alvarez et al 2014 weiland 2010 modeling of the ad process has been developed to improve understanding of the complex anaerobic system and to predict how the system responds to changes in environment conditions compared with the traditional mathematical models based on biochemical kinetics that focused on the dynamic changes of the anaerobic systems the high accuracies achieved in this study using ml models with genomic data and operational parameters from 8 research groups demonstrated the great potential of ml in various dynamic conditions selection of suitable algorithms and ml models is critical for predicting the performance of ad system in classification models rf yields the best prediction accuracies among six ml algorithms with various input datasets operational parameters 0 78 bacterial phyla 0 78 bacterial orders 0 76 archaeal orders 0 68 archaeal genera 0 73 and combined dataset 0 82 compared to the classification model mainly focusing on the identification of important parameters for performance prediction the regression model is more suitable for numerical prediction of methane yield the nnet yielded the best accuracy in regression model with the lowest relative rmse 6 7 15 6 using the same input datasets as the classification models the success of ml prediction is also dependent on the selection of input datasets in this study the highest prediction accuracy was achieved using the dataset that combined operational parameters and microbiome information for both classification and regression models this result suggested that incorporating microbiome information into operational parameters as inputs could improve the prediction performance decreasing the archaeal taxonomic level from order to genus increased prediction as expected surprisingly the decrease of the bacterial taxonomic level from phylum to order failed to improve the prediction accuracy possibly due to the small data size used in this study the model prediction accuracy could be further enhanced by increasing the size of datasets with proper selection of the input features the ml models developed in this study not only could predict the ad performance accurately but important features identified also could provide guidance for early warning and process control and management for example at the bacterial phylum level the top five most important features were phyla chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaetae with relative abundance ranging from 0 1 to 3 1 which were related to the anaerobic hydrolysis and acidification process although the relative abundances of these microbiomes were low the ad performance was highly dependent on these microbes based on the relationship of the individual bacterial phylum and methane yield these microbes can be used as indicators for instability warning and guaranteeing system function fig s5 further study will focus on analyzing the combination of several functional species to gain additional in depth understanding of the ad process moreover by managing the microbiomes through adjusting the relative abundances and community structures the stability and performance of ad could be improved an artificial microbiome could also be developed through the combination of important microbes the key microbes identified through ml could provide guidance for operation and reduce the lab work the microbial community compositions could also be manipulated through operational parameters fig 10 illustrates the proposed development of the ml models for the prediction of ad performance and the establishment of control strategies based on the key operational and microbial parameters identified by ml the control model can be developed to provide the optimal setting of each parameter to maximize the biogas production the control strategy has the potential to be further enhanced through extending the controllable operational parameters such as the waste nutrient ph and reactor configuration by developing the control strategy based on ml model it enables quick process stabilization with less operation and maintenance inconveniences increasing energy efficiency 5 conclusions this research shows that using ml algorithms to model the complex ad system is efficient as ml can predict and model non linear interactions hidden in datasets this study provides a new implementation of ml algorithms that can be used not only in ad performance prediction but also for the guidance of ad operations by incorporating genomic data and ml algorithms classification and regression models can be developed to predict the methane yield this study is the first to quantify the importance of microbial community members for methane production and evaluate the predictability of 6 ml algorithms comprehensively using different input features for the classification models rf achieves the best performance among the 6 ml algorithms for predicting methane yield the prediction accuracies were 0 77 and 0 78 using operational parameters alone and genomic data at the bacterial phylum level alone respectively the combination of operational parameters and genomic data improved the prediction accuracy significantly to 0 82 p 0 05 chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaeta were identified as the top 5 most important phyla however their relative abundances were ranging only from 0 1 to 3 1 suggesting that the functionally critical species might not be critical as well in quantitatively determining the ad performance the key species identified by the feature importance could be used as indicators for instability warning and guaranteeing system function these identified microbial features can also be used to develop control strategies to potentially further improve ad performance for the regression models nnet demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy with an rmse of 0 04 relative rmse 8 9 using genomic data the prediction accuracy has the potential to be further improved by increasing the data size and specific input features used in conjunction with empirical lab scale studies and mechanistic models the ml models can further enhance our understanding of the system and improve the control strategies this study may also help to provide valuable information for using the ml technique in other complex environmental and energy biosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16960,modeling of anaerobic digestion ad is crucial to better understand the process dynamics and to improve the digester performance this is an essential yet difficult task due to the complex and unknown interactions within the system the application of well developed data mining technologies such as machine learning ml and microbial gene sequencing techniques are promising in overcoming these challenges in this study we investigated the feasibility of 6 ml algorithms using genomic data and their corresponding operational parameters from 8 research groups to predict methane yield for classification models random forest rf achieved accuracies of 0 77 using operational parameters alone and 0 78 using genomic data at the bacterial phylum level alone the combination of operational parameters and genomic data improved the prediction accuracy to 0 82 p 0 05 for regression models a low root mean square error of 0 04 relative root mean square error 8 6 was acquired by neural network using genomic data at the bacterial phylum level alone feature importance analysis by rf suggested that chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaeta were the top 5 most important phyla although their relative abundances were ranging only from 0 1 to 3 1 the important features identified could provide guidance for early warning and proactive management of microbial communities this study demonstrated the promising application of ml techniques for predicting and controlling ad performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords machine learning anaerobic digestion genomic data performance prediction control strategy 1 introduction with the growing global concern around increasing depletion of non renewable fossil energy and the aggravated environmental pollution the search for alternative methods to develop and utilize sustainable energy has been a topic of major demand anaerobic digestion ad is a well recognized process that converts organic waste and wastewater into biomethane to harvest energy which is a promising means of addressing global energy needs and providing multiple environmental benefits linville et al 2015 naroznova et al 2016 according to the us epa s report in 2018 more than 1200 industrial grade anaerobic digesters were operated incorporating water resource recovery facilities and other 248 digesters were operated on livestock farms pennington 2018 in europe over 17 240 operational ad plants produced 63 3 twh of electricity from biogas equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of 14 6 million european households in 2014 association 2015 the ad process generally involves four interrelated phases hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis that require the complex synergy of multiple groups of anaerobic microorganisms during each stage appels et al 2011 the quantities and activities of these microorganisms behind this four stage process and the performance of ad could be influenced by factors such as waste wastewater types organic loading rates olrs volatile fatty acid compositions temperatures and hydraulic retention times hrts mcleod et al 2015 rabii et al 2019 wang et al 2018 due to the diversity and variability of feed streams and the complexity of the ad microbial process the operation of anaerobic digesters has experienced issues with unexpected perturbations in biogas production organic reduction leading to inferior digestion performance and high operation cost mata alvarez et al 2014 weiland 2010 modeling of ad process is crucial to better understand the process dynamics and to improve the digester performance lauwers et al 2013 during the last two decades a few mechanistic models were constructed using differential mass balance equations to reflect the dynamic process ramírez rivas 2013 a well known mechanistic model anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 which contains a set of reaction kinetic equations that could simulate the biochemical related to the microbial community and physicochemical related to the liquid or gaseous state of the variables processes has been widely used to simulate the ad system batstone et al 2002 the adm1 model improves the understanding of the ad process the prediction of the system s behavior under different conditions reducing the experimental requirements costs risk and time donoso bravo et al 2011 however its performance is limited by the insufficient consideration of physicochemical and biochemical processes due to the complexity of the metabolic pathways and microbial species involved batstone et al 2015 the synergistic pathways and the latent connections between the reactor performance and the kinetic parameters still need more explicit analysis nguyen et al 2019 for these reasons the adm1 model has its limitations to predict the performance of ad in practice recent improvements in computational power have afforded the development of machine learning ml as a data mining and model development tool for pattern recognition statistics and optimization witten et al 2016 in contrast to mechanistic models following mass and energy balances or physical and chemical laws ml models make data driven predictions and have been proven to be a powerful tool in microbial ecology and systems biology research the data mining techniques provide a means to analyze high dimensional microbial community data or other metagenomic features such as gene families or metabolic pathways and find the hidden trends among the data qu et al 2019 yu and liu 2003 recently ml models have been used to predict the ad performance based on feedstock characteristics and or process parameters xu et al dong and chen examined the neural networks nnet and support vector machines svm respectively to numerically predict methane production from digestion dong and chen 2019 xu et al 2014 clercq et al trained a number of ml models using different algorithms including tree boosting algorithms and k nearest neighbors knn to predict the anaerobic digester performance based on fluctuating values of biowaste input de clercq et al 2019 wang et al used both random forest rf and logistic regression multiclass glmnet to predict the methane production using defined components in substrate as input feature wang et al 2020 moreover ml models also have been applied to understand and optimize the ad process the hybrid of artificial neural network ann and genetic algorithm ga was used to simulate ad process and to optimize biogas production based on feedstock characteristics abu qdais et al 2010 barik and murugan 2015 kazemi et al used different data driven methods to evaluate the relationship between vfa concentration and operation conditions during ad process kazemi et al 2020 xu et al developed ml models to predict and optimize the ad performance with the addition of zero valent iron using operational conditions as inputs xu et al 2021 vendruscolo et al applied a ml approach to microbiome community data to identify the key functional microbes in ad systems vendruscolo et al 2020 however these models based on feedstock characteristics or genomic data provide limited understanding of the ad system and prediction ability with space for improvement with the recent development of 16s rrna gene sequencing techniques community analysis emerges as a novel method to decipher which components of the microbial community can influence the macroscopic properties osman et al 2018 in various bioreactors although certain microbial species have been found to affect the reactor performance the complexity of the metabolic pathways and the diverse microbial communities calls for the use of ml predictions about changes in macroscopic properties lesnik and liu used artifical neural network ann to predict the changes of microbial community composition as the result of various environmental stresses in microbial fuel cells lesnik and liu 2017 cai et al employed classification models using various machine learning algorithms to predict substrate types by microbial community compositions cai et al 2019 unfortunately the use of these techniques in ad systems using genomic data have not been applied according to published research the ml development based on the different taxonomic levels and the identification of key microbial species have not been fully studied and discussed in ad and any other systems the identification of the important bacterial and or archaeal groups in determining the ad performance using ml tools have not been fully studied yet in addition the conventional ad operational parameters such as waste types hrts and volatile fatty acids vfas affect the microbial communities and the system performance thus incorporating genomic data and operational parameters into the dataset could potentially lead to a novel model with accurate prediction this study provides a proof of concept of developing ml models using genomic data and operational parameters to predict ad performance and improve the understanding of the ad process samples collected from different research groups were used for the model training and validation to determine the most suitable algorithms for predicting methane yield six traditional ml algorithms including glmnet rf knn svm nnet and extreme gradient boosting xgboost were used to develop regression and classification models the feature importance analysis by rf was used to gain insights in reactor performance variations and microbial community shifts the most important bacterial and archaeal groups at different levels that could affect methane production were identified and discussed a potential control strategy based on the developed models was proposed and discussed to guide future operations 2 materials and methods 2 1 dataset details genomic datasets 50 samples from lab scale ad reactors and their corresponding operational parameters were collected from 8 research groups allen et al 2014 chen et al 2018 guo et al 2014 leite et al 2016 li et al 2016 peng et al 2018 tan et al 2019 zamanzadeh et al 2016 table s1 showed the sample details the operational parameters include vfas mg l temperature mesophilic thermophilic olrs g vs l d hrt day and waste types sequences of 18 samples were carried out by roche 454 sequencing and the remaining 32 samples were sequenced by illumina sequencing on the miseq platform there were 30 samples for food waste feed 9 samples for macro algae feed 8 samples for piggery bagasse feed and 3 samples for sewage sludge feed 15 samples were under the thermophilic condition and the remaining 35 samples were under the mesophilic condition 2 2 sequence analysis and dataset pretreatment the raw sequencing data was obtained from national center for biotechnology information and analyzed using the previously described method as detailed in text s1 in si cai et al 2019 the input datasets for ml algorithms included the phylum and order taxonomic levels of bacteria with a relative abundance higher than 0 1 the order level and genus level of archaea with a relative abundance higher than 0 1 the operational parameters alone and the combination of operational parameters and bacterial relative abundances the input datasets were normalized before the model development the goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values in this study all the data points were normalized from 0 to 1 using the following equation 1 x n e w x x m i n x m a x x m i n 2 3 ml model development glmnet rf nnet knn svm and xgboost were selected for the development of both classification and regression models because they were commonly used in prediction fields and were reported as the foremost classifiers at producing high accuracy cai et al 2019 noi et al 2017 wainer 2016 the brief description and parameter settings of these 6 algorithms were presented in text s2 in si the inputs for each algorithm include genomic data and operational parameters the output for regression model was methane yield l g vs which was obtained or calculated based on the data from the original publications the output for classification model was methane yield that was classified into 3 equal width bins ranging from minimum to the maximum namely low 0 1 l g vs to 0 25 l g vs medium 0 25 l g vs to 0 4 l g vs and high 0 4 l g vs to 0 55 l g vs respectively the whole datasets were randomly separated into training datasets and validation datasets with a ratio of 8 2 based on the scaling law guyon 1997 multivariate analyses including principal component analysis pca and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds were performed using the scikit learn package under the python platform to examine the correlations between inputs and output buitinck et al 2013 2 4 prediction accuracy evaluation for each algorithm datasets were randomly separated into training n 40 and validation groups n 10 classification models which predict the types of methane yield were evaluated by accuracy and kappa coefficient accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified instances out of all instances kappa coefficients were used to measure the inter rater reliability for classification models kappa coefficients 0 indicate no agreement 0 0 0 20 slight agreement 0 21 0 40 as fair 0 41 0 60 as moderate and 0 61 0 80 substantial wan et al 2015 the following evaluation data were resampled for 30 times to get mean accuracy and kappa coefficients regression models which predict the specific methane yields were also developed and evaluated the prediction accuracy was determined by direct comparison between real methane production and predicted methane production using root means square error rmse and relative rmse which were calculated as described previously barnston 1992 the importance of each selected feature was evaluated by mean decrease gini mdg and incnodepurity for the classification model and the regression model respectively using caret r package kuhn 2008 3 results 3 1 predicting ad performance by ml using operational parameters statistically methods pca and nmds were implemented first to preliminarily investigate the correlation between operational parameters and methane yield the first two principal coordinates were displayed to visualize the dissimilarity distances and variation between samples fig 1 the pca showed clear distribution between different methane yields which indicated that the different operation conditions would affect the ad performance similar results were also found with the nmds analysis using operational parameters fig s1 although pca nmds could demonstrate the distinct distribution under different operation conditions it may miss some hidden relationships between the original input features and the output features during the dimensional reduction which limited the application of these methods on the prediction of the ad systems therefore the hidden correlation between input and output features calls for advanced data mining techniques to predict ad performance based on operation conditions to examine the feasibility of predicting ad performance using ml models 6 ml algorithms were evaluated in terms of their accuracy and kappa values in predicting methane yield fig 2 the model developed using rf demonstrated the highest accuracy 0 77 0 04 corresponding to a kappa value of 0 67 0 06 presenting substantial reliability according to the standards for the strength of agreement the relative high accuracy 0 77 achieved using rf was possibly due to its advantage in handling categorical data and unbalanced data pal 2005 the prediction of the models trained by glmnet svm and nnet showed similar accuracy 0 75 the prediction accuracy using the xgbost algorithm was 0 72 which was higher than the accuracy obtained in a previous study 0 66 using the same algorithm de clercq et al 2019 the accuracy of knn model was 0 70 0 07 with the kappa value of 0 54 0 08 moderate reliability which was the lowest possibly due to its inability to handle imbalanced dataset de carvalho and prati 2018 the accuracy has the potential to be further improved by increasing the number of input features on the other hand the operational parameters may affect the microbial communities which was increasingly believed to be one of the most critical parameters that determine the ad performance thus expanding the datasets especially including microbial community data might greatly enhance the prediction accuracy and improve the understanding of the ad process such as the identification of the key microbial players and the relationships between microbial species and methane yield 3 2 predicting ad performance by ml using genomic data qualitatively linking the species richness and evenness to ad performance could improve the prediction accuracy and reveal the latent relationships between methane yield and operational parameters therefore the microbial communities of 50 samples from different research labs were first characterized in terms of the relative abundance of bacterial and archaea then the 6 ml algorithms discussed previously were used to develop classification and regression models to predict the performance of ad systems using bacterial and archaeal genomic data separately the importance of the community members on ad performance was also evaluated 3 2 1 characterization of microbial communities corresponding to methane yield the taxonomic distributions of the bacterial and archaeal communities corresponding to the three methane yield groups at different taxonomical levels were illustrated in fig 3 for bacterial communities the relative abundances of the most dominant phylum firmicutes were 45 8 41 and 46 8 for low medium and high methane yields respectively followed by the phylum bacteroidetes with the abundance of 29 11 and 22 interestingly the relative abundance of phylum thermotagae among the three groups had a significant difference only 0 5 of the thermotagae were in the low methane yield group but 35 and 13 were in the medium and high methane yield groups at order level all three methane yield groups harbored clostridiales with the relative abundance of 32 29 and 33 followed by bacteroides 28 9 and 28 and thermoanaerobacterales 12 6 and 13 which were the common constituents of anaerobic digester as for the order petrotogales its distribution was significantly different for the low 0 4 medium 31 and high 11 groups the taxonomic distributions of the archaeal communities were analyzed at order and genus levels since all the archaeal communities belong to the phylum euryarchaeota compared to the bacterial communities the archaeal communities were less diversified as illustrated in fig 3 the dominant order was methanosarcinales accounting for 53 57 and 74 for low medium and high methane yield respectively the second most dominant order was methanobacteriales accounting for 30 37 and 18 respectively the communities of the low methane yield groups showed the highest population of methanomicrobiales 12 at genus level methanosarcina accounting for 49 51 was the most dominant genus in all three groups followed by methanothermobacter accounting for 14 37 and 14 for the low medium and high groups respectively methanoculleus was the most sensitive genus under the different groups with high abundance in the low methane yields groups 12 but low relative abundance in the medium 0 78 and high 4 methane yield groups 3 2 2 prediction of methane yield using classification models the distribution of methane yield according to bacterial genomic data phylum level was also analyzed by the pca however there is no clear difference between the distribution of high methane yield and that of medium methane yield fig s2 due to the dimensionality reduction process therefore it is necessary to develop machine learning models using various algorithms to predict the reactor performance and to better understand the process dynamics all 6 ml algorithms were trained and evaluated to study their prediction abilities using the different taxonomic ranks of bacterial genomic data table s2 the initial model was trained and validated using the dataset including 26 phyla which included all the phylum with relative abundance higher than 0 1 as shown in fig 4 a the algorithm that generated the most accurate prediction was rf with an accuracy of 0 78 0 04 corresponding to a kappa value of 0 65 0 06 the nnet svm glmnet and xgboost algorithms achieved a slight decrease in accuracy range from 0 66 to 0 71 with kappa values ranging from 0 49 to 0 60 the knn showed the lowest prediction performance with an accuracy of 0 60 0 03 and a kappa value of 0 35 0 06 possibility due to the lack of sensitivity of knn handling imbalanced dataset zhang and zhou 2007 these ml algorithms were also evaluated using the dataset including 92 orders as shown in fig 4b the rf algorithm also achieved the highest accuracy of 0 757 0 047 and a kappa value of 0 628 0 072 the nnet algorithm using the order dataset produced a slight increase of accuracy 4 and kappa value 6 compared with the phyla based model the svm showed the lowest prediction performance with 0 660 0 053 accuracy and 0 471 0 076 kappa value which is still considered as moderate inter agreement kappa 0 4 wan et al 2015 the low prediction performance of svm could be due to its high sensitivity to the large number of features which may cause overfitting during resampling each time cawley and talbot 2010 the ml algorithms were not evaluated using the genomic data at genus level because the large number of features and the limited number of samples could cause problems such as model overfitting and curse of dimensionality the 6 ml algorithms were also evaluated using the different taxonomic ranks of archaeal genomic data fig 4c and fig 4d at order level the model was trained using 4 dominant orders with the abundance higher than 0 1 rf and xgboost showed the highest prediction performance with the accuracy values of 0 68 0 06 and 0 66 0 06 respectively followed by knn nnet and svm with the accuracy values of 0 59 0 05 0 51 0 06 and 0 46 0 05 respectively the glmnet gave the lowest prediction accuracy with an accuracy value of 0 42 0 06 possibly due to the insufficient input features which may lead to the failure of identifying the relationship between the input and methane yield groups at genus level 17 dominant genera abundance 0 1 were used to evaluate the 6 ml algorithms the prediction accuracy of rf and xgboost were both 0 73 0 05 with kappa values of 0 59 0 07 and 0 58 0 07 which were slightly increased compared with the order based model p 0 05 the prediction performance of glmnet accuracy 0 68 0 05 kappa 0 52 0 07 increased significantly p 0 05 compared with the order based model accuracy 0 42 0 06 kappa 0 11 0 08 the svm s performance was the worst among the 6 algorithms which was only 0 52 0 06 with a kappa value of 0 47 0 10 due to the same reason discussed previously rf showed the best prediction performance among different taxonomic levels bacterial phyla bacterial orders archaeal orders and archaeal genera possibly due to its capability of handling a great deal of input variables without variable deletion pal 2005 although rf produced an insignificant increase of 1 using bacterial phyla dataset compared with using operational parameters p 0 05 in this study using the genomic data has a higher potential for further improvement due to the large number of valuable features the prediction performance of ml algorithms using bacterial datasets achieved higher accuracy than using archaeal datasets based on the collected data indicating a strong relationship between methane production and bacterial community involved in the hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis of the ad process in these studies the lower archaeal taxonomic level from order to genus increased the prediction accuracy since more valuable information about the functions of the communities could be provided by the genus level jang et al 2014 however the decrease of the bacterial taxonomic level from phylum to order failed to improve the prediction accuracy possibly due to the imbalanced dataset of bacterial only 50 data points with 26 phyla 92 orders the accuracy could be improved significantly by increasing the number of the samples and further identifying the valuable features 3 2 3 feature importance evaluation feature importance was evaluated using rf to quantify the importance of each taxonomic unit on ad performance the importance of phyla and orders on methane yield was shown in fig 5 the phyla chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaetae were the top 5 most important features with relative abundance ranging from 0 1 to 3 1 which have been proven to play significant roles during the ad process zhao et al 2017 the phylum spirochaetae was the most important discriminating feature with an mdg value of 3 71 corresponding to a relative abundance of 1 1 spirochaetae has been reported to degrade propionate butyrate valerate and other organic compounds into acetate which could be directly consumed by methanogens shen et al 2018 the second most important feature was fibrobacteres with an mdg value of 3 47 corresponding to a relative abundance of 0 2 fibrobacteres is a typical phylum that has been reported to break down cellulose in its peri cytoplasm for absorption chen et al 2019 as for phylum chloroflexi the mdg value was 3 33 with a relative abundance of 3 1 chloroflexi was reported as the dominant acidogenic bacterium in ad capable of degrading amino acids glycerol glucose and other polysaccharides yi et al 2014 the mdg value of actinobacteria was 2 93 with a relative abundance of 4 9 actinobacteria plays the important role in hydrolysis and acidogenesis process within the phylum actinobacteria a large quantity of sequences were associated with the propionate producing bacteria nelson et al 2011 proteobacteria with an mdg value of 2 81 corresponding to a relative abundance of 3 5 could involve in the hydrolysis and acidification of ad system as proteobacteria contains several members capable of utilizing the glucose propionate butyrate and acetate de vrieze et al 2015 nelson et al 2011 at order level the most influential features included erysipelotrichales mdg 2 05 desulfovibrionales mdg 1 78 anaerolineales mdg 1 75 fibrobacterales mdg 1 66 and bacillales mdg 1 37 however these orders were grouped into minors only with the relative abundance of 1 0 0 1 3 0 0 2 and 0 1 respectively fig 5b the functions of these orders were related to the anaerobic hydrolysis and acidification process except desulfovibrionales de vrieze et al 2015 ramasamy et al 2013 yamada et al 2007 desulfovibrionales is sulfate reducing bacteria which belong to the phylum proteobacteria with an increase in sulfate level methane formation decreased while the sulfide production increased and sulfate reducing bacteria predominantly consumed hydrogen mizuno et al 1998 moreover the difference of key microbials at phylum and order level was also noticed for example erysipelotrichales is the suborder of bacteria of the phylum firmicutes which was identified as the minor important predictor at phylum level while erysipelotrichales was considered as the important predictor at order level the difference of microbial community abundances between phylum and order levels led to the different type and number of inputs to the ml models which affected the model prediction accuracy and the feature importance identification cai et al 2019 the feature importance of the orders and genera of archaea were also identified at order level the most important predictor mdg 7 68 was methanomicrobiales with relative abundance of 7 8 on the other hand the methanosarcinales which had an average relative abundance of 59 2 was less important mdg 5 54 compared to the methanomicrobiales and the thermoplasmatales mdg 6 73 at genus level the methanoculleus mdg 4 20 and methanobrevibacter mdg 4 16 were the most important features the genus methanoculleus is the key methanogen genera in ad process which is related to the stability of the ad performance suarez et al 2018 the species within in methanobrevibacter were found to be the dominant methanogens in mesophilic anaerobic digester which were reported to be resistant to total ammonia nitrogen tan and vfas concentrations molaey et al 2018 the ranking of the predictors might be affected by input features and data size further study is warranted to verify the rankings these feature important results suggested that the high relative abundance microbes might not play the critical roles in determining the methane yield for example in the phyla bacterial dataset firmicutes 43 7 and bacteroidetes 23 2 were dominant in all digesters which can contribute to the hydrolysis and acidification processes in ad systems ma et al 2019 however firmicutes mdg 0 64 and bacteroidetes mdg 1 16 were identified as the relatively less important features on the contrary the relative abundances of the top 5 predictors at phylum level were low with a range of 0 2 3 1 in other words some strong predictors among the phylum level were the low abundant constituents similarly at order level clostridiales mdg 0 27 was also considered the weak predictor even this order was reported to play a key role in the fermentative hydrogen production ziganshin et al 2016 thus the functionally critical species might not be critical as well in quantitatively determining the ad performance similar results also could be generated from archaeal datasets this is a novel finding of this study however further studies are warranted to unravel such a unique phenomenon 3 2 4 prediction of methane yield using regression models the feasibility of numerical prediction of methane production using the 6 ml algorithms at various taxonomical levels were also evaluated table s3 the accuracy was examined by comparing predicted values with the real values in the validation dataset which were represented by rmse for the bacterial dataset all 6 algorithms demonstrated promising prediction accuracy for most validations though the accuracy for higher methane production was generally low at phylum level fig 6 nnet yielded the best prediction accuracy rmse 0 039 followed by knn rmse 0 048 and xgboost rmse 0 051 with the methane yield ranging from 0 1 to 0 55 l ch4 g vsadd for all the samples in this study svm had the worst prediction accuracy rmse 0 121 possibly due to its high sensitivity to noisy data cawley and talbot 2010 the prediction accuracy at order level was also examined and found similar to that at phylum level the most accurate algorithm was nnet with the lowest rmse 0 046 the svm 0 138 also showed the worst performance among 6 algorithms compared to the bacterial regression model the numerical prediction of methane production among the archaeal community showed different results fig 7 at order level the rf and nnet had the highest accuracy values with rmse of 0 043 and 0 042 the rmses of xgboost glmnet svm and knn were 0 146 0 093 0 127 and 0 140 respectively the accuracy of all algorithms at genus level showed similar results with the rmses 0 053 for rf and 0 046 for nnet and 0 122 0 184 for the remaining algorithms the feature importance of the regression model at different taxonomic ranks were also evaluated fig s3 at phylum level the phyla chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaetae were considered as the most important features although their rankings were varying from the feature importance generated by classification models the reason might be the different focuses of these two models the feature importance of the regression model focused on identifying the important microbes that affect the numeric change of the methane yield similar results also could be concluded at different taxonomic levels these results demonstrated that the nnet algorithm had the best performance using the genomic data at all the taxonomic levels the rmse were 0 039 relative rmse 8 7 0 046 relative rmse 10 2 0 042 relative rmse 9 3 and 0 046 relative rmse 10 2 at bacterial phylum level bacterial order level archaeal order level and archaeal genus level respectively in our previous study the lowest rmse was obtained by svm 68 6 ml l d with the data range of 259 0 to 573 8 ml l d wang et al 2020 using the operational parameters as the only input indicating that the prediction performance using conventional operational parameters relative rmse 21 8 was lower than using genomic dataset the algorithm s accuracy has the potential to be further improved through modifications on feature selection and optimization of algorithm parameters 3 3 predicting ad performance by ml using both operational parameters and genomic data although using either operational parameters or genomic data can predict the performance of ad process with the accuracy of ranging from 0 60 to 0 78 the prediction accuracy has potential to be further improved by combining the operational parameters and genomic data as input therefore the classification models using 6 algorithms were evaluated in terms of their prediction abilities using the combined dataset fig 8 the input features contain the 5 operational parameters mentioned in section 3 1 and the 26 bacterial phyla in section 3 2 which demonstrated highest accuracy compared to using bacterial order dataset and archaeal dataset as input for classification models the accuracy values of all algorithms were higher than 0 7 and the kappa values remained above 0 6 substantial agreement the algorithm that achieved the most accurate prediction was rf with an accuracy of 0 82 0 05 which was higher than that using genomic data alone accuracy 0 78 0 04 kappa 0 65 0 06 and using operational parameters alone accuracy 0 77 0 04 kappa 0 67 0 06 the regression models using 6 different ml algorithms were also developed and evaluated fig s4 the xgboost and rf showed best prediction among six algorithms with rmse of 0 056 and 0 068 respectively rmse were 0 114 0 134 and 0 126 for glmnet knn and svm respectively the reason that the rmse of nnet 0 094 increased comparing with regression model using phyla datasets possibly due to the limitation of nnet algorithms itself not all regions operational parameters from the input domain are conductive to find the adversarial result and lead to extreme neural network output variations papernot et al 2016 the feature importance was also determined by rf to quantify the impact of the operational parameters and bacterial groups on ad performance fig 9 the top 5 strongest predictors were proteobacteria mdg 2 71 chloroflexi mdg 2 64 fibrobacteres mdg 2 63 actinobacteria mdg 2 61 and spirochaetae mdg 2 34 which were also the top 5 strongest predictors using bacterial phylum dataset the waste type mdg 2 21 and the vfas mdg 1 56 were identified as the influential predictors top 10 most important predictors indicating that these operational parameters could also be critical in determining ad performance the olrs mdg 1 02 and hrts mdg 0 72 which could be manipulated directly were considered as the influential parameters that could affect the ad performance temperature mdg 0 59 was not a significant feature among all operational parameters possibly due to the only two narrow categories mesophilic or thermophilic were labeled in this study 4 discussion the operation of anaerobic digesters has experienced issues with unexpected perturbations in biogas production organic reduction due to the diversity and variability of feed streams and complexity of the ad microbial process which impedes the ad applications mata alvarez et al 2014 weiland 2010 modeling of the ad process has been developed to improve understanding of the complex anaerobic system and to predict how the system responds to changes in environment conditions compared with the traditional mathematical models based on biochemical kinetics that focused on the dynamic changes of the anaerobic systems the high accuracies achieved in this study using ml models with genomic data and operational parameters from 8 research groups demonstrated the great potential of ml in various dynamic conditions selection of suitable algorithms and ml models is critical for predicting the performance of ad system in classification models rf yields the best prediction accuracies among six ml algorithms with various input datasets operational parameters 0 78 bacterial phyla 0 78 bacterial orders 0 76 archaeal orders 0 68 archaeal genera 0 73 and combined dataset 0 82 compared to the classification model mainly focusing on the identification of important parameters for performance prediction the regression model is more suitable for numerical prediction of methane yield the nnet yielded the best accuracy in regression model with the lowest relative rmse 6 7 15 6 using the same input datasets as the classification models the success of ml prediction is also dependent on the selection of input datasets in this study the highest prediction accuracy was achieved using the dataset that combined operational parameters and microbiome information for both classification and regression models this result suggested that incorporating microbiome information into operational parameters as inputs could improve the prediction performance decreasing the archaeal taxonomic level from order to genus increased prediction as expected surprisingly the decrease of the bacterial taxonomic level from phylum to order failed to improve the prediction accuracy possibly due to the small data size used in this study the model prediction accuracy could be further enhanced by increasing the size of datasets with proper selection of the input features the ml models developed in this study not only could predict the ad performance accurately but important features identified also could provide guidance for early warning and process control and management for example at the bacterial phylum level the top five most important features were phyla chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaetae with relative abundance ranging from 0 1 to 3 1 which were related to the anaerobic hydrolysis and acidification process although the relative abundances of these microbiomes were low the ad performance was highly dependent on these microbes based on the relationship of the individual bacterial phylum and methane yield these microbes can be used as indicators for instability warning and guaranteeing system function fig s5 further study will focus on analyzing the combination of several functional species to gain additional in depth understanding of the ad process moreover by managing the microbiomes through adjusting the relative abundances and community structures the stability and performance of ad could be improved an artificial microbiome could also be developed through the combination of important microbes the key microbes identified through ml could provide guidance for operation and reduce the lab work the microbial community compositions could also be manipulated through operational parameters fig 10 illustrates the proposed development of the ml models for the prediction of ad performance and the establishment of control strategies based on the key operational and microbial parameters identified by ml the control model can be developed to provide the optimal setting of each parameter to maximize the biogas production the control strategy has the potential to be further enhanced through extending the controllable operational parameters such as the waste nutrient ph and reactor configuration by developing the control strategy based on ml model it enables quick process stabilization with less operation and maintenance inconveniences increasing energy efficiency 5 conclusions this research shows that using ml algorithms to model the complex ad system is efficient as ml can predict and model non linear interactions hidden in datasets this study provides a new implementation of ml algorithms that can be used not only in ad performance prediction but also for the guidance of ad operations by incorporating genomic data and ml algorithms classification and regression models can be developed to predict the methane yield this study is the first to quantify the importance of microbial community members for methane production and evaluate the predictability of 6 ml algorithms comprehensively using different input features for the classification models rf achieves the best performance among the 6 ml algorithms for predicting methane yield the prediction accuracies were 0 77 and 0 78 using operational parameters alone and genomic data at the bacterial phylum level alone respectively the combination of operational parameters and genomic data improved the prediction accuracy significantly to 0 82 p 0 05 chloroflexi actinobacteria proteobacteria fibrobacteres and spirochaeta were identified as the top 5 most important phyla however their relative abundances were ranging only from 0 1 to 3 1 suggesting that the functionally critical species might not be critical as well in quantitatively determining the ad performance the key species identified by the feature importance could be used as indicators for instability warning and guaranteeing system function these identified microbial features can also be used to develop control strategies to potentially further improve ad performance for the regression models nnet demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy with an rmse of 0 04 relative rmse 8 9 using genomic data the prediction accuracy has the potential to be further improved by increasing the data size and specific input features used in conjunction with empirical lab scale studies and mechanistic models the ml models can further enhance our understanding of the system and improve the control strategies this study may also help to provide valuable information for using the ml technique in other complex environmental and energy biosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16961,the disposal and resource utilization of waste activated sludge was is a big challenge for its high moisture content ionic liquid il 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate emim otf was innovatively used as a conditioner to improve the dewatering performance of was the was was characterized by flocs size three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem zeta potential fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and scanning electron microscope sem for the investigation of intensification mechanism the results showed that the dewatering performance of was conditioned by emim otf was significantly improved the moisture content was successfully decreased to 64 99 0 92 and the intensification mechanism was investigated the results showed that the structures of extracellular polymeric substance eps were destroyed by emim otf it brought a sharp decrease of the contents of polysaccharides ps proteins pn humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa in tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance tb eps structure the inactivation of microbial cells promoted the disintegration of flocs large flocs were converted into unstable small particles and biopolymers in addition the negative charges of was were also neutralized for dissolution of biopolymers in emim otf and the electrostatic repulsion between flocs was weakened emim otf was easily recycled five times the research results indicate that specific il such as emim otf is a potential conditioner to improve the dewatering performance of was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ionic liquid waste activated sludge extracellular polymeric substance dewatering performance 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a heterogeneous colloidal mixture generated from the wastewater treatment plants disposal of was on large scales is a great challenge for the heavy economic and environmental burden it is well known that the handling of was is difficult for its very large output and high moisture content for example the was output of china exceeded 12 million tons dry sludge ds in 2020 jia et al 2020 the annual productions of was in the united states and the european union are approximately 17 8 million tons ds and 9 million tons ds respectively wu et al 2020a the moisture content in was is usually up to 95 maqbool et al 2019 and dewatering has been considered as a promising strategy in reducing was volume dewatering of was is a challenge for its tiny size high organic content and complicated colloidal structure li et al 2020 mechanical dewatering methods have been used to remove water from was however the moisture content is still as high as 80 cai et al 2018 which is far beyond the requirements for the resource utilization of was therefore many researchers constantly explore many new routes to reduce the moisture content in was α amylase and protease were used to loosen the flocs structure by chen chen et al 2015 and the moisture content was reduced from 97 95 to 81 however the conditions of biological enzyme treatment were quite harsh for the sustained cultivation process electrochemical pretreatment was used to improve was dewatering performance by zeng et al zeng et al 2020 and the moisture content of was decreased from 95 1 to 72 0 however serious corrosion of reaction system impeded its further application according to wu s work wu et al 2020b a dewatering method by preconditioning combined with vacuum preloading and freeze dried technology was achieved however it was not suitable for warm region hence exploring feasible dewatering route is still a great challenge and some vagarious ideas are needed to innovate new routes was mainly consists of water microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substance eps li et al 2019 the water in was includes free water interstitial water vicinal water and hydration water and the latter three types are usually classified as bound water vaxelaire and cezac 2004 the free water can be removed easily but the bound water is difficult to remove for the presence of eps and microbial cells wang et al 2018 the removal of bound water is crucial to the improvement of was dewatering performance eps accounts for 50 90 w w of the total organic substances in was rumky et al 2018 it is composed of polysaccharides ps proteins pn humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa etc these biopolymers bring a high surface charge of was wu et al 2017 the high surface charges make flocs to form a gel like suspension structure abelleira et al 2012 and water traps in the colloidal networks water also can bind with hydroxyl carboxyl amino of eps to form hydrogen bonding networks which increases the difficulty of was dewatering furthermore the presence of microbial cells is also not conducive to the removal of water intermolecular interactions between microbial cells such as ion bridging through eps biopolymer entanglement electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding networks and van deer waal s force all provide strong protection to the stability of flocs vaxelaire and cezac 2004 therefore exploring an effectual method to destroy eps structure and microbial cells is the key to improve the was dewaterability as a kind of green reaction media ionic liquid il has attracted more and more attentions and has been used in various fields jin et al 2015 li et al 2016a meng et al 2012 tang et al 2009 il has unique ability to selectively dissolve components that may be insoluble in conventional solvent this is because that il has strong hydrogen bond coordination ability and it can even dissolve intact biopolymers usmani et al 2020 biswas et al found that water insoluble polymers starch and zein had good solubility in a solution of 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride bmim cl and 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium dicyanamide bmim dca biswas et al 2006 gomez herrero also discovered that alkylimidazolium based il can inactive the microbial cells in was gomez herrero et al 2020 according to the fujita s work celluloses and peptidoglycans were important components of microbial cells walls and were insoluble in traditional solvents but soluble in il fujita et al 2013 as mentioned above was dewatering performance is related to microbial cells and biopolymers in flocs il can inactivate microbial cells and dissolve biopolymers we conjecture that the dewatering performance of was may be improved after treatment with il 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate emim otf is a frequently used il and its physicochemical properties have been extensively studied dunaev et al 2019 olivier et al 2010 sequeira et al 2020 emim otf can dissolve ps and other biopolymers in biomass freire et al 2011 emim otf also has excellent ability to inactivate microbial cells jiang et al 2018 therefore emim otf meets the requirements of dissolving biopolymers and inactivating microbial cells for the improvement of was dewatering performance emim otf as a short chain alkyl il has a great solubility in water it is helpful to the recovery of il by water washing emim otf also has nice biodegradability the biodegradability of il with 1 alkyl 3 methylimidazolium is enhanced with the decreasing of chain length pernak et al 2003 romero et al 2008 and the degradation rates of il with otf are higher than that of other il with cl or c cn 3 siedlecka et al 2009 emim otf as short chain alkylimidazolium based il can be degraded by specific microorganisms in soil specifically the il was degraded by soil bacteria in aerobic aqueous solution and the breakdown products of alkylimidazolium cations were detected after 12 days pham et al 2010 modelli et al also found that the alkylimidazolium based il was degraded completely after biological treatment with microorganisms in natural soil modelli et al 2008 therefore emim otf was innovatively used in this study to improve the dewatering performance of was the was dewatering performance was characterized by capillary suction time cst specific resistance of filtration srf moisture content and bound water content the flocs size three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem zeta potential fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and scanning electron microscope sem were used to reveal the intensification mechanism of was dewatering performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge and reagents the was was taken from a wastewater treatment plant in chengdu china the properties of was were listed in table s1 of supporting information the was was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c and the experiments were completed within one week the chemical reagents used in this work were given in table s2 of supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures emim otf and 10 g was were filled into a 50 ml flask the mass ratios of emim otf to was were set as 0 to 1 50 with a step of 0 25 the flask was sealed and immersed in the water bath of a thermostatic oscillator wd shz b beijing jinyang wanda technology co ltd china with a precision of 0 5 c the flask was oscillated at 30 c with a frequency of 120 rpm for 120 min then the mixture was centrifuged in a 50 ml centrifuge tube at 2000 g for 3 min after the supernatant conditioning supernatant was decanted 15 ml deionized water was poured into the centrifuge tube to recover the residual emim otf in was the deionized water and residual was were sheared by a vortex mixer for 1 min and then centrifuged at 2000 g for 3 min the residual was was obtained after the decanting of supernatant washing supernatant and was re suspended by 15 ml of deionized water to further recover emim otf the vortex mixer was used to shear deionized water and residual was for 1 min again after two washes and recover emim otf the cst srf moisture content and bound water content in was were determined and the detailed steps were outlined in section 2 3 all supernatants including conditioning supernatant and washing supernatant were collected in a 100 ml distilling flask in order to recover the emim otf a rotary evaporator re 2000a shanghai yarong biochemical instrument factory china was used to remove water from the supernatant at 80 c and 20 kpa for 60 min the residual liquid was dried in an oven dhg 9013a shanghai yiheng scientific instrument co ltd china at 105 c for 30 min almost all of the water was removed and most of the organic matters were precipitated from the supernatant then emim otf was regenerated after removing the precipitate from the residual liquid by filtration the regenerated emim otf was re used to treat the fresh was 2 3 analytical methods the cst was determined with a cst instrument 304 m triton uk the srf was measured by the general method described elsewhere see text s1 supporting information chen et al 2015 the moisture content and bound water content in was were measured cai et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 and the detailed procedures were described elsewhere see text s2 and text s3 supporting information a modified heat extraction method was used to extract eps from was li and yang 2007 pn and ps in the eps were measured by coomassie brilliant blue g 250 method bradford 1976 and phenol sulfuric acid method zhou et al 2015 respectively the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps were analyzed by a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan the detailed procedures of 3d eem were outlined in text s4 of supporting information a benchtop acidity meter phs 3e shanghai yidian scientific instrument co ltd china was used to measure the ph value the zeta potential was analyzed by a nanoparticle size zeta potential analyzer zen3690 malvern uk a laser diffraction instrument mastersizer 3000e malvern uk was used to characterize the flocs size the chemical functional groups of was were analyzed by ft ir nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa the detailed method of sample preparation was given in text s5 of supporting information a sem jsm 5900lv jeol japan was used to observe the microstructure of flocs the total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss of was were measured by the general method described elsewhere kim et al 2016 a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms tsq quantum thermo usa was used to measure the concentration of emim otf in the regenerated il and the detailed measurement method was outlined in text s6 of supporting information the chemical functional groups of fresh and regenerated emim otf were analyzed by ft ir nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa and the detailed method of sample preparation was given in text s7 of supporting information the 50 μl fresh and regenerated emim otf were diluted with 500 μl d2o the samples were measured by a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer av ii 400 mhz bruker swiss in order to obtain the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra 1h nmr the moisture content in regenerated emim otf was determined by karl fischer moisture titrator akf 1b shanghai hegong china all experiments were carried out in triplicates and the average values were adopted 3 results and discussion 3 1 the improvement of was dewatering performance by emim otf the effects of emim otf on was dewatering performance were evaluated and the results were shown in fig 1 a b the cst srf moisture content and bound water content in was treated by emim otf all were lower than that of control group without emim otf the results indicated that emim otf can improve dewatering performance of was effectively the cst and srf are important factors in dewatering process of was which are widely used to evaluate the dewatering rate the cst represents the time required for the water in was to diffuse a certain distance on the special filter paper and the srf represents the resistance per unit mass of sludge per unit filtration area under a certain pressure pei et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a when the mass ratio of emim otf was increased from 0 to 1 5 the cst and srf of was were monotonously decreased from 206 3 9 6 s and 8 98 0 35 1012 m kg to 62 0 3 5 s and 1 79 0 02 1012 m kg respectively the dewatering extent was assessed by moisture content and bound water content in the filter cake as shown in fig 1 b when the mass ratio of emim otf was increased from 0 to 1 5 the moisture content and bound water content in was were monotonously decreased from 89 88 0 14 and 0 74 0 01 g g ds to 64 99 0 92 and 0 13 0 01 g g ds respectively the lowest bound water content and moisture content in was all were observed at emim otf was mass ratio of 1 5 which were lower than that of other works specifically a hybrid process of electrolysis and zero valent iron activated persulfate oxidation was used to improve the was dewatering performance by li and a moisture content of 73 60 was achieved li et al 2016b fenton s reagent and lime were used to condition was by yu yu et al 2016 and the moisture content was only reduced to 69 7 microwave and acidification were used to improve the dewatering performance of was by liu and the moisture content was decreased from 98 29 0 03 to 74 29 4 84 liu et al 2016 the comparisons showed that the was conditioned by specific il brought an excellent improvement of was dewatering performance although increasing emim otf dosage may further improve the dewatering performance too large amount of emim otf will bring a high cost to the recovery of emim otf thus the proper mass ratio of emim otf was was set as 1 5 in this study 3 2 recovery and reusability of emim otf expensive price of emim otf has limited its massively commercial application thus the recycling of emim otf needs to be considered the regenerated il was recycled to treat was and the results showed in fig 2 a b the cst and srf of was were slightly increased from 62 0 3 5 s and 1 79 0 02 1012 m kg to 79 7 3 0 s and 2 85 0 15 1012 m kg respectively the moisture content in was were slowly increased from 64 06 1 70 to 68 53 1 33 fortunately the highest moisture content of was treated by the fifth cycle of emim otf was still lower than that of the traditional chemical and mechanical dewatering methods cai et al 2018 most of organics in the aqueous solution were removed by evaporation and filtration but some organics still stayed in regenerated il some water also existed in regenerated il these factors had negative effects on the purity of regenerated il and brought negative influences on the improvement of was dewatering performance however the final bound water content in the conditioning was almost kept at the same level for the 5 recycles of emim otf it indicated that the regenerated emim otf had excellent reusability in was dewatering emim otf has good solubility in water and is easily transferred from residual was to supernatant the distribution of emim otf was shown in figure s1 see supporting information 99 12 of emim otf was transferred from was to supernatant and no emim otf was detected in was the emim otf in supernatant was successfully regenerated after evaporation and filtration and the best recovery rate of emim otf was 93 24 see fig 3 the loss of emim otf was mainly originated from in the evaporation and filtration some biopolymers dissolved by il were precipitated during the evaporation process however in the filtration process to remove the precipitation of decomposed organics some il was abandoned with precipitation and led to a decrease of il recovery rate ft ir spectra of original was and conditioning was are similar see figure s5 supporting information the specific peaks of emim otf was not found in the ft ir spectra of conditioning was it proved that little emim otf remained in the residual conditioning was even if trace amounts of emim otf remained in residual was the side effects of il on was disposal can be ignored because the imidazole based il can be degraded in natural soil modelli et al 2008 pham et al 2010 as shown in fig 3 the highest purity of regenerated emim otf was 96 85 wt which was lower than that of fresh emim otf 98 wt the fresh emim otf was transparent and almost colorless while the regenerated emim otf was yellow see figure s2 supporting information it indicated that some biopolymers in was or impurities still existed in the regenerated emim otf the same phenomenon was observed by hou hou et al 2013 he discovered that the biopolymers were accumulated in the regenerated il and had negative effects on the reusability of il in addition the moisture content in fresh emim otf did not exceed 0 1 however the moisture content in regenerated emim otf was 0 86 0 26 obviously the biopolymers and water were existed in the regenerated emim otf and led to the decrease of purity the ft ir spectra and specific peaks attribution of fresh and regenerated emim otf were shown in figure s3 a and text s8 respectively see supporting information the ft ir spectra of fresh and regenerated emim otf indicated that the functional group of il was not changed during the dewatering process the chemical structure of 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium and the 1h nmr spectra of fresh and regenerated emim otf were shown in figure s3 b see supporting information the signals in 1h nmr spectra are related to the protons in anion of emim otf 1h nmr 400 mhz d2o δ 8 61 s 1h 7 40 s 1h 7 33 s 1h 4 14 q j 7 4 hz 2h 3 80 s 3h 1 41 t j 7 4 hz 3h the obvious peaks shift or peaks changes in the 1h nmr spectra of fresh and regenerated emim otf are not be found according to the analysis of ft ir spectra and 1h nmr spectra the emim otf is successfully regenerated with a great reusability and it show excellent potential ability on improving the was dewatering performance 3 3 characteristics and mechanism analysis 3 3 1 analysis of flocs size emim otf can destroy the flocs structure by dissolving biopolymers and the destruction degree of the flocs is reflected by the change of particle size as shown in fig 4 the curve of high emim otf dosage located at the upper location with the increasing of emim otf was mass ratio from 0 to 1 5 the median value of particle size d 50 and 90 value of particle size d90 of was reduced from 6 89 0 19 μm and 38 63 0 53 μm to 6 15 0 03 μm and 31 15 0 06 μm respectively a large number of dewatering related biopolymers in flocs structure were dissolved by emim otf which led to large particles to be degraded to small particles and biopolymers therefore the reduction in flocs size was expected the dissolution of biopolymers not only caused the shrink of flocs size but also reduced the tss as shown in figure s4 of support information the tss was sharply decreased from 19 12 0 76 g l 1 to 13 65 0 17 g l 1 with the increasing of emim otf was mass ratio from 0 to 1 5 the biopolymers were dissolved by emim otf and transferred from flocs into supernatant the contents of biopolymers in the supernatant increased significantly with the increasing dosage of emim otf while the contents of biopolymers in the flocs were decreased correspondingly see section 3 3 2 3 3 3 therefore the tss almost monotonously decreased with the increasing dosage of emim otf 3 3 2 analysis of pn and ps contents the eps including soluble extracellular polymeric substance seps loosely bound extracellular polymeric substance lb eps tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance tb eps has an important effect on the was dewatering performance kim et al 2016 the seps is dissolved in the supernatant the lb eps is relatively loose and usually exists in the outer layer of flocs however the tb eps is compact and usually locates in the inner layer of flocs the contents of pn and ps in eps exceed 80 zheng et al 2014 thus analysis of pn and ps contents in eps is useful to reveal the mechanism of was dewatering performance the distribution of pn and ps in different types of eps after treatment with different dosage of emim otf were shown in fig 5 the pn and ps extracted from was with emim otf were higher than that of control groups without emim otf compared to the original was the pn and ps contents of seps in was with emim otf were increased from 3 40 0 07 mg g ds and 1 30 0 43 mg g ds to 11 67 0 70 mg g ds and 12 44 1 81 mg g ds respectively the pn and ps in lb eps were also increased from 1 18 0 22 mg g ds and 0 79 0 62 mg g ds to 7 47 0 11 mg g ds and 9 23 1 92 mg g ds respectively however the pn and ps in tb eps were decreased from 5 97 0 47 mg g ds and 15 83 1 69 mg g ds to 0 23 0 10 mg g ds and 6 30 1 41 mg g ds respectively obviously most of the pn and ps in original was presented in tb eps due to the presence of emim otf some pn and ps in tb eps were transferred into the lb eps and seps it indicated that pn and ps were dissolved by emim otf therefore the contents of pn and ps in lb eps and seps were increased even more the pn and ps in total eps were increased from 10 56 0 55 mg g ds and 18 18 1 49 mg g ds to 19 37 0 68 mg g ds and 27 97 3 64 mg g ds respectively some pn and ps present in the pellet of flocs without the conditioning of il were not easily extracted by the modified heat extraction method but it was possible to be extracted from the flocs conditioned by il due to the destruction of flocs thus the pn and ps in total eps were increased as described above emim otf was conducive to the destruction of eps 3 3 3 analysis of 3d eem pn ha fa and other biopolymers in eps structure were closely related to the dewatering performance of was the biopolymers in different eps structures were qualitatively analyzed by 3d eem spectra and the results were shown in fig 6 the tyrosine tryptophan protein a peak and tyrosine tryptophan amino acid b peak were observed in seps and lb eps spectra of original was maqbool et al 2019 five peaks were observed in the tb eps spectrum of original was it indicated that almost all the polyaromatic type humic acid c peak polycarboxylate type humic acid e peak and fa d peak were bound in tb eps li et al 2016b it was difficult to release these compounds from tb eps because they were combined in the inner layer of flocs however the peaks of a c and d were observed in the seps spectra of was conditioned by emim otf in the lb eps spectrum of conditioning was the peaks of a c d and e all were observed although the peaks of a c and d were observed in the tb eps spectrum of conditioning was their intensity was dimmer than that of peaks in the tb eps spectrum of original was ha and fa mainly existed in tb eps and formed the skeleton of flocs with pn and other substances bala subramanian et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 the emim otf caused the transfer of pn ha and fa from tb eps to lb eps and seps which eventually led to the weakening of the intensity including a c and d in tb eps interestingly the b peak was not observed in the spectra of conditioning was which was closely related to the presence of emim otf 3 3 4 analysis of zeta potential zeta potential is a key factor affecting the stability of was and is closely related to the eps structure the eps structure in was contains many ionizable functional groups including cooh nh2 and oh etc these groups cause the original was to be negatively charged wu et al 2017 negative charges bring strong electrostatic repulsion the electrostatic repulsion between flocs prevents their aggregation and negatively affects the dewatering performance of was guo et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 the zeta potential in was conditioned by emim otf was higher than that of was without emim otf the zeta potential of conditioning was almost monotonously decreased with the increasing dosage of emim otf the results manifested that the zeta potential in was was changed after dissolution of biopolymers when the mass ratio of emim otf was increased from 0 to 1 5 the zeta potential was sharply increased from 14 20 0 87 mv to 0 89 0 36 mv the cations of emim otf were combined with negatively charged biopolymers through electrostatic interactions after destruction of eps structure xu et al 2017 and the attachment sites of negative charges in flocs were disappeared as expected the zeta potential of was gradually approached electric neutrality by increasing dosage of emim otf what s more the aqueous solution of emim otf was acidic and the ph of was was shown in figure s6 of support information when the mass ratio of emim otf was increased from 0 to 1 5 the ph value of was was decreased from 6 25 0 09 to 3 02 0 07 the functional groups in eps structure can be protonated in an acidic ph environment ding et al 2021 the biopolymers were dissolved by emim otf which accelerated the protonation of biopolymers according to the discussion of wei wei et al 2019 the protonation was helpful to weaken the electrostatic repulsion and a compression effect can be induced which promoted the aggregation of flocs with the decreasing of ph and increasing of zeta potential the protonation of biopolymers was taken placed the electrostatic repulsion between flocs was weakened finally the dewatering performance of was was improved 3 3 5 analysis of ft ir spectra the ft ir spectra and specific peaks attribution of was were shown in figure s5 and text s9 respectively see supporting information the specific peaks of oh ch2 co nh c o c o c and c c indicate that a number of biopolymers such as ps pn exist in original was and conditioning was chitins celluloses and peptidoglycans are important components of microbial cells walls which are insoluble in traditional solvents but soluble in il fujita et al 2013 il can destroy cell walls of microbial aggregates formed by chitins and peptidoglycans in was gomez herrero et al 2020 and the intracellular polymeric substances such as nucleic acids na are released the band at 913 cm 1 is associated with the o p o stretching of na liang et al 2020 the appearance of the o p o stretching vibration band indicated that microbial cells were disrupted up by emim otf which was consistent with gomez herrero s work the stable gel structure of flocs formed by eps and microbial cells was disrupted after addition of emim otf and water can be released easily 3 3 6 analysis of sem the destruction of eps structure is further confirmed by morphologies of was with without emim otf great differences in morphologies between original was and conditioning was are observed the surfaces of original was are relatively smooth and flat see fig 8 a according to wu s work wu et al 2019 a large number of intact microbial cells aggregate together to form a gel like biofilm through biochemical interaction the compact structures enhance the water binding capacity and show poor water permeability coarse surfaces complex pores and small cracks are observed in the flocs treated by emim otf see fig 8 b the complex and changeable pore structures in conditioning was provide enough channels for the release of water pn ps ha fa and na the loose structures and specific pores in flocs have positive effects on the water permeability and dewatering performance 3 3 7 the intensification mechanism of was dewatering performance as mentioned above the intensification mechanism of was dewatering performance brought by emim otf is proposed see fig 9 microbial cells in original was are integrated and active the eps structures are wrapped in different layers and the flocs are connected to each other in contrast microbial cells in conditioning was are disrupted the eps structures are wrecked to fragments and the stable structure of flocs was destroyed after the dissolution of biopolymers by emim otf the dewatering performance of was was closely related to tb eps structure the structures of eps were disrupted by emim otf and the pn ps fa ha in tb eps were released into lb eps and seps the cell walls of microbial aggregates were also wrecked by emim otf after the damage of eps structure and the lysis of cells the large flocs in was were degraded into small particles and biopolymers a large number of negative charges in flocs were neutralized due to the dissolution of biopolymers and the electrostatic repulsion between the flocs was effectively reduced the conditioning was had a complex distribution of pores after the dissolution of biopolymers and showed good water permeability in short conditioning was after the destruction of eps structure brought a low biopolymers content a feeble electrostatic repulsion and a loose structure all these changes were conducible to the improvement of was dewatering performance 4 conclusions emim otf was innovatively used to intensify the dewatering performance of was the eps structure especially tb eps structure was destroyed by emim otf many biopolymers in tb eps were transferred to lb eps and seps and a loose and porous structure in flocs was obtained flocs became shattered and unstable due to the dissolution of biopolymers and inactivation of microbial cells the filter cake with a feeble electrostatic repulsion got a good filterability after the neutralization of negative charges therefore an improvement of was dewatering performance was achieved finally the moisture content in was was successfully reduced to 64 99 0 92 emim otf can be easily recycled and regenerated as a green solvent il with high recovery and great reusability is less harmful to the environment and has potential application in was dewatering declaration of competing

16961,the disposal and resource utilization of waste activated sludge was is a big challenge for its high moisture content ionic liquid il 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate emim otf was innovatively used as a conditioner to improve the dewatering performance of was the was was characterized by flocs size three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem zeta potential fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and scanning electron microscope sem for the investigation of intensification mechanism the results showed that the dewatering performance of was conditioned by emim otf was significantly improved the moisture content was successfully decreased to 64 99 0 92 and the intensification mechanism was investigated the results showed that the structures of extracellular polymeric substance eps were destroyed by emim otf it brought a sharp decrease of the contents of polysaccharides ps proteins pn humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa in tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance tb eps structure the inactivation of microbial cells promoted the disintegration of flocs large flocs were converted into unstable small particles and biopolymers in addition the negative charges of was were also neutralized for dissolution of biopolymers in emim otf and the electrostatic repulsion between flocs was weakened emim otf was easily recycled five times the research results indicate that specific il such as emim otf is a potential conditioner to improve the dewatering performance of was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ionic liquid waste activated sludge extracellular polymeric substance dewatering performance 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a heterogeneous colloidal mixture generated from the wastewater treatment plants disposal of was on large scales is a great challenge for the heavy economic and environmental burden it is well known that the handling of was is difficult for its very large output and high moisture content for example the was output of china exceeded 12 million tons dry sludge ds in 2020 jia et al 2020 the annual productions of was in the united states and the european union are approximately 17 8 million tons ds and 9 million tons ds respectively wu et al 2020a the moisture content in was is usually up to 95 maqbool et al 2019 and dewatering has been considered as a promising strategy in reducing was volume dewatering of was is a challenge for its tiny size high organic content and complicated colloidal structure li et al 2020 mechanical dewatering methods have been used to remove water from was however the moisture content is still as high as 80 cai et al 2018 which is far beyond the requirements for the resource utilization of was therefore many researchers constantly explore many new routes to reduce the moisture content in was α amylase and protease were used to loosen the flocs structure by chen chen et al 2015 and the moisture content was reduced from 97 95 to 81 however the conditions of biological enzyme treatment were quite harsh for the sustained cultivation process electrochemical pretreatment was used to improve was dewatering performance by zeng et al zeng et al 2020 and the moisture content of was decreased from 95 1 to 72 0 however serious corrosion of reaction system impeded its further application according to wu s work wu et al 2020b a dewatering method by preconditioning combined with vacuum preloading and freeze dried technology was achieved however it was not suitable for warm region hence exploring feasible dewatering route is still a great challenge and some vagarious ideas are needed to innovate new routes was mainly consists of water microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substance eps li et al 2019 the water in was includes free water interstitial water vicinal water and hydration water and the latter three types are usually classified as bound water vaxelaire and cezac 2004 the free water can be removed easily but the bound water is difficult to remove for the presence of eps and microbial cells wang et al 2018 the removal of bound water is crucial to the improvement of was dewatering performance eps accounts for 50 90 w w of the total organic substances in was rumky et al 2018 it is composed of polysaccharides ps proteins pn humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa etc these biopolymers bring a high surface charge of was wu et al 2017 the high surface charges make flocs to form a gel like suspension structure abelleira et al 2012 and water traps in the colloidal networks water also can bind with hydroxyl carboxyl amino of eps to form hydrogen bonding networks which increases the difficulty of was dewatering furthermore the presence of microbial cells is also not conducive to the removal of water intermolecular interactions between microbial cells such as ion bridging through eps biopolymer entanglement electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding networks and van deer waal s force all provide strong protection to the stability of flocs vaxelaire and cezac 2004 therefore exploring an effectual method to destroy eps structure and microbial cells is the key to improve the was dewaterability as a kind of green reaction media ionic liquid il has attracted more and more attentions and has been used in various fields jin et al 2015 li et al 2016a meng et al 2012 tang et al 2009 il has unique ability to selectively dissolve components that may be insoluble in conventional solvent this is because that il has strong hydrogen bond coordination ability and it can even dissolve intact biopolymers usmani et al 2020 biswas et al found that water insoluble polymers starch and zein had good solubility in a solution of 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride bmim cl and 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium dicyanamide bmim dca biswas et al 2006 gomez herrero also discovered that alkylimidazolium based il can inactive the microbial cells in was gomez herrero et al 2020 according to the fujita s work celluloses and peptidoglycans were important components of microbial cells walls and were insoluble in traditional solvents but soluble in il fujita et al 2013 as mentioned above was dewatering performance is related to microbial cells and biopolymers in flocs il can inactivate microbial cells and dissolve biopolymers we conjecture that the dewatering performance of was may be improved after treatment with il 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate emim otf is a frequently used il and its physicochemical properties have been extensively studied dunaev et al 2019 olivier et al 2010 sequeira et al 2020 emim otf can dissolve ps and other biopolymers in biomass freire et al 2011 emim otf also has excellent ability to inactivate microbial cells jiang et al 2018 therefore emim otf meets the requirements of dissolving biopolymers and inactivating microbial cells for the improvement of was dewatering performance emim otf as a short chain alkyl il has a great solubility in water it is helpful to the recovery of il by water washing emim otf also has nice biodegradability the biodegradability of il with 1 alkyl 3 methylimidazolium is enhanced with the decreasing of chain length pernak et al 2003 romero et al 2008 and the degradation rates of il with otf are higher than that of other il with cl or c cn 3 siedlecka et al 2009 emim otf as short chain alkylimidazolium based il can be degraded by specific microorganisms in soil specifically the il was degraded by soil bacteria in aerobic aqueous solution and the breakdown products of alkylimidazolium cations were detected after 12 days pham et al 2010 modelli et al also found that the alkylimidazolium based il was degraded completely after biological treatment with microorganisms in natural soil modelli et al 2008 therefore emim otf was innovatively used in this study to improve the dewatering performance of was the was dewatering performance was characterized by capillary suction time cst specific resistance of filtration srf moisture content and bound water content the flocs size three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem zeta potential fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and scanning electron microscope sem were used to reveal the intensification mechanism of was dewatering performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge and reagents the was was taken from a wastewater treatment plant in chengdu china the properties of was were listed in table s1 of supporting information the was was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c and the experiments were completed within one week the chemical reagents used in this work were given in table s2 of supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures emim otf and 10 g was were filled into a 50 ml flask the mass ratios of emim otf to was were set as 0 to 1 50 with a step of 0 25 the flask was sealed and immersed in the water bath of a thermostatic oscillator wd shz b beijing jinyang wanda technology co ltd china with a precision of 0 5 c the flask was oscillated at 30 c with a frequency of 120 rpm for 120 min then the mixture was centrifuged in a 50 ml centrifuge tube at 2000 g for 3 min after the supernatant conditioning supernatant was decanted 15 ml deionized water was poured into the centrifuge tube to recover the residual emim otf in was the deionized water and residual was were sheared by a vortex mixer for 1 min and then centrifuged at 2000 g for 3 min the residual was was obtained after the decanting of supernatant washing supernatant and was re suspended by 15 ml of deionized water to further recover emim otf the vortex mixer was used to shear deionized water and residual was for 1 min again after two washes and recover emim otf the cst srf moisture content and bound water content in was were determined and the detailed steps were outlined in section 2 3 all supernatants including conditioning supernatant and washing supernatant were collected in a 100 ml distilling flask in order to recover the emim otf a rotary evaporator re 2000a shanghai yarong biochemical instrument factory china was used to remove water from the supernatant at 80 c and 20 kpa for 60 min the residual liquid was dried in an oven dhg 9013a shanghai yiheng scientific instrument co ltd china at 105 c for 30 min almost all of the water was removed and most of the organic matters were precipitated from the supernatant then emim otf was regenerated after removing the precipitate from the residual liquid by filtration the regenerated emim otf was re used to treat the fresh was 2 3 analytical methods the cst was determined with a cst instrument 304 m triton uk the srf was measured by the general method described elsewhere see text s1 supporting information chen et al 2015 the moisture content and bound water content in was were measured cai et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 and the detailed procedures were described elsewhere see text s2 and text s3 supporting information a modified heat extraction method was used to extract eps from was li and yang 2007 pn and ps in the eps were measured by coomassie brilliant blue g 250 method bradford 1976 and phenol sulfuric acid method zhou et al 2015 respectively the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps were analyzed by a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan the detailed procedures of 3d eem were outlined in text s4 of supporting information a benchtop acidity meter phs 3e shanghai yidian scientific instrument co ltd china was used to measure the ph value the zeta potential was analyzed by a nanoparticle size zeta potential analyzer zen3690 malvern uk a laser diffraction instrument mastersizer 3000e malvern uk was used to characterize the flocs size the chemical functional groups of was were analyzed by ft ir nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa the detailed method of sample preparation was given in text s5 of supporting information a sem jsm 5900lv jeol japan was used to observe the microstructure of flocs the total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss of was were measured by the general method described elsewhere kim et al 2016 a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms tsq quantum thermo usa was used to measure the concentration of emim otf in the regenerated il and the detailed measurement method was outlined in text s6 of supporting information the chemical functional groups of fresh and regenerated emim otf were analyzed by ft ir nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa and the detailed method of sample preparation was given in text s7 of supporting information the 50 μl fresh and regenerated emim otf were diluted with 500 μl d2o the samples were measured by a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer av ii 400 mhz bruker swiss in order to obtain the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra 1h nmr the moisture content in regenerated emim otf was determined by karl fischer moisture titrator akf 1b shanghai hegong china all experiments were carried out in triplicates and the average values were adopted 3 results and discussion 3 1 the improvement of was dewatering performance by emim otf the effects of emim otf on was dewatering performance were evaluated and the results were shown in fig 1 a b the cst srf moisture content and bound water content in was treated by emim otf all were lower than that of control group without emim otf the results indicated that emim otf can improve dewatering performance of was effectively the cst and srf are important factors in dewatering process of was which are widely used to evaluate the dewatering rate the cst represents the time required for the water in was to diffuse a certain distance on the special filter paper and the srf represents the resistance per unit mass of sludge per unit filtration area under a certain pressure pei et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a when the mass ratio of emim otf was increased from 0 to 1 5 the cst and srf of was were monotonously decreased from 206 3 9 6 s and 8 98 0 35 1012 m kg to 62 0 3 5 s and 1 79 0 02 1012 m kg respectively the dewatering extent was assessed by moisture content and bound water content in the filter cake as shown in fig 1 b when the mass ratio of emim otf was increased from 0 to 1 5 the moisture content and bound water content in was were monotonously decreased from 89 88 0 14 and 0 74 0 01 g g ds to 64 99 0 92 and 0 13 0 01 g g ds respectively the lowest bound water content and moisture content in was all were observed at emim otf was mass ratio of 1 5 which were lower than that of other works specifically a hybrid process of electrolysis and zero valent iron activated persulfate oxidation was used to improve the was dewatering performance by li and a moisture content of 73 60 was achieved li et al 2016b fenton s reagent and lime were used to condition was by yu yu et al 2016 and the moisture content was only reduced to 69 7 microwave and acidification were used to improve the dewatering performance of was by liu and the moisture content was decreased from 98 29 0 03 to 74 29 4 84 liu et al 2016 the comparisons showed that the was conditioned by specific il brought an excellent improvement of was dewatering performance although increasing emim otf dosage may further improve the dewatering performance too large amount of emim otf will bring a high cost to the recovery of emim otf thus the proper mass ratio of emim otf was was set as 1 5 in this study 3 2 recovery and reusability of emim otf expensive price of emim otf has limited its massively commercial application thus the recycling of emim otf needs to be considered the regenerated il was recycled to treat was and the results showed in fig 2 a b the cst and srf of was were slightly increased from 62 0 3 5 s and 1 79 0 02 1012 m kg to 79 7 3 0 s and 2 85 0 15 1012 m kg respectively the moisture content in was were slowly increased from 64 06 1 70 to 68 53 1 33 fortunately the highest moisture content of was treated by the fifth cycle of emim otf was still lower than that of the traditional chemical and mechanical dewatering methods cai et al 2018 most of organics in the aqueous solution were removed by evaporation and filtration but some organics still stayed in regenerated il some water also existed in regenerated il these factors had negative effects on the purity of regenerated il and brought negative influences on the improvement of was dewatering performance however the final bound water content in the conditioning was almost kept at the same level for the 5 recycles of emim otf it indicated that the regenerated emim otf had excellent reusability in was dewatering emim otf has good solubility in water and is easily transferred from residual was to supernatant the distribution of emim otf was shown in figure s1 see supporting information 99 12 of emim otf was transferred from was to supernatant and no emim otf was detected in was the emim otf in supernatant was successfully regenerated after evaporation and filtration and the best recovery rate of emim otf was 93 24 see fig 3 the loss of emim otf was mainly originated from in the evaporation and filtration some biopolymers dissolved by il were precipitated during the evaporation process however in the filtration process to remove the precipitation of decomposed organics some il was abandoned with precipitation and led to a decrease of il recovery rate ft ir spectra of original was and conditioning was are similar see figure s5 supporting information the specific peaks of emim otf was not found in the ft ir spectra of conditioning was it proved that little emim otf remained in the residual conditioning was even if trace amounts of emim otf remained in residual was the side effects of il on was disposal can be ignored because the imidazole based il can be degraded in natural soil modelli et al 2008 pham et al 2010 as shown in fig 3 the highest purity of regenerated emim otf was 96 85 wt which was lower than that of fresh emim otf 98 wt the fresh emim otf was transparent and almost colorless while the regenerated emim otf was yellow see figure s2 supporting information it indicated that some biopolymers in was or impurities still existed in the regenerated emim otf the same phenomenon was observed by hou hou et al 2013 he discovered that the biopolymers were accumulated in the regenerated il and had negative effects on the reusability of il in addition the moisture content in fresh emim otf did not exceed 0 1 however the moisture content in regenerated emim otf was 0 86 0 26 obviously the biopolymers and water were existed in the regenerated emim otf and led to the decrease of purity the ft ir spectra and specific peaks attribution of fresh and regenerated emim otf were shown in figure s3 a and text s8 respectively see supporting information the ft ir spectra of fresh and regenerated emim otf indicated that the functional group of il was not changed during the dewatering process the chemical structure of 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium and the 1h nmr spectra of fresh and regenerated emim otf were shown in figure s3 b see supporting information the signals in 1h nmr spectra are related to the protons in anion of emim otf 1h nmr 400 mhz d2o δ 8 61 s 1h 7 40 s 1h 7 33 s 1h 4 14 q j 7 4 hz 2h 3 80 s 3h 1 41 t j 7 4 hz 3h the obvious peaks shift or peaks changes in the 1h nmr spectra of fresh and regenerated emim otf are not be found according to the analysis of ft ir spectra and 1h nmr spectra the emim otf is successfully regenerated with a great reusability and it show excellent potential ability on improving the was dewatering performance 3 3 characteristics and mechanism analysis 3 3 1 analysis of flocs size emim otf can destroy the flocs structure by dissolving biopolymers and the destruction degree of the flocs is reflected by the change of particle size as shown in fig 4 the curve of high emim otf dosage located at the upper location with the increasing of emim otf was mass ratio from 0 to 1 5 the median value of particle size d 50 and 90 value of particle size d90 of was reduced from 6 89 0 19 μm and 38 63 0 53 μm to 6 15 0 03 μm and 31 15 0 06 μm respectively a large number of dewatering related biopolymers in flocs structure were dissolved by emim otf which led to large particles to be degraded to small particles and biopolymers therefore the reduction in flocs size was expected the dissolution of biopolymers not only caused the shrink of flocs size but also reduced the tss as shown in figure s4 of support information the tss was sharply decreased from 19 12 0 76 g l 1 to 13 65 0 17 g l 1 with the increasing of emim otf was mass ratio from 0 to 1 5 the biopolymers were dissolved by emim otf and transferred from flocs into supernatant the contents of biopolymers in the supernatant increased significantly with the increasing dosage of emim otf while the contents of biopolymers in the flocs were decreased correspondingly see section 3 3 2 3 3 3 therefore the tss almost monotonously decreased with the increasing dosage of emim otf 3 3 2 analysis of pn and ps contents the eps including soluble extracellular polymeric substance seps loosely bound extracellular polymeric substance lb eps tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance tb eps has an important effect on the was dewatering performance kim et al 2016 the seps is dissolved in the supernatant the lb eps is relatively loose and usually exists in the outer layer of flocs however the tb eps is compact and usually locates in the inner layer of flocs the contents of pn and ps in eps exceed 80 zheng et al 2014 thus analysis of pn and ps contents in eps is useful to reveal the mechanism of was dewatering performance the distribution of pn and ps in different types of eps after treatment with different dosage of emim otf were shown in fig 5 the pn and ps extracted from was with emim otf were higher than that of control groups without emim otf compared to the original was the pn and ps contents of seps in was with emim otf were increased from 3 40 0 07 mg g ds and 1 30 0 43 mg g ds to 11 67 0 70 mg g ds and 12 44 1 81 mg g ds respectively the pn and ps in lb eps were also increased from 1 18 0 22 mg g ds and 0 79 0 62 mg g ds to 7 47 0 11 mg g ds and 9 23 1 92 mg g ds respectively however the pn and ps in tb eps were decreased from 5 97 0 47 mg g ds and 15 83 1 69 mg g ds to 0 23 0 10 mg g ds and 6 30 1 41 mg g ds respectively obviously most of the pn and ps in original was presented in tb eps due to the presence of emim otf some pn and ps in tb eps were transferred into the lb eps and seps it indicated that pn and ps were dissolved by emim otf therefore the contents of pn and ps in lb eps and seps were increased even more the pn and ps in total eps were increased from 10 56 0 55 mg g ds and 18 18 1 49 mg g ds to 19 37 0 68 mg g ds and 27 97 3 64 mg g ds respectively some pn and ps present in the pellet of flocs without the conditioning of il were not easily extracted by the modified heat extraction method but it was possible to be extracted from the flocs conditioned by il due to the destruction of flocs thus the pn and ps in total eps were increased as described above emim otf was conducive to the destruction of eps 3 3 3 analysis of 3d eem pn ha fa and other biopolymers in eps structure were closely related to the dewatering performance of was the biopolymers in different eps structures were qualitatively analyzed by 3d eem spectra and the results were shown in fig 6 the tyrosine tryptophan protein a peak and tyrosine tryptophan amino acid b peak were observed in seps and lb eps spectra of original was maqbool et al 2019 five peaks were observed in the tb eps spectrum of original was it indicated that almost all the polyaromatic type humic acid c peak polycarboxylate type humic acid e peak and fa d peak were bound in tb eps li et al 2016b it was difficult to release these compounds from tb eps because they were combined in the inner layer of flocs however the peaks of a c and d were observed in the seps spectra of was conditioned by emim otf in the lb eps spectrum of conditioning was the peaks of a c d and e all were observed although the peaks of a c and d were observed in the tb eps spectrum of conditioning was their intensity was dimmer than that of peaks in the tb eps spectrum of original was ha and fa mainly existed in tb eps and formed the skeleton of flocs with pn and other substances bala subramanian et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 the emim otf caused the transfer of pn ha and fa from tb eps to lb eps and seps which eventually led to the weakening of the intensity including a c and d in tb eps interestingly the b peak was not observed in the spectra of conditioning was which was closely related to the presence of emim otf 3 3 4 analysis of zeta potential zeta potential is a key factor affecting the stability of was and is closely related to the eps structure the eps structure in was contains many ionizable functional groups including cooh nh2 and oh etc these groups cause the original was to be negatively charged wu et al 2017 negative charges bring strong electrostatic repulsion the electrostatic repulsion between flocs prevents their aggregation and negatively affects the dewatering performance of was guo et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 the zeta potential in was conditioned by emim otf was higher than that of was without emim otf the zeta potential of conditioning was almost monotonously decreased with the increasing dosage of emim otf the results manifested that the zeta potential in was was changed after dissolution of biopolymers when the mass ratio of emim otf was increased from 0 to 1 5 the zeta potential was sharply increased from 14 20 0 87 mv to 0 89 0 36 mv the cations of emim otf were combined with negatively charged biopolymers through electrostatic interactions after destruction of eps structure xu et al 2017 and the attachment sites of negative charges in flocs were disappeared as expected the zeta potential of was gradually approached electric neutrality by increasing dosage of emim otf what s more the aqueous solution of emim otf was acidic and the ph of was was shown in figure s6 of support information when the mass ratio of emim otf was increased from 0 to 1 5 the ph value of was was decreased from 6 25 0 09 to 3 02 0 07 the functional groups in eps structure can be protonated in an acidic ph environment ding et al 2021 the biopolymers were dissolved by emim otf which accelerated the protonation of biopolymers according to the discussion of wei wei et al 2019 the protonation was helpful to weaken the electrostatic repulsion and a compression effect can be induced which promoted the aggregation of flocs with the decreasing of ph and increasing of zeta potential the protonation of biopolymers was taken placed the electrostatic repulsion between flocs was weakened finally the dewatering performance of was was improved 3 3 5 analysis of ft ir spectra the ft ir spectra and specific peaks attribution of was were shown in figure s5 and text s9 respectively see supporting information the specific peaks of oh ch2 co nh c o c o c and c c indicate that a number of biopolymers such as ps pn exist in original was and conditioning was chitins celluloses and peptidoglycans are important components of microbial cells walls which are insoluble in traditional solvents but soluble in il fujita et al 2013 il can destroy cell walls of microbial aggregates formed by chitins and peptidoglycans in was gomez herrero et al 2020 and the intracellular polymeric substances such as nucleic acids na are released the band at 913 cm 1 is associated with the o p o stretching of na liang et al 2020 the appearance of the o p o stretching vibration band indicated that microbial cells were disrupted up by emim otf which was consistent with gomez herrero s work the stable gel structure of flocs formed by eps and microbial cells was disrupted after addition of emim otf and water can be released easily 3 3 6 analysis of sem the destruction of eps structure is further confirmed by morphologies of was with without emim otf great differences in morphologies between original was and conditioning was are observed the surfaces of original was are relatively smooth and flat see fig 8 a according to wu s work wu et al 2019 a large number of intact microbial cells aggregate together to form a gel like biofilm through biochemical interaction the compact structures enhance the water binding capacity and show poor water permeability coarse surfaces complex pores and small cracks are observed in the flocs treated by emim otf see fig 8 b the complex and changeable pore structures in conditioning was provide enough channels for the release of water pn ps ha fa and na the loose structures and specific pores in flocs have positive effects on the water permeability and dewatering performance 3 3 7 the intensification mechanism of was dewatering performance as mentioned above the intensification mechanism of was dewatering performance brought by emim otf is proposed see fig 9 microbial cells in original was are integrated and active the eps structures are wrapped in different layers and the flocs are connected to each other in contrast microbial cells in conditioning was are disrupted the eps structures are wrecked to fragments and the stable structure of flocs was destroyed after the dissolution of biopolymers by emim otf the dewatering performance of was was closely related to tb eps structure the structures of eps were disrupted by emim otf and the pn ps fa ha in tb eps were released into lb eps and seps the cell walls of microbial aggregates were also wrecked by emim otf after the damage of eps structure and the lysis of cells the large flocs in was were degraded into small particles and biopolymers a large number of negative charges in flocs were neutralized due to the dissolution of biopolymers and the electrostatic repulsion between the flocs was effectively reduced the conditioning was had a complex distribution of pores after the dissolution of biopolymers and showed good water permeability in short conditioning was after the destruction of eps structure brought a low biopolymers content a feeble electrostatic repulsion and a loose structure all these changes were conducible to the improvement of was dewatering performance 4 conclusions emim otf was innovatively used to intensify the dewatering performance of was the eps structure especially tb eps structure was destroyed by emim otf many biopolymers in tb eps were transferred to lb eps and seps and a loose and porous structure in flocs was obtained flocs became shattered and unstable due to the dissolution of biopolymers and inactivation of microbial cells the filter cake with a feeble electrostatic repulsion got a good filterability after the neutralization of negative charges therefore an improvement of was dewatering performance was achieved finally the moisture content in was was successfully reduced to 64 99 0 92 emim otf can be easily recycled and regenerated as a green solvent il with high recovery and great reusability is less harmful to the environment and has potential application in was dewatering declaration of competing

16962,water quality can change along a river system due to differences in adjacent land use patterns and discharge sources these variations can induce rapid responses of the aquatic microbial community which may be an indicator of water quality characteristics in the current study we used a random forest model to predict water sample sources from three different river ecosystems along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance i e less disturbed mountainous area wastewater discharged urban area and pesticide and fertilizer applied agricultural area based on environmental physicochemical indices pcis microbiological indices mbis and their combination results showed that among the pci based models using conventional water quality indices as inputs provided markedly better prediction of water sample source than using pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and much better prediction than using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and substituted pahs spahs among the mbi based models using the abundances of the top 30 bacteria combined with pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb as inputs achieved the lowest median out of bag error rate 9 9 and increased median kappa coefficient 0 8694 while adding fungal inputs reduced the kappa coefficient the model based on the top 30 bacteria still showed an advantage compared with models based on pcis or the combination of pcis and mbis with improvement in sequencing technology and increase in data availability in the future the proposed method provides an economical rapid and reliable way in which to identify water sample sources based on abundance data of microbial communities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords source identification of water samples physicochemical indices microbial abundance machine learning classification random forest 1 introduction in the past several decades many organic and inorganic contaminants have been released into the aquatic environment from industrial agricultural and other anthropogenic activities and include nutrients heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs substituted pahs spahs pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and pesticides sibanda et al 2015 malmqvist and rundle 2002 pollution levels and characteristics differ dramatically among various receiving water bodies even for the same river depending on adjacent land use patterns and activities zhao et al 2020 wang et al 2014 accordingly microbial communities also have significant spatial heterogeneity with pollution gradients due to their sensitivity to the ambient environment bai et al 2018 blunt et al 2018 smith et al 2015 the structure and functional genes of aquatic microbial communities are also known to respond rapidly to pollutants entering the water environment even under extremely low concentrations of micropollutants and therefore microbial communities may reflect the effects of anthropogenic activities on natural aquatic ecosystems and physicochemical indices liao et al 2019 blunt et al 2018 liang et al 2020 liao et al 2018 lupo et al 2012 deciphering how aquatic microbial communities respond to different water environments is challenging due to the intricate interactions among microorganisms as well as between microorganisms and their environment recent studies have attempted to prove quantitative correlations between microbial communities and pollutants using machine learning ml algorithms such as artificial neural network ann classification and regression tree cfrt and random forest rf which are powerful tools for explaining multivariate nonlinear and non monotonic relationships though they are considered as black box models phiri et al 2020 lesnik and liu 2017 munn et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 ubiquitous natural bacterial communities could be used as in situ environmental sensors that respond to and capture perturbations caused by human impact for example smith et al 2015 used bacterial 16s rrna sequencing data to provide effective predictions on a rich catalog of 26 geochemical features collected from 93 water wells with highly differing geochemistry characteristics by rf approach buelow et al 2020 also employed rf algorithm and multi variate analysis to evaluate signatures of resistome microbiota and eco exposome of hospital wastewater hww compared to urban u ww and demonstrated a significant impact of pharmaceuticals and surfactants on the resistome and microbiota of h and u ww as sequencing technology continues to improve such approaches could be rapidly expanded deployed and scaled we previously revealed that both water quality and microbial communities change along polluted river gradients i e low disturbed mountain areas wastewater impacted urban areas and pesticide fertilizer applied agricultural areas liao et al 2018 we thus speculated that the site source of a water sample could potentially be identified based on microbial sequencing and chemical concentration data using a ml algorithm therefore the objectives of the current study were to 1 develop an optimization method for identifying water sample sources based on microbial sequencing data environmental parameters or their combination using the rf algorithm and 2 identify important variables in the predictions as the indicator pollutants or microorganisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study sample sites are located in the chaobai river beijing china the river successively flows through a mountainous area m 5 530 km2 urban area u 695 km2 where the river receives treated wastewater effluent and agricultural farmland a 4 624 km2 where the river receives pesticide fertilizer runoff as shown in fig 1 annual runoff into the chaobai river is about 2 000 104 m3 and average annual runoff from the municipal sewage treatment plant to the river is 919 104 m3 annual consumption of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer in the agricultural area is 89 900 and 29 900 tons respectively further details on the sampling area are provided in our previous paper liao et al 2018 2 2 dataset description water samples were collected at each sampling point every three months from december 2017 to september 2018 for both analysis of physicochemical indices pcis and microbial sequencing the pcis included 13 conventional water quality indices cwqis 34 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and substitute pahs spahs and 23 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps among which only ofloxacin was lower than its limit of quantification loq in all samples and was therefore removed from the pcis together with total s pahs tpah i e the sum of pahs and spahs and total ppcps tppcps i e the sum of ppcps 71 pcis were used as input parameters for data analysis as listed in table s1 with their abbreviations the microbial indices mbis obtained from 16s rrna and metagenomic sequencing included 1 045 bacterial operational taxonomic units otus and 423 fungal otus and pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb parb identified and quantified by liang et al 2020 were found to be significantly affected by municipal drainage and agriculture runoff and therefore selected as inputs in this study in total we obtained 123 records of cwqi observations each record consisted of 13 cwqi variables 125 records of ppcp observations each record consisted of 22 ppcp variables 126 records of observations for pah and spah each record consisted of 34 pah and spah variables and 126 records of observations for microbial abundance each record consisted of 1 045 bacterial otus and 423 fungal otus although some missing data existed due to individual sample loss for predictions of water sample sources based on the combinations of different types of input variables the rfimpute function was used to impute missing values and obtain optimal sample fitting values i e 136 records of observations for the six models based on pcis and the four models based on the combination of mbis and pcis the rfimpute function adopted is from the randomforest package in r v 3 5 2 in which the imputed value is the category with the largest average proximity for categorical predictors specific information on sample treatment and analysis methods is provided in previous research liao et al 2018 qiao et al 2020 su et al 2020 2 3 ml model selection seven classic ml algorithms i e ann multinomial logit mnl rf naive bayes nb k nearest neighbor knn support vector machine svm and linear discriminant analysis lda were selected for classification prediction to determine the best model ten fold cross validation was applied to estimate test errors of the models respectively based on an abundance dataset containing 18 bacterial otus 0 01 and an pci dataset via the errorest function in r v 3 5 2 water sample source was the only output categorical variable and included agricultural a mountainous m and urban u areas each operation was performed for five different divisions of the dataset i e training and testing data by setting five random seeds the results are provided in fig s1 with the rf algorithm presenting the lowest error the rf algorithm is widely used for analysis of environmental and microbial data baek et al 2021 song et al 2020 zeng et al 2017 furthermore it is insensitive to multicollinearity and robust to missing and unbalanced data and can adapt to datasets with thousands of interpretation variables breiman 2001 these factors accord with our study datasets especially for the screening of important variables from many bacterial otu inputs therefore rf was selected to perform dataset training and prediction in this study 2 4 rf model development and evaluation in the development of the rf models the measurement values of pcis abundance data of mbis and their combination were used as input datasets respectively before each rf model was established the best value for the key parameter mtry was determined by 10 fold cross validation and the parameter ntree was determined after stable algorithm operation for each rf model 80 of the dataset was randomly separated into a training set with the remaining 20 used as a testing set there were fewer u samples than a and m samples therefore 10 random seeds were established to form 10 different dataset divisions for independent calculation the 10 calculation results were statistically analyzed via boxplots to avoid the influence of extremely limited or significantly unbalanced datasets two performance parameters were applied simultaneously to evaluate the rf models including out of bag oob estimates of the error rate obtained on the training set and the kappa coefficient obtained from the testing set model accuracies are provided in the supporting information table s2 s4 the rf models were developed via the randomforest package in r v 3 5 2 2 5 selection of top variables for the high dimensional and small size datasets as described in 2 2 importance ranking was performed during model development to determine indicative pcis or mbis and identify top variables for further model optimization the mean decrease accuracy mda and mean decrease gini mdg indices which are based on oob error and gini impurity respectively were used to assess the importance of the input variables in the rf models the larger the mda or mdg value the more important the variable the mda and mdg rankings for most variables were very close in this study according to nicodemus 2011 under strong within predictor correlation mdg rankings were less stable than those using mda the subsequent selections of top variables for further modeling were based on mda rankings while the mdg rankings were only used as a qualitative reference the mda rankings were obtained via the importance and varimpplot functions in r v 3 5 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 predictions based on pcis 3 1 1 predictions based on different types of pcis considering only environmental pcis four sets of inputs were used in the rf model including 13 cwqis 22 ppcps 34 pahs and spahs and all 71 pcis the precision of the four models was compared with the oob estimates of the error rates and kappa coefficients shown in fig 2 a and b and specific statistical values shown in table s2 the models based solely on cwqis had the lowest oob errors ranging from 11 22 to 14 29 median of 12 24 and relatively high kappa coefficients ranging from 0 7002 to 0 8641 median of 0 7511 these results were only slightly lower than those obtained using a model based on all pcis suggesting that cwqis can reflect most water quality characteristics of different functional areas although significant information on ppcps and s pahs is not included in the cwqi based model the model based on all 71 pcis presented the highest median kappa coefficient of 0 7979 but also had a wider range 0 5891 0 9388 indicating that the prediction result was not as stable as the one based on cwqis which was likely due to the influence of input parameter noise from some ppcps and s pahs the model based solely on ppcps also had a low median oob error of 16 and a high median kappa coefficient of 0 7076 but it was unstable within a very wide range 0 4526 0 9351 the model based solely on pahs and spahs showed the worst prediction with the highest median oob error 28 71 and lowest median kappa coefficient 0 4704 among the 10 calculations with 10 random seeds for dataset division for all 71 pcis the best three predictions had relatively low oob errors of 12 84 15 6 and 17 43 respectively and correspondingly high kappa coefficients of 0 8792 0 9189 and 0 9388 respectively thus they were selected for importance ranking of input variables the ranking results for the top 30 pcis by median mda are shown in fig 2 c the mdas of all 71 pcis in the three best predictions and their median ranking results are provided in table s3 the three ranking results were similar indicating the reliability of the analysis thus the median mdas were applied for further analysis overall the mda of most cwqis was higher than that of other variables with median mdas for doc nh4 n cond no3 n tp tds orp and srp of 37 88 33 10 32 39 21 25 19 35 17 31 13 27 and 12 66 respectively therefore these important cwqi variables reflect the main differences in water quality among the different functional areas several ppcps presented very high mda values e g carbamazepine cbz 72 84 sulfamethoxazole smx 18 11 bezafibrate bf 17 34 and metoprolol met 12 15 and several ppcps in the top 30 pcis showed moderately high mda values in the range of 5 09 8 95 e g sulfadiazine sdz trimethoprim tmp lomefloxacin lom oxytetracycline otc chlortetracycline ctc roxithromycin rox and caffeine caf results showed that cbz ranked first among all pcis even higher than the cwqis indicating that cbz could be used as a possible anthropogenic marker in aquatic environments in accordance with several previous studies bjorlenius et al 2018 clara et al 2004 mei et al 2018 the extensive use of cbz and its limited removal in sewage treatment have resulted in large amounts of cbz entering surface water and cbz is also difficult to degrade in natural environments kosjek et al 2009 mei et al 2018 our study also showed that tppcps mda of 16 04 played an important role in the prediction i e eleventh in the mda ranking this suggests that tppcp concentration is an important indicator of anthropogenic activities and could be used to distinguish water sample sources in our previous research the detection frequencies and concentrations of most pharmaceuticals showed significant spatial heterogeneity among different land use types along the chaobai river and may originate from diverse pollution sources su et al 2020 the pharmaceuticals detected in the urban area were significantly associated with the wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the river while the agricultural area was additionally impacted by untreated wastewater from surrounding households and livestock farms the mdas of pahs and spahs were generally much lower except for 1 cn 19 17 and d cn 15 81 which ranked seventh and twelfth respectively and ace 9 62 bkf 9 07 1 clpyr 6 73 and acy 5 62 which ranked in the top 20 pcis notably the concentration levels of these pahs and spahs with high mda were very low along the whole river in particular the maximum value of 1 cn was only 2 9 ng l and it was not detected in most m sample points which probably led to its regional sensitivity kosjek et al 2009 mei et al 2018 in contrast the pahs and spahs with high general concentrations such as at aq 9 fl nap and phe qiao et al 2020 had low mda values 0 04 3 32 4 24 0 27 and 0 46 respectively indicating no significant differences among the different areas it could be speculated that the main source of these pahs in surface water may be atmospheric deposition or other important sources rather than sewage plant discharge thus the importance ranking further proved that the model using cwqis as inputs better predicted the water sample sources than those based solely on ppcps or s pahs 3 1 2 predictions based on different combinations of top pcis according to the mean importance ranking of all 71 pcis the top 10 20 30 40 and 50 pcis were respectively used as inputs to predict water sample source the oob estimates of the error rates and kappa coefficients for the prediction results are shown in fig 3 and specific statistical data are provided in table s2 compared with the model based on all pcis using the top 10 pcis as inputs significantly reduced the median oob error 13 76 to 11 93 and increased the kappa coefficient 0 7979 to 0 8260 however the median oob error increased to 12 39 12 84 12 84 and 13 76 for models based on the top 20 30 40 and 50 variables respectively indicating that too many environmental variables not only fail to provide useful information but may also introduce redundant noise especially when the observational data are very limited using the top 30 pcis achieved the highest median kappa coefficient of 0 8492 but the prediction was also less stable compared to the model based on the top 10 pcis however although these pci models generally showed stable oob errors on the training dataset the kappa coefficients for predictions using new data were very unstable 3 2 predictions based on mbis 3 2 1 predictions based on bacterial abundance the relative abundance data of all 1 045 bacterial otus detected in all samples were used as inputs for rf model training with 10 random seeds established to form different dataset divisions the one with the highest accuracy was selected to carry out importance ranking in accordance with the optimization process of prediction based on pcis the top 10 20 30 40 and 50 variables in the importance ranking of all bacteria were selected as inputs to develop the rf models the prediction results are shown in fig 4 and specific statistical data are provided in table s4 all five simplified models markedly reduced the oob error and improved the kappa coefficient the model based on the top 30 bacterial variables exhibited best performance with the lowest median oob error 10 89 and highest median kappa coefficient 0 8592 in comparison the top 10 and top 20 variables were insufficient for reflecting differences in water quality among the different areas presenting median oob errors of 15 84 and 13 37 and median kappa coefficients of 0 7525 and 0 7973 respectively conversely noise was introduced with the continuous increase in bacterial variables in the top 40 and 50 models which presented higher median oob errors of 11 39 and 12 87 and lower median kappa coefficients of 0 8587 and 0 8139 respectively therefore the top 30 bacterial set was considered as the optimal input set and was combined with the fungal and parb sets for further prediction most of the top 30 bacteria belonged to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes specific information on annotation results of the top 30 bacteria is provided in table s5 the models based on the five groups of top bacteria with 126 records of observations demonstrated more stable predictions on new datasets fig 4 b than the pci based models with 136 records of observations as shown in fig 2 b and fig 3 b to compare the prediction accuracies for each class the balanced accuracies of a m and u were determined as shown in fig 4 c e the balanced accuracy of class a was high and within a stable range of 0 9091 to 1 median of 0 9655 for the model based on the top 30 bacteria for class m the best prediction was obtained when using the model based on the top 50 bacteria which was high but within a less stable range of 0 8831 to 1 median of 0 9792 the balanced accuracy of class u was much lower in all rf models this was mainly due to the lower number of samples 25 compared with a and m 48 and 53 samples respectively which led to inadequate model training despite there being fewer class a than class m samples the balanced accuracies were generally high it can be inferred that higher bacterial diversity in mountainous water samples liao et al 2018 may lead to the requirement of more bacterial input variables to fully clarify characteristics it should be noted that prediction accuracy decreased with increasing u samples in the testing set for the same rf model which was dependent on the randomness of dataset division 3 2 2 predictions based on fungal abundance according to the selection and optimization processes of the bacterial variables the relative abundance data of all 423 fungal otus detected in all samples were used as inputs for rf model training with 10 random seeds the top 10 20 30 40 and 50 fungal variables selected by importance ranking were then taken as inputs to predict water sources based on the rf model the prediction results are shown in fig 5 and specific statistical data are provided in table s4 among the six groups of fungi based models the best prediction was achieved using the top 30 variables presenting a median oob error of 27 55 and median kappa coefficient of 0 6049 the best predictions for the a m and u classes were also achieved using the model based on the top 30 fungi with median balanced accuracies of 0 8534 0 8782 and 0 6409 respectively different from the bacterial models however the balanced accuracies of class a were lower than those of class m in addition the prediction performance of the fungal based models was markedly worse than that of the bacterial based models suggesting that fungal community do not show the same environmental sensitivity as bacterial community specific information on the annotation results of the top 30 fungi is provided in table s6 3 2 3 predictions based on different mbi combinations to further optimize the input variables the top 30 bacteria combined with parb mbi 31 and top 30 bacteria combined with both parb and the top 30 fungi mbi 61 were respectively used as inputs to predict water sample source importance ranking was carried out for the best prediction based on mbi 61 with the top 10 20 30 40 and 50 mbi variables respectively selected as inputs to perform prediction their performance comparison is shown in fig 6 and specific statistical data are provided in table s7 as shown in fig 6 all top mbi inputs provided low oob error rates and high median kappa coefficients however compared with the models based on top bacteria only fig 3 b the kappa coefficients in fig 6 b generally exhibited a broader range indicating that the addition of fungal variables led to prediction instability moreover according to the importance ranking shown in fig 6 c only three species of fungi ranked in the top 30 mbis further indicating that bacterial community had a much stronger indicator effect on differences in water samples than fungal al community among the seven groups of mbis the best prediction was achieved using the mbi 31 inputs with a median oob error of 9 9 and median kappa coefficient of 0 8694 which were slightly better than those obtained using the model based on the top 30 bacteria only suggesting that parb played a positive role in the prediction therefore the top 30 bacteria in combination with parb was the best mbi input set though the addition of parb slightly reduced classification robustness which was probably influenced by the limited amount of data 3 2 4 correlations among mdas and mbi abundances correlation analysis for abundances of the top 20 mbis and their mean mda values in the best predictions as above was performed with results expressed as correlation coefficients r as shown in table 1 the absolute amount for each mbi was obtained by its abundance multiplied by the total absolute cell counts in the water samples analyzed using flow cytometry liang et al 2020 the r values between the mdas of the top 20 mbis and their abundances amounts were very low suggesting no significant linear correlation previous research has suggested that certain dominant bacterial genera are not as sensitive to environment as non dominant genera wolińska et al 2018 3 3 predictions based on pcis and mbis 3 3 1 comparison of prediction performance comparisons of the prediction performance of the rf models based on mbis pcis and their combinations are shown in fig 7 predictions were further performed based on the top 10 20 and 30 combination inputs according to the importance ranking fig s2 as seen using combination inputs slightly improved the robustness of the predictions in particular using the top 20 and 30 combination inputs achieved median kappa coefficients of 0 8738 and 0 8769 respectively slightly higher than that of mbi 31 0 8694 which was probably due to the advantage of more data however the model based on the top 30 bacteria combined with parb still presented the lowest median oob error estimate 9 90 among all models indicating their importance and reliability in reflecting water quality characteristics according to the importance ranking fig s2 the mda of cbz still ranked first far exceeding other inputs again suggesting its indicative role in reflecting anthropological activities moreover nh4 n b147 cond b161 b220 and doc also showed very high mdas of note b147 g fimbriimonas was not found in most a samples whereas b161 f gzkb119 was only found in a and u samples 3 3 2 correlations among mbis and pcis correlation analysis was performed for the abundances of the top 30 mbis with parb with the measurement data of all 71 pcis the results are respectively presented in hierarchical clustering order fig 8 and original order fig s3 as shown in fig 8 several bacteria i e b189 f cytophagaceae b1014 f auto67 4w b6 g nitrosopumilus b560 c koll11 b31 o yla114 and b559 c pbs 25 showed similar features and were strongly negatively correlated with doc and moderately or weakly negatively correlated with some ppcps e g cbz and s pahs e g 1 cn d cn 2 cn ace and 9 fl these bacteria were found to be negatively correlated with b132 o gaiellales b71 o actinomycetales b258 f saprospiraceae and b931 f xanthomonadaceae b167 g paludibacter and b161 f gzkb119 also presented similar responses with positive correlation with nh4 n caf rox tppcp fluo 2 6 dmn dox and srp in addition b220 which was annotated to the flavobacteriaceae family was strongly positively correlated with conductivity previous research has suggested that flavobacteriaceae is sensitive to the ambient environment wolińska et al 2018 carrion et al 2019 gutiérrez et al 2018 as shown in fig s3 overall most of the top 30 bacteria had stronger correlation with cwqis followed by spahs ppcps and pahs of note b197 g leadbetterella exhibited strong positive correlation with several s pahs including phe ant flua pyr baa chry bbf and 9 clphe which has not been reported previously we speculated that leadbetterella may be related to the degradation of one or several of these s pahs in view of the high correlations between these compounds in addition parb was correlated with some conventional pcis and spahs rather than antibiotic ppcps and presented high positive correlation with b914 pseudomonas as reported in previous research liang et al 2020 therefore it can be inferred that the abundances of most of the top mbis were influenced by the comprehensive effects of multiple environmental pcis and interactions of other microbes 4 conclusions we explored and developed a rapid and reliable method for the identification of water sample sources based on the rf model the main conclusions are as follows 1 among the pci based models using cwqis as inputs provided markedly better classification than using ppcps and much better classification than using pahs and spahs using the top 10 pcis based on the importance ranking optimized prediction 2 among the mbi based models bacterial inputs provided much better source identification of water samples than fungal inputs in the comparison of the models based on mbis pcis and their combinations the top 30 bacteria in the importance ranking combined with parb as inputs provided the best prediction with the continuous increase in sample data availability in the future mbi based models should exhibit more significant advantages and could potentially be extended to the

16962,water quality can change along a river system due to differences in adjacent land use patterns and discharge sources these variations can induce rapid responses of the aquatic microbial community which may be an indicator of water quality characteristics in the current study we used a random forest model to predict water sample sources from three different river ecosystems along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance i e less disturbed mountainous area wastewater discharged urban area and pesticide and fertilizer applied agricultural area based on environmental physicochemical indices pcis microbiological indices mbis and their combination results showed that among the pci based models using conventional water quality indices as inputs provided markedly better prediction of water sample source than using pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and much better prediction than using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and substituted pahs spahs among the mbi based models using the abundances of the top 30 bacteria combined with pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb as inputs achieved the lowest median out of bag error rate 9 9 and increased median kappa coefficient 0 8694 while adding fungal inputs reduced the kappa coefficient the model based on the top 30 bacteria still showed an advantage compared with models based on pcis or the combination

use patterns and activities zhao et al 2020 wang et al 2014 accordingly microbial communities also have significant spatial heterogeneity with pollution gradients due to their sensitivity to the ambient environment bai et al 2018 blunt et al 2018 smith et al 2015 the structure and functional genes of aquatic microbial communities are also known to respond rapidly to pollutants entering the water environment even under extremely low concentrations of micropollutants and therefore microbial communities may reflect the effects of anthropogenic activities on natural aquatic ecosystems and physicochemical indices liao et al 2019 blunt et al 2018 liang et al 2020 liao et al 2018 lupo et al 2012 deciphering how aquatic microbial communities respond to different water environments is

al 2020 also employed rf algorithm and multi variate analysis to evaluate signatures of resistome microbiota and eco exposome of hospital wastewater hww compared to urban u ww and demonstrated a significant impact of pharmaceuticals and surfactants on the resistome and microbiota of h and u ww as sequencing technology continues to improve such approaches could be rapidly expanded deployed and scaled we previously revealed that both water quality and microbial communities change along polluted river gradients i e low disturbed mountain areas wastewater impacted urban areas and pesticide fertilizer applied agricultural areas liao et al 2018 we thus speculated that the site source of a water sample could potentially be identified based on microbial sequencing and chemical concentration data using a ml algorithm therefore the objectives of the current study were to 1 develop an optimization method for identifying water sample sources based on microbial sequencing data environmental parameters or their combination using the rf algorithm and 2 identify important variables in the predictions as the indicator pollutants or microorganisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study sample sites are located in the chaobai river beijing china the river successively flows through a mountainous area m 5 530 km2 urban area u 695 km2 where the river receives treated wastewater effluent and agricultural farmland a 4 624 km2 where the river receives pesticide fertilizer runoff as shown in fig 1 annual runoff into the chaobai river is about 2 000 104 m3 and average annual runoff from the municipal sewage treatment plant to the river is 919 104 m3 annual consumption of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer in the agricultural area is 89 900 and 29 900 tons respectively further details on the sampling area are provided in our previous paper liao et al 2018 2 2 dataset description water samples were collected at each sampling point every three months from december 2017 to september 2018 for both analysis of physicochemical indices pcis and microbial sequencing the pcis included 13 conventional water quality indices cwqis 34 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and substitute pahs spahs and 23 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps among which only ofloxacin was lower than its limit of quantification loq in all samples and was therefore removed from the pcis together with total s pahs tpah i e the sum of pahs and spahs and total ppcps tppcps i e the sum of ppcps 71 pcis were used as input parameters for data analysis as listed in table s1 with their abbreviations the microbial indices mbis obtained from 16s rrna and metagenomic sequencing included 1 045 bacterial operational taxonomic units otus and 423 fungal otus and pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria parb parb identified and quantified by liang et al 2020 were found to be significantly affected by municipal drainage and agriculture runoff and therefore selected as inputs in this study in total we obtained 123 records of cwqi observations each record consisted of 13 cwqi variables 125 records of ppcp observations each record consisted of 22 ppcp variables 126 records of observations for pah and spah each record consisted of 34 pah and spah variables and 126 records of observations for microbial abundance each record consisted of 1 045 bacterial otus and 423 fungal otus although some missing data existed due to individual sample loss for predictions of water sample sources based on the combinations of different types of input variables the rfimpute function was used to impute missing values and obtain optimal sample fitting values i e 136 records of observations for the six models based on pcis and the four models based on the combination of mbis and pcis the rfimpute function adopted is from the randomforest package in r v 3 5 2 in which the imputed value is the category with the largest average proximity for categorical predictors specific information on sample treatment and analysis methods is provided in previous research liao et al 2018 qiao et al 2020 su et al 2020 2 3 ml model selection seven classic ml algorithms i e ann multinomial logit mnl rf naive bayes nb k nearest neighbor knn support vector machine svm and linear discriminant analysis lda were selected for classification prediction to determine the best model ten fold cross validation was applied to estimate test errors of the models respectively based on an abundance dataset containing 18 bacterial otus 0 01 and an pci dataset via the errorest function in r v 3 5 2 water sample source was the only output categorical variable and included agricultural a mountainous m and urban u areas each operation was performed for five different divisions of the dataset i e training and testing data by setting five random seeds the results are provided in fig s1 with the rf algorithm presenting the lowest error the rf algorithm is widely used for analysis of environmental and microbial data baek et al 2021 song et al 2020 zeng et al 2017 furthermore it is insensitive to multicollinearity and robust to missing and unbalanced data and can adapt to datasets with thousands of interpretation variables breiman 2001 these factors accord with our study datasets especially for the screening of important variables from many bacterial otu inputs therefore rf was selected to perform dataset training and prediction in this study 2 4 rf model development and evaluation in the development of the rf models the measurement values of pcis abundance data of mbis and their combination were used as input datasets respectively before each rf model was established the best value for the key parameter mtry was determined by 10 fold cross validation and the parameter ntree was determined after stable algorithm operation for each rf model 80 of the dataset was randomly separated into a training set with the remaining 20 used as a testing set there were fewer u samples than a and m samples therefore 10 random seeds were established to form 10 different dataset divisions for independent calculation the 10 calculation results were statistically analyzed via boxplots to avoid the influence of extremely limited or significantly unbalanced datasets two performance parameters were applied simultaneously to evaluate the rf models including out of bag oob estimates of the error rate obtained on the training set and the kappa coefficient obtained from the testing set model accuracies are provided in the supporting information table s2 s4 the rf models were developed via the randomforest package in r v 3 5 2 2 5 selection of top variables for the high dimensional and small size datasets as described in 2 2 importance ranking was performed during model development to determine indicative pcis or mbis and identify top variables for further model optimization the mean decrease accuracy mda and mean decrease gini mdg indices which are based on oob error and gini impurity respectively were used to assess the importance of the input variables in the rf models the larger the mda or mdg value the more important the variable the mda and mdg rankings for most variables were very close in this study according to nicodemus 2011 under strong within predictor correlation mdg rankings were less stable than those using mda the subsequent selections of top variables for further modeling were based on mda rankings while the mdg rankings were only used as a qualitative reference the mda rankings were obtained via the importance and varimpplot functions in r v 3 5 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 predictions based on pcis 3 1 1 predictions based on different types of pcis considering only environmental pcis four sets of inputs were used in the rf model including 13 cwqis 22 ppcps 34 pahs and spahs and all 71 pcis the precision of the four models was compared with the oob estimates of the error rates and kappa coefficients shown in fig 2 a and b and specific statistical values shown in table s2 the models based solely on cwqis had the lowest oob errors ranging from 11 22 to 14 29 median of 12 24 and relatively high kappa coefficients ranging from 0 7002 to 0 8641 median of 0 7511 these results were only slightly lower than those obtained using a model based on all pcis suggesting that cwqis can reflect most water quality characteristics of different functional areas although significant information on ppcps and s pahs is not included in the cwqi based model the model based on all 71 pcis presented the highest median kappa coefficient of 0 7979 but also had a wider range 0 5891 0 9388 indicating that the prediction result was not as stable as the one based on cwqis which was likely due to the influence of input parameter noise from some ppcps and s pahs the model based solely on ppcps also had a low median oob error of 16 and a high median kappa coefficient of 0 7076 but it was unstable within a very wide range 0 4526 0 9351 the model based solely on pahs and spahs showed the worst prediction with the highest median oob error 28 71 and lowest median kappa coefficient 0 4704 among the 10 calculations with 10 random seeds for dataset division for all 71 pcis the best three predictions had relatively low oob errors of 12 84 15 6 and 17 43 respectively and correspondingly high kappa coefficients of 0 8792 0 9189 and 0 9388 respectively thus they were selected for importance ranking of input variables the ranking results for the top 30 pcis by median mda are shown in fig 2 c the mdas of all 71 pcis in the three best predictions and their median ranking results are provided in table s3 the three ranking results were similar indicating the reliability of the analysis thus the median mdas were applied for further analysis overall the mda of most cwqis was higher than that of other variables with median mdas for doc nh4 n cond no3 n tp tds orp and srp of 37 88 33 10 32 39 21 25 19 35 17 31 13 27 and 12 66 respectively therefore these important cwqi variables reflect the main differences in water quality among the different functional areas several ppcps presented very high mda values e g carbamazepine cbz 72 84 sulfamethoxazole smx 18 11 bezafibrate bf 17 34 and metoprolol met 12 15 and several ppcps in the top 30 pcis showed moderately high mda values in the range of 5 09 8 95 e g sulfadiazine sdz trimethoprim tmp lomefloxacin lom oxytetracycline otc chlortetracycline ctc roxithromycin rox and caffeine caf results showed that cbz ranked first among all pcis even higher than the cwqis indicating that cbz could be used as a possible anthropogenic marker in aquatic environments in accordance with several previous studies bjorlenius et al 2018 clara et al 2004 mei et al 2018 the extensive use of cbz and its limited removal in sewage treatment have resulted in large amounts of cbz entering surface water and cbz is also difficult to degrade in natural environments kosjek et al 2009 mei et al 2018 our study also showed that tppcps mda of 16 04 played an important role in the prediction i e eleventh in the mda ranking this suggests that tppcp concentration is an important indicator of anthropogenic activities and could be used to distinguish water sample sources in our previous research the detection frequencies and concentrations of most pharmaceuticals showed significant spatial heterogeneity among different land use types along the chaobai river and may originate from diverse pollution sources su et al 2020 the pharmaceuticals detected in the urban area were significantly associated with the wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the river while the agricultural area was additionally impacted by untreated wastewater from surrounding households and livestock farms the mdas of pahs and spahs were generally much lower except for 1 cn 19 17 and d cn 15 81 which ranked seventh and twelfth respectively and ace 9 62 bkf 9 07 1 clpyr 6 73 and acy 5 62 which ranked in the top 20 pcis notably the concentration levels of these pahs and spahs with high mda were very low along the whole river in particular the maximum value of 1 cn was only 2 9 ng l and it was not detected in most m sample points which probably led to its regional sensitivity kosjek et al 2009 mei et al 2018 in contrast the pahs and spahs with high general concentrations such as at aq 9 fl nap and phe qiao et al 2020 had low mda values 0 04 3 32 4 24 0 27 and 0 46 respectively indicating no significant differences among the different areas it could be speculated that the main source of these pahs in surface water may be atmospheric deposition or other important sources rather than sewage plant discharge thus the importance ranking further proved that the model using cwqis as inputs better predicted the water sample sources than those based solely on ppcps or s pahs 3 1 2 predictions based on different combinations of top pcis according to the mean importance ranking of all 71 pcis the top 10 20 30 40 and 50 pcis were respectively used as inputs to predict water sample source the oob estimates of the error rates and kappa coefficients for the prediction results are shown in fig 3 and specific statistical data are provided in table s2 compared with the model based on all pcis using the top 10 pcis as inputs significantly reduced the median oob error 13 76 to 11 93 and increased the kappa coefficient 0 7979 to 0 8260 however the median oob error increased to 12 39 12 84 12 84 and 13 76 for models based on the top 20 30 40 and 50 variables respectively indicating that too many environmental variables not only fail to provide useful information but may also introduce redundant noise especially when the observational data are very limited using the top 30 pcis achieved the highest median kappa coefficient of 0 8492 but the prediction was also less stable compared to the model based on the top 10 pcis however although these pci models generally showed stable oob errors on the training dataset the kappa coefficients for predictions using new data were very unstable 3 2 predictions based on mbis 3 2 1 predictions based on bacterial abundance the relative abundance data of all 1 045 bacterial otus detected in all samples were used as inputs for rf model training with 10 random seeds established to form different dataset divisions the one with the highest accuracy was selected to carry out importance ranking in accordance with the optimization process of prediction based on pcis the top 10 20 30 40 and 50 variables in the importance ranking of all bacteria were selected as inputs to develop the rf models the prediction results are shown in fig 4 and specific statistical data are provided in table s4 all five simplified models markedly reduced the oob error and improved the kappa coefficient the model based on the top 30 bacterial variables exhibited best performance with the lowest median oob error 10 89 and highest median kappa coefficient 0 8592 in comparison the top 10 and top 20 variables were insufficient for reflecting differences in water quality among the different areas presenting median oob errors of 15 84 and 13 37 and median kappa coefficients of 0 7525 and 0 7973 respectively conversely noise was introduced with the continuous increase in bacterial variables in the top 40 and 50 models which presented higher median oob errors of 11 39 and 12 87 and lower median kappa coefficients of 0 8587 and 0 8139 respectively therefore the top 30 bacterial set was considered as the optimal input set and was combined with the fungal and parb sets for further prediction most of the top 30 bacteria belonged to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes specific information on annotation results of the top 30 bacteria is provided in table s5 the models based on the five groups of top bacteria with 126 records of observations demonstrated more stable predictions on new datasets fig 4 b than the pci based models with 136 records of observations as shown in fig 2 b and fig 3 b to compare the prediction accuracies for each class the balanced accuracies of a m and u were determined as shown in fig 4 c e the balanced accuracy of class a was high and within a stable range of 0 9091 to 1 median of 0 9655 for the model based on the top 30 bacteria for class m the best prediction was obtained when using the model based on the top 50 bacteria which was high but within a less stable range of 0 8831 to 1 median of 0 9792 the balanced accuracy of class u was much lower in all rf models this was mainly due to the lower number of samples 25 compared with a and m 48 and 53 samples respectively which led to inadequate model training despite there being fewer class a than class m samples the balanced accuracies were generally high it can be inferred that higher bacterial diversity in mountainous water samples liao et al 2018 may lead to the requirement of more bacterial input variables to fully clarify characteristics it should be noted that prediction accuracy decreased with increasing u samples in the testing set for the same rf model which was dependent on the randomness of dataset division 3 2 2 predictions based on fungal abundance according to the selection and optimization processes of the bacterial variables the relative abundance data of all 423 fungal otus detected in all samples were used as inputs for rf model training with 10 random seeds the top 10 20 30 40 and 50 fungal variables selected by importance ranking were then taken as inputs to predict water sources based on the rf model the prediction results are shown in fig 5 and specific statistical data are provided in table s4 among the six groups of fungi based models the best prediction was achieved using the top 30 variables presenting a median oob error of 27 55 and median kappa coefficient of 0 6049 the best predictions for the a m and u classes were also achieved using the model based on the top 30 fungi with median balanced accuracies of 0 8534 0 8782 and 0 6409 respectively different from the bacterial models however the balanced accuracies of class a were lower than those of class m in addition the prediction performance of the fungal based models was markedly worse than that of the bacterial based models suggesting that fungal community do not show the same environmental sensitivity as bacterial community specific information on the annotation results of the top 30 fungi is provided in table s6 3 2 3 predictions based on different mbi combinations to further optimize the input variables the top 30 bacteria combined with parb mbi 31 and top 30 bacteria combined with both parb and the top 30 fungi mbi 61 were respectively used as inputs to predict water sample source importance ranking was carried out for the best prediction based on mbi 61 with the top 10 20 30 40 and 50 mbi variables respectively selected as inputs to perform prediction their performance comparison is shown in fig 6 and specific statistical data are provided in table s7 as shown in fig 6 all top mbi inputs provided low oob error rates and high median kappa coefficients however compared with the models based on top bacteria only fig 3 b the kappa coefficients in fig 6 b generally exhibited a broader range indicating that the addition of fungal variables led to prediction instability moreover according to the importance ranking shown in fig 6 c only three species of fungi ranked in the top 30 mbis further indicating that bacterial community had a much stronger indicator effect on differences in water samples than fungal al community among the seven groups of mbis the best prediction was achieved using the mbi 31 inputs with a median oob error of 9 9 and median kappa coefficient of 0 8694 which were slightly better than those obtained using the model based on the top 30 bacteria only suggesting that parb played a positive role in the prediction therefore the top 30 bacteria in combination with parb was the best mbi input set though the addition of parb slightly reduced classification robustness which was probably influenced by the limited amount of data 3 2 4 correlations among mdas and mbi abundances correlation analysis for abundances of the top 20 mbis and their mean mda values in the best predictions as above was performed with results expressed as correlation coefficients r as shown in table 1 the absolute amount for each mbi was obtained by its abundance multiplied by the total absolute cell counts in the water samples analyzed using flow cytometry liang et al 2020 the r values between the mdas of the top 20 mbis and their abundances amounts were very low suggesting no significant linear correlation previous research has suggested that certain dominant bacterial genera are not as sensitive to environment as non dominant genera wolińska et al 2018 3 3 predictions based on pcis and mbis 3 3 1 comparison of prediction performance comparisons of the prediction performance of the rf models based on mbis pcis and their combinations are shown in fig 7 predictions were further performed based on the top 10 20 and 30 combination inputs according to the importance ranking fig s2 as seen using combination inputs slightly improved the robustness of the predictions in particular using the top 20 and 30 combination inputs achieved median kappa coefficients of 0 8738 and 0 8769 respectively slightly higher than that of mbi 31 0 8694 which was probably due to the advantage of more data however the model based on the top 30 bacteria combined with parb still presented the lowest median oob error estimate 9 90 among all models indicating their importance and reliability in reflecting water quality characteristics according to the importance ranking fig s2 the mda of cbz still ranked first far exceeding other inputs again suggesting its indicative role in reflecting anthropological activities moreover nh4 n b147 cond b161 b220 and doc also showed very high mdas of note b147 g fimbriimonas was not found in most a samples whereas b161 f gzkb119 was only found in a and u samples 3 3 2 correlations among mbis and pcis correlation analysis was performed for the abundances of the top 30 mbis with parb with the measurement data of all 71 pcis the results are respectively presented in hierarchical clustering order fig 8 and original order fig s3 as shown in fig 8 several bacteria i e b189 f cytophagaceae b1014 f auto67 4w b6 g nitrosopumilus b560 c koll11 b31 o yla114 and b559 c pbs 25 showed similar features and were strongly negatively correlated with doc and moderately or weakly negatively correlated with some ppcps e g cbz and s pahs e g 1 cn d cn 2 cn ace and 9 fl these bacteria were found to be negatively correlated with b132 o gaiellales b71 o actinomycetales b258 f saprospiraceae and b931 f xanthomonadaceae b167 g paludibacter and b161 f gzkb119 also presented similar responses with positive correlation with nh4 n caf rox tppcp fluo 2 6 dmn dox and srp in addition b220 which was annotated to the flavobacteriaceae family was strongly positively correlated with conductivity previous research has suggested that flavobacteriaceae is sensitive to the ambient environment wolińska et al 2018 carrion et al 2019 gutiérrez et al 2018 as shown in fig s3 overall most of the top 30 bacteria had stronger correlation with cwqis followed by spahs ppcps and pahs of note b197 g leadbetterella exhibited strong positive correlation with several s pahs including phe ant flua pyr baa chry bbf and 9 clphe which has not been reported previously we speculated that leadbetterella may be related to the degradation of one or several of these s pahs in view of the high correlations between these compounds in addition parb was correlated with some conventional pcis and spahs rather than antibiotic ppcps and presented high positive correlation with b914 pseudomonas as reported in previous research liang et al 2020 therefore it can be inferred that the abundances of most of the top mbis were influenced by the comprehensive effects of multiple environmental pcis and interactions of other microbes 4 conclusions we explored and developed a rapid and reliable method for the identification of water sample sources based on the rf model the main conclusions are as follows 1 among the pci based models using cwqis as inputs provided markedly better classification than using ppcps and much better classification than using pahs and spahs using the top 10 pcis based on the importance ranking optimized prediction 2 among the mbi based models bacterial inputs provided much better source identification of water samples than fungal inputs in the comparison of the models based on mbis pcis and their combinations the top 30 bacteria in the importance ranking combined with parb as inputs provided the best prediction with the continuous increase in sample data availability in the future mbi based models should exhibit more significant advantages and could potentially be extended to the

16963,with the linkage between dissolved organic matter dom and the characteristics of natural ecosystem assessed extensively the properties of dom in reservoirs the typical human interrupted ecosystems have been focused on in recent years which is critical for the understanding of human impacts on watershed ecosystems and carbon cycling this study aims to analyze the effect of hydrological management on the dom chemistry and organic carbon burial in daning river tributary of the world s largest three gorges reservoir tgr based on the application of a combined approach including bulk geochemical analyses optical spectroscopy and ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry various sources of dom terrestrial anthropogenic and autochthonous sources were revealed an increasing trend of terrestrial and recalcitrant dom was observed along the upstream to downstream transect of daning river tributary which was mainly caused by the water intrusion with a higher terrestrial and recalcitrant signature from mainstream to tributary resulted from hydrological management of tgr integrated with the analysis of sedimentary organic matter in daning river tributary in the past decade after the construction of tgr our work suggests that organic carbon burial in the reservoir could be enhanced by hydrological management induced variation in dom chemistry further studies are needed to better constrain the effects of damming reservoirs on carbon cycling considering their booming all over the world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter three gorges reservoir organic carbon burial hydrological management optical properties ft icr ms 1 introduction with economic development all over the world the construction of reservoirs increased dramatically over the past several decades especially in developing countries the number of reservoirs increased by more than 70 and the total reservoir storage volume increased from about 3500 to nearly 6200 km3 since 1980 world commission on dams 2000 maavara et al 2017 as the most far reaching human modifications of the flows of rivers reservoirs take on various kinds of functions including flood control power generation navigation drinking water supply however the construction and operation of reservoirs lead to significant changes in hydrological conditions which give rise to various ecological responses including both benefits and side effects mallik and richardson 2009 issues such as water level alteration flow changes sediment trapping disruption of nutrient balance and algal blooms had arisen in most reservoirs due to the hydrological management cortes et al 2002 taleb et al 2004 bennett et al 2007 mims et al 2013 since the hydrological management of reservoirs exerted a non negligible effect on the chemical energy distribution in the watershed the dynamic processes of natural organic matter including dissolved organic matter dom would be altered significantly hur et al 2007 maavara et al 2020 dom is an organic assemblage of numerous molecules with different sources and biochemical characteristics stedmon et al 2003 as one of the most dynamic reactive carbon pools on earth dom plays a crucial part in global carbon cycling and has attracted substantial attention mopper et al 2014 the significant influence of hydrology e g discharge changes rainfall alterations on the quantity and quality of dom has been assessed in natural aquatic ecosystems inamdar et al 2011 bao et al 2019 however the effect of reservoir hydrological management induced variations in dom cycling was less constrained he et al 2020a ma and li 2020 maavara et al 2020 wang et al 2021 as the largest artificial reservoir in the world the three gorges reservoir tgr plays a crucial part in the economic development of china since its full operation in 2008 with a watershed area of 1080 km2 along the yangtze river from chongqing to yichang tgr exerts a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 with the operation of tgr several hydrological alterations have taken place the water level fluctuation zone the area of periodically submerged soils is formed due to the management of tgr with a water level fluctuation of 30 m ranging from 145 m to 175 m bao et al 2015 hu et al 2013 and dai and liu 2013 found that the water velocity was significantly reduced in the mainstream of tgr since its impoundment so as the flux of suspended particles algal blooms were observed in several segments of tgr cai et al 2006 these alterations in physicochemical conditions of tgr have gained wide attention especially for carbon cycling maavara et al 2020 our previous study has preliminarily depicted the relationship between hydrological management and co2 emission in tgr due to the degradation of labile components of dom he et al 2020b previous studies have found that the recalcitrant component of dom can devote to the in situ organic carbon oc burial e g schmidt et al 2009 but whether and how it is affected by the hydrological management of reservoirs is poorly known therefore the comprehensive understanding of alteration dynamics and fate of dom would offer better insight into the carbon cycling in reservoirs analytical techniques of dom develop significantly in the past several decades from initial bulk chemical characteristic analysis to optical properties depiction of colored dom cdom and fluorescent dom fdom including ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis and excitation and emission matrixes eems hansen et al 2016 the combination of eems and parallel factor analysis parafac is also developed stedmon et al 2003 humic like and protein like parafac components from various sources could be

assessed so as its environmental behaviors mcknight et al 2001 sleighter et al 2014 in this study we investigated one of the largest tributaries of tgr daning river we collected surface and bottom

description the tgr is located on the yangtze river in south central china 110 25 111 06 e 31 04 31 34 n with the function of controlling floods generating electricity and improving navigability this reservoir project started in 1994 and run since 2008 the area of tgr has a subtropical monsoon humid climate with an average annual temperature of 18 9 c and precipitation between 817 1 and 1360 5 mm daning river one of the largest tributaries in the tgr region with an average discharge of 73 m3 s is located in the middle section of tgr and at a distance of 123 km from the dam the length and watershed of daning river are ca 162 km and 4170 km2 respectively covering both wushan and wuxi counties fig 1 the watershed of daning river has a high mountain canyon topography and mountains cover 95 of the total area with an average elevation of 1197 m 2 2 sample collection to capture the optimal effect of hydrological management of reservoir we sampled in november of the year 2017 storage period during which the flow was reduced to store water in the reservoir and the hydrological regime was shifted from river to semi lake like condition by management zhou et al 2016 zhao 2017 surface ca 1 m deep and bottom water ca 50 m deep samples were collected based on topography from 8 sites in daning river dn07 dn00 dn00 is the most downstream estuary site and dn07 is the most upstream site about 40 km to the estuary fig 1 besides that three surface water samples 01 02 and 03 were collected in mainstream all water samples were collected using hydrochloric acid trace metal purity precleaned nalgene bottles transported back to the lab on ice all water samples were filtered through precombusted 0 7 μm glass fiber filters whatman gff and 0 22 μm membrane filters millipore to remove particles algal aggregates and most bacteria within 24 hr of sampling to obtain dom in water seidel et al 2014 to assess the dom characteristics in buried sediments surface sediments and a

sources were revealed in daning river through the analyses of dom by uv vis eems and ft icr ms our study identified two humic like components c1 and c3 in dom which are considered to be derived from terrestrial sources these two humic like components were also identified in the lakes and estuaries stedmon et al 2005 murphy et al 2014 besides the range of hix and suva254 values of cdom 0 47 0 65 3 31 5 44 l mg c 1m 1 respectively suggested terrestrial inputs as well hansen et al 2016 considering the parameter ranges of aquatic ecosystems including rivers and lakes suva254 0 6 to 5 3 l mg c 1 m 1 hix 0 39 to 0 87 the values of these parameters indicated that cdom in daning river was in the high end of aromaticity and humification degree weishaar et al 2003 kothawala et al 2012b in terms of molecular composition the detection of polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds in spe dom which could be indicators of vascular plant sourced organic matter and products of lignin degradation respectively demonstrated the input of terrestrial organic matter seidel et al 2015 besides the significant positive correlations spearman s rank correlation r 0 5 p 0 01 between terrestrial indicators of fdom hix c1 and c3 and spe dom aimod polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds further confirmed the terrestrial source of dom table s6 the protein like c4 has a similar eems peak range to the c5 in the inland water system and c6 in liverpool bay uk which were associated with the aquatic organisms osburn et al 2016 yamashita et al 2011 the identification of peptides and unsaturated aliphatic compounds in spe dom by ft icr ms also indicated the contribution of dom from aquatic organisms seidel et al 2015 the significant correlations p 0 01 between peptides or unsaturated compounds and fi or bix further confirmed the aquatic input table s6 no significant positive correlation was observed between c4 and peptides or unsaturated aliphatic compounds which might result from the limitation of the analytical window of ft icr ms for high molecular weight e g 700 da compounds associated with c4 the protein like c2 is similar to the c5 component reported by murphy et al 2014 which was identified in wastewaters and indicated the anthropogenic input in terms of molecular composition o3s and o5s classes of compounds identified in ft icr ms which might relate to surface active ingredients in cleaning and personal care products also signify the anthropogenic input melendez perez et al 2016 in addition a significant correlation p 0 01 between c2 and o3s and o5s compounds further supported the input of anthropogenic sourced dom table s6 4 2 the effect of hydrological management on dom chemistry in daning river a significant p 0 01 decreasing proportion of terrestrial derived dom and an increasing p 0 01 proportion of autochthonous and anthropogenic derived dom along the upstream to downstream dn07 to dn00 transect were observed figs 1 3 4 the values of hix suva254 and aimod increased significantly p 0 01 along the upstream to downstream transect suggesting that dom in downstream had higher aromaticity and humification degree but a smaller proportion of microbial or freshly produced dom that of the upstream figs 3 4 no significant differences were observed for the optical and molecular indices between the surface and bottom waters which demonstrated that the dom chemistry showed limited vertical variations during the sampling period the variations in dom chemistry along the upstream to downstream transect were further revealed by the pca fig 6 the loadings of the first two principal components captured 73 of the total variations the first principal component pc1 showed strong positive loadings for parameters associated with humification e g suva254 and aimod and parafac components or molecular groups associated with humic like compounds e g c1 c3 polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds and negative loadings for parameters associated with freshly produced dom e g h c c4 peptides and unsaturated aliphatic compounds samples at downstream sites e g dn00 dn01 and dn02 have positive scores on pc1 and are plotted near aimod suva254 c1 c3 polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds suggesting a higher proportion of terrestrially sourced dom than samples in upstream e g dn05 dn06 and dn07 which have negative scores on pc1 since there were similar vegetation distribution land use and geomorphology along the short ca 35 km distance upstream to downstream transect the spatial variation in dom chemistry e g the relative abundance of terrestrial dom might result from other factors especially the water exchange between mainstream and tributary due to the reservoir hydrological management he et al 2020b several studies have focused on the interaction processes of river waters between the tributaries and mainstream of tgr mainstream due to hydrological management ji et al 2010 these studies found that the mainstream of the tgr intruded into all tributaries e g xiangxi river a tributary close to the three gorges dam as a density current with different plunging depths and would result in 70 of tributary water come from mainstream ji et al 2010 cl was used as a tracer to estimate the water source in the daning river and the results showed that on average 73 of the water in daning river is from the tgr mainstream ran et al 2010 xiong 2013 proposed a water exchange model in daning river during november same as our sampling month which is characterized by water intrusion from the mainstream to daning river tributary this water exchange model in daning river is found during both drainage and storage periods huang et al 2017 zhao 2017 han et al 2020 although the water velocity was not directly measured in this study the concentrations of conservative cations and anions e g na cl measured in this study also supported the water intrusion process table s1 for instance it is known the mainstream water is characterized by higher concentrations of cations and anions ran et al 2010 and there was a gradual increase of both cations and anions e g na cl along the upstream to downstream dn07 to dn00 transect table s1 in this regard the dom variation along the upstream to downstream can be mainly explained by this water exchange model and a conceptual model of dom dynamics is developed fig 7 the hydrological management of the tgr resulted in the water intrusion from the mainstream to daning river tributary figs 2 7 since the dom in the mainstream had a significantly higher p 0 01 proportion of terrestrial signal table s7 the increase of terrestrial signal from the upstream to downstream could result mainly from the mainstream water intrusion therefore the hydrological management of the tgr introduced additional terrestrial dom to daning river tributary since the water intrusion to daning river tributary has been observed from january to december xiong 2013 zhao et al 2015 the addition of dom from the mainstream to daning river tributary likely exists in multiple months zhao et al 2015 zhao 2017 han et al 2020 4 3 implications for organic carbon burial and further considerations the linkage between human activities and oc burial has been increasingly emphasized sundquist et al 1993 stackpoole et al 2014 in particular the relationship between reservoir operation and oc burial has been paid attention tranvik et al 2009 maavara et al 2020 although the oc burial is influenced by sediment transport it is known that the dom transported through the water column to the sediments could be an important way of oc accumulation in sediments as well tranvik et al 2009 for instance recalcitrant dom compounds with carboxylic and hydroxylic groups e g crams allow for ligand exchange with metals on mineral surfaces kothawala et al 2012a resulting in preferential adsorption to particles and further deposited in sediments kalbitz et al 2005 besides the flocculation of recalcitrant dom with metals such as fe has also been observed in various aquatic ecosystems yu et al 2015 jilbert et al 2017 and this association has devoted to stabilize oc in sediments and promote carbon burial lalonde et al 2012 in particular there was a positive relationship between the contents of recalcitrant doc and total oc in sediments schmidt et al 2009 with the significant addition of terrestrial and recalcitrant dom from the mainstream the effect of reservoir hydrological management on the oc burial in daning river tributary is further explored firstly since the river reservoir is constructed it will result in longer water residence time compared with the natural river and thus increase the in situ primary production e g cai et al 2006 this increased in situ primary production will lead to increased deposition of autochthonous organic matter through time li et al 2015 estimated that the δ13c of phytoplankton derived particulate organic carbon in changjiang river is ca 32 0 to 30 0 which is even more depleted in 13c than that of the higher plants nevertheless the dom derived from phytoplankton usually has lower hix values e g lee et al 2019 wang et al 2019 considering the overall high hix values observed in this study the dom is likely mainly derived from terrestrial sources therefore we suggest that the autochthonous dom from phytoplankton is usually characterized by higher δ13c and lower hix values than those of terrestrial plant derived organic matter which will lead to increased δ13c for the toc of sediments and decrease of hix for water extractable organic matter with time however our surface sediment showed lower δ13c toc of the sediments and higher hix water extractable organic matter of the sediments than those of deeper sediments as such increased deposition of autochthonous organic matter through time cannot explain the vertical distribution of δ13c and hix the second factor to consider is that oc will undergo consistent degradation during its burial nevertheless the degradation seems not to be a dominant factor affecting the distribution of oc quantity and quality with depth because during biodegradation of dom the hix value will increase due to the preferential removal of protein like components and preservation of humic like components which has been observed in multiple studies e g hansen et al 2016 and our previous incubation experiments at xiangxi river tributary of the yangtze river he et al 2020b leading to increase of hix values with depth however this is not the case observed here therefore integrated with the conceptual model fig 7 we suggest that the increasing hix value of extractable organic matter from bottom to top layers of the sediment core is mainly caused by the increasing terrestrial signal in daning river tributary through time which might be related to the addition of terrestrial and recalcitrant dom from the mainstream fig 5 moreover the quality association of doc and oc was observed in the sediments of daning river tributary by the significant positive correlation p 0 01 between the hix value of dom and oc for the sediment core samples fig s5 specifically there were significantly increasing trends p 0 01 of hix and oc values and a decreasing trend p 0 01 of δ13c values from bottom to top layers of the sediment core demonstrating the increase of terrestrial oc for both toc and dom of sediments in daning river tributary with damming time increase fig 5 considering the increasing terrestrial signal from the bottom to top layers of the sediment core of daning river tributary and the established water intrusion regime from the mainstream to tributary we speculate that the hydrological management of tgr makes an important devotion to the oc burial in tributaries with similar hydrodynamics to daning river tributary through the addition of dom with more terrestrial and recalcitrant signature about 26 tg oc per year has been estimated to bury in global reservoirs which would increase to 52 tg oc per year by 2030 due to the construction and operation of reservoirs a fourfold increase compared with that in 1970 maavara et al 2017 considering the linkage between hydrological management and dom chemistry in daning river tributary the hydrological management induced variations in dom chemistry should contribute to the estimated increase of oc burial in reservoirs around the world this study has provided novel insights into the oc burial mechanism in a typical tributary of the world s largest reservoir this investigation was carried out in november with low river flow which likely facilitates dom adsorption on particles and sedimentation in the lentic environment future seasonal investigations and more sedimentary cores are needed to make a more comprehensive assessment of the linkage between dom chemistry and oc burial in addition to hydrological management other factors may also affect the dom chemistry and oc burial in reservoirs for instance both biodegradation and photodegradation may affect the spatial variations in dom chemistry along the upstream to downstream transect the mutual transformation among dom particulate organic matter pom and sedimentary organic matter would also influence the oc burial in reservoirs he et al 2016 in this regard further qualitative and quantitative assessments of the factors affecting dom chemistry and oc burial are encouraged to address the environmental and management control of carbon cycling in reservoirs 5 conclusions this study provides comprehensive evidence that the hydrological management of the tgr has a substantial effect on the quantity and quality of dom in daning river tributary significant changes in optical and molecular properties of dom were revealed in both surface and bottom water along the upstream to downstream transect of daning river tributary a significant increasing trend of aromaticity and humification degree revealed by suva254 hix and aimod was observed along the upstream to downstream transect besides the alteration of various sources of dom anthropogenic terrestrial and autochthonous inputs was uncovered by the changes in a variety of optical and molecular parameters identified by eems and ft icr ms a significant increasing trend of terrestrial signal from the upstream to downstream transect was observed which was mainly caused by water intrusion from the mainstream to tributary due to the hydrological management of tgr the hydrological management of tgr likely further contributes to the increase of oc burial in daning river tributary collectively this study emphasized the role of hydrological management in alteration of dom chemistry and oc burial in a typical tributary of tgr and provided insights into the interaction between anthropogenic perturbations and carbon cycling in fluvial ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16963,with the linkage between dissolved organic matter dom and the characteristics of natural ecosystem assessed extensively the properties of dom in reservoirs the typical human interrupted ecosystems have been focused on in recent years which is critical for the understanding of human impacts on watershed ecosystems and carbon cycling this study aims to analyze the effect of hydrological management on the dom chemistry and organic carbon burial in daning river tributary of the world s largest three gorges reservoir tgr based on the application of a combined approach including bulk geochemical analyses optical spectroscopy and ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry various sources of dom terrestrial anthropogenic and autochthonous sources were revealed an increasing trend of terrestrial and recalcitrant dom was observed along the upstream to downstream transect of daning river tributary which was mainly caused by the water intrusion with a higher terrestrial and recalcitrant signature from mainstream to tributary resulted from hydrological management of tgr integrated with the analysis of sedimentary organic matter in daning river tributary in the past decade after the construction of tgr our work suggests that organic carbon burial in the reservoir could be enhanced by hydrological management induced

graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter three gorges reservoir organic carbon burial hydrological management optical properties ft icr ms 1 introduction with economic development all over the world the construction of reservoirs increased dramatically over the past several decades especially in developing countries the number of reservoirs increased by more than 70 and the total reservoir storage volume increased from about 3500 to nearly 6200 km3 since 1980 world commission on dams 2000 maavara et al 2017 as the most far reaching human modifications of the flows of rivers reservoirs take on various kinds of functions including flood control power generation navigation drinking water supply however the construction and operation of reservoirs lead to significant changes in hydrological conditions which give rise to various ecological responses including both benefits and side effects mallik and richardson 2009 issues such as water level alteration flow changes sediment trapping disruption of nutrient balance and algal blooms had arisen in most reservoirs due to the hydrological management cortes et al 2002 taleb et al 2004 bennett et al 2007 mims et al 2013 since the hydrological management of reservoirs exerted a non negligible effect on the chemical energy distribution in the watershed the dynamic processes of natural organic matter including dissolved organic matter dom would be altered significantly hur et al 2007 maavara et al 2020 dom is an organic assemblage of numerous molecules with different sources and biochemical characteristics stedmon et al 2003 as one of the most dynamic reactive carbon pools on earth dom plays a crucial part in global carbon cycling and has attracted substantial attention mopper et al 2014 the significant influence of hydrology e g discharge changes rainfall alterations on the quantity and quality of dom has been assessed in natural aquatic ecosystems inamdar et al 2011 bao et al 2019 however the effect of reservoir hydrological management induced variations in dom cycling was less constrained he et al 2020a ma and li 2020 maavara et al 2020 wang et al 2021 as the largest artificial reservoir in the world the three gorges reservoir tgr plays a crucial part in the economic development of china since its full operation in 2008 with a watershed area of 1080 km2 along the yangtze river from chongqing to yichang tgr exerts a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 with the operation of tgr several hydrological alterations have taken place the water level fluctuation zone the area of periodically submerged soils is formed due to the management of tgr with a water level fluctuation of 30 m ranging from 145 m to 175 m bao et al 2015 hu et al 2013 and dai and liu 2013 found that the water velocity was significantly reduced in the mainstream of tgr since its impoundment so as the flux of suspended particles algal blooms were observed in several segments of tgr cai et al 2006 these alterations in physicochemical conditions of tgr have gained wide attention especially for carbon cycling maavara et al 2020 our previous study has preliminarily depicted the relationship between hydrological management and co2 emission in tgr due to the degradation of labile components of dom he et al 2020b previous studies have found that the recalcitrant component of dom can devote to the in situ organic carbon oc burial e g schmidt et al 2009 but whether and how it is affected by the hydrological management of reservoirs is poorly known therefore the comprehensive understanding of alteration dynamics and fate of dom would offer better insight into the carbon cycling in reservoirs analytical techniques of dom develop significantly in the past several decades from initial bulk chemical characteristic analysis to optical properties depiction of colored dom cdom and fluorescent dom fdom including ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis and excitation and emission matrixes eems hansen et al 2016 the combination of eems and parallel factor analysis parafac is also developed stedmon et al 2003 humic like and protein like parafac components from various sources could be

cho chon and chos classes in dom are identified and several molecular groups have been preliminarily linked with different sources such as anthropogenic sources and terrestrial inputs which are not accessible through conventional analytical techniques with the combination of these approaches compositional details lability and degradability biodegradability and photodegradability of dom could be assessed so as its environmental behaviors mcknight et al 2001 sleighter et al 2014 in this study we investigated one of the largest tributaries of tgr daning river we collected surface and bottom

sources were revealed in daning river through the analyses of dom by uv vis eems and ft icr ms our study identified two humic like components c1 and c3 in dom which are considered to be derived from terrestrial sources these two humic like components were also identified in the lakes and estuaries stedmon et al 2005 murphy et al 2014 besides the range of hix and suva254 values of cdom 0 47 0 65 3 31 5 44 l mg c 1m 1 respectively suggested terrestrial inputs as well hansen et al 2016 considering the parameter ranges of aquatic ecosystems including rivers and lakes suva254 0 6 to 5 3 l mg c 1 m 1 hix 0 39 to 0 87 the values of these parameters indicated that cdom in daning river was in the high end of aromaticity and humification degree weishaar et al 2003 kothawala et al 2012b in terms of molecular composition the detection of polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds in spe dom which could be indicators of vascular plant sourced organic matter and products of lignin degradation respectively demonstrated the input of terrestrial organic matter seidel et al 2015 besides the significant positive correlations spearman s rank correlation r 0 5 p 0 01 between terrestrial indicators of fdom hix c1 and c3 and spe dom aimod polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds further confirmed the terrestrial source of dom table s6 the protein like c4 has a similar eems peak range to the c5 in the inland water system and c6 in liverpool bay uk which were associated with the aquatic organisms osburn et al 2016 yamashita et al 2011 the identification of peptides and unsaturated aliphatic compounds in spe dom by ft icr ms also indicated the contribution of dom from aquatic organisms seidel et al 2015 the significant correlations p 0 01 between peptides or unsaturated compounds and fi or bix further confirmed the aquatic input table s6 no significant positive correlation was observed between c4 and peptides or unsaturated aliphatic compounds which might result from the limitation of the analytical window of ft icr ms for high molecular weight e g 700 da compounds associated with c4 the protein like c2 is similar to the c5 component reported by murphy et al 2014 which was identified in wastewaters and indicated the anthropogenic input in terms of molecular composition o3s and o5s classes of compounds identified in ft icr ms which might relate to surface active ingredients in cleaning and personal care products also signify the anthropogenic input melendez perez et al 2016 in addition a significant correlation p 0 01 between c2 and o3s and o5s compounds further supported the input of anthropogenic sourced dom table s6 4 2 the effect of hydrological management on dom chemistry in daning river a significant p 0 01 decreasing proportion of terrestrial derived dom and an increasing p 0 01 proportion of autochthonous and anthropogenic derived dom along the upstream to downstream dn07 to dn00 transect were observed figs 1 3 4 the values of hix suva254 and aimod increased significantly p 0 01 along the upstream to downstream transect suggesting that dom in downstream had higher aromaticity and humification degree but a smaller proportion of microbial or freshly produced dom that of the upstream figs 3 4 no significant differences were observed for the optical and molecular indices between the surface and bottom waters which demonstrated that the dom chemistry showed limited vertical variations during the sampling period the variations in dom chemistry along the upstream to downstream transect were further revealed by the pca fig 6 the loadings of the first two principal components captured 73 of the total variations the first principal component pc1 showed strong positive loadings for parameters associated with humification e g suva254 and aimod and parafac components or molecular groups associated with humic like compounds e g c1 c3 polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds and negative loadings for parameters associated with freshly produced dom e g h c c4 peptides and unsaturated aliphatic compounds samples at downstream sites e g dn00 dn01 and dn02 have positive scores on pc1 and are plotted near aimod suva254 c1 c3 polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds suggesting a higher proportion of terrestrially sourced dom than samples in upstream e g dn05 dn06 and dn07 which have negative scores on pc1 since there were similar vegetation distribution land use and geomorphology along the short ca 35 km distance upstream to downstream transect the spatial variation in dom chemistry e g the relative abundance of terrestrial dom might result from other factors especially the water exchange between mainstream and tributary due to the reservoir hydrological management he et al 2020b several studies have focused on the interaction processes of river waters between the tributaries and mainstream of tgr mainstream due to hydrological management ji et al 2010 these studies found that the mainstream of the tgr intruded into all tributaries e g xiangxi river a tributary close to the three gorges dam as a density current with different plunging depths and would result in 70 of tributary water come from mainstream ji et al 2010 cl was used as a tracer to estimate the water source in the daning river and the results showed that on average 73 of the water in daning river is from the tgr mainstream ran et al 2010 xiong 2013 proposed a water exchange model in daning river during november same as our sampling month which is characterized by water intrusion from the mainstream to daning river tributary this water exchange model in daning river is found during both drainage and storage periods huang et al 2017 zhao 2017 han et al 2020 although the water velocity was not directly measured in this study the concentrations of conservative cations and anions e g na cl measured in this study also supported the water intrusion process table s1 for instance it is known the mainstream water is characterized by higher concentrations of cations and anions ran et al 2010 and there was a gradual increase of both cations and anions e g na cl along the upstream to downstream dn07 to dn00 transect table s1 in this regard the dom variation along the upstream to downstream can be mainly explained by this water exchange model and a conceptual model of dom dynamics is developed fig 7 the hydrological management of the tgr resulted in the water intrusion from the mainstream to daning river tributary figs 2 7 since the dom in the mainstream had a significantly higher p 0 01 proportion of terrestrial signal table s7 the increase of terrestrial signal from the upstream to downstream could result mainly from the mainstream water intrusion therefore the hydrological management of the tgr introduced additional terrestrial dom to daning river tributary since the water intrusion to daning river tributary has been observed from january to december xiong 2013 zhao et al 2015 the addition of dom from the mainstream to daning river tributary likely exists in multiple months zhao et al 2015 zhao 2017 han et al 2020 4 3 implications for organic carbon burial and further considerations the linkage between human activities and oc burial has been increasingly emphasized sundquist et al 1993 stackpoole et al 2014 in particular the relationship between reservoir operation and oc burial has been paid attention tranvik et al 2009 maavara et al 2020 although the oc burial is influenced by sediment transport it is known that the dom transported through the water column to the sediments could be an important way of oc accumulation in sediments as well tranvik et al 2009 for instance recalcitrant dom compounds with carboxylic and hydroxylic groups e g crams allow for ligand exchange with metals on mineral surfaces kothawala et al 2012a resulting in preferential adsorption to particles and further deposited in sediments kalbitz et al 2005 besides the flocculation of recalcitrant dom with metals such as fe has also been observed in various aquatic ecosystems yu et al 2015 jilbert et al 2017 and this association has devoted to stabilize oc in sediments and promote carbon burial lalonde et al 2012 in particular there was a positive relationship between the contents of recalcitrant doc and total oc in sediments schmidt et al 2009 with the significant addition of terrestrial and recalcitrant dom from the mainstream the effect of reservoir hydrological management on the oc burial in daning river tributary is further explored firstly since the river reservoir is constructed it will result in longer water residence time compared with the natural river and thus increase the in situ primary production e g cai et al 2006 this increased in situ primary production will lead to increased deposition of autochthonous organic matter through time li et al 2015 estimated that the δ13c of phytoplankton derived particulate organic carbon in changjiang river is ca 32 0 to 30 0 which is even more depleted in 13c than that of the higher plants nevertheless the dom derived from phytoplankton usually has lower hix values e g lee et al 2019 wang et al 2019 considering the overall high hix values observed in this study the dom is likely mainly derived from terrestrial sources therefore we suggest that the autochthonous dom from phytoplankton is usually characterized by higher δ13c and lower hix values than those of terrestrial plant derived organic matter which will lead to increased δ13c for the toc of sediments and decrease of hix for water extractable organic matter with time however our surface sediment showed lower δ13c toc of the sediments and higher hix water extractable organic matter of the sediments than those of deeper sediments as such increased deposition of autochthonous organic matter through time cannot explain the vertical distribution of δ13c and hix the second factor to consider is that oc will undergo consistent degradation during its burial nevertheless the degradation seems not to be a dominant factor affecting the distribution of oc quantity and quality with depth because during biodegradation of dom the hix value will increase due to the preferential removal of protein like components and preservation of humic like components which has been observed in multiple studies e g hansen et al 2016 and our previous incubation experiments at xiangxi river tributary of the yangtze river he et al 2020b leading to increase of hix values with depth however this is not the case observed here therefore integrated with the conceptual model fig 7 we suggest that the increasing hix value of extractable organic matter from bottom to top layers of the sediment core is mainly caused by the increasing terrestrial signal in daning river tributary through time which might be related to the addition of terrestrial and recalcitrant dom from the mainstream fig 5 moreover the quality association of doc and oc was observed in the sediments of daning river tributary by the significant positive correlation p 0 01 between the hix value of dom and oc for the sediment core samples fig s5 specifically there were significantly increasing trends p 0 01 of hix and oc values and a decreasing trend p 0 01 of δ13c values from bottom to top layers of the sediment core demonstrating the increase of terrestrial oc for both toc and dom of sediments in daning river tributary with damming time increase fig 5 considering the increasing terrestrial signal from the bottom to top layers of the sediment core of daning river tributary and the established water intrusion regime from the mainstream to tributary we speculate that the hydrological management of tgr makes an important devotion to the oc burial in tributaries with similar hydrodynamics to daning river tributary through the addition of dom with more terrestrial and recalcitrant signature about 26 tg oc per year has been estimated to bury in global reservoirs which would increase to 52 tg oc per year by 2030 due to the construction and operation of reservoirs a fourfold increase compared with that in 1970 maavara et al 2017 considering the linkage between hydrological management and dom chemistry in daning river tributary the hydrological management induced variations in dom chemistry should contribute to the estimated increase of oc burial in reservoirs around the world this study has provided novel insights into the oc burial mechanism in a typical tributary of the world s largest reservoir this investigation was carried out in november with low river flow which likely facilitates dom adsorption on particles and sedimentation in the lentic environment future seasonal investigations and more sedimentary cores are needed to make a more comprehensive assessment of the linkage between dom chemistry and oc burial in addition to hydrological management other factors may also affect the dom chemistry and oc burial in reservoirs for instance both biodegradation and photodegradation may affect the spatial variations in dom chemistry along the upstream to downstream transect the mutual transformation among dom particulate organic matter pom and sedimentary organic matter would also influence the oc burial in reservoirs he et al 2016 in this regard further qualitative and quantitative assessments of the factors affecting dom chemistry and oc burial are encouraged to address the environmental and management control of carbon cycling in reservoirs 5 conclusions this study provides comprehensive evidence that the hydrological management of the tgr has a substantial effect on the quantity and quality of dom in daning river tributary significant changes in optical and molecular properties of dom were revealed in both surface and bottom water along the upstream to downstream transect of daning river tributary a significant increasing trend of aromaticity and humification degree revealed by suva254 hix and aimod was observed along the upstream to downstream transect besides the alteration of various sources of dom anthropogenic terrestrial and autochthonous inputs was uncovered by the changes in a variety of optical and molecular parameters identified by eems and ft icr ms a significant increasing trend of terrestrial signal from the upstream to downstream transect was observed which was mainly caused by water intrusion from the mainstream to tributary due to the hydrological management of tgr the hydrological management of tgr likely further contributes to the increase of oc burial in daning river tributary collectively this study emphasized the role of hydrological management in alteration of dom chemistry and oc burial in a typical tributary of tgr and provided insights into the interaction between anthropogenic perturbations and carbon cycling in fluvial ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16964,inhibitory effects of phosphate on zero valent iron zvi dissolution have been studied mainly focusing on a single chemical system little is known about inhibitory effects and the mechanism of phosphate on zvi dissolution within a bioreactor during long term operation this study demonstrates the feasibility of achieving energy recovery from phosphate containing domestic sewage using an efficient anaerobic reactor with micro sized or nano sized zvi addition the results indicate that the chemical oxygen demand cod removal and methane production are enhanced by zvi addition a maximum cod removal efficiency of 89 and methane content of 60 was achieved however the strengthening effect of zvi on methane production is weakened by the presence of phosphate in domestic sewage analyzing the variations of fe2 ions and phosphate concentrations and characterizing the micro morphology of corroded zvi proved that the generated fe2 ions reacts with phosphate and forms a passivation layer on the zvi surface inhibiting further dissolution of zvi as an improved alternative we chose the double layered core shell structured zvi carbon composite as an excellent candidate to reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution in this way the direct formation of precipitates on the zvi surface can be avoided due to the protective carbon layer which adjusts the ion transfer adding zvi carbon composites accelerate the methane content by 16 to our knowledge this is the first report on adding zvi carbon composites to promote the anaerobic metabolism in studies which are focusing on reducing the inhibition of zvi by phosphate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zvi dissolution phosphate zvi carbon composites methane production domestic sewage 1 introduction the annual discharge of domestic sewage in china is about 70 billion cubic meters and regarded as one of the main sources of environmental pollution hao et al 2015 currently the main processes for the treatment of domestic sewage in wastewater treatment plants wwtps include the aerobic activated sludge method oxidation ditch and improved technologies these processes suffer from high oxygen consumption excessive sludge production and large land occupation alternatively anaerobic treatment technologies are considered to be a promising approach for the treatment of domestic sewage due to their biogas production and high organic removal efficiency with low sludge production shin and bae 2018 the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency can reach up to 80 using an expanded granular sludge blanket egsb reactor to treat domestic sewage xu et al 2018 however the concentrations of organic compounds in domestic sewage are low which results in low energy production during anaerobic digestion ad jeong et al 2017 therefore it is important to develop an efficient anaerobic treatment technology for energy recovery from domestic sewage recently studies highlighted that the addition of zero valent iron zvi during ad can promote anaerobic metabolism pan et al 2019 zvi is a reductive material that not only decreases the oxidation reduction potential orp of the anaerobic system to promote the metabolism of methanogens but also acts as an electron donor to promote the in situ production of methane from co2 wei et al 2018 for example feng et al 2014 found that the addition of zvi enhanced the decomposition of protein and cellulose within the waste activated sludge was and accelerated methane production by 43 5 liu et al 2015 demonstrated that zvi is effective in producing methane during the ad of food waste with the methane production level increasing by 14 most of the studies however have focused on high concentration organic wastewater and little is known about the boosting mechanism of zvi in low strength domestic sewage and thus requires further investigation in addition previous studies have focused almost exclusively on the bioaugmentation of zvi ignoring the potentially physical inhibition effects during ad zhao et al 2018 xu et al 2021 demonstrated that the addition of zvi accelerated methane production early in the ad process but the further release of phosphate from the was caused a decrease in methane production most research results indicate that the dissolution of zvi enhances ad feng et al 2014 however the released fe2 ions can react with oh and or po4 3 in an aqueous solution thus generating precipitates mokete et al 2020 nagoya et al 2019 partial precipitates cover the zvi surface and or attach to the microbial aggregates decreasing zvi dissolution and causing a low methane production xu et al 2021 in addition to the main organic matter domestic sewage contains significant amounts of inorganic salts such as phosphate and ammonia nitrogen that may affect the availability of zvi during ad to our knowledge the effect of phosphate in domestic sewage on the bioaugmentation with zvi during ad has not been reported moreover detailed information on the shift in the microbial communities during zvi dissolution is limited the zvi evolution and dissolution in solution are affected by several factors including ph temperature dosage inorganic ions and interferences eljamal et al 2018 eljamal et al 2020a for example xiong et al 2008 found that the phosphate removal using zvi can be inhibited slightly by increasing the phosphate concentration to overcome the issue of low zvi utilization researchers have employed carbon coatings to form the core shell structured zvi carbon fe c composites huang et al 2018 carbon is a highly porous material which can promote zvi dispersion and improve its utilization due to this high reaction surface area eljamal et al 2020b furthermore due to the presence of a protective carbon layer the diffusion rates of ions decrease this means that the negative effects of inorganic salt precipitations causing zvi dissolution may be weakened however the core shell structured fe c composites were mostly used in chemical systems how they work in an efficient anaerobic reactor for treating phosphate containing domestic sewage is unknown based on the above considerations this work aims to evaluate the feasibility of a high rate anaerobic reactor running with the addition of micro sized or nano sized zvi for treating domestic sewage for energy recovery firstly the ability of zvi to enhance methane generation was evaluated then the potential mechanism of the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution within the bioreactor was elucidated finally the mechanisms of how core shell fe c composites remediate the inhibitory effects of phosphates were explored to our knowledge this is the first study to enhance the anaerobic treatment through adding core shell fe c composites 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials inoculated sludge and synthetic wastewater micro sized zvi mzvi 0 25 mm 99 9 purity was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china nano sized zvi nzvi 100 nm 99 9 purity and carbon powder 150 nm 99 9 purity were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa core shell fe c composites were synthesized according to a previous study gong et al 2018a the seed sludge was collected from a semi continuous mesophilic anaerobic digester reactor for treating waste activated sludge with a sludge residence time of 6 d in the laboratory the original waste activated sludge was collected from a secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtps in shanghai china the detailed characteristics of the sludge can be found in our previous study xu et al 2021 the seed sludge was of black flocculent type with a diameter of less than 0 1 mm the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of the seed sludge was 9 g l with an mlvss mlss ratio of 0 69 the synthetic domestic sewage was prepared according to a previous study xu et al 2018 and the detailed compositions of domestic sewage are provided in table s1 the concentrations of total cod total phosphorous tp and total nitrogen tn in the influents were 400 20 mg l 5 4 mg l and 50 5 mg l respectively the ph of the influent was adjusted to 6 8 7 6 using nahco3 2 2 experimental set up operational strategies and conditions three identical egsb reactors with a height to diameter ratio of 20 and an effective working volume of 3 l were used to treat the domestic sewage schematic diagrams of the reactors are shown in fig s1 the whole experiment lasted 200 days and was divided into five periods i ii iii iv and v the detailed operating parameters including duration hydraulic retention time hrt upflow velocity vup the dosage of additives and tp concentration in influents are summarized in table 1 the reactors were divided into three groups the unamended control group r1 the group amended with mzvi or a mixture of carbon powder and nzvi r2 and the group amended with mzvi or fe c composites r3 the selection of dosage of mzvi in period i was done according to previous studies feng et al 2014 zhang et al 2018b and the addition amount of mzvi in periods ii and iii mainly depended on the released fe2 ion concentration the tp concentration in the influent of each period depended on the experimental conditions the tp concentration in periods i ii and iii ranged from 5 to 10 mg l note that in order to prevent the high tp concentration from inhibiting the dissolution of additives the tp concentration in period v is slightly lower than that in the other periods the hrt was gradually decreased from 24 h to 6 h in terms of cod removal performance the operation temperature of the reactors was maintained at 25 1 c using an electric heating wire 2 3 chemical corrosion test on fe c composites and zvi to investigate the remediation of core shell fe c composites against the potential inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution fe c composites were added to a weak acidic environment ph 6 to simulate their chemical corrosion process in the presence or absence of phosphate named fe c group this chemical corrosion process was compared with a mixture of carbon powder and nzvi as control named fe c group the batch experiments were conducted in a series of serum bottles with a working volume of 250 ml the steps were as follows 0 1 g of fe c or a mixture of carbon powder and nzvi was added to 100 ml deoxygenated water with an initial tp concentration of 10 mg l under the condition of ph 6 then the bottles were sealed with stoppers and incubated at 25 c under agitation at 160 rpm during the corrosion process the ph tp and fe2 concentrations were measured every hour each chemical corrosion experiment lasted for 4 h and included three parallel tests additionally the corroded composites were collected for micro morphology observation by scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem 2 4 analytical methods cod tn tp ph orp mlss and mlvss were measured following the standard methods apha 1998 the fe2 ion concentration was measured by the phenanthroline method using a uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 35 the content of methane and volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations were determined periodically with a gas chromatograph gc gc 14a shimadzu japan equipped with a flame ionization detector and a nickel converter particle size distribution of flocculent sludge and granules was tested using a sieve method strength of the microbial aggregates was measured according to a previous study sudmalis et al 2018 the concentrations of coenzyme f420 and cyt c in the sludge samples were detected at the end of each period using a double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent method with the microbiological elisa kit feiya biotechnology jiangsu china the evaluation of specific methanogenic activity was done based a previous study wang et al 2018 the crystal structures of minerals on the sludge surface and fe c composites were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd analysis xrd analysis was carried out using a rigaku d max rb diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode and a cu kα radiation source rigaku corporation japan the compositions of the fe c composites were analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis tga tga was conducted from 25 c to 900 c with a heating rate of 10 c min and an air flow rate of 100 ml min using a series q500 instrument ta usa the surface morphologies of granules and materials were characterized by sem and tem a pre treatment of samples for sem and tem analysis was done based previous studies daye et al 2019 2 5 high throughput sequencing to investigate the effects of zvi on the microbial community structure a total 12 of sludge samples were collected from the three reactors at the end of periods i and iii for high throughput sequencing analysis the detailed procedure to the high throughput sequencing technology is based on a previous study xu et al 2018 the archaeal and bacterial 16s rrna pcrs polymerase chain reaction were performed using 349f 50 gygcascagkcgmgaaw 30 806r 50 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 30 and 341f 50 cctacgggnggcwgcag 30 805r 50 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 30 primers targeting the variable region v3 v4 respectively illumina pyrosequencing was carried out on the miseq pe300 platform illumina inc ca us by major biotech co ltd shanghai china the 16s rrna amplicon sequences have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive and are available under the bioproject prjna720899 2 6 statistical analysis the significance of the data was determined by duncan s multiple range test spss 19 0 software using analysis of variance anovas with a p value 0 05 considered to be statistically significant 3 results 3 1 effects of mzvi on the reactor performance the cod removal efficiency was used to evaluate the reactor performance with mzvi addition the results of which are shown in fig 1 a during the 1st to the 23rd day the cod removal efficiencies in all reactors showed significant fluctuations due to the start up phase afterwards the average cod removal efficiencies were almost 82 6 this value is similar to a previous study xu et al 2018 in which cod removal efficiencies were maintained at around 80 in a successfully started anaerobic reactor for the treatment of domestic sewage the results indicate that the reactor started successfully after period i early during period ii with the continuous addition of mzvi a significant enhancement in cod removal was achieved in r2 and r3 afterwards a decreasing trend in cod removal was observed in these reactors nonetheless the average cod removal efficiencies in r2 and r3 reached as high as 85 6 table s2 higher than that of r1 81 6 p 0 05 this indicates that mzvi can boost organic matter removal from domestic sewage since the wash out of the sludge became serious with an increased organic load at the beginning of period iii the external reflux of all reactors was terminated in the last part of period iii table 1 afterwards the cod removal increased significantly for r3 the average cod removal efficiency increased up to 89 5 while no significant differences were observed in r1 table s2 throughout the entire operation no significant differences in the cod removal efficiencies were measured between r2 and r3 p 0 05 in this study the domestic sewage contained a low concentration of organic compounds with high biodegradability as such the hydrolysis acidification cannot the limiting step during ad with an hrt of 6 24 h yang et al 2018 therefore the boosting effect of mzvi on the cod removal was not affected by the phosphate in the domestic sewage 3 2 effects of mzvi on methane production in anaerobic sewage treatment fig 2 a shows the variation of the vfas concentration the average vfas concentration was approximately 100 mg l in all reactors during period i with acetate being the dominant product during period ii the average vfas concentration was 60 and 65 mg l in r2 and r3 respectively which are lower than the 75 mg l measured for r1 mzvi is a reductive material that is able to create a favorable environment for ad which can promote the conversion of organic matter into vfas and subsequently into methane feng et al 2014 interestingly the mzvi addition did not decrease the opr values of the reactors compared with the control see fig s2 this result is inconsistent with those of previous studies fu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 where mzvi decreased the orp and in this way enhanced acetic acid type fermentation and declined propionate production in this study the orp remained at 300 mv in all reactors which meets the orp requirements of fermentation bacteria lu et al 2015 fig 2b shows the concentrations of coenzyme f420 and cyt c in the sludge samples in period i the concentrations of coenzyme f420 and cyt c in r2 and r3 increased in comparison to r1 h2 generated from mzvi dissolution can act as a substrate for boosting the in situ production of methane affecting the methanogenic activity and coenzyme f420 concentration zhao et al 2018 meanwhile the generated iron ions can cooperate with cyt c to mediate extracellular electron transfer improving anaerobic metabolism costa et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a this means that the anaerobes formed increasing amounts of these key compounds for methane production with mzvi addition when the mzvi dosage was decreased to 2 g in period ii or 5 g in period iii the concentrations of coenzyme f420 and cyt c also decreased significantly notably in periods ii and iii the concentrations of coenzymes f420 and cyt c in r3 were lower than that in r2 the fe2 ions in r3 can be released smoothly with their concentrations changing greatly with time thus the ph value of the anaerobic reactor could be affected faintly see fig s2 which might result in the fluctuation of enzyme concentration zhang et al 2020 to further investigate the effects of mzvi on methane formation the relative amounts of acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were measured the sludge samples were collected on days 48 and 88 for analysis see fig 2c on day 48 the hydrogenotrophic methanogens activities in r2 and r3 increased compared to r1 the addition of mzvi clearly enhanced the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens while the acetoclastic methanogenic activities in r2 and r3 were lower than that in r1 the h2 generation from mzvi dissolution has been proven to be beneficial for the increase of methanogenic activity especially for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis zhao et al 2018 however on day 88 there was no significant difference p 0 05 of the methanogenic activities in all reactors see fig s3 this can be attributed to the gradual consumption and or trapping of mzvi during the long term operation and the lower concentrations of released fe2 ions thus resulting in a weakened improvement of the methanogenic activity fig 2d displays the average methane volume fraction in each reactor from the 37th to the 48th day this fraction accounted for 48 3 and 60 3 in r2 and r3 respectively which is higher than that in r1 38 4 hu et al 2015 found that a substantial enhancement up to 61 of the ch4 yield is achieved by zvi addition h2 is generated by mzvi dissolution with the assistance of microorganisms and or chemical corrosion hydrogenotrophic methanogens utilize h2 as an electron donor to reduce co2 to methane thus a reactor with mzvi addition has a higher content of methane however the methane volume fraction decreased in r2 compared to r3 meanwhile the fe2 ions could not be released in r2 these results indicate that the phosphate might have a negative effect on mzvi enhanced methane production similarly the average methane volume fraction in r2 and r3 decreased significantly from the 49th to the 88th day which is consistent with the data for the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis activity see fig s3 overall these results indicate that mzvi promotes methanogenesis in the anaerobic reactor however phosphate in domestic sewage affects the ability of mzvi to boost methane formation 3 3 effects of phosphate on the dissolution of mzvi considering that released fe2 ions might precipitate with phosphate to generate fe3 po4 2 prot et al 2020 the concentrations of fe2 and tp in the effluent were recorded and shown in figs 1b and 1c during period i fe2 ion concentration was almost undetectable in all reactors the tp concentrations in the effluents of r1 and r2 were even higher than those in the influent this can be attributed to the release of large amounts of phosphate due to incomplete ad of the inoculated waste activated sludge xu et al 2021 many chemicals are used to remove tp from domestic sewage in wwtps resulting in the presence of inorganic salts in the sludge these inorganic ions such as phosphate can be released into the supernatant and even regenerate precipitations at the end of period i the tp concentration in r3 gradually decreased to 0 30 mg l indicating that the released phosphate from digested sludge had been washed out completely afterwards on day 37 2 g of mzvi were added to the r2 and r3 as a result the fe2 ion concentration suddenly increased to about 6 mg l in r3 but remained lower than 1 mg l during the entire period ii in r2 interestingly there were no significant differences in the tp concentrations in the effluents of the r1 and r2 p 0 05 these results suggest that the release of fe2 could be inhibited to further confirm the potential inhibition of mzvi dissolution by phosphate an extra 5 g of mzvi were added to r2 and r3 on day 89 as a result the fe2 ion concentration in r3 increased from 0 98 mg l on day 88 to 23 30 mg l on day 100 whereas in r2 it remained low with 5 21 mg l on day 100 correspondingly the average tp concentrations in r1 and r2 during the first 10 days of period iii were 5 01 mg l and 4 62 mg l respectively these values indicate that part of the phosphate was precipitated in r2 with the increasing mzvi dosage however the tp concentration in r2 effluent was far less than the expected value based on the results of the released fe2 ion in r3 it means that the mzvi dissolution in the anaerobic reactor was inhibited probably by phosphate considering the corroded mzvi within the reactor might mitigate the inhibitory effects of phosphate on the release of fe2 therefore the r3 received the same tp concentration like the r1 from day 100 the fe2 concentration in the r3 decreased sharply from 23 30 mg l to 0 80 mg l after 20 days meanwhile the tp concentration in the r3 gradually increased to 4 25 mg l which was almost the same value as the tp concentration in the r1 overall the results indicate that the chemical precipitation process between the phosphate and fe2 ion could not occur a continuous release of fe2 ion was not achievable in these reactors once the influent contains phosphorus 3 4 effects of mzvi on the sludge granulation sludge granulation was observed in all reactors in periods i and iii particle size distributions in r1 and r2 were the same during period i comparatively the average size of granules in r3 was 0 25 mm which was slightly larger than that in r1 and r2 see fig 3 a in period iii the average size of the granules in the r3 was still higher than those in r1 and r2 see fig s4 the average size increased to 0 30 0 28 and 0 40 mm in r1 r2 or r3 respectively these results demonstrate that mzvi did not result in an enhanced growth of granules if the influent contained phosphate fig 3b shows the strength measurement of the granules from all reactors at the end of period iii the strength of the granules in r2 and r3 was higher than that in the r1 implying mzvi enhanced the strength of granules however the strength values in r1 and r3 show an increasing trend with vortexing time while in r2 a fluctuating trend is noted this implies that the granules in r2 were less resistant to shear forces than those in the other reactors in addition micro morphology analysis was carried out using sem to visualize the differences between the granules from the reactors see figs 4 and s5 sem images show that the surface of a granule from r1 is rough and has large cracks however the granule from r2 shows a complete structure of granular sludge many channels are visible on the surface in r1 the dominant morphology of the microorganisms are coccus shaped microorganisms while in r2 a small number of coccus shaped bacteria was visible but mainly filamentous bacteria appeared the differences in the granule morphology reveals that mzvi affects the composition of the microbial communities for further analyses of the potential effects of phosphate on mzvi during granulation sem mapping was used the dominant elements are fe o and p on the sludge surface which is implying that fe3 po4 2 has been produced on the sludge surface affecting the sludge granulation also xrd scans further confirmed the presence of fe3 po4 2 on the surface of granular sludge see fig 4f 3 5 effects of mzvi on the composition of the microbial community to investigate the effects of mzvi high throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze the variation of the composition of the microbial communities in sludge samples collected at the end of periods i and iii the indices of chao and shannon represent community richness and diversity xu et al 2018 in r3 the chao indices decreased significantly for both bacteria and archaea as compared to the ones of r1 while the shannon indices increased for the bacteria table 2 however no significant differences were observed between the chao and shannon indices for r1 and r2 for further analyses the variations of the microbial communities in all reactors and the number and overlapping of operational taxonomic units otus are displayed in a venn graph see fig 5 a with 699 the same number of otus exists in r1 and r2 569 or 564 outs were found to be identical in r1and r3 or r2 and r3 respectively these results indicate that phosphate changes the effects of mzvi on the microbial communities at the phylum level firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and chloroflexi were most dominant accounting for more than 83 of the all detected phyla see fig 5b many anaerobes in these phyla have been reported to be capable to degrade organic matter such as proteins and carbohydrates for the production of vfas and h2 du et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the relative abundances of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi changed significantly with mzvi addition for example compared to the population in r1 the abundance of bacteroidetes in r3 increased drastically from 12 to 29 in period iii while the proteobacteria decreased sharply from 49 to 2 however in r2 the variations of the abundances of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were not obvious in comparison to r3 fig 5c shows the heat map graph for the distribution of the microbial populations at the genus level various anaerobes with the ability to produce acids and or methane were detected in the three reactors wu et al 2019 with their populations affected by mzvi for example in period iii the abundance of bacteroidetes vadinha17 sp and clostridium sensu stricto sp in r3 reached 29 2 and 16 9 respectively which are involved in organic matter degradation and produce precursors for methane production wu et al 2021 however the relative abundance of trichococcus sp and georgenia sp decreased significantly in r3 correlating to the sharp acidification drop in all reactors with time ren et al 2020 these results suggest that the addition of mzvi shifted the structure of the bacterial microbial community furthermore methanosaeta sp and methanobacterium sp were the dominant methanogens in all reactors in period i no significant differences in the relative abundances of methanosaeta sp and methanobacterium sp were observed in period iii the abundances of methanosaeta sp in r2 and r3 increased to 70 8 and 74 2 respectively whereas the populations of methanobacterium sp dropped to 26 7 and 24 0 respectively recently several studies have indicated that the direct interspecies electron transfer diet from bacteria to methanogens also functions for the syntrophic metabolism during ad rotaru et al 2014 for example the dominant methanogens methanosaeta and methanobacterium have been reported to participate in diet rotaru et al 2014 tang et al 2019 these methanogens can directly accept electrons from zvi rather than through the intermediate h2 as an electron donor zheng et al 2020 in this study mzvi enhanced the production of an electron transfer compound cyt c this implies that mzvi might enhance the extracellular electron transfer costa et al 2018 however studies about the involvement of diet in the reactors for methane production are still in their infancy and require further investigation 3 6 effect of phosphate on the dissolution of core shell structured fe c composites according to the above results phosphate affects the mzvi dissolution therefore as alternatives core shell structured fe c composites were added to solve the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution the fe c composites are smooth spherical particles with a diameter of 120 150 nm the diameter of zvi in the fe c composites was 100 130 nm with a zvi to carbon mass ratio of 1 2 5 more details regarding the fe c composites are presented in fig s6 as shown in the fig s7 the average methane volume fraction accounted for 49 2 and 56 3 in the fe c and fe c groups during period v respectively which are also higher than those in the control with 41 2 moreover the ability of fe c composites to boost methane production was better than that of the mixture of nzvi and carbon powder after adding nzvi for 30 days from the 171st to the 200th day the average methane volume fraction in the nzvi group was still higher than that in the mzvi group with 48 fig 2d it means that the nzvi addition relieves the inhibitory effects of phosphate on methane production compared to mzvi as shown in fig 6 fe2 ions were released smoothly in the fe c and fe c groups during period iv due to the absence of phosphate in the influent interestingly the fluctuation of released fe2 ion was smaller in the fe c group and the decline of the rate of the fe2 concentration was lower than that in the fe c group this might be a result of the special core shell structure of the fe c composites during period v fe2 ions were released smoothly both in the fe c and fe c groups even if the influent contained phosphate this was inconsistent with previous results of section 3 3 which imply that the nzvi relieves the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution the dissolution of nzvi was enhanced and more fe2 ions were present in the solution due to nanoparticles increasing surface active sites eljamal et al 2018 furthermore the average tp concentration in the effluent of the fe c group was 0 91 0 20 mg l which was lower than the values of the control and fe c groups with 1 31 0 30 or 1 14 0 25 mg l respectively this result suggests that the core shell fe c reduces the inhibition of zvi dissolution to further explore the characteristics of core shell fe c composites the micro morphologies of corroded composites were visualized since these materials cannot be separated effectively from the sludge chemical corrosion tests of fe c composites and mixtures of nzvi and carbon powder were conducted the corroded material was collected and used for micro morphology observation by sem and tem see fig 7 the sem and tem images of raw nzvi exhibited a smooth surface however in the case of an acidic treatment containing phosphate the nzvi surface was rough and wrapped with a large number of layer like precipitates this observation suggests that the dissolution of nzvi occurred leading to fe2 generation and the subsequent precipitations of fe p compounds that cover the zvi surface see figs s8 and s9 this precipitate formation is attributed to the surface charge zeta potential and point of zero charge eljamal et al 2016 shubair et al 2019 partial precipitates were loaded onto the zvi surface hindering the diffusion of h and resulting in an inhibition of zvi dissolution sleiman et al 2016 meanwhile the elution of fe2 from zvi gradually decreased due to the increase in ph figs s8 causing the reduction of the precipitate in solution nagoya et al 2019 these may also be the reasons as to why mzvi dissolution is inhibited by phosphate see section 3 3 in contrast the surface of core shell fe c composites was comparatively smooth with a low number of needle like precipitations loaded discretely on the carbon layer surface and an absence of layer like precipitates the carbon layer coated on the nzvi surface protects it from the external environment and thus avoids being wrapped by precipitates these results indicate that the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution can be avoided by using core shell structured fe c composites 4 discussion 4 1 inhibitory effect of phosphate on mzvi dissolution the positive effect of mzvi on anaerobic methanogens occurred in synchronization with mzvi dissolution feng et al 2014 according to the results shown in fig 1 a sustained release of fe2 ion cannot be achieved if domestic sewage contains phosphate nagoya et al 2019 pointed out that fe2 ions react with oh or o2 to form precipitates in the form of iron hydroxides and iron oxides on the zvi surface these precipitates cause a rapid decrease in zvi dissolution in this study the ph was maintained at 7 due to the activity of the anaerobes see fig s2 if phosphate is present the precipitation of fe3 po4 2 is more energetically favorable by its low solubility ksp 10 36 than the formation of fe oh 2 wilfert et al 2015 xrd analysis confirmed that the crystals precipitated on the sludge surface in the anaerobic reactor and were almost identical with fe3 po4 2 see fig 4f meanwhile partial precipitates of fe3 po4 2 were loaded on zvi surface see fig 7 based on the above findings we propose an inhibitory mechanism for phosphate on zvi dissolution in an anaerobic reactor see the upper part of fig 8 fe2 ions were released from zvi into the aqueous solution subsequently parts of fe2 ions react with phosphate to form a stable passivation layer of fe3 po4 2 on the zvi surface this layer blocks the dissolution by microorganisms and proton attack therefore the continuous dissolution of zvi could not be achieved under such conditions in addition the results of the reactor performance and the sludge characterization confirmed that mzvi dissolution is inhibited by phosphate a significant increase in the methane content was observed with mzvi addition see fig 2d however the methane content was significantly reduced if the influent contained phosphate mzvi can be used as an electron donor for methanogens in the form of molecular h2 or directly as electrons for methane production once mzvi is wrapped the release of fe2 ions become blocked and the methane production decreases correspondingly if fe2 can be released continuously from mzvi the anaerobic metabolic pathways hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis become altered zhao et al 2018 the structure and diversity of the microbial community in the reactor shifted according to the availability of zvi according to the diversity analysis the addition of mzvi in the presence of phosphate r2 resulted in a similar community structure and a low difference in the diversity of microorganisms to the control r1 see fig 5 further the strength and average particle size of the granular sludge have been improved significantly due to mzvi addition however the boosting effects become weakened in the presence of phosphate see fig 3 4 2 fe c composites reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution nzvi seems to be a good substitute to overcome the inhibition of phosphate because of its high specific surface area and high reactivity relative to mzvi microbes directly contact zvi to dissolve it and generate fe2 ions nzvi interacts with the extracellular polymeric substances secreted by microorganisms which results in a complete dissolution he et al 2020 this also explains why the released fe2 ions concentrations fluctuated greatly in the fe c group see fig 6 since the phosphate concentration in the reactor was sufficiently high with continuous influent fe3 po4 2 generation in the fe c group was inevitable due to the rapid dissolution of nzvi a portion of the fe3 po4 2 precipitates and coats the nzvi surfaces and causes surface passivation moreover this passivation layer gradually increases in thickness inhibiting h diffusion and zvi dissolution even more alternatively core shell structured fe c composites prove to be a good material to address the abovementioned problems nzvi is stabilized by carbon materials which may avoid the direct contact of nzvi with microorganisms also carbon is a protective material for regulating and decreasing the h transfer due to its abundant porosity it decreases the release of electrons from nzvi and enhances its electron utilization during ad gong et al 2018a the transfer of phosphate and fe2 through the carbon layer is important for the adjustment of the generation of fe3 po4 2 the transfer depends mainly on the diffusion due to the concentration differences the h diffusion through the porous carbon layer to dissolve nzvi to fe2 ions is slowed down gong et al 2018b moreover the fe2 concentration inside the carbon layer is higher than in the outer layer due to the dissolution gradient of nzvi whereas the phosphate concentration is outside the carbon layer and higher than in the inner layer thus the reaction sites between fe2 and phosphate are separated which largely avoids the direct precipitation of fe3 po4 2 on the nzvi surface and in this way reduces nzvi passivation see the bottom part of fig 8 therefore a carbon coating on the nzvi surface to acts as a buffer for the phosphate and fe2 ions is a promising way to reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on nzvi dissolution 4 3 implications in general zvi addition has been shown to effectively enhance methane production through bioaugmentation in anaerobic treatment however this work demonstrates that phosphate could cause a significant inhibition of zvi dissolution during ad resulting in the loss of the ability of zvi to boost ad thus the remediation of the inhibition of phosphate should be noted in the application of zvi technology phosphate concentration within domestic sewage was always higher than 2 mg l which was likely to cause the inhibition of zvi dissolution in this study the double layered core shell structured fe c composites could efficiently reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution compared to mzvi or nzvi the life cycle of the fe c composites was longer and the performance of the bioreactor was more stable with the addition of the fe c composites the strengthening effect of zvi on methane production could proceed smoothly in addition the combination of zvi technology and anaerobic granular sludge technology can not only increase the organic load in the treatment of domestic sewage but also prevent the zvi washout with the sludge from the bioreactor further the presence of the carbon layer can promote homogeneous distribution of nzvi in the sludge system these results further strengthen the feasibility of fe c composites to boost methane production in the treatment of domestic sewage overall this work proposes a core shell structured fe c technology to reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution and to enhance methane production during ad this technology has the potential to be applied in wwtps it is worth mentioning that this technology is only a front end technology with the aim to enhance the energy recovery from domestic sewage it needs to be combined with other technologies such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation and biological phosphorus removal to meet the water quality discharge standards additionally the nano sized fe c technology is potentially expensive for wwtps for practical application therefore a cheap synthetic route for fe c composites is worth studying in the future 5 conclusions phosphate within domestic sewage causes a significant inhibition of zvi dissolution during anaerobic treatment which weakens the boosting effects of zvi for ad this is attributed to a reaction between fe2 and phosphate ions which form a passivation layer on the zvi surface inhibiting its dissolution as an alternative double layered core shell structured fe c composites have been proven to reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate the carbon in these composites acts as a protective layer for zvi shielding it against phosphate and promoting zvi utilization therefore fe c composites provide a promising technology for energy recovery from domestic sewage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16964,inhibitory effects of phosphate on zero valent iron zvi dissolution have been studied mainly focusing on a single chemical system little is known about inhibitory effects and the mechanism of phosphate on zvi dissolution within a bioreactor during long term operation this study demonstrates the feasibility of achieving energy recovery from phosphate containing domestic sewage using an efficient anaerobic reactor with micro sized or nano sized zvi addition the results indicate that the chemical oxygen demand cod removal and methane production are enhanced by zvi addition a maximum cod removal efficiency of 89 and methane content of 60 was achieved however the strengthening effect of zvi on methane production is weakened by the presence of phosphate in domestic sewage analyzing the variations of fe2 ions and phosphate concentrations and characterizing the micro morphology of corroded zvi proved that the generated fe2 ions reacts with phosphate and forms a passivation layer on the zvi surface inhibiting further dissolution of zvi as an improved alternative we chose the double layered core shell structured zvi carbon composite as an excellent candidate to reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution in this way the direct formation of precipitates on the zvi surface can be avoided due to the protective carbon layer which adjusts the ion transfer adding zvi carbon composites accelerate the methane content by 16 to our knowledge this is the first report on adding zvi carbon composites to promote the anaerobic metabolism in studies which are focusing on reducing the inhibition of zvi by phosphate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zvi dissolution phosphate zvi carbon composites methane production domestic sewage 1 introduction the annual discharge of domestic sewage in china is about 70 billion cubic meters and regarded as one of the main sources of environmental pollution hao et al 2015 currently the main processes for the treatment of domestic sewage in wastewater treatment plants wwtps include the aerobic activated sludge method oxidation ditch and improved technologies these processes suffer from high oxygen consumption excessive sludge production and large land occupation alternatively anaerobic treatment technologies are considered to be a promising approach for the treatment of domestic sewage due to their biogas production and high organic removal efficiency with low sludge production shin and bae 2018 the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency can reach up to 80 using an expanded granular sludge blanket egsb reactor to treat domestic sewage xu et al 2018 however the concentrations of organic compounds in domestic sewage are low which results in low energy production during anaerobic digestion ad jeong et al 2017 therefore it is important to develop an efficient anaerobic treatment technology for energy recovery from domestic sewage recently studies highlighted that the addition of zero valent iron zvi during ad can promote anaerobic metabolism pan et al 2019 zvi is a reductive material that not only decreases the oxidation reduction potential orp of the anaerobic system to promote the metabolism of methanogens but also acts as an electron donor to promote the in situ production of methane from co2 wei et al 2018 for example feng et al 2014 found that the addition of zvi enhanced the decomposition of protein and cellulose within the waste activated sludge was and accelerated methane production by 43 5 liu et al 2015 demonstrated that zvi is effective in producing methane during the ad of food waste with the methane production level increasing by 14 most of the studies however have focused on high concentration organic wastewater and little is known about the boosting mechanism of zvi in low strength domestic sewage and thus requires further investigation in addition previous studies have focused almost exclusively on the bioaugmentation of zvi ignoring the potentially physical inhibition effects during ad zhao et al 2018 xu et al 2021 demonstrated that the addition of zvi accelerated methane production early in the ad process but the further release of phosphate from the was caused a decrease in methane production most research results indicate that the dissolution of zvi enhances ad feng et al 2014 however the released fe2 ions can react with oh and or po4 3 in an aqueous solution thus generating precipitates mokete et al 2020 nagoya et al 2019 partial precipitates cover the zvi surface and or attach to the microbial aggregates decreasing zvi dissolution and causing a low methane production xu et al 2021 in addition to the main organic matter domestic sewage contains significant amounts of inorganic salts such as phosphate and ammonia nitrogen that may affect the availability of zvi during ad to our knowledge the effect of phosphate in domestic sewage on the bioaugmentation with zvi during ad has not been reported moreover detailed information on the shift in the microbial communities during zvi dissolution is limited the zvi evolution and dissolution in solution are affected by several factors including ph temperature dosage inorganic ions and interferences eljamal et al 2018 eljamal et al 2020a for example xiong et al 2008 found that the phosphate removal using zvi can be inhibited slightly by increasing the phosphate concentration to overcome the issue of low zvi utilization researchers have employed carbon coatings to form the core shell structured zvi carbon fe c composites huang et al 2018 carbon is a highly porous material which can promote zvi dispersion and improve its utilization due to this high reaction surface area eljamal et al 2020b furthermore due to the presence of a protective carbon layer the diffusion rates of ions decrease this means that the negative effects of inorganic salt precipitations causing zvi dissolution may be weakened however the core shell structured fe c composites were mostly used in chemical systems how they work in an efficient anaerobic reactor for treating phosphate containing domestic sewage is unknown based on the above considerations this work aims to evaluate the feasibility of a high rate anaerobic reactor running with the addition of micro sized or nano sized zvi for treating domestic sewage for energy recovery firstly the ability of zvi to enhance methane generation was evaluated then the potential mechanism of the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution within the bioreactor was elucidated finally the mechanisms of how core shell fe c composites remediate the inhibitory effects of phosphates were explored to our knowledge this is the first study to enhance the anaerobic treatment through adding core shell fe c composites 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials inoculated sludge and synthetic wastewater micro sized zvi mzvi 0 25 mm 99 9 purity was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china nano sized zvi nzvi 100 nm 99 9 purity and carbon powder 150 nm 99 9 purity were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa core shell fe c composites were synthesized according to a previous study gong et al 2018a the seed sludge was collected from a semi continuous mesophilic anaerobic digester reactor for treating waste activated sludge with a sludge residence time of 6 d in the laboratory the original waste activated sludge was collected from a secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtps in shanghai china the detailed characteristics of the sludge can be found in our previous study xu et al 2021 the seed sludge was of black flocculent type with a diameter of less than 0 1 mm the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of the seed sludge was 9 g l with an mlvss mlss ratio of 0 69 the synthetic domestic sewage was prepared according to a previous study xu et al 2018 and the detailed compositions of domestic sewage are provided in table s1 the concentrations of total cod total phosphorous tp and total nitrogen tn in the influents were 400 20 mg l 5 4 mg l and 50 5 mg l respectively the ph of the influent was adjusted to 6 8 7 6 using nahco3 2 2 experimental set up operational strategies and conditions three identical egsb reactors with a height to diameter ratio of 20 and an effective working volume of 3 l were used to treat the domestic sewage schematic diagrams of the reactors are shown in fig s1 the whole experiment lasted 200 days and was divided into five periods i ii iii iv and v the detailed operating parameters including duration hydraulic retention time hrt upflow velocity vup the dosage of additives and tp concentration in influents are summarized in table 1 the reactors were divided into three groups the unamended control group r1 the group amended with mzvi or a mixture of carbon powder and nzvi r2 and the group amended with mzvi or fe c composites r3 the selection of dosage of mzvi in period i was done according to previous studies feng et al 2014 zhang et al 2018b and the addition amount of mzvi in periods ii and iii mainly depended on the released fe2 ion concentration the tp concentration in the influent of each period depended on the experimental conditions the tp concentration in periods i ii and iii ranged from 5 to 10 mg l note that in order to prevent the high tp concentration from inhibiting the dissolution of additives the tp concentration in period v is slightly lower than that in the other periods the hrt was gradually decreased from 24 h to 6 h in terms of cod removal performance the operation temperature of the reactors was maintained at 25 1 c using an electric heating wire 2 3 chemical corrosion test on fe c composites and zvi to investigate the remediation of core shell fe c composites against the potential inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution fe c composites were added to a weak acidic environment ph 6 to simulate their chemical corrosion process in the presence or absence of phosphate named fe c group this chemical corrosion process was compared with a mixture of carbon powder and nzvi as control named fe c group the batch experiments were conducted in a series of serum bottles with a working volume of 250 ml the steps were as follows 0 1 g of fe c or a mixture of carbon powder and nzvi was added to 100 ml deoxygenated water with an initial tp concentration of 10 mg l under the condition of ph 6 then the bottles were sealed with stoppers and incubated at 25 c under agitation at 160 rpm during the corrosion process the ph tp and fe2 concentrations were measured every hour each chemical corrosion experiment lasted for 4 h and included three parallel tests additionally the corroded composites were collected for micro morphology observation by scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem 2 4 analytical methods cod tn tp ph orp mlss and mlvss were measured following the standard methods apha 1998 the fe2 ion concentration was measured by the phenanthroline method using a uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 35 the content of methane and volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations were determined periodically with a gas chromatograph gc gc 14a shimadzu japan equipped with a flame ionization detector and a nickel converter particle size distribution of flocculent sludge and granules was tested using a sieve method strength of the microbial aggregates was measured according to a previous study sudmalis et al 2018 the concentrations of coenzyme f420 and cyt c in the sludge samples were detected at the end of each period using a double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent method with the microbiological elisa kit feiya biotechnology jiangsu china the evaluation of specific methanogenic activity was done based a previous study wang et al 2018 the crystal structures of minerals on the sludge surface and fe c composites were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd analysis xrd analysis was carried out using a rigaku d max rb diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode and a cu kα radiation source rigaku corporation japan the compositions of the fe c composites were analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis tga tga was conducted from 25 c to 900 c with a heating rate of 10 c min and an air flow rate of 100 ml min using a series q500 instrument ta usa the surface morphologies of granules and materials were characterized by sem and tem a pre treatment of samples for sem and tem analysis was done based previous studies daye et al 2019 2 5 high throughput sequencing to investigate the effects of zvi on the microbial community structure a total 12 of sludge samples were collected from the three reactors at the end of periods i and iii for high throughput sequencing analysis the detailed procedure to the high throughput sequencing technology is based on a previous study xu et al 2018 the archaeal and bacterial 16s rrna pcrs polymerase chain reaction were performed using 349f 50 gygcascagkcgmgaaw 30 806r 50 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 30 and 341f 50 cctacgggnggcwgcag 30 805r 50 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 30 primers targeting the variable region v3 v4 respectively illumina pyrosequencing was carried out on the miseq pe300 platform illumina inc ca us by major biotech co ltd shanghai china the 16s rrna amplicon sequences have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive and are available under the bioproject prjna720899 2 6 statistical analysis the significance of the data was determined by duncan s multiple range test spss 19 0 software using analysis of variance anovas with a p value 0 05 considered to be statistically significant 3 results 3 1 effects of mzvi on the reactor performance the cod removal efficiency was used to evaluate the reactor performance with mzvi addition the results of which are shown in fig 1 a during the 1st to the 23rd day the cod removal efficiencies in all reactors showed significant fluctuations due to the start up phase afterwards the average cod removal efficiencies were almost 82 6 this value is similar to a previous study xu et al 2018 in which cod removal efficiencies were maintained at around 80 in a successfully started anaerobic reactor for the treatment of domestic sewage the results indicate that the reactor started successfully after period i early during period ii with the continuous addition of mzvi a significant enhancement in cod removal was achieved in r2 and r3 afterwards a decreasing trend in cod removal was observed in these reactors nonetheless the average cod removal efficiencies in r2 and r3 reached as high as 85 6 table s2 higher than that of r1 81 6 p 0 05 this indicates that mzvi can boost organic matter removal from domestic sewage since the wash out of the sludge became serious with an increased organic load at the beginning of period iii the external reflux of all reactors was terminated in the last part of period iii table 1 afterwards the cod removal increased significantly for r3 the average cod removal efficiency increased up to 89 5 while no significant differences were observed in r1 table s2 throughout the entire operation no significant differences in the cod removal efficiencies were measured between r2 and r3 p 0 05 in this study the domestic sewage contained a low concentration of organic compounds with high biodegradability as such the hydrolysis acidification cannot the limiting step during ad with an hrt of 6 24 h yang et al 2018 therefore the boosting effect of mzvi on the cod removal was not affected by the phosphate in the domestic sewage 3 2 effects of mzvi on methane production in anaerobic sewage treatment fig 2 a shows the variation of the vfas concentration the average vfas concentration was approximately 100 mg l in all reactors during period i with acetate being the dominant product during period ii the average vfas concentration was 60 and 65 mg l in r2 and r3 respectively which are lower than the 75 mg l measured for r1 mzvi is a reductive material that is able to create a favorable environment for ad which can promote the conversion of organic matter into vfas and subsequently into methane feng et al 2014 interestingly the mzvi addition did not decrease the opr values of the reactors compared with the control see fig s2 this result is inconsistent with those of previous studies fu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 where mzvi decreased the orp and in this way enhanced acetic acid type fermentation and declined propionate production in this study the orp remained at 300 mv in all reactors which meets the orp requirements of fermentation bacteria lu et al 2015 fig 2b shows the concentrations of coenzyme f420 and cyt c in the sludge samples in period i the concentrations of coenzyme f420 and cyt c in r2 and r3 increased in comparison to r1 h2 generated from mzvi dissolution can act as a substrate for boosting the in situ production of methane affecting the methanogenic activity and coenzyme f420 concentration zhao et al 2018 meanwhile the generated iron ions can cooperate with cyt c to mediate extracellular electron transfer improving anaerobic metabolism costa et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a this means that the anaerobes formed increasing amounts of these key compounds for methane production with mzvi addition when the mzvi dosage was decreased to 2 g in period ii or 5 g in period iii the concentrations of coenzyme f420 and cyt c also decreased significantly notably in periods ii and iii the concentrations of coenzymes f420 and cyt c in r3 were lower than that in r2 the fe2 ions in r3 can be released smoothly with their concentrations changing greatly with time thus the ph value of the anaerobic reactor could be affected faintly see fig s2 which might result in the fluctuation of enzyme concentration zhang et al 2020 to further investigate the effects of mzvi on methane formation the relative amounts of acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were measured the sludge samples were collected on days 48 and 88 for analysis see fig 2c on day 48 the hydrogenotrophic methanogens activities in r2 and r3 increased compared to r1 the addition of mzvi clearly enhanced the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens while the acetoclastic methanogenic activities in r2 and r3 were lower than that in r1 the h2 generation from mzvi dissolution has been proven to be beneficial for the increase of methanogenic activity especially for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis zhao et al 2018 however on day 88 there was no significant difference p 0 05 of the methanogenic activities in all reactors see fig s3 this can be attributed to the gradual consumption and or trapping of mzvi during the long term operation and the lower concentrations of released fe2 ions thus resulting in a weakened improvement of the methanogenic activity fig 2d displays the average methane volume fraction in each reactor from the 37th to the 48th day this fraction accounted for 48 3 and 60 3 in r2 and r3 respectively which is higher than that in r1 38 4 hu et al 2015 found that a substantial enhancement up to 61 of the ch4 yield is achieved by zvi addition h2 is generated by mzvi dissolution with the assistance of microorganisms and or chemical corrosion hydrogenotrophic methanogens utilize h2 as an electron donor to reduce co2 to methane thus a reactor with mzvi addition has a higher content of methane however the methane volume fraction decreased in r2 compared to r3 meanwhile the fe2 ions could not be released in r2 these results indicate that the phosphate might have a negative effect on mzvi enhanced methane production similarly the average methane volume fraction in r2 and r3 decreased significantly from the 49th to the 88th day which is consistent with the data for the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis activity see fig s3 overall these results indicate that mzvi promotes methanogenesis in the anaerobic reactor however phosphate in domestic sewage affects the ability of mzvi to boost methane formation 3 3 effects of phosphate on the dissolution of mzvi considering that released fe2 ions might precipitate with phosphate to generate fe3 po4 2 prot et al 2020 the concentrations of fe2 and tp in the effluent were recorded and shown in figs 1b and 1c during period i fe2 ion concentration was almost undetectable in all reactors the tp concentrations in the effluents of r1 and r2 were even higher than those in the influent this can be attributed to the release of large amounts of phosphate due to incomplete ad of the inoculated waste activated sludge xu et al 2021 many chemicals are used to remove tp from domestic sewage in wwtps resulting in the presence of inorganic salts in the sludge these inorganic ions such as phosphate can be released into the supernatant and even regenerate precipitations at the end of period i the tp concentration in r3 gradually decreased to 0 30 mg l indicating that the released phosphate from digested sludge had been washed out completely afterwards on day 37 2 g of mzvi were added to the r2 and r3 as a result the fe2 ion concentration suddenly increased to about 6 mg l in r3 but remained lower than 1 mg l during the entire period ii in r2 interestingly there were no significant differences in the tp concentrations in the effluents of the r1 and r2 p 0 05 these results suggest that the release of fe2 could be inhibited to further confirm the potential inhibition of mzvi dissolution by phosphate an extra 5 g of mzvi were added to r2 and r3 on day 89 as a result the fe2 ion concentration in r3 increased from 0 98 mg l on day 88 to 23 30 mg l on day 100 whereas in r2 it remained low with 5 21 mg l on day 100 correspondingly the average tp concentrations in r1 and r2 during the first 10 days of period iii were 5 01 mg l and 4 62 mg l respectively these values indicate that part of the phosphate was precipitated in r2 with the increasing mzvi dosage however the tp concentration in r2 effluent was far less than the expected value based on the results of the released fe2 ion in r3 it means that the mzvi dissolution in the anaerobic reactor was inhibited probably by phosphate considering the corroded mzvi within the reactor might mitigate the inhibitory effects of phosphate on the release of fe2 therefore the r3 received the same tp concentration like the r1 from day 100 the fe2 concentration in the r3 decreased sharply from 23 30 mg l to 0 80 mg l after 20 days meanwhile the tp concentration in the r3 gradually increased to 4 25 mg l which was almost the same value as the tp concentration in the r1 overall the results indicate that the chemical precipitation process between the phosphate and fe2 ion could not occur a continuous release of fe2 ion was not achievable in these reactors once the influent contains phosphorus 3 4 effects of mzvi on the sludge granulation sludge granulation was observed in all reactors in periods i and iii particle size distributions in r1 and r2 were the same during period i comparatively the average size of granules in r3 was 0 25 mm which was slightly larger than that in r1 and r2 see fig 3 a in period iii the average size of the granules in the r3 was still higher than those in r1 and r2 see fig s4 the average size increased to 0 30 0 28 and 0 40 mm in r1 r2 or r3 respectively these results demonstrate that mzvi did not result in an enhanced growth of granules if the influent contained phosphate fig 3b shows the strength measurement of the granules from all reactors at the end of period iii the strength of the granules in r2 and r3 was higher than that in the r1 implying mzvi enhanced the strength of granules however the strength values in r1 and r3 show an increasing trend with vortexing time while in r2 a fluctuating trend is noted this implies that the granules in r2 were less resistant to shear forces than those in the other reactors in addition micro morphology analysis was carried out using sem to visualize the differences between the granules from the reactors see figs 4 and s5 sem images show that the surface of a granule from r1 is rough and has large cracks however the granule from r2 shows a complete structure of granular sludge many channels are visible on the surface in r1 the dominant morphology of the microorganisms are coccus shaped microorganisms while in r2 a small number of coccus shaped bacteria was visible but mainly filamentous bacteria appeared the differences in the granule morphology reveals that mzvi affects the composition of the microbial communities for further analyses of the potential effects of phosphate on mzvi during granulation sem mapping was used the dominant elements are fe o and p on the sludge surface which is implying that fe3 po4 2 has been produced on the sludge surface affecting the sludge granulation also xrd scans further confirmed the presence of fe3 po4 2 on the surface of granular sludge see fig 4f 3 5 effects of mzvi on the composition of the microbial community to investigate the effects of mzvi high throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze the variation of the composition of the microbial communities in sludge samples collected at the end of periods i and iii the indices of chao and shannon represent community richness and diversity xu et al 2018 in r3 the chao indices decreased significantly for both bacteria and archaea as compared to the ones of r1 while the shannon indices increased for the bacteria table 2 however no significant differences were observed between the chao and shannon indices for r1 and r2 for further analyses the variations of the microbial communities in all reactors and the number and overlapping of operational taxonomic units otus are displayed in a venn graph see fig 5 a with 699 the same number of otus exists in r1 and r2 569 or 564 outs were found to be identical in r1and r3 or r2 and r3 respectively these results indicate that phosphate changes the effects of mzvi on the microbial communities at the phylum level firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and chloroflexi were most dominant accounting for more than 83 of the all detected phyla see fig 5b many anaerobes in these phyla have been reported to be capable to degrade organic matter such as proteins and carbohydrates for the production of vfas and h2 du et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the relative abundances of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi changed significantly with mzvi addition for example compared to the population in r1 the abundance of bacteroidetes in r3 increased drastically from 12 to 29 in period iii while the proteobacteria decreased sharply from 49 to 2 however in r2 the variations of the abundances of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were not obvious in comparison to r3 fig 5c shows the heat map graph for the distribution of the microbial populations at the genus level various anaerobes with the ability to produce acids and or methane were detected in the three reactors wu et al 2019 with their populations affected by mzvi for example in period iii the abundance of bacteroidetes vadinha17 sp and clostridium sensu stricto sp in r3 reached 29 2 and 16 9 respectively which are involved in organic matter degradation and produce precursors for methane production wu et al 2021 however the relative abundance of trichococcus sp and georgenia sp decreased significantly in r3 correlating to the sharp acidification drop in all reactors with time ren et al 2020 these results suggest that the addition of mzvi shifted the structure of the bacterial microbial community furthermore methanosaeta sp and methanobacterium sp were the dominant methanogens in all reactors in period i no significant differences in the relative abundances of methanosaeta sp and methanobacterium sp were observed in period iii the abundances of methanosaeta sp in r2 and r3 increased to 70 8 and 74 2 respectively whereas the populations of methanobacterium sp dropped to 26 7 and 24 0 respectively recently several studies have indicated that the direct interspecies electron transfer diet from bacteria to methanogens also functions for the syntrophic metabolism during ad rotaru et al 2014 for example the dominant methanogens methanosaeta and methanobacterium have been reported to participate in diet rotaru et al 2014 tang et al 2019 these methanogens can directly accept electrons from zvi rather than through the intermediate h2 as an electron donor zheng et al 2020 in this study mzvi enhanced the production of an electron transfer compound cyt c this implies that mzvi might enhance the extracellular electron transfer costa et al 2018 however studies about the involvement of diet in the reactors for methane production are still in their infancy and require further investigation 3 6 effect of phosphate on the dissolution of core shell structured fe c composites according to the above results phosphate affects the mzvi dissolution therefore as alternatives core shell structured fe c composites were added to solve the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution the fe c composites are smooth spherical particles with a diameter of 120 150 nm the diameter of zvi in the fe c composites was 100 130 nm with a zvi to carbon mass ratio of 1 2 5 more details regarding the fe c composites are presented in fig s6 as shown in the fig s7 the average methane volume fraction accounted for 49 2 and 56 3 in the fe c and fe c groups during period v respectively which are also higher than those in the control with 41 2 moreover the ability of fe c composites to boost methane production was better than that of the mixture of nzvi and carbon powder after adding nzvi for 30 days from the 171st to the 200th day the average methane volume fraction in the nzvi group was still higher than that in the mzvi group with 48 fig 2d it means that the nzvi addition relieves the inhibitory effects of phosphate on methane production compared to mzvi as shown in fig 6 fe2 ions were released smoothly in the fe c and fe c groups during period iv due to the absence of phosphate in the influent interestingly the fluctuation of released fe2 ion was smaller in the fe c group and the decline of the rate of the fe2 concentration was lower than that in the fe c group this might be a result of the special core shell structure of the fe c composites during period v fe2 ions were released smoothly both in the fe c and fe c groups even if the influent contained phosphate this was inconsistent with previous results of section 3 3 which imply that the nzvi relieves the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution the dissolution of nzvi was enhanced and more fe2 ions were present in the solution due to nanoparticles increasing surface active sites eljamal et al 2018 furthermore the average tp concentration in the effluent of the fe c group was 0 91 0 20 mg l which was lower than the values of the control and fe c groups with 1 31 0 30 or 1 14 0 25 mg l respectively this result suggests that the core shell fe c reduces the inhibition of zvi dissolution to further explore the characteristics of core shell fe c composites the micro morphologies of corroded composites were visualized since these materials cannot be separated effectively from the sludge chemical corrosion tests of fe c composites and mixtures of nzvi and carbon powder were conducted the corroded material was collected and used for micro morphology observation by sem and tem see fig 7 the sem and tem images of raw nzvi exhibited a smooth surface however in the case of an acidic treatment containing phosphate the nzvi surface was rough and wrapped with a large number of layer like precipitates this observation suggests that the dissolution of nzvi occurred leading to fe2 generation and the subsequent precipitations of fe p compounds that cover the zvi surface see figs s8 and s9 this precipitate formation is attributed to the surface charge zeta potential and point of zero charge eljamal et al 2016 shubair et al 2019 partial precipitates were loaded onto the zvi surface hindering the diffusion of h and resulting in an inhibition of zvi dissolution sleiman et al 2016 meanwhile the elution of fe2 from zvi gradually decreased due to the increase in ph figs s8 causing the reduction of the precipitate in solution nagoya et al 2019 these may also be the reasons as to why mzvi dissolution is inhibited by phosphate see section 3 3 in contrast the surface of core shell fe c composites was comparatively smooth with a low number of needle like precipitations loaded discretely on the carbon layer surface and an absence of layer like precipitates the carbon layer coated on the nzvi surface protects it from the external environment and thus avoids being wrapped by precipitates these results indicate that the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution can be avoided by using core shell structured fe c composites 4 discussion 4 1 inhibitory effect of phosphate on mzvi dissolution the positive effect of mzvi on anaerobic methanogens occurred in synchronization with mzvi dissolution feng et al 2014 according to the results shown in fig 1 a sustained release of fe2 ion cannot be achieved if domestic sewage contains phosphate nagoya et al 2019 pointed out that fe2 ions react with oh or o2 to form precipitates in the form of iron hydroxides and iron oxides on the zvi surface these precipitates cause a rapid decrease in zvi dissolution in this study the ph was maintained at 7 due to the activity of the anaerobes see fig s2 if phosphate is present the precipitation of fe3 po4 2 is more energetically favorable by its low solubility ksp 10 36 than the formation of fe oh 2 wilfert et al 2015 xrd analysis confirmed that the crystals precipitated on the sludge surface in the anaerobic reactor and were almost identical with fe3 po4 2 see fig 4f meanwhile partial precipitates of fe3 po4 2 were loaded on zvi surface see fig 7 based on the above findings we propose an inhibitory mechanism for phosphate on zvi dissolution in an anaerobic reactor see the upper part of fig 8 fe2 ions were released from zvi into the aqueous solution subsequently parts of fe2 ions react with phosphate to form a stable passivation layer of fe3 po4 2 on the zvi surface this layer blocks the dissolution by microorganisms and proton attack therefore the continuous dissolution of zvi could not be achieved under such conditions in addition the results of the reactor performance and the sludge characterization confirmed that mzvi dissolution is inhibited by phosphate a significant increase in the methane content was observed with mzvi addition see fig 2d however the methane content was significantly reduced if the influent contained phosphate mzvi can be used as an electron donor for methanogens in the form of molecular h2 or directly as electrons for methane production once mzvi is wrapped the release of fe2 ions become blocked and the methane production decreases correspondingly if fe2 can be released continuously from mzvi the anaerobic metabolic pathways hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis become altered zhao et al 2018 the structure and diversity of the microbial community in the reactor shifted according to the availability of zvi according to the diversity analysis the addition of mzvi in the presence of phosphate r2 resulted in a similar community structure and a low difference in the diversity of microorganisms to the control r1 see fig 5 further the strength and average particle size of the granular sludge have been improved significantly due to mzvi addition however the boosting effects become weakened in the presence of phosphate see fig 3 4 2 fe c composites reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution nzvi seems to be a good substitute to overcome the inhibition of phosphate because of its high specific surface area and high reactivity relative to mzvi microbes directly contact zvi to dissolve it and generate fe2 ions nzvi interacts with the extracellular polymeric substances secreted by microorganisms which results in a complete dissolution he et al 2020 this also explains why the released fe2 ions concentrations fluctuated greatly in the fe c group see fig 6 since the phosphate concentration in the reactor was sufficiently high with continuous influent fe3 po4 2 generation in the fe c group was inevitable due to the rapid dissolution of nzvi a portion of the fe3 po4 2 precipitates and coats the nzvi surfaces and causes surface passivation moreover this passivation layer gradually increases in thickness inhibiting h diffusion and zvi dissolution even more alternatively core shell structured fe c composites prove to be a good material to address the abovementioned problems nzvi is stabilized by carbon materials which may avoid the direct contact of nzvi with microorganisms also carbon is a protective material for regulating and decreasing the h transfer due to its abundant porosity it decreases the release of electrons from nzvi and enhances its electron utilization during ad gong et al 2018a the transfer of phosphate and fe2 through the carbon layer is important for the adjustment of the generation of fe3 po4 2 the transfer depends mainly on the diffusion due to the concentration differences the h diffusion through the porous carbon layer to dissolve nzvi to fe2 ions is slowed down gong et al 2018b moreover the fe2 concentration inside the carbon layer is higher than in the outer layer due to the dissolution gradient of nzvi whereas the phosphate concentration is outside the carbon layer and higher than in the inner layer thus the reaction sites between fe2 and phosphate are separated which largely avoids the direct precipitation of fe3 po4 2 on the nzvi surface and in this way reduces nzvi passivation see the bottom part of fig 8 therefore a carbon coating on the nzvi surface to acts as a buffer for the phosphate and fe2 ions is a promising way to reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on nzvi dissolution 4 3 implications in general zvi addition has been shown to effectively enhance methane production through bioaugmentation in anaerobic treatment however this work demonstrates that phosphate could cause a significant inhibition of zvi dissolution during ad resulting in the loss of the ability of zvi to boost ad thus the remediation of the inhibition of phosphate should be noted in the application of zvi technology phosphate concentration within domestic sewage was always higher than 2 mg l which was likely to cause the inhibition of zvi dissolution in this study the double layered core shell structured fe c composites could efficiently reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution compared to mzvi or nzvi the life cycle of the fe c composites was longer and the performance of the bioreactor was more stable with the addition of the fe c composites the strengthening effect of zvi on methane production could proceed smoothly in addition the combination of zvi technology and anaerobic granular sludge technology can not only increase the organic load in the treatment of domestic sewage but also prevent the zvi washout with the sludge from the bioreactor further the presence of the carbon layer can promote homogeneous distribution of nzvi in the sludge system these results further strengthen the feasibility of fe c composites to boost methane production in the treatment of domestic sewage overall this work proposes a core shell structured fe c technology to reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate on zvi dissolution and to enhance methane production during ad this technology has the potential to be applied in wwtps it is worth mentioning that this technology is only a front end technology with the aim to enhance the energy recovery from domestic sewage it needs to be combined with other technologies such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation and biological phosphorus removal to meet the water quality discharge standards additionally the nano sized fe c technology is potentially expensive for wwtps for practical application therefore a cheap synthetic route for fe c composites is worth studying in the future 5 conclusions phosphate within domestic sewage causes a significant inhibition of zvi dissolution during anaerobic treatment which weakens the boosting effects of zvi for ad this is attributed to a reaction between fe2 and phosphate ions which form a passivation layer on the zvi surface inhibiting its dissolution as an alternative double layered core shell structured fe c composites have been proven to reduce the inhibitory effects of phosphate the carbon in these composites acts as a protective layer for zvi shielding it against phosphate and promoting zvi utilization therefore fe c composites provide a promising technology for energy recovery from domestic sewage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
