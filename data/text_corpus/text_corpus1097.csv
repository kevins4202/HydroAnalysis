5485,genetic algorithms gas have been commonly applied in the last two decades as a substitute for the traditional mathematical programming algorithms in searching for optimal operating rules of reservoir systems however only a few ga studies related to reservoir operations addressed the inflow uncertainty in this study the reservoir operation rules were developed and evaluated by reflecting the uncertainty of reservoir inflows using the non dominated sorting ga ii algorithm nsga ii through the following procedure 1 the historical inflow data were classified into four clusters using the self organizing map som clustering technique 2 nsga ii searched for an optimal release rule in each cluster with all the inflow data of the corresponding cluster 3 a release response function was then derived for each cluster by regressing the calculated optimal release data against the storage at the beginning of the month and the inflow during the month and 4 finally the derived release rules for each cluster were tested with three performance indices namely reliability resilience and vulnerability the proposed procedure was applied to the monthly operations of the lake tana multi reservoir system in ethiopia which has six upstream irrigation reservoirs and one natural lake that has three release outlets for agriculture hydropower and instream requirement using the nsga ii som and a seasonal arima forecasting model in this study it is concluded that 1 the overall performance of the proposed optimization procedure with arima forecasts and cluster approach reaches 84 of the perfect information case across multiple performance measures 2 the use of the one month ahead arima forecasts improves the overall system performance by 8 over simply optimizing to the mean flow and 3 the use of the four clusters and the consequent rrfs further improves the overall system performance by 14 furthermore this study recommends that in future significant efforts should be focused on improving the operation performance of the upstream irrigation reservoirs in coordination with the lake tana system keywords genetic algorithm multi reservoir operation inflow uncertainty cluster optimal release 1 introduction planning the operating rules of multiple and multi purpose reservoirs has been a traditional water resources planning problem labadie 2004 many optimization techniques to build the operating rules for complex reservoir systems are available such as linear programming belaineh et al 1999 dynamic programming kim et al 2007 and nonlinear programming consoli et al 2008 however the dynamic programming technique has a major problem known as the curse of dimensionality with the increase in the number of state variables bellman and dreyfus 1962 on the other hand the linear and the nonlinear programming methods face essential approximation problems in dealing with discontinuous non differentiable non convex multi objective functions reddy and kumar 2006 to overcome these drawbacks evolutionary algorithms particularly the genetic algorithms gas were applied in reservoir operation studies for solving real world reservoir operation problems e g reddy and kumar 2006 chen et al 2007 yang et al 2007 chang 2008 reed et al 2013 many multi objective evolutionary algorithms were suggested in the field of water resources during the last two decades such as the niched pareto genetic algorithm npga horn et al 1994 the strength pareto evolutionary algorithm spea zitzler and thiele 1999 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga srinivas and deb 1994 the pareto archived evolution strategy paes knowles and corne 2000 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 and the auto adaptive borg moea hadka and reed 2013 a comparison of various multi objective evolutionary algorithms is presented by zitzler et al 2000 and in detail by deb 2001 who concluded that nsga ii outperforms paes and spea in terms of converging nearer to the true pareto optimal set reddy and kumar 2006 also pointed out that nsga ii uses elitism to preserve the best solutions and to speed up convergence where the combination of parents and offspring population are grouped into different fronts and the best individuals are selected for the next generation recently the auto adaptive borg moea hadka and reed 2013 has been reported as a robust approach in a diverse types of multi objective problems reed et al 2013 reported that the borg moea outperformed the performance of other state of the art moeas however the present study adopted nsga ii due to its widespread use in water resources optimization problems uncertainty plays a major role in water resource planning and management and the development of reservoir operation rules is not an exception because the performance of the considered reservoirs can be often over or underestimated when uncertainty is ignored loucks and van beek 2005 managing uncertainty in ga is difficult because no probabilistic expression is involved in the ga formulation in other words ga searches for an optimal solution in each scenario and then perform a post optimization analysis of uncertainty thus most of the previous studies have developed reservoir operation rules deterministically with the mean monthly inflow kim et al 2006 chen et al 2007 yang et al 2007 chang 2008 on the other hand reddy and kumar 2006 divided the yearly pattern of their average reservoir inflow series into dry normal and wet seasons while schardong et al 2013 grouped the record years into two inflow scenarios namely the dry period with inflows below the historical average and the wet period with average inflows above the historical average both studies developed multiple operating rules for multiple seasonal or annual inflow scenarios with ga but it was unclear to select which scenario should be selected in the actual operations moreover direct search approach has been used in optimization of reservoir operating rules with gas by directly finding optimal parameters of the rule using system simulation results oliveira and loucks 1997 koutsoyiannis and economou 2003 momtahen and dariane 2007 giuliani et al 2014 giuliani et al 2017 this study proposed an alternative and yet a simple approach to reflect the natural variability of reservoir inflows in the development of optimal reservoir operation rules with gas using a cluster analysis combined with an implicit optimization approach ioa in this aspect many types of clustering methods can be used to cluster the similar hydrologic years such as the hierarchical the k means the fuzzy c means the kohonen self organizing map som and the fuzzy adaptive resonance theory kalteh et al 2008 reviewed the application of som in water resources problems and concluded that it is a promising technique suitable to investigate model and control many types of water resource processes and systems therefore this study employs the som method to cluster all available inflows into each reservoir system in order to provide the optimal operating rules for different clusters momtahen and dariane 2007 pointed out that any function that provides a better fit to the state decision vectors can better operate the system in a traditional ioa however this is not valid in operations during some exceptional hydrologic years with extreme conditions such as droughts and floods in other words the frequent occurrence of normal conditions might dominate the fitting process and reduce the operating rule performance in the exceptional conditions thus finding operating rules over different clusters i e hydrologic years and determining which of those rules to use based on which cluster the forecasts project flows to be in can improve the reservoir operation performances the proposed approach with ga is applied to maximize water releases to irrigation and hydropower users from the source of the blue nile river the lake tana basin ltb where seven existing and proposed reservoirs are located in parallel and series see fig 1 this is done by optimally allocating the surface water resources to all ongoing and proposed hydropower and irrigation projects therefore this study tests the performance of the proposed optimization approach and presents a reservoir operating rule in the ltb multi reservoir system which has not been investigated in the past but will have significant impact on the water availability in the downstream countries such as egypt and sudan 2 methodology 2 1 optimization model with ga the operation of the ongoing and proposed reservoirs in the ltb using an optimization technique will be significant to maximize the water releases to all users by finding an optimal solution for the formulated model here nsga ii is applied to the ltb reservoir system to derive the operating rules for the multi reservoir system in the basin and to maximize the monthly release to the downstream users nsga ii aims to find a set of efficient solutions which is known as a pareto front where all solutions are optimal for a formulated problem a more detailed description of the nsga ii is given by deb et al 2002 the optimization model is formulated for the reservoir system configuration as shown in fig 2 to manage effectively the downstream release to the tana beles hydropower plant and tiss issat waterfall considering the lake level requirement for flood protection and navigation purposes as previously discussed the ltb multi reservoir system consists of seven reservoirs comprising lake tana and its six upstream irrigation reservoirs given that lake tana has three outlets r7 r8 and r9 in fig 2 which indicate the releases for the lake tana pump irrigation the tana beles hydropower and the tiss issat waterfall through the blue nile river respectively the total number of decision variables i e reservoir releases in each time step is 9 the number notations from 1 to 6 indicate the irrigation schemes gilgelabay gummera jemma koga megech and ribb respectively given that the system aims to satisfy the irrigation and hydropower demands the following two objectives are included in the optimization problem the first objective is to minimize the sum of the squared shortages of releases from the demands for irrigation as follows 1 f 1 n 1 7 t 1 12 d n t r n t 2 where dn t is the irrigation demand for reservoir n except n 8 during the month t and rn t is the release from reservoir n except n 8 for irrigation during the month t the second objective is to minimize the sum of the squared shortages of releases from the demands for hydropower as follows 2 f 2 t 1 12 d 8 t r 8 t 2 where d8 t is the hydropower demand for lake tana during the month t and r8 t is the release from lake tana for hydropower during the month t hydropower production relies mainly on the release discharge from the lake tana reservoir because only one intake structure was constructed in the lake tana for direct transfer of the discharge to the tana beles hydropower plant the storage continuity for the six irrigation reservoirs eq 3 that take water from the upstream river flowing into lake tana and the storage continuity of lake tana eq 4 are expressed as follows 3 s n t 1 s n t i n t r n t p n t e n t o n t t 1 2 12 and n 1 2 6 4 s 7 t 1 s 7 t i 7 t n 1 6 r n t r n t min n 7 9 r n t p 7 t e 7 t t 1 2 12where sn t and s7 t are the initial storage volumes of the irrigation reservoir n 1 2 6 and lake tana reservoir n 7 respectively at period t sn t 1 and s7 t 1 are the initial storage volumes of the irrigation reservoir n and the lake tana reservoir respectively at period t 1 in t and i7 t are the total inflow to the irrigation reservoir n and the lake tana reservoir respectively at period t pn t and p7 t are the areal rainfall in the irrigation reservoir n and in the lake tana reservoir respectively during period t en t and e7 t are the evaporation losses from the irrigation reservoir n and the lake tana reservoir respectively during period t eqs 3 and 4 are solved simultaneously and i7 is the total inflow into the lake tana natural reservoir which has not been affected by the upstream irrigation reservoir s operation the spill from the reservoir n during month t on t for n 1 6n 1can be defined 5 o n t max s n t s n max 0 finally the following constraints should be defined for the reservoir storage n eq 6 and for each reservoir release eq 7 6 s n min s n t s n max t 1 2 12 and n 1 2 7 7 max d n t min r n t min r n t r n t max t 1 2 12 and n 1 2 9 where smin n is the minimum active storage of reservoir n and smax n is the maximum active storage of reservoir n dmin n t is the minimum demand release from reservoir n except n 9 during the month t rmin n t is the minimum release from reservoir n except n 7 8 during the month t to meet the downstream water quality requirement and rmax n t considers the conduit and penstock capacities for irrigation and hydropower the compromise solution among all potential solutions along the pareto front is then computed which concurrently maximizes both the irrigation and hydropower benefits all efficient solutions of the two objectives are standardized and weighted to specify importance and then summed to form a single overall fitness value for each set of efficient solutions along the pareto front the smallest value is then considered the utopia point i e a compromise solution 2 2 managing inflow uncertainty with ga this study proposed a novel approach to reflect the natural variability of reservoir inflows in the development of optimal reservoir operation rules with gas using a cluster analysis combined with an implicit optimization approach ioa considering the reservoir inflow uncertainty in the design of the operation models can help in reducing the possibility of water allocation shortages to irrigation and power generation contrary to the dynamic programming uncertainty could not be explicitly formulated with ga because ga is a black box data driven approach therefore this study follows the implicit stochastic optimization approach labadie 2004 which calculates an optimal release series for each series of inflow set available and then obtains a general release response function rrf by regressing the optimal release data calculated on the data of the inflow and the initial storage this study followed this implicit approach but developed an rrf for each inflow cluster to decrease regression errors specifically this study categorized the historical inflow data set into some inflow clusters and developed a reservoir operating rule rrf for each inflow cluster the pronounced inter annual hydro climatic variability in the study region block and strzepek 2010 tegegne et al 2017 tegegne and kim 2018 motivated this research to classify all available reservoir inflows into distinct clusters in order to provide the optimal operating policies for different hydrological conditions thus finding operating policies over different clusters i e hydrologic years and determining which of those policies to use based on which cluster the forecasts project flows to be in could improve the reservoir operation performances this is essential in operations during some exceptional hydrologic years with extreme conditions such as droughts and floods in the traditional reservoir operation approach the frequent occurrence of normal conditions might dominate the fitting process and reduce the operating policy performance in the exceptional conditions in general the proposed approach is very important in developing reservoir operation rules for the lake tana reservoir systems because of the strong inter annual hydro climatic variability in ethiopia 2 2 1 inflow clustering method many types of clustering methods are available such as the hierarchical the k means the fuzzy c means the kohonen self organizing map som and the fuzzy adaptive resonance theory kalteh et al 2008 reviewed the application of som in water resources problems and concluded that it is a promising technique suitable to investigate model and control many types of water resource processes and systems therefore this study employs the som method to cluster all available inflows 1995 2009 the basic idea of a som is to map the data patterns onto a n dimensional grid of neurons or units som recognizes groups of similar input vectors in a manner that neurons that are physically near each other in the output layer respond to similar input vectors kohonen 1990 the som network consists of an input layer and the kohonen layer the neuron arrangement of the kohonen layer is usually considered as a two dimensional space that maps the n dimensional inputs into two dimensions the kohonen layer computes the euclidean distance between the weight vector for each of the kohonen neurons and the input the som cluster analysis is based on the minimization of the average of the squared euclidean distances between the inputs and their closest prototypes such that the input only attracts its winning prototype and has no effect on the non winning prototypes du 2010 the weights between the input nodes and the output nodes are iteratively changed until a termination criterion is satisfied the neuron with a minimum distance i e closest is the winner and has an activation value of one while zero activation value for all other neurons note that the som network is trained by an unsupervised competitive learning algorithm a process of self organization a more detailed description of the som method is given by kohonen 1990 2 2 2 release response function multiple regression analysis is applied to the optimization results to develop the rrf based on the initial storage of the reservoir and reservoir inflow the optimal reservoir releases for each cluster which are derived by the nsga ii for years that belong to each cluster are regressed on the initial storage and the reservoir inflow for each cluster thus eq 8 could be used to estimate the reservoir release at any time based on the reservoir storage and inflow data all monthly data points for each year in each cluster are used to compute the coefficients of the rrf of the corresponding cluster 8 r t i t s t a 1 a 2 i t a 3 s t where i t and s t denote the reservoir inflow during the month t and reservoir storage at the beginning of the month t respectively r t is the reservoir release and a1 a2 a3 represent the coefficients of the rrf equation 2 2 3 inflow forecasting model given that the optimal release developed in this study is a function of the inflow concurrent to the release being considered an inflow forecasting value is needed to obtain the optimal release value for the time period being considered from the developed rrf the monthly inflow to each reservoir possesses a seasonal component that repeats every 12 observations annually autoregressive integrated moving average arima models are employed to deal with seasonality box and jenkins 1976 the arima models can be expressed as arima p d q p d q s where s denotes the number of periods per season the uppercase and lowercase notations are used for the seasonal parts and the non seasonal parts of the model respectively details in the arima time series theory are provided by box and jenkins 1976 the arima modeling procedures are summarized in three steps as follows i identification ii parameter estimation and iii diagnostic check the present study utilizes the forecast auto arima function in r programming language hyndman and khandakar 2007 hyndman and athanasopoulos 2018 which performs the above steps based on the akaike information criterion aic and the maximum likelihood while the ljung box test is used to test for white noise residuals 3 application 3 1 study area and data description the transboundary nile river is the world s longest river and sustains the livelihood of millions of people across ten countries in africa rwanda burundi the democratic republic of congo tanzania kenya uganda ethiopia south sudan sudan and egypt awulachew et al 2012 owing to the population growth in these countries the food and water security situation is extremely vulnerable awulachew et al 2012 thus the nile water resources system requires new approaches to water development for sustainable reduction of poverty in the region egypt and sudan are the largest water consumers whereas ethiopia s water consumption is negligible to meet the growing demand for food and energy the ethiopian government started to implement a number of water resource projects in the upper blue nile river basin specifically in the ltb which is the source of the blue nile river and this motivated us to develop an optimal operation of multi reservoir systems for the basin lake tana mainly serves as a means of transportation with a lake level of greater than 1785 m above sea level asl supplying water for the popular tourist destination of the tiss issat waterfall and supplying water for the country s hydropower production plant called tana beles the construction of the tana beles hydropower project was completed with an installed generating capacity of 460 mw by diverting approximately 2 985 mm3 of water per year from the natural reservoir lake tana to the beles river through a 12 km long 7 1 m diameter tunnel smec 2008 the elevation difference between lake tana and the beles river is 311 m the minimum level of lake tana for the hydropower supply has been fixed at an elevation of 1784 m asl which does not meet the minimum water level requirement for navigation purposes i e 1785 m asl operating the lake level between 1784 m asl and 1785 m asl creates a conflict between the hydropower supply and navigation purposes furthermore the koga irrigation project has been completed and a number of irrigation schemes e g gilgelabay gummera jemma megech and ribb irrigation are planned on the main rivers flowing into lake tana see fig 1 this study applied ga to develop reservoir operation rules by maximizing the release from the source of the blue nile river the ltb where seven reservoirs are located in parallel to the downstream users fig 1 the outflow from lake tana i e the blue nile river is regulated by the chara chara weir where seven gates are installed over a 3 m range of water levels from 1784 to 1787 m asl between these lake levels the lake active storage is 9100 mm3 the total flow through the seven gates is 490 m3 s at full supply level in which the surface area of lake tana is about 3156 km2 the recommended monthly downstream flows recommended by bellier et al 1997 over the tiss issat waterfall situated downstream of the chara chara weir were considered as the minimum downstream releases from the system see table 1 b irrigation net demand data and other details for each proposed and ongoing water resource project in the ltb are provided in table 1 a 3 2 application overview the proposed reservoir operation method first uses nsga ii to optimize monthly reservoir releases for hydropower and irrigation reservoir operating rules are then abstracted from the optimized policies by regressing the release decisions on storage and inflow different operating rules are derived for different hydrological years the similar hydrological years are clustered using the som as it is suitable to investigate model and control many types of water resource systems kalteh et al 2008 in this study we first evaluated the performance of the proposed reservoir operation approach using the commonly used performances indices the impacts of inflow uncertainty on the performance of the derived operation rules of the lake tana reservoir system are further examined by calculating the performance indices for different reservoir operation models derived based on the naïve i e operating rules with the mean flows the arima without cluster i e operating rules without considering inflow variability the arima with cluster i e operating rules by considering inflow variability and the perfect i e operating rules with the true inflows cases 3 3 application of performance indices to evaluate the reservoir operating rules the derived release rules for both the upstream sub systems and lake tana are evaluated with performance indices such as reliability rr resilience res and vulnerability rv using the actual inflow series from january 2010 to december 2012 reliability is the probability of no failure within the planning period often the probability that the system state lies in the set of satisfactory states resilience describes how quickly a system is likely to recover from failure conversely vulnerability measures the likely magnitude of a failure the likely damage in a failure event let xt t 1 2 t be the system s output state or status and wt be an indicator for the transition from the unsatisfactory to the satisfactory state the state variable z is defined as follows 9 if x t s z t 1 else x t u and z t 0 10 w t 1 i f x t u and x t 1 s 0 otherwise where s and u represent the system in satisfactory and unsatisfactory states respectively the rr res and rv used in this study are defined as follows hashimoto et al 1982 11 r r t 1 t z t t r es t 1 t w t t t 1 t z t r v j 1 m v j m where ν j is the deficit volume j 1 m and m is the total number of unsatisfactory states out of the total system period t kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 rr res and rv measure the system being considered in terms of frequency period and the amount of the satisfactory state respectively where higher values are considered better results 4 results and discussion 4 1 clustering inflow data on the monthly demand inflows and other details for each proposed and ongoing water resource project in the ltb were collected from the ministry of water irrigation and energy ethiopia the reservoir inflow rainfall and evaporation are the stochastic variables in the formulated reservoir systems the monthly values of reservoir areal rainfall and open water evaporation which have been computed using the thiessen polygons and penman monteith method respectively were used in the formulated optimization model the som inputs of 15 samples i e reservoir inflow from 1995 to 2009 by 12 elements i e monthly inflow were used to be clustered the historical monthly inflows 1995 2009 were clustered into four groups using som in matlab which resulted in the years 1995 1997 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 as cluster i 1996 2000 2005 and 2007 as cluster ii 1999 2006 and 2008 as cluster iii and 1998 2009 as cluster iv it is essential to note that the difference between cluster ii and iii is due to an earlier rainy season april to july in the case of cluster iii see fig 3 fig 3 shows the total monthly average lake tana reservoir inflow for each cluster the monthly average open water evaporation from the lake and the areal rainfall over the lake the monthly mean values of the lake tana reservoir inflow for cluster i cluster ii cluster iii and cluster iv were found to be 627 mm3 746 mm3 723 mm3 and 877 mm3 respectively a total of 40 of the mean inflow increment was observed from cluster i to cluster iv and the authors infer that incorporating this information in the reservoir operation analysis is critical to provide a better understanding of the possible ranges of future conditions 4 2 optimal releases with nsga ii nsga ii was applied to derive the optimal release series for each inflow cluster using all the inflow series that belong to the cluster being considered the 3 year historical inflow record from 2010 to 2012 was used to test the performance of the derived rrfs the parameters of nsga ii population size generation number probability of crossover and the probability of mutation play a vital role in obtaining the optimal solutions for the given problem therefore the influence of these parameters including the crossover techniques such as arithmetic crossover heuristic crossover and random crossover on the fitness values was performed as a result a population size of 1000 a generation number of 9600 a crossover probability of 0 8 a mutation probability of 0 02 and a heuristic crossover function with a ratio of 1 2 were selected to run the formulated model that resulted in better optimal fitness values of the two objective functions fig 4 presents a set of efficient solutions along the pareto front for the four inflow clusters the decision makers can select one optimal solution among a set of efficient solutions along the pareto front based on preferences 4 3 deriving compromise solutions with utopia tracking to facilitate smooth decision making a compromise solution was considered which weights the irrigation and the hydropower benefits relatively equally the compromise optimal points were selected to achieve the highest net benefits considering both objectives based on the result the value of the objective function for irrigation was found to be 7 65 mm3 7 73 mm3 7 23 mm3 and 6 87 mm3 for cluster i cluster ii cluster iii and cluster iv respectively on the other hand the annual deviation for hydropower production was found to be 38 89 mm3 37 51 mm3 35 55 mm3 and 34 31 mm3 for cluster i cluster ii cluster iii and cluster iv respectively 4 4 deriving the release response functions to derive the release response functions rrfs the entire system was divided into two subsystems 1 the six irrigation reservoirs i e gilgelabay gummera jemma koga megech and ribb located in the upstream of the lake tana reservoir and 2 the lake tana reservoir for the irrigation reservoirs the release from the six upstream reservoirs was regressed on their storage at the beginning of the month and the inflow into all upstream reservoirs similarly for the lake tana reservoir each of the releases for the tana beles hydropower tana pump irrigation and to the downstream tiss issat waterfall was regressed at the beginning of storage and the inflow into the lake tana natural reservoir therefore the rrfs were derived using matlab for each cluster comprising one for the upstream and the other three for the lake tana the overall average of r2 over clusters and reservoirs is 0 67 which is higher than the average r2 without clusters 0 60 although the individual r2s with clusters are sometimes inferior to the corresponding r2s without clusters 4 5 inflow forecasting to read the value of the releases during the month t from an rrf two input values such as an inflow value during the month t and a storage value at the beginning of the month t given that the storage value can be an observed value but the inflow value is unknown at the beginning of the month when we want to calculate the release the inflow forecasting models are required for the aggregated upstream reservoirs system and lake tana the historical inflow data from 1995 to 2009 were used to create an appropriate arima time series model and the period from 2010 to 2012 was assumed as a future series to test the derived arima model using the auto arima function in the r programming arima 1 0 0 0 1 1 12 was found to be the best model which produces the lowest aic values for both subsystems the selected arima model can be expressed as follows 12 1 φ 1 b 1 b 12 y t 1 θ 1 b 12 ε t which becomes 13 y t φ 1 y t 1 y t 12 φ 1 y t 13 ε t θ 1 ε t 1 using the maximum likelihood estimation method built in the auto arima function the best fit coefficients of φ1 non seasonal autoregressive term and θ1 seasonal moving average term were found to be 0 63 and 0 77 for the upstream system and 0 46 and 0 79 for the lake tana respectively therefore an l month ahead forecast can be calculated using eq 14 for the upstream systems and eq 15 for the lake tana 14 y t l y t l 0 63 y t l 1 y t l 12 0 63 y t l 13 0 77 ε t l 1 15 y t t y t l 0 46 y t l 1 y t l 12 0 46 y t l 13 0 79 ε t l 1 the 1 month ahead inflow forecasts for the three year period from january 2010 to december 2012 were generated and tested with r2 and percent bias pbias the generated forecast series closely matches the observed series with r2 of 0 87 for lake tana and 0 92 for the upstream system and pbias of 7 49 for lake tana and 3 93 for the upstream system the diagnostic test for the model residuals using the ljung box test also confirmed that the calculated residuals are white noise series 4 6 performance of the derived operation rules and impacts of inflow uncertainty on reservoir operation rules the derived reservoir operating rules were tested with performance indices of the reliability resilience and vulnerability using the actual inflow series from january 2010 to december 2012 the impacts of inflow uncertainty on the reservoir operation rules were further assessed by developing the release rules for different cases with the aim of investigating the effects of natural variabilities by comparing the reliability i e measure in terms of frequency resilience i e measure in terms of period and vulnerability i e measure in terms of the amount of the satisfactory state of each case the performance test procedure is as follows i the 1 month ahead arima forecasts for the upstream system and lake tana inflows are made at the beginning of each month ii the most similar cluster to the calculated arima forecast is selected based on the relative distance between the mean monthly inflows then the optimal releases for the upstream system and lake tana are read with the calculated arima inflow forecasts and the beginning reservoir storages from the rrfs iii the optimal releases read from the corresponding rrfs for each month of the test period i e january 2010 december 2012 are inputted to the performance indices to summarize the performance of the derived optimal rules the above procedure with the arima forecasts and the four cluster test is called ga fc4 case this study considers two more cases the naïve and perfect cases in order to investigate the effects of natural variabilities on the development of reservoir operation rules the naïve case called ga n derives the optimal release simply with the monthly average series of the actual flow from 1995 to 2009 while the perfect case called ga p derives the optimal release simply with the actual flow from january 2010 to december 2012 similar to the last stage of the above arima case procedure the performance indices were then calculated for the same test period using the derived optimal release series for each case the optimal release series for the naïve case did not change annually because it uses only the 12 values of average inflows this study also developed the ga model with the arima forecasts but without clusters for investigating the effects of inflow uncertainty which is called the ga fc0 case the ga fc0 uses only one rrf that has been estimated over the entire inflow data except those that follows the above arima case procedure therefore the ga p and ga n are expected to perform the best and the worst respectively while the performance of ga fc0 and ga fc4 fall between those of the perfect and the naïve cases the stepwise comparison of the four models allows the evaluation of various effects the performance improvements from ga n to ga fc0 and from ga fc0 to ga fc4 imply the forecasting values with the rrf and clustering i e value of considering inflow uncertainty respectively the performances of the four models were computed following equations 11 the results are reported in fig 5 the performance of each model and the values of forecast and the effects of inflow uncertainty on the development of reservoir operations rules were assessed using the relative performance improvement fig 5 4 6 1 performance of the proposed reservoir operation approach fig 5 quantifies and confirms the authors expectations among the many performance measure values 48 values 4 release decisions 3 measures 4 models some key findings are summarized as follows our proposed model ga fc4 reached 84 of the best model ga p on average over 12 measures the maximum achievement ratio of ga fc4 ga fc4 ga p 98 occurred in the reliability of the tana beles hydropower plant release while the minimum achievement of ga fc4 53 occurred in the vulnerability of the upstream system therefore the vulnerability of the upstream irrigation must be urgently minimized for the future operation of the system when comparing the achievement ratios of ga fc4 in three measures averaged over four release decisions for ga fc4 the system performs the worst 69 in terms of vulnerability when analyzing the system by the decision variables the system performs the worst 71 in the upstream system which requires further studies in general as may be expected the consideration of cluster approach considerably improved the accuracy of the reservoir operation rules of the lake tana basin reservoir systems hence it can be concluded that reservoir operation rules for different hydrological years may have to be defined separately as this could improve the reservoir operations performance during some exceptional hydrologic years with extreme conditions such as droughts and floods 4 6 2 values of forecast in the development of reservoir operation rules the average value of the forecasts i e the improvement from ga n to ga fc0 is estimated to be 9 over 12 measures the value of the forecasts 12 averaged over 3 measures is the greatest in the upstream irrigation system but the least in the tana beles hydropower plant therefore significant efforts are necessary in improving the forecasting accuracy for the tana beles hydropower plant 4 6 3 effects of inflow uncertainty in the development of reservoir operation rules the average improvement of the derived operation rules by considering inflow variability i e the cluster approach ga fc4 over the traditional approach ga fc0 was found to be 14 over 12 measures 4 release decisions 3 measures the results showed that the proposed model ga fc4 that considers inflow variability achieved 84 of the reservoir operation model with perfect forecast ga p performance on average over 12 measures moreover the derived operation rule by considering inflow variability maximum achievement ratio 98 occurred in the reliability of the tana beles hydropower plant release and the minimum achievement ratio 53 occurred in the vulnerability of the upstream irrigation system based on the performance difference between ga fc4 and ga fc0 the inflow clustering provided greater impact on the upstream irrigation system on average but the least impact on the tana beles hydropower plant 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a novel strategy to represent inflow uncertainty in the development of monthly reservoir operation for conflicting objectives with genetic algorithms the paper evaluated the performance of the seasonal arima forecasting approach relative to both perfect and naïve forecasts as well as improvements with the use of self organizing maps clustering to classify hydrologic years into four categories the proposed strategy has improved the overall performance of the system by developing separate reservoir response functions for four distinct types of hydrologic years it is verified that the proposed model the arima forecast with cluster approach achieved 84 of the best model perfect forecast performance on average over 12 measures 4 release decisions 3 measures the maximum achievement ratio 98 occurred in the reliability of the tana beles hydropower plant release and the minimum achievement ratio 53 occurred in the vulnerability of the upstream system in addition the average improvement of the forecast with cluster approach over the traditional approach i e the value of cluster was found to be 14 whereas the average improvement of the forecasts i e the improvement from the naïve to the forecast without cluster was found to be 9 in general the proposed approach was observed to be more efficient in improving the reliability vulnerability and resilience of the lake tana reservoir system performance than the traditional reservoir operation approaches as expected developing reservoir operation rules for different hydrological conditions was the most successful while the naïve approach was the least successful consequently it can be concluded that accounting for the inflow uncertainty in the development of reservoir operation rules could help in reducing the possibility of water allocation shortages to irrigation and power generation furthermore the system performed the worst 69 in the vulnerability achievement ratios i e arima forecast with cluster model perfect forecast model among the performance measures whereas the system performed the worst 71 in the upstream system among the decision variables therefore in the near future significant efforts should be focused on improving the vulnerability among the performance measures as well as the operation of the upstream irrigation reservoirs in coordination with the lake tana system this can be solved by optimizing the operating rules to minimize vulnerability the study results revealed that the derived reservoir release response functions with the proposed approach could be used to effectively operate the multi

5485,genetic algorithms gas have been commonly applied in the last two decades as a substitute for the traditional mathematical programming algorithms in searching for optimal operating rules of reservoir systems however only a few ga studies related to reservoir operations addressed the inflow uncertainty in this study the reservoir operation rules were developed and evaluated by reflecting the uncertainty of reservoir inflows using the non dominated sorting ga ii algorithm nsga ii through the following procedure 1 the historical inflow data were classified into four clusters using the self organizing map som clustering technique 2 nsga ii searched for an optimal release rule in each cluster with all the inflow data of the corresponding cluster 3 a release response function was then derived for each cluster by regressing the calculated optimal release data against the storage at the beginning of the month and the inflow during the month and 4 finally the derived release rules for each cluster were tested with three performance indices namely reliability resilience and vulnerability the proposed procedure was applied to the monthly operations of the lake tana multi reservoir system in ethiopia which has six upstream irrigation reservoirs and one natural lake that has three release outlets for agriculture hydropower and instream requirement using the nsga ii som and a seasonal arima forecasting model in this study it is concluded that 1 the overall performance of the proposed optimization procedure with arima forecasts and cluster approach reaches 84 of the perfect information case across multiple performance measures 2 the use of the one month ahead arima forecasts improves the overall system performance by 8 over simply optimizing to the mean flow and 3 the use of the four clusters and the consequent rrfs further improves the overall system performance by 14 furthermore this study recommends that in future significant efforts should be focused on improving the operation performance of the upstream irrigation reservoirs in coordination with the lake tana system keywords genetic algorithm multi reservoir operation inflow uncertainty cluster optimal release 1 introduction planning the operating rules of multiple and multi purpose reservoirs has been a traditional water resources planning problem labadie 2004 many optimization techniques to build the operating rules for complex reservoir systems are available such as linear programming belaineh et al 1999 dynamic programming kim et al 2007 and nonlinear programming consoli et al 2008 however the dynamic programming technique has a major problem known as the curse of dimensionality with the increase in the number of state variables bellman and dreyfus 1962 on the other hand the linear and the nonlinear programming methods face essential approximation problems in dealing with discontinuous non differentiable non convex multi objective functions reddy and kumar 2006 to overcome these drawbacks evolutionary algorithms particularly the genetic algorithms gas were applied in reservoir operation studies for solving real world reservoir operation problems e g reddy and kumar 2006 chen et al 2007 yang et al 2007 chang 2008 reed et al 2013 many multi objective evolutionary algorithms were suggested in the field of water resources during the last two decades such as the niched pareto genetic algorithm npga horn et al 1994 the strength pareto evolutionary algorithm spea zitzler and thiele 1999 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga srinivas and deb 1994 the pareto archived evolution strategy paes knowles and corne 2000 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 and the auto adaptive borg moea hadka and reed 2013 a comparison of various multi objective evolutionary algorithms is presented by zitzler et al 2000 and in detail by deb 2001 who concluded that nsga ii outperforms paes and spea in terms of converging nearer to the true pareto optimal set reddy and kumar 2006 also pointed out that nsga ii uses elitism to preserve the best solutions and to speed up convergence where the combination of parents and offspring population are grouped into different fronts and the best individuals are selected for the next generation recently the auto adaptive borg moea hadka and reed 2013 has been reported as a robust approach in a diverse types of multi objective problems reed et al 2013 reported that the borg moea outperformed the performance of other state of the art moeas however the present study adopted nsga ii due to its widespread use in water resources optimization problems uncertainty plays a major role in water resource planning and management and the development of reservoir operation rules is not an exception because the performance of the considered reservoirs can be often over or underestimated when uncertainty is ignored loucks and van beek 2005 managing uncertainty in ga is difficult because no probabilistic expression is involved in the ga formulation in other words ga searches for an optimal solution in each scenario and then perform a post optimization analysis of uncertainty thus most of the previous studies have developed reservoir operation rules deterministically with the mean monthly inflow kim et al 2006 chen et al 2007 yang et al 2007 chang 2008 on the other hand reddy and kumar 2006 divided the yearly pattern of their average reservoir inflow series into dry normal and wet seasons while schardong et al 2013 grouped the record years into two inflow scenarios namely the dry period with inflows below the historical average and the wet period with average inflows above the historical average both studies developed multiple operating rules for multiple seasonal or annual inflow scenarios with ga but it was unclear to select which scenario should be selected in the actual operations moreover direct search approach has been used in optimization of reservoir operating rules with gas by directly finding optimal parameters of the rule using system simulation results oliveira and loucks 1997 koutsoyiannis and economou 2003 momtahen and dariane 2007 giuliani et al 2014 giuliani et al 2017 this study proposed an alternative and yet a simple approach to reflect the natural variability of reservoir inflows in the development of optimal reservoir operation rules with gas using a cluster analysis combined with an implicit optimization approach ioa in this aspect many types of clustering methods can be used to cluster the similar hydrologic years such as the hierarchical the k means the fuzzy c means the kohonen self organizing map som and the fuzzy adaptive resonance theory kalteh et al 2008 reviewed the application of som in water resources problems and concluded that it is a promising technique suitable to investigate model and control many types of water resource processes and systems therefore this study employs the som method to cluster all available inflows into each reservoir system in order to provide the optimal operating rules for different clusters momtahen and dariane 2007 pointed out that any function that provides a better fit to the state decision vectors can better operate the system in a traditional ioa however this is not valid in operations during some exceptional hydrologic years with extreme conditions such as droughts and floods in other words the frequent occurrence of normal conditions might dominate the fitting process and reduce the operating rule performance in the exceptional conditions thus finding operating rules over different clusters i e hydrologic years and determining which of those rules to use based on which cluster the forecasts project flows to be in can improve the reservoir operation performances the proposed approach with ga is applied to maximize water releases to irrigation and hydropower users from the source of the blue nile river the lake tana basin ltb where seven existing and proposed reservoirs are located in parallel and series see fig 1 this is done by optimally allocating the surface water resources to all ongoing and proposed hydropower and irrigation projects therefore this study tests the performance of the proposed optimization approach and presents a reservoir operating rule in the ltb multi reservoir system which has not been investigated in the past but will have significant impact on the water availability in the downstream countries such as egypt and sudan 2 methodology 2 1 optimization model with ga the operation of the ongoing and proposed reservoirs in the ltb using an optimization technique will be significant to maximize the water releases to all users by finding an optimal solution for the formulated model here nsga ii is applied to the ltb reservoir system to derive the operating rules for the multi reservoir system in the basin and to maximize the monthly release to the downstream users nsga ii aims to find a set of efficient solutions which is known as a pareto front where all solutions are optimal for a formulated problem a more detailed description of the nsga ii is given by deb et al 2002 the optimization model is formulated for the reservoir system configuration as shown in fig 2 to manage effectively the downstream release to the tana beles hydropower plant and tiss issat waterfall considering the lake level requirement for flood protection and navigation purposes as previously discussed the ltb multi reservoir system consists of seven reservoirs comprising lake tana and its six upstream irrigation reservoirs given that lake tana has three outlets r7 r8 and r9 in fig 2 which indicate the releases for the lake tana pump irrigation the tana beles hydropower and the tiss issat waterfall through the blue nile river respectively the total number of decision variables i e reservoir releases in each time step is 9 the number notations from 1 to 6 indicate the irrigation schemes gilgelabay gummera jemma koga megech and ribb respectively given that the system aims to satisfy the irrigation and hydropower demands the following two objectives are included in the optimization problem the first objective is to minimize the sum of the squared shortages of releases from the demands for irrigation as follows 1 f 1 n 1 7 t 1 12 d n t r n t 2 where dn t is the irrigation demand for reservoir n except n 8 during the month t and rn t is the release from reservoir n except n 8 for irrigation during the month t the second objective is to minimize the sum of the squared shortages of releases from the demands for hydropower as follows 2 f 2 t 1 12 d 8 t r 8 t 2 where d8 t is the hydropower demand for lake tana during the month t and r8 t is the release from lake tana for hydropower during the month t hydropower production relies mainly on the release discharge from the lake tana reservoir because only one intake structure was constructed in the lake tana for direct transfer of the discharge to the tana beles hydropower plant the storage continuity for the six irrigation reservoirs eq 3 that take water from the upstream river flowing into lake tana and the storage continuity of lake tana eq 4 are expressed as follows 3 s n t 1 s n t i n t r n t p n t e n t o n t t 1 2 12 and n 1 2 6 4 s 7 t 1 s 7 t i 7 t n 1 6 r n t r n t min n 7 9 r n t p 7 t e 7 t t 1 2 12where sn t and s7 t are the initial storage volumes of the irrigation reservoir n 1 2 6 and lake tana reservoir n 7 respectively at period t sn t 1 and s7 t 1 are the initial storage volumes of the irrigation reservoir n and the lake tana reservoir respectively at period t 1 in t and i7 t are the total inflow to the irrigation reservoir n and the lake tana reservoir respectively at period t pn t and p7 t are the areal rainfall in the irrigation reservoir n and in the lake tana reservoir respectively during period t en t and e7 t are the evaporation losses from the irrigation reservoir n and the lake tana reservoir respectively during period t eqs 3 and 4 are solved simultaneously and i7 is the total inflow into the lake tana natural reservoir which has not been affected by the upstream irrigation reservoir s operation the spill from the reservoir n during month t on t for n 1 6n 1can be defined 5 o n t max s n t s n max 0 finally the following constraints should be defined for the reservoir storage n eq 6 and for each reservoir release eq 7 6 s n min s n t s n max t 1 2 12 and n 1 2 7 7 max d n t min r n t min r n t r n t max t 1 2 12 and n 1 2 9 where smin n is the minimum active storage of reservoir n and smax n is the maximum active storage of reservoir n dmin n t is the minimum demand release from reservoir n except n 9 during the month t rmin n t is the minimum release from reservoir n except n 7 8 during the month t to meet the downstream water quality requirement and rmax n t considers the conduit and penstock capacities for irrigation and hydropower the compromise solution among all potential solutions along the pareto front is then computed which concurrently maximizes both the irrigation and hydropower benefits all efficient solutions of the two objectives are standardized and weighted to specify importance and then summed to form a single overall fitness value for each set of efficient solutions along the pareto front the smallest value is then considered the utopia point i e a compromise solution 2 2 managing inflow uncertainty with ga this study proposed a novel approach to reflect the natural variability of reservoir inflows in the development of optimal reservoir operation rules with gas using a cluster analysis combined with an implicit optimization approach ioa considering the reservoir inflow uncertainty in the design of the operation models can help in reducing the possibility of water allocation shortages to irrigation and power generation contrary to the dynamic programming uncertainty could not be explicitly formulated with ga because ga is a black box data driven approach therefore this study follows the implicit stochastic optimization approach labadie 2004 which calculates an optimal release series for each series of inflow set available and then obtains a general release response function rrf by regressing the optimal release data calculated on the data of the inflow and the initial storage this study followed this implicit approach but developed an rrf for each inflow cluster to decrease regression errors specifically this study categorized the historical inflow data set into some inflow clusters and developed a reservoir operating rule rrf for each inflow cluster the pronounced inter annual hydro climatic variability in the study region block and strzepek 2010 tegegne et al 2017 tegegne and kim 2018 motivated this research to classify all available reservoir inflows into distinct clusters in order to provide the optimal operating policies for different hydrological conditions thus finding operating policies over different clusters i e hydrologic years and determining which of those policies to use based on which cluster the forecasts project flows to be in could improve the reservoir operation performances this is essential in operations during some exceptional hydrologic years with extreme conditions such as droughts and floods in the traditional reservoir operation approach the frequent occurrence of normal conditions might dominate the fitting process and reduce the operating policy performance in the exceptional conditions in general the proposed approach is very important in developing reservoir operation rules for the lake tana reservoir systems because of the strong inter annual hydro climatic variability in ethiopia 2 2 1 inflow clustering method many types of clustering methods are available such as the hierarchical the k means the fuzzy c means the kohonen self organizing map som and the fuzzy adaptive resonance theory kalteh et al 2008 reviewed the application of som in water resources problems and concluded that it is a promising technique suitable to investigate model and control many types of water resource processes and systems therefore this study employs the som method to cluster all available inflows 1995 2009 the basic idea of a som is to map the data patterns onto a n dimensional grid of neurons or units som recognizes groups of similar input vectors in a manner that neurons that are physically near each other in the output layer respond to similar input vectors kohonen 1990 the som network consists of an input layer and the kohonen layer the neuron arrangement of the kohonen layer is usually considered as a two dimensional space that maps the n dimensional inputs into two dimensions the kohonen layer computes the euclidean distance between the weight vector for each of the kohonen neurons and the input the som cluster analysis is based on the minimization of the average of the squared euclidean distances between the inputs and their closest prototypes such that the input only attracts its winning prototype and has no effect on the non winning prototypes du 2010 the weights between the input nodes and the output nodes are iteratively changed until a termination criterion is satisfied the neuron with a minimum distance i e closest is the winner and has an activation value of one while zero activation value for all other neurons note that the som network is trained by an unsupervised competitive learning algorithm a process of self organization a more detailed description of the som method is given by kohonen 1990 2 2 2 release response function multiple regression analysis is applied to the optimization results to develop the rrf based on the initial storage of the reservoir and reservoir inflow the optimal reservoir releases for each cluster which are derived by the nsga ii for years that belong to each cluster are regressed on the initial storage and the reservoir inflow for each cluster thus eq 8 could be used to estimate the reservoir release at any time based on the reservoir storage and inflow data all monthly data points for each year in each cluster are used to compute the coefficients of the rrf of the corresponding cluster 8 r t i t s t a 1 a 2 i t a 3 s t where i t and s t denote the reservoir inflow during the month t and reservoir storage at the beginning of the month t respectively r t is the reservoir release and a1 a2 a3 represent the coefficients of the rrf equation 2 2 3 inflow forecasting model given that the optimal release developed in this study is a function of the inflow concurrent to the release being considered an inflow forecasting value is needed to obtain the optimal release value for the time period being considered from the developed rrf the monthly inflow to each reservoir possesses a seasonal component that repeats every 12 observations annually autoregressive integrated moving average arima models are employed to deal with seasonality box and jenkins 1976 the arima models can be expressed as arima p d q p d q s where s denotes the number of periods per season the uppercase and lowercase notations are used for the seasonal parts and the non seasonal parts of the model respectively details in the arima time series theory are provided by box and jenkins 1976 the arima modeling procedures are summarized in three steps as follows i identification ii parameter estimation and iii diagnostic check the present study utilizes the forecast auto arima function in r programming language hyndman and khandakar 2007 hyndman and athanasopoulos 2018 which performs the above steps based on the akaike information criterion aic and the maximum likelihood while the ljung box test is used to test for white noise residuals 3 application 3 1 study area and data description the transboundary nile river is the world s longest river and sustains the livelihood of millions of people across ten countries in africa rwanda burundi the democratic republic of congo tanzania kenya uganda ethiopia south sudan sudan and egypt awulachew et al 2012 owing to the population growth in these countries the food and water security situation is extremely vulnerable awulachew et al 2012 thus the nile water resources system requires new approaches to water development for sustainable reduction of poverty in the region egypt and sudan are the largest water consumers whereas ethiopia s water consumption is negligible to meet the growing demand for food and energy the ethiopian government started to implement a number of water resource projects in the upper blue nile river basin specifically in the ltb which is the source of the blue nile river and this motivated us to develop an optimal operation of multi reservoir systems for the basin lake tana mainly serves as a means of transportation with a lake level of greater than 1785 m above sea level asl supplying water for the popular tourist destination of the tiss issat waterfall and supplying water for the country s hydropower production plant called tana beles the construction of the tana beles hydropower project was completed with an installed generating capacity of 460 mw by diverting approximately 2 985 mm3 of water per year from the natural reservoir lake tana to the beles river through a 12 km long 7 1 m diameter tunnel smec 2008 the elevation difference between lake tana and the beles river is 311 m the minimum level of lake tana for the hydropower supply has been fixed at an elevation of 1784 m asl which does not meet the minimum water level requirement for navigation purposes i e 1785 m asl operating the lake level between 1784 m asl and 1785 m asl creates a conflict between the hydropower supply and navigation purposes furthermore the koga irrigation project has been completed and a number of irrigation schemes e g gilgelabay gummera jemma megech and ribb irrigation are planned on the main rivers flowing into lake tana see fig 1 this study applied ga to develop reservoir operation rules by maximizing the release from the source of the blue nile river the ltb where seven reservoirs are located in parallel to the downstream users fig 1 the outflow from lake tana i e the blue nile river is regulated by the chara chara weir where seven gates are installed over a 3 m range of water levels from 1784 to 1787 m asl between these lake levels the lake active storage is 9100 mm3 the total flow through the seven gates is 490 m3 s at full supply level in which the surface area of lake tana is about 3156 km2 the recommended monthly downstream flows recommended by bellier et al 1997 over the tiss issat waterfall situated downstream of the chara chara weir were considered as the minimum downstream releases from the system see table 1 b irrigation net demand data and other details for each proposed and ongoing water resource project in the ltb are provided in table 1 a 3 2 application overview the proposed reservoir operation method first uses nsga ii to optimize monthly reservoir releases for hydropower and irrigation reservoir operating rules are then abstracted from the optimized policies by regressing the release decisions on storage and inflow different operating rules are derived for different hydrological years the similar hydrological years are clustered using the som as it is suitable to investigate model and control many types of water resource systems kalteh et al 2008 in this study we first evaluated the performance of the proposed reservoir operation approach using the commonly used performances indices the impacts of inflow uncertainty on the performance of the derived operation rules of the lake tana reservoir system are further examined by calculating the performance indices for different reservoir operation models derived based on the naïve i e operating rules with the mean flows the arima without cluster i e operating rules without considering inflow variability the arima with cluster i e operating rules by considering inflow variability and the perfect i e operating rules with the true inflows cases 3 3 application of performance indices to evaluate the reservoir operating rules the derived release rules for both the upstream sub systems and lake tana are evaluated with performance indices such as reliability rr resilience res and vulnerability rv using the actual inflow series from january 2010 to december 2012 reliability is the probability of no failure within the planning period often the probability that the system state lies in the set of satisfactory states resilience describes how quickly a system is likely to recover from failure conversely vulnerability measures the likely magnitude of a failure the likely damage in a failure event let xt t 1 2 t be the system s output state or status and wt be an indicator for the transition from the unsatisfactory to the satisfactory state the state variable z is defined as follows 9 if x t s z t 1 else x t u and z t 0 10 w t 1 i f x t u and x t 1 s 0 otherwise where s and u represent the system in satisfactory and unsatisfactory states respectively the rr res and rv used in this study are defined as follows hashimoto et al 1982 11 r r t 1 t z t t r es t 1 t w t t t 1 t z t r v j 1 m v j m where ν j is the deficit volume j 1 m and m is the total number of unsatisfactory states out of the total system period t kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 rr res and rv measure the system being considered in terms of frequency period and the amount of the satisfactory state respectively where higher values are considered better results 4 results and discussion 4 1 clustering inflow data on the monthly demand inflows and other details for each proposed and ongoing water resource project in the ltb were collected from the ministry of water irrigation and energy ethiopia the reservoir inflow rainfall and evaporation are the stochastic variables in the formulated reservoir systems the monthly values of reservoir areal rainfall and open water evaporation which have been computed using the thiessen polygons and penman monteith method respectively were used in the formulated optimization model the som inputs of 15 samples i e reservoir inflow from 1995 to 2009 by 12 elements i e monthly inflow were used to be clustered the historical monthly inflows 1995 2009 were clustered into four groups using som in matlab which resulted in the years 1995 1997 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 as cluster i 1996 2000 2005 and 2007 as cluster ii 1999 2006 and 2008 as cluster iii and 1998 2009 as cluster iv it is essential to note that the difference between cluster ii and iii is due to an earlier rainy season april to july in the case of cluster iii see fig 3 fig 3 shows the total monthly average lake tana reservoir inflow for each cluster the monthly average open water evaporation from the lake and the areal rainfall over the lake the monthly mean values of the lake tana reservoir inflow for cluster i cluster ii cluster iii and cluster iv were found to be 627 mm3 746 mm3 723 mm3 and 877 mm3 respectively a total of 40 of the mean inflow increment was observed from cluster i to cluster iv and the authors infer that incorporating this information in the reservoir operation analysis is critical to provide a better understanding of the possible ranges of future conditions 4 2 optimal releases with nsga ii nsga ii was applied to derive the optimal release series for each inflow cluster using all the inflow series that belong to the cluster being considered the 3 year historical inflow record from 2010 to 2012 was used to test the performance of the derived rrfs the parameters of nsga ii population size generation number probability of crossover and the probability of mutation play a vital role in obtaining the optimal solutions for the given problem therefore the influence of these parameters including the crossover techniques such as arithmetic crossover heuristic crossover and random crossover on the fitness values was performed as a result a population size of 1000 a generation number of 9600 a crossover probability of 0 8 a mutation probability of 0 02 and a heuristic crossover function with a ratio of 1 2 were selected to run the formulated model that resulted in better optimal fitness values of the two objective functions fig 4 presents a set of efficient solutions along the pareto front for the four inflow clusters the decision makers can select one optimal solution among a set of efficient solutions along the pareto front based on preferences 4 3 deriving compromise solutions with utopia tracking to facilitate smooth decision making a compromise solution was considered which weights the irrigation and the hydropower benefits relatively equally the compromise optimal points were selected to achieve the highest net benefits considering both objectives based on the result the value of the objective function for irrigation was found to be 7 65 mm3 7 73 mm3 7 23 mm3 and 6 87 mm3 for cluster i cluster ii cluster iii and cluster iv respectively on the other hand the annual deviation for hydropower production was found to be 38 89 mm3 37 51 mm3 35 55 mm3 and 34 31 mm3 for cluster i cluster ii cluster iii and cluster iv respectively 4 4 deriving the release response functions to derive the release response functions rrfs the entire system was divided into two subsystems 1 the six irrigation reservoirs i e gilgelabay gummera jemma koga megech and ribb located in the upstream of the lake tana reservoir and 2 the lake tana reservoir for the irrigation reservoirs the release from the six upstream reservoirs was regressed on their storage at the beginning of the month and the inflow into all upstream reservoirs similarly for the lake tana reservoir each of the releases for the tana beles hydropower tana pump irrigation and to the downstream tiss issat waterfall was regressed at the beginning of storage and the inflow into the lake tana natural reservoir therefore the rrfs were derived using matlab for each cluster comprising one for the upstream and the other three for the lake tana the overall average of r2 over clusters and reservoirs is 0 67 which is higher than the average r2 without clusters 0 60 although the individual r2s with clusters are sometimes inferior to the corresponding r2s without clusters 4 5 inflow forecasting to read the value of the releases during the month t from an rrf two input values such as an inflow value during the month t and a storage value at the beginning of the month t given that the storage value can be an observed value but the inflow value is unknown at the beginning of the month when we want to calculate the release the inflow forecasting models are required for the aggregated upstream reservoirs system and lake tana the historical inflow data from 1995 to 2009 were used to create an appropriate arima time series model and the period from 2010 to 2012 was assumed as a future series to test the derived arima model using the auto arima function in the r programming arima 1 0 0 0 1 1 12 was found to be the best model which produces the lowest aic values for both subsystems the selected arima model can be expressed as follows 12 1 φ 1 b 1 b 12 y t 1 θ 1 b 12 ε t which becomes 13 y t φ 1 y t 1 y t 12 φ 1 y t 13 ε t θ 1 ε t 1 using the maximum likelihood estimation method built in the auto arima function the best fit coefficients of φ1 non seasonal autoregressive term and θ1 seasonal moving average term were found to be 0 63 and 0 77 for the upstream system and 0 46 and 0 79 for the lake tana respectively therefore an l month ahead forecast can be calculated using eq 14 for the upstream systems and eq 15 for the lake tana 14 y t l y t l 0 63 y t l 1 y t l 12 0 63 y t l 13 0 77 ε t l 1 15 y t t y t l 0 46 y t l 1 y t l 12 0 46 y t l 13 0 79 ε t l 1 the 1 month ahead inflow forecasts for the three year period from january 2010 to december 2012 were generated and tested with r2 and percent bias pbias the generated forecast series closely matches the observed series with r2 of 0 87 for lake tana and 0 92 for the upstream system and pbias of 7 49 for lake tana and 3 93 for the upstream system the diagnostic test for the model residuals using the ljung box test also confirmed that the calculated residuals are white noise series 4 6 performance of the derived operation rules and impacts of inflow uncertainty on reservoir operation rules the derived reservoir operating rules were tested with performance indices of the reliability resilience and vulnerability using the actual inflow series from january 2010 to december 2012 the impacts of inflow uncertainty on the reservoir operation rules were further assessed by developing the release rules for different cases with the aim of investigating the effects of natural variabilities by comparing the reliability i e measure in terms of frequency resilience i e measure in terms of period and vulnerability i e measure in terms of the amount of the satisfactory state of each case the performance test procedure is as follows i the 1 month ahead arima forecasts for the upstream system and lake tana inflows are made at the beginning of each month ii the most similar cluster to the calculated arima forecast is selected based on the relative distance between the mean monthly inflows then the optimal releases for the upstream system and lake tana are read with the calculated arima inflow forecasts and the beginning reservoir storages from the rrfs iii the optimal releases read from the corresponding rrfs for each month of the test period i e january 2010 december 2012 are inputted to the performance indices to summarize the performance of the derived optimal rules the above procedure with the arima forecasts and the four cluster test is called ga fc4 case this study considers two more cases the naïve and perfect cases in order to investigate the effects of natural variabilities on the development of reservoir operation rules the naïve case called ga n derives the optimal release simply with the monthly average series of the actual flow from 1995 to 2009 while the perfect case called ga p derives the optimal release simply with the actual flow from january 2010 to december 2012 similar to the last stage of the above arima case procedure the performance indices were then calculated for the same test period using the derived optimal release series for each case the optimal release series for the naïve case did not change annually because it uses only the 12 values of average inflows this study also developed the ga model with the arima forecasts but without clusters for investigating the effects of inflow uncertainty which is called the ga fc0 case the ga fc0 uses only one rrf that has been estimated over the entire inflow data except those that follows the above arima case procedure therefore the ga p and ga n are expected to perform the best and the worst respectively while the performance of ga fc0 and ga fc4 fall between those of the perfect and the naïve cases the stepwise comparison of the four models allows the evaluation of various effects the performance improvements from ga n to ga fc0 and from ga fc0 to ga fc4 imply the forecasting values with the rrf and clustering i e value of considering inflow uncertainty respectively the performances of the four models were computed following equations 11 the results are reported in fig 5 the performance of each model and the values of forecast and the effects of inflow uncertainty on the development of reservoir operations rules were assessed using the relative performance improvement fig 5 4 6 1 performance of the proposed reservoir operation approach fig 5 quantifies and confirms the authors expectations among the many performance measure values 48 values 4 release decisions 3 measures 4 models some key findings are summarized as follows our proposed model ga fc4 reached 84 of the best model ga p on average over 12 measures the maximum achievement ratio of ga fc4 ga fc4 ga p 98 occurred in the reliability of the tana beles hydropower plant release while the minimum achievement of ga fc4 53 occurred in the vulnerability of the upstream system therefore the vulnerability of the upstream irrigation must be urgently minimized for the future operation of the system when comparing the achievement ratios of ga fc4 in three measures averaged over four release decisions for ga fc4 the system performs the worst 69 in terms of vulnerability when analyzing the system by the decision variables the system performs the worst 71 in the upstream system which requires further studies in general as may be expected the consideration of cluster approach considerably improved the accuracy of the reservoir operation rules of the lake tana basin reservoir systems hence it can be concluded that reservoir operation rules for different hydrological years may have to be defined separately as this could improve the reservoir operations performance during some exceptional hydrologic years with extreme conditions such as droughts and floods 4 6 2 values of forecast in the development of reservoir operation rules the average value of the forecasts i e the improvement from ga n to ga fc0 is estimated to be 9 over 12 measures the value of the forecasts 12 averaged over 3 measures is the greatest in the upstream irrigation system but the least in the tana beles hydropower plant therefore significant efforts are necessary in improving the forecasting accuracy for the tana beles hydropower plant 4 6 3 effects of inflow uncertainty in the development of reservoir operation rules the average improvement of the derived operation rules by considering inflow variability i e the cluster approach ga fc4 over the traditional approach ga fc0 was found to be 14 over 12 measures 4 release decisions 3 measures the results showed that the proposed model ga fc4 that considers inflow variability achieved 84 of the reservoir operation model with perfect forecast ga p performance on average over 12 measures moreover the derived operation rule by considering inflow variability maximum achievement ratio 98 occurred in the reliability of the tana beles hydropower plant release and the minimum achievement ratio 53 occurred in the vulnerability of the upstream irrigation system based on the performance difference between ga fc4 and ga fc0 the inflow clustering provided greater impact on the upstream irrigation system on average but the least impact on the tana beles hydropower plant 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a novel strategy to represent inflow uncertainty in the development of monthly reservoir operation for conflicting objectives with genetic algorithms the paper evaluated the performance of the seasonal arima forecasting approach relative to both perfect and naïve forecasts as well as improvements with the use of self organizing maps clustering to classify hydrologic years into four categories the proposed strategy has improved the overall performance of the system by developing separate reservoir response functions for four distinct types of hydrologic years it is verified that the proposed model the arima forecast with cluster approach achieved 84 of the best model perfect forecast performance on average over 12 measures 4 release decisions 3 measures the maximum achievement ratio 98 occurred in the reliability of the tana beles hydropower plant release and the minimum achievement ratio 53 occurred in the vulnerability of the upstream system in addition the average improvement of the forecast with cluster approach over the traditional approach i e the value of cluster was found to be 14 whereas the average improvement of the forecasts i e the improvement from the naïve to the forecast without cluster was found to be 9 in general the proposed approach was observed to be more efficient in improving the reliability vulnerability and resilience of the lake tana reservoir system performance than the traditional reservoir operation approaches as expected developing reservoir operation rules for different hydrological conditions was the most successful while the naïve approach was the least successful consequently it can be concluded that accounting for the inflow uncertainty in the development of reservoir operation rules could help in reducing the possibility of water allocation shortages to irrigation and power generation furthermore the system performed the worst 69 in the vulnerability achievement ratios i e arima forecast with cluster model perfect forecast model among the performance measures whereas the system performed the worst 71 in the upstream system among the decision variables therefore in the near future significant efforts should be focused on improving the vulnerability among the performance measures as well as the operation of the upstream irrigation reservoirs in coordination with the lake tana system this can be solved by optimizing the operating rules to minimize vulnerability the study results revealed that the derived reservoir release response functions with the proposed approach could be used to effectively operate the multi reservoir systems in the lake tana basin in the near future credit authorship contribution statement getachew tegegne conceptualization methodology software data curation writing original draft

5486,agriculture is a key economic sector in developing countries that are facing challenges of low efficiency of water resources utilization and of shrinking water supply this study develops an optimization model for the allocation of agricultural irrigation water to improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue considering uncertainties of fluctuating water supply then it assesses the impact of efficient water allocation on the sustainability and water scarcity under different levels of water supply this study can help answer questions as to how to optimal allocate limited water supplies to different crops and different subareas under uncertainty to improve iwue how water shortage affects economic social and environmental aspects and what the relationship between system sustainability and water shortage is to demonstrate its feasibility the proposed models are applied to an irrigation district in northeastern china these models can also be applied to other regions that suffer from water scarcity results of application are found to be satisfactory for explaining the impact of agricultural irrigation water allocation on net economic benefit water resources allocation equity total greenhouse gas emissions and water scarcity footprint under different water supply conditions this study provides insights into tradeoffs amongst resources economy society and environment in irrigated agricultural systems under uncertainty keywords irrigation water modelling sustainability water scarcity uncertainty 1 introduction economic growth and increased demand for food feed and fuels have raised concerns on freshwater resources scarcity and overexploitation worldwide gheewala et al 2018 water crises have become one of the top five key global risks over the past five years wef 2017 among all the water uses agriculture is the dominant user and irrigated agriculture consumes approximately 70 of available water resources in the world galán martín et al 2017 however agricultural water shortage is subject to increasing pressure due to the rapid growth of water demand for non agricultural sectors such as industrial domestic ecological and environmental uses levidow et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 meanwhile food production needs have been growing and are desired to increase by about 60 by 2050 fao 2011 these underscore the importance of efficient management for agricultural irrigation water especially for developing countries where agriculture plays a key role in socio economic development many studies have been reported on improving irrigation water use efficiency iwue by innovative irrigation water efficient practices and developing various models of water efficiency olivier and singels 2015 tang et al 2015 ali et al 2018 efficient allocation of irrigation water is a popular way to improve iwue it can be understood as using the scarce water resources to generate the highest monetary value and is capable of facilitating a balance between water supply and demand malghan 2010 divakar et al 2011 optimization modelling is an effective technique for the efficient allocation of irrigation water and has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years jiang et al 2016 difallah et al 2017 the objective function of the optimization model is usually maximizing iwue based on fractional programming and the model is subject to various constraints such as water supply water demand food security etc tan and zhang 2018 however efficient allocation of irrigation water is complicated by various environmental economic and social factors mosleh et al 2017 these factors have conflicts with each other and their coordination through the match between water availability and water needs in quantity and quality in both space and time can be understood as sustainable water management chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 li et al 2020 nowadays government policies consistently state that water resources should be allocated with sustainability in an agricultural irrigation system sustainability can be considered in relation to agricultural economic growth regional stability and environmental protection liu et al 2008 juwana et al 2010 under water scarcity irrigation water use policies aiming to increase water efficiency based on the assertion that more can be achieved with less water through better management can be formulated by optimization the impact of this management on system sustainability that is associated with economic social and environmental factors is increasingly causing concern for agricultural policy makers besides sustainability water footprint approaches have also proven to be effective in quantifying the impact of water use hoekstra et al 2015 for areas with water scarcity water scarcity footprint wsf has been recommended as a proxy indicator to show water deprivation impact potential gheewala et al 2018 wsf indicates the equivalent amount of water withdrawn from a waterbody and can reflect the potential impact on water scarcity of water used in food production hess et al 2015 wsf has gained recognition as an important tool to support policy makers more intuitively where there is the water pressure and how the condition of water supply demand is however limited studies have been reported on focusing on an insightful analysis of sustainability and wsf based on efficient allocation of irrigation water in agricultural irrigation systems further efficient allocation of irrigation water in real world is more complicated for the temporal and spatial variations of water supply for example water supply changes with stream flows the variation of which is based on natural conditions and human activities even under a certain stream flow water supply is not fixed attributing to many elements such as technology selection judgement diversity and water saving consciousness these lead to multiple uncertainties of water supply and such uncertainty will become more pronounced for areas with significant inter annual variations of water source considering these uncertainties of water supply is important because they directly determine the veracity of irrigation water allocation and thus affect the accompanying sustainability and water shortage of agricultural systems nevertheless it is usually overlooked in previous studies this paper therefore aims to propose an approach for optimally allocating irrigation water efficiently and determine its impacts on agricultural sustainability and water scarcity under uncertainty the paper will address the following questions under the uncertainty of water supply 1 how to efficiently allocate limited water supplies to different subareas and then to different crops to increase iwue 2 how do agricultural sustainability and water shortage response to this efficient water allocations the approach will be tested in a real world study the approach will help decision makers for irrigation districts to provide efficient irrigation water plans also it is helpful to put forward alternative measures of irrigation strategies in response to changing environment on the basis of realizing the relationship between agricultural sustainability and water shortage this study contributes to efficient and sustainable management of irrigation resources the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the hulan river irrigation district in heilongjiang china and the data collected from the district section 3 details an approach for answering the above questions including the development of an optimization model for efficient irrigation water allocation determination of system sustainability and wsf and quantification of uncertainty of water supply section 4 discusses a trade off analysis under various scenarios section 5 draws some conclusions and suggests extensions 2 materials 2 1 study area the study area under investigation is hulan river irrigation district in the middle of heilongjiang province northeast china see fig 1 it is located between 125 55 and 128 43 e and 45 52 and 48 03 n with a size of approximately 1 89 105 ha the hulan river irrigation district belongs to a semi arid and semi humid continental monsoon climate with moderate seasonal climate the mean annual precipitation evaporation temperature frost free days and sunshine hours are 545 mm 665 mm 1 7 c 128 d and 2577 h respectively liu et al 2019 the area includes six subarea areas heping subarea jianye subarea liuhe subarea fengtian subarea laomo subarea and lanhe subarea several rivers including hulan river anbang river lalinqing river ougen river and yijimi river supply water to the hulan river irrigation district 2 2 water resources issues agricultural irrigation is the largest water consumer in the hulan river irrigation district accounting for approximately 90 of the total water consumption irrigated crops of rice corn and soybean are the main water and land uses in this area and these crops were selected as the study crops for this study rice cultivation is recommended for its good quality which will bring higher benefit however rice production always requires large water consumption besides paddy fields dry farmland also needs irrigation because the hulan river irrigation district has a responsibility for producing grain water shortages exist in the hulan river irrigation district groundwater is considered as a supplemental source of water for irrigation because only surface water cannot satisfy water demand for crop growth water use efficiency is low reaching only 0 5 these lead to the necessity of managing agricultural irrigation water of the district efficiently in order to respond to the call of heilongjiang government for sustainable utilization of water resources evaluating the effect of water resources allocation on system sustainability is also desired for the hulan river irrigation district 2 3 data sources and collection both hydrological data and socio economic and environmental data are needed hydrological data mainly contain water supply water demand and effective precipitation water supply for the six subareas was calculated by multiplying the runoff volume of the corresponding river and water proportion coefficient of each subarea the runoff volume of each river was obtained from the corresponding hydrometric stations and the water proportion coefficients were obtained from planning and design report of the hulan river irrigation district planning report for short for the hulan river irrigation district the heping subarea is supplied by hulan river anbang river and lalinqing river jianye and liuhe subareas are supplied only by lalinqing river fengtian subarea is supplied by hulan river and yijimihe river and laomo and liuhe subareas are supplied by ougen river basin groundwater is supplied only to heping and jianye subareas and the corresponding groundwater supplies were 1165 104 m3 and 67 104 m3 respectively based on the planning report water demand was obtained based on crop evapotranspiration which was calculated by multiplying crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 effective precipitation was calculated based on the usda soil conservation service method patwardhan et al 1990 the meteorological data for calculating water demand and effective precipitation were derived from the national meteorological network as the growth period for rice corn and soybean was from may to september the effective precipitation crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration were calculated during this period as listed in table 1 from the planning report yearbook website field surveys and references the associated socio economic and environmental data were obtained specifically the market price for rice corn and soybean was 3 22 yuan kg 2 31 yuan kg and 5 42 yuan kg yuan is china s currency respectively the planting cost for rice corn and soybean was 9526 yuan ha 5010 yuan ha and 4980 yuan ha respectively the water use efficiency was 0 5 for surface water and 0 8 for groundwater was the cost was 0 035 yuan m3 for surface water and was 0 065 yuan m3 for groundwater the maximum irrigation water amount was obtained from the planning report and the yield per unit area of each crop was calculated based on the ratio of crop yield and planting area from the yearbook the unit area dosage of fertilizer pesticide agricultural films agricultural machinery and electricity for irrigation was calculated based on data source from the yearbook and was 683 06 kg ha 21 18 kg ha 145 58 kg ha 237 19 kg ha and 187 87 kg kw h correspondingly the emission coefficients of greenhouse gases ghg were referred to li et al 2019 3 methodology 3 1 conceptual framework for an irrigation district system the authorities are concerned with the entire water supply insufficiency and deal with the problem that limited water supply should be optimally distributed in an efficient way to alleviate water scarcity in practice water allocation is not merely the structural adjustment of resources but also causes fluctuations of agricultural economic benefit environmental pollution as well as the equity in accessing water resources forming a water economic social environmental system water scarcity directly affects the sustainability of the system the complexity of river system and remarkable interannual variations of water supplies make the problem of water allocation hard to address therefore an approach is desired for an efficient allocation of irrigation water and evaluate its impact on agricultural sustainability and water scarcity under uncertainty a conceptual framework is designed in fig 2 3 2 optimization of irrigation water in this study the water allocation system under consideration is an optimization model of fractional programming the model considered three different crops rice corn and soybean and six different subareas heping subarea jianye subarea liuhe subarea fengtian subarea laomo subarea and lanhe subarea the objective of the model is to achieve the maximization of iwue which is defined as the ratio of grain yield to the total amount of irrigation water wang et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 the objective function can be expressed as follows 1 f iwue i 1 i j 1 j y ij w ij sur w ij gro i q ij i 1 i j 1 j w ij sur w ij gro i 1 i j 1 j where f iwue is the objective function kg m3 i is the index of district and i is the total number of districts i 6 with i 1 i 2 i 3 i 4 i 5 i 6 corresponding heping jianye liuhe fengtian laomo and lanhe subareas respectively j is the index of crop type and j is the total number of crops j 3 with j 1 j 2 and j 3 representing rice corn and soybean respectively y ij is the yield of crop j per unit area in district i kg ha w ij sur and w ij gro are the net surface water allocation amount and groundwater allocation amount to crop j in district i respectively m3 they are decision variables and i q ij is the irrigation quota of crop j in district i m3 ha the objective is subject to several constraints as described below 1 surface water supply constraint the water allocation amount for each subarea cannot exceed the amount of water supply as the annual surface water supplies for different subareas from rivers vary at different levels this study considered surface water supplies as random variables which fluctuate with different inflow levels and under each flow level they are expressed as interval numbers this constraint can be expressed as follows 2 j 1 j w ij sur tw a i sur p η i sur i p where tw a i sur p is the surface water supply for district i m3 and it was expressed as an interval number for each probability of inflow level p for its uncertainty and η i sur is the surface water utilization coefficient of district i dimensionless 2 groundwater supply constraint the groundwater is always considered as an important water supply source for water users because the limited availability of surface water is not abundant enough to meet water demand the amount of groundwater allocation should less than the total supply of groundwater for irrigation this constraint can be expressed as follows 3 j 1 j w ij gro t w a i gro η i gro γ i i where tw a i gro is the groundwater supply of district i m3 η i gro is the groundwater utilization coefficient of district i dimensionless and γ i is the irrigation proportion coefficient of groundwater in district i 3 water demand constraint the allocated water for each crop in each subarea should be larger than the minimal water demand this constraint can be expressed as follows 4 w ij sur w ij gro ω 0 i r ij e p ij i j where ω 0 is the allowable reduction coefficient i r ij is the water requirement of crop j in district i m3 and e p ij is the effective precipitation for crop j in district i m3 4 maximum water allocation constraint the upper limit of allocating water quantity for each subarea should be taken into account to avoid water resources waste this constraint can be expressed as follows 5 j 1 j w ij sur w ij gro w i max i where w i max is the maximum irrigation water amount of district i m3 5 non negative constraint all the decision variables should be no less than zero 6 w ij sur w ij gro 0 the structure of the above optimization model is a linear fractional programming which can be transformed into ordinary linear programming based on the method from chadha and chadha 2007 with the aid of computer software programming water allocation schemes from the developed optimization model can be obtained 3 3 system sustainability the sustainability of an irrigation district is reflected by several aspects including economic social and environmental which are connected to the water allocation amount this means that the economic benefit social benefit and environmental impact are calculated based on the results of the optimization model 3 3 1 economic benefit various methods for economic benefits have been reported over the years for example divakar et al 2011 applied the residual imputation method to compute the net economic benefit of agricultural water hu et al 2016a used the mean annual economic benefit per unit of water consumption to obtain the net economic benefit of different sectors industrial agricultural domestic and ecological zhang et al 2017 calculated the economic benefit based on cobb douglas production however these methods are either complicated or reflect the system revenue and cost incompletely this study used the popular way to more reasonably obtain the net economic benefit i e the difference between system revenue and costs xia et al 2014 karner et al 2019 the net economic benefit neb yuan can be expressed as follows 7 neb i 1 i j 1 j m p ij w p ij w ij sur w ij gro i 1 i j 1 j c sur w ij sur c gro w ij gro c ij a ij where m p ij is the market price per unit yield for crop j in district i yuan kg w p ij is the yield per unit of water for crop j in district i kg m3 c sur and c gro are the irrigation cost of surface water and of groundwater respectively yuan m3 c ij is the planting cost per unit area for crop j in district i yuan ha a ij is the irrigation area of crop j in district i ha and it can be further expressed as 8 a ij w ij sur w ij gro i q ij i j 3 3 2 social benefit social benefit is difficult to quantify shortage of water resources is one main restriction for the development of irrigation district in order to guarantee the balanced development of each subarea the authorities need to consider water resources allocation equity in the allocation to ensure the stability of each subarea therefore in this study social benefit for irrigation district is reflected by water resources allocation equity gini coefficient gini 1921 has been used in recent years to effectively measure water use inequality and land inequality sun et al 2010 yang et al 2015 hu et al 2016a b hence this study used gini coefficient to quantify water resources allocation equity the gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 and the distribution can be more equal if it is closer to 0 the following formula can be used to express the difference between any pair of individual z i and z j divided by the mean size of z with n indicating the number of the entire individuals cullis and koppen 2007 9 gini 1 2 n 2 z i 1 n j 1 n z i z j then the value of social benefit can be further quantified based on lorenz curve sadras and bongiovanni 2004 malakar et al 2018 representing the equitable sharing of water used for crops the sum of irrigation water and effective precipitation per unit of irrigation area water allocation equity wae dimensionless can be expressed as follows 10 wae 1 2 i i 1 i j 1 j w ij sur w ij gro e p ij a ij l 1 i k 1 i j 1 j w lj sur w lj gro e p lj j 1 j a lj j 1 j w kj sur w kj gro e p kj j 1 j a kj a smaller value of wae means the water allocation among different subareas is more even specifically wae 0 2 means absolute fair 0 2 w a e 0 3 means relatively fair 0 3 w a e 0 4 means relatively reasonable 0 4 w a e 0 5 means a big gap and wae 0 5 means the disparity of water allocation between different subareas 3 3 3 environmental impact the environmental impact in the field is mainly reflected by the ghg emissions including co2 emission caused by the utilization of fertilizers pesticides agricultural machinery agricultural film and electricity for irrigation ch4 emission from paddy field and n2o emission from nitrification denitrification from fertilizers in the soil to reflect the combined effect of the three ghgs in one system the concept of global warming potential gwp was used to quantify the environmental impact guillermo et al 2016 weller et al 2016 gwp kgco2eq can be expressed as follows 11 gwp ξ c o 2 44 12 ξ c h 4 16 12 21 ξ n 2 o 44 28 310 where ξ c o 2 ξ c h 4 and ξ n 2 o are the co2 emissions kgco2 c ch4 emission kgch4 c and n2o emissions kgn2o c respectively 44 12 represents the ratio of molecular weight of co2 and the molecular weight of c in co2 16 12 represents the ratio of molecular weight of ch4 and the molecular weight of c in ch4 44 28 represents the ratio of molecular weight of n2o and the molecular weight of c in n2o 21 and 310 are the factors for converting ch4 and n2o respectively to co2 eq over a 100 year time horizon irrigation water allocation will directly affect the distribution of irrigation land based on the optimal results eq 11 can be further expressed as 12 gwp 44 12 i 1 i j 1 j a ij t t r t δ t 16 12 21 i 1 i a i 1 α i 44 28 310 j 1 j i 1 i a ij β j k 1 k n k x k i 1 i j 1 j a ij where t is the type of carbon source and t is the total number of carbon sources and r t is the amount of carbon source t kg ha or kwh ha this study considered five carbon sources including chemical fertilizer pesticide agriculture film diesel and irrigation electricity consumption δ t is the emission coefficient of carbon source t kgce kg or kgce kwh α i is the emission amount of ch4 per unit area for rice of district i kg ha β j is the emission coefficient of n2o from soil of crop j kg ha k is the type of chemical fertilizer and k is the total type number of the fertilizer x k is the n2o emission coefficient of chemical fertilizer k and n k is the amount of chemical fertilizer k per unit area kg ha 3 3 4 sustainability index the water economic social environmental system is complex with interactive components it is desired to assess the performance of the system if the driving factor i e water resources in this study changes the sustainability index pedro monzonís et al 2015 can be used to comprehensively evaluate the performance of economic benefit social benefit and environmental impact which can be expressed as follows 13 si m 1 m ψ m 1 m where si is the sustainability index considering a geometric average of m performance criteria ψ m for this study m 3 ψ 1 ϑ neb ψ 2 ϑ wae and ψ 3 ϑ gw ϑ neb ϑ wae and ϑ gwp are the normalized values of neb wae and gwp respectively neb is the indicator with the characteristic of the larger the better and ϑ neb can be calculated as 14 ϑ neb neb n

16 ϑ gwp 1 gwp g w p min gw p max g w p min where min and max indicate the minimum and maximum values of indicator respectively 3 4 water scarcity footprint water footprint quantifies the potential environmental impacts related to water water footprint is commonly expressed as the water volume used to produce a unit of product or the water volume per year of a delineated area lovarelli et al 2016 for an irrigation district green water footprint and blue water footprint are usually involved green water is the water produced by the precipitation infiltrating into the soil during the crop production process and can be absorbed and utilized by the plants while blue water is the water consumption from rivers aquifers reservoirs and lakes during the production of crops johansson et al 2016 liu et al 2019 based on the concept of water footprint this study used wsf to reflect the impact potentially caused by irrigation a high value of wsf indicates a higher impact on water consumed pfister et al 2009 wsf for different crops and different subareas can be quantified as follows silalertruksa and gheewala 2018 17 ws f ij w f ij blue w s i ij i j where ws f ij is the water scarcity footprint for crop j in subarea i m3 ha w f ij blue is the blue water footprint for crop j in subarea i m3 ha and it can be quantified as 18 w f ij blue 10 d 1 lgp e t i blue y ij i j where e t i blue is the blue evapotranspiration for subarea i mm y ij is the yield for which crop j in subarea i kg ha and factor 10 is used to convert water depth in millimeters into water volume per land in m3 ha the summation is done over the growth period of each crop from the day of planting d 1 to the day of harvest d lgp e t i blue can be estimated as follows 19 e t i blue max e t c i e p i the following steps are used to determine blue crop water use 1 calculating reference evapotranspiration et0 2 calculating crop evapotranspiration etc by multiplying the crop coefficient of specified crop with et0 during its growth period 3 calculating effective precipitation ep 4 comparing etc and ep to determine e t blue then obtaining w f ij blue ws i ij is the water stress index for crop j in subarea i which is the ratio of the total irrigation water withdrawal to hydrological water available for agriculture of crop j in subarea i dimensionless it reflects the water resources vulnerability or deprivation and the bigger value indicates higher water stress ws i ij can be calculated by the following equation li et al 2017a b based on the results of optimization model 20 ws i ij t w ij a w ij where t w ij is the total irrigation water withdrawal of crop j in subarea i m3 a w ij is the available water of crop j in subarea i m3 usually wsi 0 9 represents extremely water stress 0 5 w s i 0 9 represents severe water stress wsi 0 5 is the threshold of water stress and 0 1 w s i 0 5 represents moderate water stress gheewala et al 2018 3 5 uncertainty of water supply to extend the proposed optimization model to uncertain cases the uncertainty of surface water supply is considered to provide alternative strategies for irrigation district basin authorities the uncertainty is reflected in two aspects the first is water supply varying with different inflow levels of runoff different inflow levels can be expressed with different probabilities in hydrology and a higher probability corresponds to a lower inflow volume the second aspect is that even for a specified probability water supply may be uncertain because of measurement and statistical errors and subjective human judgment such uncertainty can be expressed as interval numbers the following steps are summarized to quantify the two aspects of uncertainty first the hydrological frequency curve for the related river is fitted and the goodness of fit is tested li et al 2018 then surface water supply for each subarea under each selected probability can be simulated based on monte carlo method gu et al 2012 last the interval numbers of water supply under each probability can be generated based on the bootstrap method hu et al 2015 under the specified confidence level the sketch for reflecting the uncertainty of surface water supply based on the above steps is shown in fig 3 in this study all the content including water allocation optimal schemes quantification of system sustainability and wsf based on the above methodology were determined in the context of uncertainty of water supply 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 total water allocation scheme under uncertainty the optimization model for efficient irrigation water allocation was applied to the hulan river basin the runoff value of rivers associated with the study area varied significantly where the coefficients of variation c v were all larger than 0 5 this directly resulted in big changes in surface water supply for each subarea which would thus lead to big changes in water allocation schemes in this study 13 probabilities including 1 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 99 were selected water supply volumes with higher probabilities were smaller than those with lower probabilities 90 confidence level was used to generate interval numbers of surface water supply for each probability the uncertainty of surface water supply was quantified based on the steps in section 3 4 and the corresponding interval expressions for each subarea under the selected probabilities are listed in table 2 inputting these surface water supply data into the optimization model irrigation water allocations under different probabilities were obtained as shown in fig 4 the water allocation amount under each probability was expressed as an interval number indicating that the allocation amount could be adjustable in the corresponding range under the confidence level of 90 for example the irrigation water allocation amount for hulan irrigation district ranged from 4 835 107 m3 to 5 8 107 m3 under the probability of 50 which indicated a middle level of water supply the irrigation water allocation amount with the probabilities smaller than 40 could satisfy the irrigation water demand otherwise water shortage would exist in extreme dry conditions corresponding to the situations with probabilities larger than 90 which were especially of concern of policy makers the water shortage reached 1 32 2 29 107 m3 it was obvious that water allocation amounts under smaller probabilities were more than those under lower probabilities the changing trend of which was the same as the changes of water supply under different probabilities results indicated that water supply was the main restriction for irrigation water allocation based on historical data the occurrence probabilities for each level of water supply could be obtained then the average total water allocation amount could be calculated by multiplying the water allocation amount under each probability with the corresponding occurrence probability li et al 2017a b as expressed with the red dotted line in fig 4 the average water allocation amount was 5 245 107 m3 that could be used to guide irrigation water planning for hulan river irrigation district this value was 7 232 105 m3 lower than the middle value of water allocation under probability of 50 which was usually regarded as the average level for water allocation results show that the consideration of uncertainty of water supply could improve the accuracy of irrigation water allocation and provide different strategies for policy makers 4 2 water allocation for different crops and subareas under uncertainty the water trade off between different crops and different subareas is discussed in this section fig 5 shows water allocation schemes for different crops under the probability of 50 it is seen that it had an absolute superiority to plant rice especially for the heping subarea irrigation water allocation for rice accounted for 98 of the total water allocation of the heping subarea and for 45 of the total water allocation of the whole hulan river irrigation district irrigation water for corn in the liuhe laomo and lanhe subareas occupied certain proportions accounting for 20 18 and 26 of th total water consumption in each subarea while irrigation for corn in the heping subarea could be ignored only accounting for 0 65 for soybean the irrigation water allocation amounts from large to small were lanhe laomo liuhe fengtian jianye and heping subareas it can be seen from the figure that for heping jianye and fengtian subareas irrigation focus was all for rice with the average water allocation percentage of 96 and for liuhe laomo and lanhe subareas there was diversity of food crops fig 6 shows water allocation schemes among different subareas considering all selected probabilities from the figure water allocations in all subareas were expressed as intervals water shortages led to the trade off of irrigation water between different subareas irrigation water allocation amounts for the six subareas in order of descending were heping laomo fengtian lanhe jianye and liuhe subareas and the corresponding water allocation amounts were 2214 2631 104 m3 700 927 104 m3 702 855 104 m3 227 336 104 m3 191 264 104 m3 and 126 209 104 m3 respectively among them heping subarea and jianye subarea were irrigated by both surface water and groundwater while the other four subareas were irrigated only by surface water based on the figure the changes of surface water allocation were remarkable while those of groundwater were not obvious under different probabilities especially under smaller probabilities water allocation trends under different probabilities were the same as for the total water allocation as illustrated in fig 4 however the lengths of intervals for different subareas were different it can be seen from the figure that the length of an interval corresponding to a subarea with a larger water allocation amount was shorter than the subarea with a smaller water allocation amount such a result was attributed to the following two reasons the first reason was that it depended on the interval water supply for different subareas and the second reason was that the optimization model tended to generate more robust irrigation water allocation schemes for subareas with larger water consumption 4 3 economic social and environmental impacts the changes of irrigation water allocation schemes directly brought changes in economic social and environmental benefits as shown in fig 7 in this study the economic benefit was quantified as system net benefit from irrigating crops the social benefit was quantified as gini coefficient and the environmental benefit was quantified by gwp based on the outputs of optimization model the economic benefit ranged from 10 19 107 yuan to 21 38 107 yuan considering all probabilities with the average economic benefit being 16 37 107 yuan larger water allocations meant higher economic benefits the increase of economic benefit was similar to the increase of water allocation as the probabilities decreased the difference between the increase of economic benefit and water allocation was less than 5 indicating that water was the decisive variable for economic benefit gini coefficient could reflect the equity of water resources allocation results showed that the value of gini coefficient changed slightly changing around 0 14 under different probabilities such results indicated that the optimal water allocation schemes could produce good social interest with the allocation of irrigation water resources being pretty fair gwp could reflect emission conditions of ghg including co2 ch4 and n2o which had side effects on air environment the changes of gwp were obvious under different probabilities ranging from 15 35 108 kgce to 33 02 108 kgce the water affected ghg emissions by the crop land larger water allocation amounts meant larger land allocation and thus would lead to larger values of gwp among all the contributions of the ghg emissions the emission of co2 was the greatest because most farming practices that related to crop growth generated co2 including fertilizer pesticide diesel from agricultural machinery agricultural film and electricity among them fertilizer contributed the most occupying 55 of co2 emission therefore increasing the use efficiency of fertilizer would contribute much to reduce gwp 4 4 water scarcity footprint based on water allocation results from the optimization model wsf was calculated taking the probability of 50 as an example the corresponding results are listed in table 3 the changing trend of wsf was the same as that of wsi which reflected water supply and demand conditions the wsi index was estimated using the water withdrawal to water availability ratio results showed that there was water stress of different degree for each crop in each subarea rice had more water stress than had corn and soybean the water utilization for rice was in the state of severe water stress while for corn and soybean it was in the state of moderate water stress higher values of wsf were correlated with more severe water stress in the district it was obvious that wsf for rice was higher than for corn and soybean in each subarea except for lanhe subarea indicating that more water was needed for irrigating rice especially for the heping subarea however for lanhe subarea the value of wsf for rice was the lowest this indicated that for lanhe subarea the growth of corn and soybean was more sensitive to water than was rice considering the planting area of each crop in each subarea wsf for each subarea could be obtained presenting large regional differences for example the value of wsf for heping subarea reached 0 94 0 96 m3 ha while the value of wsf for lanhe subarea was only 0 45 0 49 m3 ha this indicated that different subareas had different sensitivities on water water demand degrees for these subareas from high to low were heping subarea fengtian subarea liuhe subarea jianye subara laomo subarea and lanhe subarea and the corresponding wsf values were 0 95 m3 ha 0 89 m3 ha 0 79 m3 ha 0 66 m3 ha 0 52 m3 ha and 0 47 m3 ha 4 5 relationship between system sustainability and water shortage sustainable agriculture requires the coordinated economic social and environment development previous analysis showed how water re allocation affected these three aspects of development now is discussed how water re allocation affected the sustainability of irrigation district and what the relationship between water shortage and system sustainability was results are shown in fig 8 the sustainability index of the whole hulan river irrigation district was calculated based on the normalized values of net economic benefit gini coefficient and gwp which represented economic benefit social benefit and environmental benefit respectively generally both sustainability index and wsf increased as probabilities decreased results indicated that more water allocation would promote the sustainability of hulan river irrigation district the variation of wsf was not obvious because regional values of wsf were calculated taking into account the planting area of each subarea more water allocation always corresponded to larger irrigated area leading to the final results of wsf tending to be stable under different probabilities based on the methodology of determining wsf it can also be obtained from the figure that for extreme dry condition both water shortage and system sustainability were not stable this deserves the attention of local policymakers to make emergency plans 4 6 discussion this study re allocated irrigation water in the hulan river irrigation district in an efficient way using an optimization model with water trade offs among different crops and different regions being addressed since water shortage existed in hulan river irrigation district irrigation re allocation could alleviate the water shortage compared with status quo there was an improvement in the iwue the iwue for the whole hulan river irrigation district in status quo was around 1 87 kg m3 while the optimal iwue ranged from 1 96 kg m3 to 2 02 kg m3 such results were particularly positive for water resources management in irrigation districts with water shortage the primary reason for the improvement of iwue was that the water use structure was adjusted as water shortage existed in the hulan river irrigation district leading to the water land utilization mode becoming water determine land the crop irrigation land was adjustable correspondingly table 4 shows irrigation area ratio of each crop in each subarea and we took wet condition probability of 25 normal condition probability of 50 and dry condition probability of 75 as an example comparison of results showed that the optimization model tended to increase irrigation land for rice because irrigating rice could produce more yield per unit hectare but the increase varied in magnitude for different scenarios for water shortage areas policymakers usually pay more attention to water land allocation schemes under dry condition compared with status quo the increase of area proportion for rice for liuhe subarea was the most with the growth ratio being 31 2 while for lanhe subarea the proportion was only 0 25 by comparison the area proportion for soybean decreased by 45 for heping subarea while for lanhe subarea the ratio increased by 26 3 under the probability of 75 results indicated that when facing water shortage policymakers in different subareas should choose different water and land allocation schemes moreover this paper provides water allocation strategies considering variations of inflow levels which can help policymakers gain insights into the balance of water supply demand and thus generate alternative schemes in response to extreme cases this is one of the highlights of this study the water shortage in the hulan river irrigation district forced water transfer from area with relatively abundant water or increased groundwater exploitation in order to ensure food production this inevitably would increase irrigation costs and might affect groundwater environment this study analyzed the impact of different water allocation schemes on economic social and environmental aspects and how water shortage affected the sustainability of the hulan river irrigation district this was another highlight of this study the results would contribute to the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture based on the results the social benefit was less sensitive to water supply however water shortage would decrease economic benefit to a large degree but meanwhile would induce additional ghg emissions how to balance the two contradictory aspects of increasing economic benefit and decreasing environmental influence was a question that needs further study for this study the sustainability of irrigated agricultural was sensitive to water shortage and more water promoted the sustainability of irrigated agricultural there were significant regional characteristics of wsf in this case study the heping subarea experienced the highest impacts on water consumed while the lanhe subarea had the lowest impacts on water consumed therefore improving the iwue for the heping subarea was more urgent 5 conclusion this paper first developed a linear fractional programming model for allocating irrigation water resources to improve irrigation water use efficiency considering the randomness of water supply based on optimal water allocation economic benefit social benefit and environmental impact were analyzed furthermore changing trends of system sustainability and water scarcity footprint corresponding to different water allocation strategies were studied the approach used in this study can help policy makers for irrigation district plan irrigation water resources in an efficient manner the combined performance analysis of the impact of water scarcity on economic social environmental aspects and system sustainability can give a more comprehensive picture of efficient water resources management these will contribute to water scarcity remission from this study on hulan irrigation district the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the consideration of uncertainty of water supply can improve the accuracy of irrigation water allocation and provide alternative strategies for policy makers to deal with extreme conditions 2 water shortages caused a trade off of irrigation water between different subareas and the developed approach increased iwue by 4 8 8 3 wsf presented large regional differences leading to different regional measures in response to water shortage 3 water was the decisive variable for economic benefit and environmental pollution while social benefit displayed less sensitivity to the variation of water re allocation more water allocation was conducive to system sustainability 4 it had an absolute superiority to irrigate rice rice had more water stress than corn and soybean water utilization for rice was in the state of severe water stress while for corn and soybean it was in the state of moderate water stress the approach was portable and could be applied to most irrigation districts with water shortages for this case study there were many water supplies and the annual variation of each water supply was obvious leading to random uncertainties of these water supplies however for water supply with no evident change other uncertainties such as grey or fuzzy would be more suitable which deserves further study credit authorship contribution statement mo li methodology writing original draft

5486,agriculture is a key economic sector in developing countries that are facing challenges of low efficiency of water resources utilization and of shrinking water supply this study develops an optimization model for the allocation of agricultural irrigation water to improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue considering uncertainties of fluctuating water supply then it assesses the impact of efficient water allocation on the sustainability and water scarcity under different levels of water supply this study can help answer questions as to how to optimal allocate limited water supplies to different crops and different subareas under uncertainty to improve iwue how water shortage affects economic social and environmental aspects and what the relationship between system sustainability and water shortage is to demonstrate its feasibility the proposed models are applied to an irrigation district in northeastern china these models can also be applied to other regions that suffer from water scarcity results of application are found to be satisfactory for explaining the impact of agricultural irrigation water allocation on net economic benefit water resources allocation equity total greenhouse gas emissions and water scarcity footprint under different water supply conditions this study provides insights into tradeoffs amongst resources economy society and environment in irrigated agricultural systems under uncertainty keywords irrigation water modelling sustainability water scarcity uncertainty 1 introduction economic growth and increased demand for food feed and fuels have raised concerns on freshwater resources scarcity and overexploitation worldwide gheewala et al 2018 water crises have become one of the top five key global risks over the past five years wef 2017 among all the water uses agriculture is the dominant user and irrigated agriculture consumes approximately 70 of available water resources in the world galán martín et al 2017 however agricultural water shortage is subject to increasing pressure due to the rapid growth of water demand for non agricultural sectors such as industrial domestic ecological and environmental uses levidow et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 meanwhile food production needs have been growing and are desired to increase by about 60 by 2050 fao 2011 these underscore the importance of efficient management for agricultural irrigation water especially for developing countries where agriculture plays a key role in socio economic development many studies have been reported on improving irrigation water use efficiency iwue by innovative irrigation water efficient practices and developing various models of water efficiency olivier and singels 2015 tang et al 2015 ali et al 2018 efficient allocation of irrigation water is a popular way to improve iwue it can be understood as using the scarce water resources to generate the highest monetary value and is capable of facilitating a balance between water supply and demand malghan 2010 divakar et al 2011 optimization modelling is an effective technique for the efficient allocation of irrigation water and has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years jiang et al 2016 difallah et al 2017 the objective function of the optimization model is usually maximizing iwue based on fractional programming and the model is subject to various constraints such as water supply water demand food security etc tan and zhang 2018 however efficient allocation of irrigation water is complicated by various environmental economic and social factors mosleh et al 2017 these factors have conflicts with each other and their coordination through the match between water availability and water needs in quantity and quality in both space and time can be understood as sustainable water management chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 li et al 2020 nowadays government policies consistently state that water resources should be allocated with sustainability in an agricultural irrigation system sustainability can be considered in relation to agricultural economic growth regional stability and environmental protection liu et al 2008 juwana et al 2010 under water scarcity irrigation water use policies aiming to increase water efficiency based on the assertion that more can be achieved with less water through better management can be formulated by optimization the impact of this management on system sustainability that is associated with economic social and environmental factors is increasingly causing concern for agricultural policy makers besides sustainability water footprint approaches have also proven to be effective in quantifying the impact of water use hoekstra et al 2015 for areas with water scarcity water scarcity footprint wsf has been recommended as a proxy indicator to show water deprivation impact potential gheewala et al 2018 wsf indicates the equivalent amount of water withdrawn from a waterbody and can reflect the potential impact on water scarcity of water used in food production hess et al 2015 wsf has gained recognition as an important tool to support policy makers more intuitively where there is the water pressure and how the condition of water supply demand is however limited studies have been reported on focusing on an insightful analysis of sustainability and wsf based on efficient allocation of irrigation water in agricultural irrigation systems further efficient allocation of irrigation water in real world is more complicated for the temporal and spatial variations of water supply for example water supply changes with stream flows the variation of which is based on natural conditions and human activities even under a certain stream flow water supply is not fixed attributing to many elements such as technology selection judgement diversity and water saving consciousness these lead to multiple uncertainties of water supply and such uncertainty will become more pronounced for areas with significant inter annual variations of water source considering these uncertainties of water supply is important because they directly determine the veracity of irrigation water allocation and thus affect the accompanying sustainability and water shortage of agricultural systems nevertheless it is usually overlooked in previous studies this paper therefore aims to propose an approach for optimally allocating irrigation water efficiently and determine its impacts on agricultural sustainability and water scarcity under uncertainty the paper will address the following questions under the uncertainty of water supply 1 how to efficiently allocate limited water supplies to different subareas and then to different crops to increase iwue 2 how do agricultural sustainability and water shortage response to this efficient water allocations the approach will be tested in a real world study the approach will help decision makers for irrigation districts to provide efficient irrigation water plans also it is helpful to put forward alternative measures of irrigation strategies in response to changing environment on the basis of realizing the relationship between agricultural sustainability and water shortage this study contributes to efficient and sustainable management of irrigation resources the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the hulan river irrigation district in heilongjiang china and the data collected from the district section 3 details an approach for answering the above questions including the development of an optimization model for efficient irrigation water allocation determination of system sustainability and wsf and quantification of uncertainty of water supply section 4 discusses a trade off analysis under various scenarios section 5 draws some conclusions and suggests extensions 2 materials 2 1 study area the study area under investigation is hulan river irrigation district in the middle of heilongjiang province northeast china see fig 1 it is located between 125 55 and 128 43 e and 45 52 and 48 03 n with a size of approximately 1 89 105 ha the hulan river irrigation district belongs to a semi arid and semi humid continental monsoon climate with moderate seasonal climate the mean annual precipitation evaporation temperature frost free days and sunshine hours are 545 mm 665 mm 1 7 c 128 d and 2577 h respectively liu et al 2019 the area includes six subarea areas heping subarea jianye subarea liuhe subarea fengtian subarea laomo subarea and lanhe subarea several rivers including hulan river anbang river lalinqing river ougen river and yijimi river supply water to the hulan river irrigation district 2 2 water resources issues agricultural irrigation is the largest water consumer in the hulan river irrigation district accounting for approximately 90 of the total water consumption irrigated crops of rice corn and soybean are the main water and land uses in this area and these crops were selected as the study crops for this study rice cultivation is recommended for its good quality which will bring higher benefit however rice production always requires large water consumption besides paddy fields dry farmland also needs irrigation because the hulan river irrigation district has a responsibility for producing grain water shortages exist in the hulan river irrigation district groundwater is considered as a supplemental source of water for irrigation because only surface water cannot satisfy water demand for crop growth water use efficiency is low reaching only 0 5 these lead to the necessity of managing agricultural irrigation water of the district efficiently in order to respond to the call of heilongjiang government for sustainable utilization of water resources evaluating the effect of water resources allocation on system sustainability is also desired for the hulan river irrigation district 2 3 data sources and collection both hydrological data and socio economic and environmental data are needed hydrological data mainly contain water supply water demand and effective precipitation water supply for the six subareas was calculated by multiplying the runoff volume of the corresponding river and water proportion coefficient of each subarea the runoff volume of each river was obtained from the corresponding hydrometric stations and the water proportion coefficients were obtained from planning and design report of the hulan river irrigation district planning report for short for the hulan river irrigation district the heping subarea is supplied by hulan river anbang river and lalinqing river jianye and liuhe subareas are supplied only by lalinqing river fengtian subarea is supplied by hulan river and yijimihe river and laomo and liuhe subareas are supplied by ougen river basin groundwater is supplied only to heping and jianye subareas and the corresponding groundwater supplies were 1165 104 m3 and 67 104 m3 respectively based on the planning report water demand was obtained based on crop evapotranspiration which was calculated by multiplying crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 effective precipitation was calculated based on the usda soil conservation service method patwardhan et al 1990 the meteorological data for calculating water demand and effective precipitation were derived from the national meteorological network as the growth period for rice corn and soybean was from may to september the effective precipitation crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration were calculated during this period as listed in table 1 from the planning report yearbook website field surveys and references the associated socio economic and environmental data were obtained specifically the market price for rice corn and soybean was 3 22 yuan kg 2 31 yuan kg and 5 42 yuan kg yuan is china s currency respectively the planting cost for rice corn and soybean was 9526 yuan ha 5010 yuan ha and 4980 yuan ha respectively the water use efficiency was 0 5 for surface water and 0 8 for groundwater was the cost was 0 035 yuan m3 for surface water and was 0 065 yuan m3 for groundwater the maximum irrigation water amount was obtained from the planning report and the yield per unit area of each crop was calculated based on the ratio of crop yield and planting area from the yearbook the unit area dosage of fertilizer pesticide agricultural films agricultural machinery and electricity for irrigation was calculated based on data source from the yearbook and was 683 06 kg ha 21 18 kg ha 145 58 kg ha 237 19 kg ha and 187 87 kg kw h correspondingly the emission coefficients of greenhouse gases ghg were referred to li et al 2019 3 methodology 3 1 conceptual framework for an irrigation district system the authorities are concerned with the entire water supply insufficiency and deal with the problem that limited water supply should be optimally distributed in an efficient way to alleviate water scarcity in practice water allocation is not merely the structural adjustment of resources but also causes fluctuations of agricultural economic benefit environmental pollution as well as the equity in accessing water resources forming a water economic social environmental system water scarcity directly affects the sustainability of the system the complexity of river system and remarkable interannual variations of water supplies make the problem of water allocation hard to address therefore an approach is desired for an efficient allocation of irrigation water and evaluate its impact on agricultural sustainability and water scarcity under uncertainty a conceptual framework is designed in fig 2 3 2 optimization of irrigation water in this study the water allocation system under consideration is an optimization model of fractional programming the model considered three different crops rice corn and soybean and six different subareas heping subarea jianye subarea liuhe subarea fengtian subarea laomo subarea and lanhe subarea the objective of the model is to achieve the maximization of iwue which is defined as the ratio of grain yield to the total amount of irrigation water wang et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 the objective function can be expressed as follows 1 f iwue i 1 i j 1 j y ij w ij sur w ij gro i q ij i 1 i j 1 j w ij sur w ij gro i 1 i j 1 j where f iwue is the objective function kg m3 i is the index of district and i is the total number of districts i 6 with i 1 i 2 i 3 i 4 i 5 i 6 corresponding heping jianye liuhe fengtian laomo and lanhe subareas respectively j is the index of crop type and j is the total number of crops j 3 with j 1 j 2 and j 3 representing rice corn and soybean respectively y ij is the yield of crop j per unit area in district i kg ha w ij sur and w ij gro are the net surface water allocation amount and groundwater allocation amount to crop j in district i respectively m3 they are decision variables and i q ij is the irrigation quota of crop j in district i m3 ha the objective is subject to several constraints as described below 1 surface water supply constraint the water allocation amount for each subarea cannot exceed the amount of water supply as the annual surface water supplies for different subareas from rivers vary at different levels this study considered surface water supplies as random variables which fluctuate with different inflow levels and under each flow level they are expressed as interval numbers this constraint can be expressed as follows 2 j 1 j w ij sur tw a i sur p η i sur i p where tw a i sur p is the surface water supply for district i m3 and it was expressed as an interval number for each probability of inflow level p for its uncertainty and η i sur is the surface water utilization coefficient of district i dimensionless 2 groundwater supply constraint the groundwater is always considered as an important water supply source for water users because the limited availability of surface water is not abundant enough to meet water demand the amount of groundwater allocation should less than the total supply of groundwater for irrigation this constraint can be expressed as follows 3 j 1 j w ij gro t w a i gro η i gro γ i i where tw a i gro is the groundwater supply of district i m3 η i gro is the groundwater utilization coefficient of district i dimensionless and γ i is the irrigation proportion coefficient of groundwater in district i 3 water demand constraint the allocated water for each crop in each subarea should be larger than the minimal water demand this constraint can be expressed as follows 4 w ij sur w ij gro ω 0 i r ij e p ij i j where ω 0 is the allowable reduction coefficient i r ij is the water requirement of crop j in district i m3 and e p ij is the effective precipitation for crop j in district i m3 4 maximum water allocation constraint the upper limit of allocating water quantity for each subarea should be taken into account to avoid water resources waste this constraint can be expressed as follows 5 j 1 j w ij sur w ij gro w i max i where w i max is the maximum irrigation water amount of district i m3 5 non negative constraint all the decision variables should be no less than zero 6 w ij sur w ij gro 0 the structure of the above optimization model is a linear fractional programming which can be transformed into ordinary linear programming based on the method from chadha and chadha 2007 with the aid of computer software programming water allocation schemes from the developed optimization model can be obtained 3 3 system sustainability the sustainability of an irrigation district is reflected by several aspects including economic social and environmental which are connected to the water allocation amount this means that the economic benefit social benefit and environmental impact are calculated based on the results of the optimization model 3 3 1 economic benefit various methods for economic benefits have been reported over the years for example divakar et al 2011 applied the residual imputation method to compute the net economic benefit of agricultural water hu et al 2016a used the mean annual economic benefit per unit of water consumption to obtain the net economic benefit of different sectors industrial agricultural domestic and ecological zhang et al 2017 calculated the economic benefit based on cobb douglas production however these methods are either complicated or reflect the system revenue and cost incompletely this study used the popular way to more reasonably obtain the net economic benefit i e the difference between system revenue and costs xia et al 2014 karner et al 2019 the net economic benefit neb yuan can be expressed as follows 7 neb i 1 i j 1 j m p ij w p ij w ij sur w ij gro i 1 i j 1 j c sur w ij sur c gro w ij gro c ij a ij where m p ij is the market price per unit yield for crop j in district i yuan kg w p ij is the yield per unit of water for crop j in district i kg m3 c sur and c gro are the irrigation cost of surface water and of groundwater respectively yuan m3 c ij is the planting cost per unit area for crop j in district i yuan ha a ij is the irrigation area of crop j in district i ha and it can be further expressed as 8 a ij w ij sur w ij gro i q ij i j 3 3 2 social benefit social benefit is difficult to quantify shortage of water resources is one main restriction for the development of irrigation district in order to guarantee the balanced development of each subarea the authorities need to consider water resources allocation equity in the allocation to ensure the stability of each subarea therefore in this study social benefit for irrigation district is reflected by water resources allocation equity gini coefficient gini 1921 has been used in recent years to effectively measure water use inequality and land inequality sun et al 2010 yang et al 2015 hu et al 2016a b hence this study used gini coefficient to quantify water resources allocation equity the gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 and the distribution can be more equal if it is closer to 0 the following formula can be used to express the difference between any pair of individual z i and z j divided by the mean size of z with n indicating the number of the entire individuals cullis and koppen 2007 9 gini 1 2 n 2 z i 1 n j 1 n z i z j then the value of social benefit can be further quantified based on lorenz curve sadras and bongiovanni 2004 malakar et al 2018 representing the equitable sharing of water used for crops the sum of irrigation water and effective precipitation per unit of irrigation area water allocation equity wae dimensionless can be expressed as follows 10 wae 1 2 i i 1 i j 1 j w ij sur w ij gro e p ij a ij l 1 i k 1 i j 1 j w lj sur w lj gro e p lj j 1 j a lj j 1 j w kj sur w kj gro e p kj j 1 j a kj a smaller value of wae means the water allocation among different subareas is more even specifically wae 0 2 means absolute fair 0 2 w a e 0 3 means relatively fair 0 3 w a e 0 4 means relatively reasonable 0 4 w a e 0 5 means a big gap and wae 0 5 means the disparity of water allocation between different subareas 3 3 3 environmental impact the environmental impact in the field is mainly reflected by the ghg emissions including co2 emission caused by the utilization of fertilizers pesticides agricultural machinery agricultural film and electricity for irrigation ch4 emission from paddy field and n2o emission from nitrification denitrification from fertilizers in the soil to reflect the combined effect of the three ghgs in one system the concept of global warming potential gwp was used to quantify the environmental impact guillermo et al 2016 weller et al 2016 gwp kgco2eq can be expressed as follows 11 gwp ξ c o 2 44 12 ξ c h 4 16 12 21 ξ n 2 o 44 28 310 where ξ c o 2 ξ c h 4 and ξ n 2 o are the co2 emissions kgco2 c ch4 emission kgch4 c and n2o emissions kgn2o c respectively 44 12 represents the ratio of molecular weight of co2 and the molecular weight of c in co2 16 12 represents the ratio of molecular weight of ch4 and the molecular weight of c in ch4 44 28 represents the ratio of molecular weight of n2o and the molecular weight of c in n2o 21 and 310 are the factors for converting ch4 and n2o respectively to co2 eq over a 100 year time horizon irrigation water allocation will directly affect the distribution of irrigation land based on the optimal results eq 11 can be further expressed as 12 gwp 44 12 i 1 i j 1 j a ij t t r t δ t 16 12 21 i 1 i a i 1 α i 44 28 310 j 1 j i 1 i a ij β j k 1 k n k x k i 1 i j 1 j a ij where t is the type of carbon source and t is the total number of carbon sources and r t is the amount of carbon source t kg ha or kwh ha this study considered five carbon sources including chemical fertilizer pesticide agriculture film diesel and irrigation electricity consumption δ t is the emission coefficient of carbon source t kgce kg or kgce kwh α i is the emission amount of ch4 per unit area for rice of district i kg ha β j is the emission coefficient of n2o from soil of crop j kg ha k is the type of chemical fertilizer and k is the total type number of the fertilizer x k is the n2o emission coefficient of chemical fertilizer k and n k is the amount of chemical fertilizer k per unit area kg ha 3 3 4 sustainability index the water economic social environmental system is complex with interactive components it is desired to assess the performance of the system if the driving factor i e water resources in this study changes the sustainability index pedro monzonís et al 2015 can be used to comprehensively evaluate the performance of economic benefit social benefit and environmental impact which can be expressed as follows 13 si m 1 m ψ m 1 m where si is the sustainability index considering a geometric average of m performance criteria ψ m for this study m 3 ψ 1 ϑ neb ψ 2 ϑ wae and ψ 3 ϑ gw ϑ neb ϑ wae and ϑ gwp are the normalized values of neb wae and gwp respectively neb is the indicator with the characteristic of the larger the better and ϑ neb can be calculated as 14 ϑ neb neb n e b min ne b max n e b min wae and gwp are indicators with the characteristic of the smaller the better and ψ 2 ϑ wae and ϑ gwp can be calculated as follows 15 ϑ wae 1 wae w a e min wa e max w a e min 16 ϑ gwp 1 gwp g w p min gw p max g w p min where min and max indicate the minimum and maximum values of indicator respectively 3 4 water scarcity footprint water footprint quantifies the potential environmental impacts related to water water footprint is commonly expressed as the water volume used to produce a unit of product or the water volume per year of a delineated area lovarelli et al 2016 for an irrigation district green water footprint and blue water footprint are usually involved green water is the water produced by the precipitation infiltrating into the soil during the crop production process and can be absorbed and utilized by the plants while blue water is the water consumption from rivers aquifers reservoirs and lakes during the production of crops johansson et al 2016 liu et al 2019 based on the concept of water footprint this study used wsf to reflect the impact potentially caused by irrigation a high value of wsf indicates a higher impact on water consumed pfister et al 2009 wsf for different crops and different subareas can be quantified as follows silalertruksa and gheewala 2018 17 ws f ij w f ij blue w s i ij i j where ws f ij is the water scarcity footprint for crop j in subarea i m3 ha w f ij blue is the blue water footprint for crop j in subarea i m3 ha and it can be quantified as 18 w f ij blue 10 d 1 lgp e t i blue y ij i j where e t i blue is the blue evapotranspiration for subarea i mm y ij is the yield for which crop j in subarea i kg ha and factor 10 is used to convert water depth in millimeters into water volume per land in m3 ha the summation is done over the growth period of each crop from the day of planting d 1 to the day of harvest d lgp e t i blue can be estimated as follows 19 e t i blue max e t c i e p i the following steps are used to determine blue crop water use 1 calculating reference evapotranspiration et0 2 calculating crop evapotranspiration etc by multiplying the crop coefficient of specified crop with et0 during its growth period 3 calculating effective precipitation ep 4 comparing etc and ep to determine e t blue then obtaining w f ij blue ws i ij is the water stress index for crop j in subarea i which is the ratio of the total irrigation water withdrawal to hydrological water available for agriculture of crop j in subarea i dimensionless it reflects the water resources vulnerability or deprivation and the bigger value indicates higher water stress ws i ij can be calculated by the following equation li et al 2017a b based on the results of optimization model 20 ws i ij t w ij a w ij where t w ij is the total irrigation water withdrawal of crop j in subarea i m3 a w ij is the available water of crop j in subarea i m3 usually wsi 0 9 represents extremely water stress 0 5 w s i 0 9 represents severe water stress wsi 0 5 is the threshold of water stress and 0 1 w s i 0 5 represents moderate water stress gheewala et al 2018 3 5 uncertainty of water supply to extend the proposed optimization model to uncertain cases the uncertainty of surface water supply is considered to provide alternative strategies for irrigation district basin authorities the uncertainty is reflected in two aspects the first is water supply varying with different inflow levels of runoff different inflow levels can be expressed with different probabilities in hydrology and a higher probability corresponds to a lower inflow volume the second aspect is that even for a specified probability water supply may be uncertain because of measurement and statistical errors and subjective human judgment such uncertainty can be expressed as interval numbers the following steps are summarized to quantify the two aspects of uncertainty first the hydrological frequency curve for the related river is fitted and the goodness of fit is tested li et al 2018 then surface water supply for each subarea under each selected probability can be simulated based on monte carlo method gu et al 2012 last the interval numbers of water supply under each probability can be generated based on the bootstrap method hu et al 2015 under the specified confidence level the sketch for reflecting the uncertainty of surface water supply based on the above steps is shown in fig 3 in this study all the content including water allocation optimal schemes quantification of system sustainability and wsf based on the above methodology were determined in the context of uncertainty of water supply 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 total water allocation scheme under uncertainty the optimization model for efficient irrigation water allocation was applied to the hulan river basin the runoff value of rivers associated with the study area varied significantly where the coefficients of variation c v were all larger than 0 5 this directly resulted in big changes in surface water supply for each subarea which would thus lead to big changes in water allocation schemes in this study 13 probabilities including 1 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 99 were selected water supply volumes with higher probabilities were smaller than those with lower probabilities 90 confidence level was used to generate interval numbers of surface water supply for each probability the uncertainty of surface water supply was quantified based on the steps in section 3 4 and the corresponding interval expressions for each subarea under the selected probabilities are listed in table 2 inputting these surface water supply data into the optimization model irrigation water allocations under different probabilities were obtained as shown in fig 4 the water allocation amount under each probability was expressed as an interval number indicating that the allocation amount could be adjustable in the corresponding range under the confidence level of 90 for example the irrigation water allocation amount for hulan irrigation district ranged from 4 835 107 m3 to 5 8 107 m3 under the probability of 50 which indicated a middle level of water supply the irrigation water allocation amount with the probabilities smaller than 40 could satisfy the irrigation water demand otherwise water shortage would exist in extreme dry conditions corresponding to the situations with probabilities larger than 90 which were especially of concern of policy makers the water shortage reached 1 32 2 29 107 m3 it was obvious that water allocation amounts under smaller probabilities were more than those under lower probabilities the changing trend of which was the same as the changes of water supply under different probabilities results indicated that water supply was the main restriction for irrigation water allocation based on historical data the occurrence probabilities for each level of water supply could be obtained then the average total water allocation amount could be calculated by multiplying the water allocation amount under each probability with the corresponding occurrence probability li et al 2017a b as expressed with the red dotted line in fig 4 the average water allocation amount was 5 245 107 m3 that could be used to guide irrigation water planning for hulan river irrigation district this value was 7 232 105 m3 lower than the middle value of water allocation under probability of 50 which was usually regarded as the average level for water allocation results show that the consideration of uncertainty of water supply could improve the accuracy of irrigation water allocation and provide different strategies for policy makers 4 2 water allocation for different crops and subareas under uncertainty the water trade off between different crops and different subareas is discussed in this section fig 5 shows water allocation schemes for different crops under the probability of 50 it is seen that it had an absolute superiority to plant rice especially for the heping subarea irrigation water allocation for rice accounted for 98 of the total water allocation of the heping subarea and for 45 of the total water allocation of the whole hulan river irrigation district irrigation water for corn in the liuhe laomo and lanhe subareas occupied certain proportions accounting for 20 18 and 26 of th total water consumption in each subarea while irrigation for corn in the heping subarea could be ignored only accounting for 0 65 for soybean the irrigation water allocation amounts from large to small were lanhe laomo liuhe fengtian jianye and heping subareas it can be seen from the figure that for heping jianye and fengtian subareas irrigation focus was all for rice with the average water allocation percentage of 96 and for liuhe laomo and lanhe subareas there was diversity of food crops fig 6 shows water allocation schemes among different subareas considering all selected probabilities from the figure water allocations in all subareas were expressed as intervals water shortages led to the trade off of irrigation water between different subareas irrigation water allocation amounts for the six subareas in order of descending were heping laomo fengtian lanhe jianye and liuhe subareas and the corresponding water allocation amounts were 2214 2631 104 m3 700 927 104 m3 702 855 104 m3 227 336 104 m3 191 264 104 m3 and 126 209 104 m3 respectively among them heping subarea and jianye subarea were irrigated by both surface water and groundwater while the other four subareas were irrigated only by surface water based on the figure the changes of surface water allocation were remarkable while those of groundwater were not obvious under different probabilities especially under smaller probabilities water allocation trends under different probabilities were the same as for the total water allocation as illustrated in fig 4 however the lengths of intervals for different subareas were different it can be seen from the figure that the length of an interval corresponding to a subarea with a larger water allocation amount was shorter than the subarea with a smaller water allocation amount such a result was attributed to the following two reasons the first reason was that it depended on the interval water supply for different subareas and the second reason was that the optimization model tended to generate more robust irrigation water allocation schemes for subareas with larger water consumption 4 3 economic social and environmental impacts the changes of irrigation water allocation schemes directly brought changes in economic social and environmental benefits as shown in fig 7 in this study the economic benefit was quantified as system net benefit from irrigating crops the social benefit was quantified as gini coefficient and the environmental benefit was quantified by gwp based on the outputs of optimization model the economic benefit ranged from 10 19 107 yuan to 21 38 107 yuan considering all probabilities with the average economic benefit being 16 37 107 yuan larger water allocations meant higher economic benefits the increase of economic benefit was similar to the increase of water allocation as the probabilities decreased the difference between the increase of economic benefit and water allocation was less than 5 indicating that water was the decisive variable for economic benefit gini coefficient could reflect the equity of water resources allocation results showed that the value of gini coefficient changed slightly changing around 0 14 under different probabilities such results indicated that the optimal water allocation schemes could produce good social interest with the allocation of irrigation water resources being pretty fair gwp could reflect emission conditions of ghg including co2 ch4 and n2o which had side effects on air environment the changes of gwp were obvious under different probabilities ranging from 15 35 108 kgce to 33 02 108 kgce the water affected ghg emissions by the crop land larger water allocation amounts meant larger land allocation and thus would lead to larger values of gwp among all the contributions of the ghg emissions the emission of co2 was the greatest because most farming practices that related to crop growth generated co2 including fertilizer pesticide diesel from agricultural machinery agricultural film and electricity among them fertilizer contributed the most occupying 55 of co2 emission therefore increasing the use efficiency of fertilizer would contribute much to reduce gwp 4 4 water scarcity footprint based on water allocation results from the optimization model wsf was calculated taking the probability of 50 as an example the corresponding results are listed in table 3 the changing trend of wsf was the same as that of wsi which reflected water supply and demand conditions the wsi index was estimated using the water withdrawal to water availability ratio results showed that there was water stress of different degree for each crop in each subarea rice had more water stress than had corn and soybean the water utilization for rice was in the state of severe water stress while for corn and soybean it was in the state of moderate water stress higher values of wsf were correlated with more severe water stress in the district it was obvious that wsf for rice was higher than for corn and soybean in each subarea except for lanhe subarea indicating that more water was needed for irrigating rice especially for the heping subarea however for lanhe subarea the value of wsf for rice was the lowest this indicated that for lanhe subarea the growth of corn and soybean was more sensitive to water than was rice considering the planting area of each crop in each subarea wsf for each subarea could be obtained presenting large regional differences for example the value of wsf for heping subarea reached 0 94 0 96 m3 ha while the value of wsf for lanhe subarea was only 0 45 0 49 m3 ha this indicated that different subareas had different sensitivities on water water demand degrees for these subareas from high to low were heping subarea fengtian subarea liuhe subarea jianye subara laomo subarea and lanhe subarea and the corresponding wsf values were 0 95 m3 ha 0 89 m3 ha 0 79 m3 ha 0 66 m3 ha 0 52 m3 ha and 0 47 m3 ha 4 5 relationship between system sustainability and water shortage sustainable agriculture requires the coordinated economic social and environment development previous analysis showed how water re allocation affected these three aspects of development now is discussed how water re allocation affected the sustainability of irrigation district and what the relationship between water shortage and system sustainability was results are shown in fig 8 the sustainability index of the whole hulan river irrigation district was calculated based on the normalized values of net economic benefit gini coefficient and gwp which represented economic benefit social benefit and environmental benefit respectively generally both sustainability index and wsf increased as probabilities decreased results indicated that more water allocation would promote the sustainability of hulan river irrigation district the variation of wsf was not obvious because regional values of wsf were calculated taking into account the planting area of each subarea more water allocation always corresponded to larger irrigated area leading to the final results of wsf tending to be stable under different probabilities based on the methodology of determining wsf it can also be obtained from the figure that for extreme dry condition both water shortage and system sustainability were not stable this deserves the attention of local policymakers to make emergency plans 4 6 discussion this study re allocated irrigation water in the hulan river irrigation district in an efficient way using an optimization model with water trade offs among different crops and different regions being addressed since water shortage existed in hulan river irrigation district irrigation re allocation could alleviate the water shortage compared with status quo there was an improvement in the iwue the iwue for the whole hulan river irrigation district in status quo was around 1 87 kg m3 while the optimal iwue ranged from 1 96 kg m3 to 2 02 kg m3 such results were particularly positive for water resources management in irrigation districts with water shortage the primary reason for the improvement of iwue was that the water use structure was adjusted as water shortage existed in the hulan river irrigation district leading to the water land utilization mode becoming water determine land the crop irrigation land was adjustable correspondingly table 4 shows irrigation area ratio of each crop in each subarea and we took wet condition probability of 25 normal condition probability of 50 and dry condition probability of 75 as an example comparison of results showed that the optimization model tended to increase irrigation land for rice because irrigating rice could produce more yield per unit hectare but the increase varied in magnitude for different scenarios for water shortage areas policymakers usually pay more attention to water land allocation schemes under dry condition compared with status quo the increase of area proportion for rice for liuhe subarea was the most with the growth ratio being 31 2 while for lanhe subarea the proportion was only 0 25 by comparison the area proportion for soybean decreased by 45 for heping subarea while for lanhe subarea the ratio increased by 26 3 under the probability of 75 results indicated that when facing water shortage policymakers in different subareas should choose different water and land allocation schemes moreover this paper provides water allocation strategies considering variations of inflow levels which can help policymakers gain insights into the balance of water supply demand and thus generate alternative schemes in response to extreme cases this is one of the highlights of this study the water shortage in the hulan river irrigation district forced water transfer from area with relatively abundant water or increased groundwater exploitation in order to ensure food production this inevitably would increase irrigation costs and might affect groundwater environment this study analyzed the impact of different water allocation schemes on economic social and environmental aspects and how water shortage affected the sustainability of the hulan river irrigation district this was another highlight of this study the results would contribute to the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture based on the results the social benefit was less sensitive to water supply however water shortage would decrease economic benefit to a large degree but meanwhile would induce additional ghg emissions how to balance the two contradictory aspects of increasing economic benefit and decreasing environmental influence was a question that needs further study for this study the sustainability of irrigated agricultural was sensitive to water shortage and more water promoted the sustainability of irrigated agricultural there were significant regional characteristics of wsf in this case study the heping subarea experienced the highest impacts on water consumed while the lanhe subarea had the lowest impacts on water consumed therefore improving the iwue for the heping subarea was more urgent 5 conclusion this paper first developed a linear fractional programming model for allocating irrigation water resources to improve irrigation water use efficiency considering the randomness of water supply based on optimal water allocation economic benefit social benefit and environmental impact were analyzed furthermore changing trends of system sustainability and water scarcity footprint corresponding to different water allocation strategies were studied the approach used in this study can help policy makers for irrigation district plan irrigation water resources in an efficient manner the combined performance analysis of the impact of water scarcity on economic social environmental aspects and system sustainability can give a more comprehensive picture of efficient water resources management these will contribute to water scarcity remission from this study on hulan irrigation district the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the consideration of uncertainty of water supply can improve the accuracy of irrigation water allocation and provide alternative strategies for policy makers to deal with extreme conditions 2 water shortages caused a trade off of irrigation water between different subareas and the developed approach increased iwue by 4 8 8 3 wsf presented large regional differences leading to different regional measures in response to water shortage 3 water was the decisive variable for economic benefit and environmental pollution while social benefit displayed less sensitivity to the variation of water re allocation more water allocation was conducive to system sustainability 4 it had an absolute superiority to irrigate rice rice had more water stress than corn and soybean water utilization for rice was in the state of severe water stress while for corn and soybean it was in the state of moderate water stress the approach was portable and could be applied to most irrigation districts with water shortages for this case study there were many water supplies and the annual variation of each water supply was obvious leading to random uncertainties of these water supplies however for water supply with no evident change other uncertainties such as grey or fuzzy would be more suitable which deserves further study credit authorship contribution statement mo li methodology writing original draft

5487,the rapid increase of impervious area and climate change greatly affect the hydrological environmental and ecological system at the local regional and global scales these phenomena can increase the peak flow and surface runoff carrying anthropogenic pollutants thereby severely deteriorating the water quality of the surface waters low impact development lid practices have been proposed as a promising urban management methodology to mitigate these environmental issues numerical models have been increasingly utilized as an analyzing tool for evaluating the lid performance however lid associated numerical models are oversimplified in terms of water quality simulation by only considering the dilution effect by rainfall in lids this study resolved this challenge by modifying the water quality module of lid in the stormwater management model swmm we evaluated the module performance for simulating total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp of the lid facilities using the developed model we conducted the lid scenario analysis under the climate change scenarios the scenario analysis was applied in the urban area which focused on flow rate and tss the modified module provided accurate results for pollutant simulations yielding an average value of root mean square error observation standard deviation ratio rsr of 0 52 while the original module showed an unacceptable performance with an rsr value of 1 11 scenario analysis showed that the hydrological outputs were sensitive to the volume of rainfall while the water quality results were sensitive to the temporal distribution of rainfall based on these statements the modified water quality module in lid developed in this study will be useful in designing lid facilities and in formulating guidelines for lid installation keywords low impact development storm water management model water quality climate change 1 introduction rampant urbanization greatly increases impervious areas thereby generating urban stormwater runoff with anthropogenic pollutants which can lead to severe water quality deterioration davis and mccuen 2005 kayhanian et al 2012 barbosa et al 2012 the increasing area of impervious cover can also affect the hydrological environmental and ecological system at the local regional and global scales gao et al 2003 shi et al 2016 in addition climate change has a huge impact on urban areas due to higher temperatures and the increasing occurrence of extreme precipitation events predicted in the near future douglas and fairbank 2010 interagency climate change adaptation task force 2011 ipcc 2012 these extreme weather conditions cause severe drought and flood which can transport pollutants hirabayashi et al 2013 hence it is important to improve how the urban management sectors address the water associated challenges especially accelerated generation of pollutants and urban runoff in the environmental cycle barbosa et al 2012 eshtawi et al 2016 in the past decade low impact development lid practices have been proposed to deliver better hydrologic and environmental functions elliott and trowsdale 2007 hunt et al 2008 these practices have switched the focus of urban storm water drainage systems from using pipes to designing storage and infiltration us epa 2000 coffman 2002 cembrano et al 2004 cipolla et al 2016 kong et al 2017 prior to lid installation it is difficult to identify the effectiveness of lid in terms of how it retains the hydrological and environmental functions even after urban development ahiablame et al 2012a baek et al 2017 though lid practices have many advantages in the urban environment the management and installation of lid structures are often expensive elliott and trowsdale 2007 hence governments and research groups established guidelines for the efficient implementation of lid through modeling approaches which are useful in evaluating the lid performance with various urban management scenarios prez pedini et al 2005 elliott and trowsdale 2007 therefore numerical models have been used as analytical tools to provide hydrological and environmental information of lid

environmental protection agency us epa swmm has been widely used for analyzing lid performance because it is available as an open source software which can readily simulate lid practices elliott and trowsdale 2007 essential processes such as straining as well as decay or decomposition of pollutants and their attachment to particles in lid soil have to be simulated along with dilution which is the only process simulated in the swmm model this study attempted to overcome the limitations of the lid module in swmm specifically its simulations of water quality for lid the modified module was evaluated using the monitoring data of flow rate tss cod tn and tp from pilot scale lids in pyeongtaek south korea 37 03 00 7 n 127 03 04 3 e using the modified swmm model we tried to conduct lid

and 3 to apply lid scenario analysis under different climate change conditions the modified water quality module for lid in the swmm could increase the model accuracy and improve its performance in effect this would be beneficial for establishing new guidelines for urban stormwater management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites 2 1 1 pilot scale lid experiment for model evaluation fig 1 a we

study site to be used as a representative of the current status of the area without lid installation the effects of the lid system on the changes in the runoff volume and water quality were evaluated using the original and modified water quality modules which included the optimized water flow and water quality parameters from the urban subbasin 2 2 lid water quality simulation model modified swmm fig s2 a schematic diagram of the methodology for the urban watershed and lid simulation is shown in fig s2 the urban watershed simulation in epa swmm version 5 1 012 produced surface runoff rainfall and pollutant from the urban area fig s2 a fig s2 b shows that the lid simulation was divided into two modules hydrology module and water quality module the input for the hydrology module includes the simulated surface runoff and rainfall values from the area fig s2 c while the water quality module incorporates with the rainfall and the pollutant from the urban area fig s2 d the hydrology module produces the surface runoff infiltration and ponding depth from the lid fig s2 c this information is then transferred into the water quality module simulating the outflow concentration from lid fig s2 d after that the surface runoff and outflow concentration from lid are fed into the conduit in the urban watershed simulation the results of the modified and original lid modules were then evaluated by simulating two different bioretentions and one infiltration trench in which the flow and pollutant concentration were observed 2 2 1 hydrology module for lid simulation fig s2 a the hydrology

we conducted the ees sensitivity analysis using the safe toolbox sensitivity analysis for everybody in matlab pianosi et al 2015 2 3 2 model accuarcy our study evaluated the modified and original lid module using the pilot scale lid experimental data fig s1 a the rsr was employed to assess the model accuracy fukunaga et al 2015 amatya and jha 2011 this metric has been used to quantitatively describe the accuracy of the model moriasi et al 2007 10 r s r rmse stde v obs i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 where rmse is the root mean square error stde v obs is the standard

calibration was applied by coupling swmm with matlab the mathworks inc using the pattern searching algorithm the pattern search is one of the optimization methods that can find an optimal set with a systematic direct search method sahu et al 2015 in addition this algorithm is an efficient approach in finding an optimal parameter set with time series data cho et al 2011 baek et al 2015 park et al 2015 tables 1 and 2 summarizes the lid parameters for calibration based on the pattern searching algorithm lewis and virginia 2002 2 4 scenario analysis under climate change fig s1 b 2 4 1 changes in design factors for a lid system we conducted scenario analyses using the original and modified swmm for an urban subbasin under climate change scenarios both models were calibrated using the observed flow rate and tss for the urban subbasin in yongin city fig 1 b the rainfall events on 06 18 2013 and 08 29 2013 were used to calibrate and validate respectively table s2 summarizes the optimized hydrology and water quality parameters for the urban watershed simulation the model calibration of the urban subbasin was implemented based on the pattern search algorithm in matlab the mathworks inc the scenarios analysis was then applied to the optimized bioretention 1 bioretention 2 and infiltration trench fig 1 a from the pilot scale lid experiment the climate change scenarios were estimated by the intensity duration and frequency idf curves and huff s method as shown in fig s3 b lima et al 2016 huff 1967 furthermore the original and modified swmm simulated the total volume peak flow load and peak load by expanding lid application areas from 0 to 70 of the study areas fig s3 c 2 4 2 climate change scenarios fig s3 b in this study we used rainfall idf curves under the climate change to build the rainfall climate change scenarios that have been widely adopted in hydrologic and environmental stormwater management singh 1992 lima et al 2016 the idf curves combines the rainfall frequency and intensity by relying on different durations using the idf curves generated by lima et al 2016 based on future climate change scenarios we analyze the effect of lid on the flow rates and tss the selected climate change scenarios were historical scenarios and representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp 8 5 scenarios the temporal precipitation distribution was also essential for the climate change scenarios hence we applied huff s method to analyze the temporal change in precipitation intensity and generate the temporal distribution huff 1967 azli and rao 2010 baek et al 2015 based on these scenarios this study used the design storm of a two five and ten year return period in seoul south korea as well as the average rainfall duration and antecedent dry hours adh kim et al 2005 using the climate change data the scenario analysis was conducted to analyze the performance of lid in the urban subbasin 3 results and discussion 3 1 model sensitivity analysis fig 2 a presents the sensitivity analysis for the simulation of the hydrology module in lid in the hydrology module the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and wetting front suction head ψ had the largest mean ee values among all parameters fig 2 a the standard deviation of the ee values for both parameters were also greater than those of the other parameters this implies that these parameters strongly influenced not only the model output but also the interaction effect of the parameters saltelli et al 2008 the results can also be attributed to the substantial influence of k s and ψ on the infiltration rate into soil based on eq 1 since these parameters are related to the surface layer eq 1 we can infer that surface layer parameters are more sensitive than those related to the soil layer eq 2 the sensitivity result for the modified water quality module in lid are presented in fig 2 b in the figure the thickness of soil mixing zone d mix and the attachment rates at soil k a were shown to have larger means and standard deviations of ees compared to other parameters this implies that these parameters had considerable effects on the model output and more interactions with other parameters pyo et al 2017 since both parameters are related to the mechanism of pollutant attachment we can presume that this mechanism has a strong influence on the water quality module in lid at the soil mixing zone the straining coefficient k str has the lowest mean and standard deviation of ees k str was one of the factors used to describe the straining effect of pollutants via vegetation during infiltration the low values indicate that the straining effect of pollutants is not crucial to the water quality module 3 2 model evaluation in the pilot scale lid experiment 3 2 1 hydrology module fig 3 presents the temporal variation in the observed surface runoff and inflow of each lid e g bioretention 1 bioretention 2 and infiltration trench the same hydrologic modules were used in the modified swmm as in the original eqs 1 5 in the figure both simulated and observed surface runoff values were at zero when the ponding depths were below the berm heights of the respective lids surface runoff was initiated when the ponding depth reached the berm height which can be observed by the sudden increase of surface runoff values in the plots afterwhich the trend of the surface runoff in every plot was notably similar to the inflow indicating that the inflow can influence surface runoff rsr values of the simulation were calculated to evaluate the performance of each lid bioretention 1 and 2 yielded rsr values of less than 0 6 which is within the good criterion while the simulation for the infiltration trench was 0 7 implying that model performance was satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 these results signify acceptable performances and a good agreement between the observed and simulated surface flow moriasi et al 2007 the optimal parameters for hydrology module are presented in table 2 for bioretention 1 and 2 the hydrology module optimized similar values for all parameters these values are similar to the soil properties of sandy loam and loam rossman 2015 on the other hand infiltration trench has different parameter values compared to the bioretention lids infiltration trench has larger porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity values and smaller field capacity wilting point and suction head these results entail that the soil in the infiltration trench had different properties compared to bioretention 1 and 2 the parameter values were similar to the soil properties of gravel which has high permeability and porosity lewis and cheney 2006 3 2 2 water quality module figs 4 6 show the comparison between the observed pollutant values and the pollutant simulations of the swmm and modified swmm simulated pollutants of modified swmm showed a good agreement with the observations while the swmm overestimated its pollutant simulation the figures show that the three lids have similar simulation trends of the load variation with their respective load inflow this indicates that the load inflow has a high influence on the load outflow from bioretention and infiltration trench rsr values of the swmm for biorientation 1 were above 0 7 which is within the unsatisfactory performance range 0 7 while biorientation 2 performances were satisfactory 0 6 to 0 7 except tp 2 52 the cod and tn simulations for infiltration trench can be regarded as satisfactory 0 6 to 0 7 while tss and tp were unsatisfactory 0 7 although few simulation results showed acceptable performance ratings the results of bioretention 1 and 2 presented considerable overestimations of the pollutant on the other hand the results of the infiltration trench were relatively close to the observed values albeit showing a slightly exaggerated simulation these results may indicate that swmm does not have enough functions on the pollutant reduction effect by lid since this model only used the dilution effect by rainfall the modified swmm results for bioretention 1 were acceptable with rsr values of less than 0 6 excluding tn 0 73 moriasi et al 2007 fig 4 shows that the modified model underestimated the tn values when compared to the observations and swmm had more overestimated the tn value than modified model the water quality simulation showed a peak load when the load inflow was high and a decreasing load outflow when the load inflow was low for bioretention 2 in fig 5 the rsr values obtained by the model were less than 0 4 implying that the model performance rating can be regarded as very good moriasi et al 2007 the load outflow computed by the model showed instantaneous changes in the early stage of surface runoff since the load of the inflow was high before surface runoff began after which a decrease in the load outflow can be observed with decreasing load inflow after the start of surface runoff the modified model showed that the tn simulation had the lowest value of rsr among water quality variables where lower rsr values indicate better model performance moriasi et al 2007 on the other hand the original swmm had the lowest rsr value in the cod simulation of bioretention 2 although the simulated result was overestimated these results indicate that the modified model may be more suitable for tn simulation from bioretention in fig 6 the infiltration trench yielded rsr values of less than 0 7 which is within the satisfactory performance rating for pollutant modeling moriasi et al 2007 the tss and tn were slightly overestimated while cod and tp were slightly underestimated by the proposed model simulations this may arise because the model focuses on the pollutant straining effect by vegetation during infiltration and the attachment of pollutants to particles in the soil mixing zone these effects were more important for bioretention rather than infiltration trench functioning which relies on rapid infiltration maniquiz et al 2010 heilweil and watt 2011 the simulation of infiltration trench by swmm showed better results than other lid types e g bioretention 1 and 2 even though its results were overestimations when compared to the observations this discrepancy might result from the simple structure of the infiltration trench in swmm it consists of only one layer showing that it is simpler than in other lid types in this regard it can be assumed that vegetation had a weaker reduction effect on the infiltration trench as compared to its effects on other lids table 2 therefore developing an additional reduction function for an infiltration trench is recommended for future research in the tn simulation from lids the model performance of modified swmm was superior to that of the original an accurate tn estimate is important in urban areas because nitrogen could provoke algal blooms and degrade the water source cirmo and mcdonnell 1997 rabalais 2002 barco et al 2008 b mayer et al 2010 however the performance may vary depending on the lid types this variation can be due to several factors affecting nitrogen concentrations vegetation soil type and lid nitrogen circulating in the atmosphere soil water and ecosystems can be converted into multiple chemical forms as shown by the nitrogen cycle steven and steven 2004 kuypers et al 2011 table 2 summarizes each pollutant parameter of the water quality module for bioretention 1 bioretention 2 and infiltration trench the water quality module for bioretention 1 and 2 had similar parameter values based on the type of pollutant however a different set of optimized parameter values were obtained for the infiltration trench we applied a larger kstr and a smaller ka to the infiltration trench while bioretention lids applied smaller kstr and larger ka values in addition the dmix of the infiltration trench was much smaller than that of bioretention lids these parameter sets indicate that bioretention was strongly affected by pollutant attachment to soil particles in the mixing zone while the infiltration trench was sensitive to the straining effect on the pollutant transport the decay rate values were low considering that all lid types had similar values and the target pollutant type also did not significantly affect the decay rate table 2 this reveals that the decay effect was ineffective at reducing pollutants in lid because the lid had a short retention time due to its small dimensions bioretention 1 and the infiltration trench have a width of 2 00 m and a length of 2 24 m while bioretention 2 has a width of 1 00 m and a length of 1 24 m the berm height of all lids is 10 cm table s1 the decay approach cannot be simulated in detail which differs from nitrification mineralization and pollutant removal by plant and microorganism in order to consider these detailed degradation processes of the pollutant in the lid model we need to have more data of the pollutant products e g nh4 no3 organic and inorganic suspended solids as well as additional parameters our study adopted the decay function in the model to simulate the pollutant degradation without considering these degradation products this indicates that this model did not require the pollutant product data and additional parameters previous studies have utilized a simple decay equation for tss zawilski and sakson 2008 crobeddu and bennis 2011 wong et al 2006 cod temprano et al 2006 tn and tp fletcher et al 2002 wong et al 2002 wong et al 2006 therefore the function was found to be convenient and versatile in simulating various pollutants al et al 2018 park et al 2015 3 3 scenario analysis under the climate change 3 3 1 model calibration fig s4 shows the observed and simulated flow rates and fig s5 shows the observed and simulated total suspended solids the flowrates and suspended solids simulations for both rainfall events showed good performance with rsr values of less than 0 6 the simulated peak flow and load were slightly lower than their respective observed values previous studies have shown that the peak flow and total suspended solids are substantially underestimated by swmm barco et al 2008 baek et al 2015 3 3 2 lid implementation on hydrology under the historical scenarios and rcp 8 5 the total volume and peak flow of the base case without lids and the seven lid scenarios 10 70 are presented in fig 7 and fig s6 8 table s3 summarizes the conditions of each rainfall scenario kim et al 2005 lima et al 2016 the historical rainfall volume of a 2 year return period was slightly larger than rcp scenarios in contrast the rcp 8 5 has a larger rainfall volume for the 5 year and 10 year return period as compared to the historical scenario these discrepancies might be caused by the extreme precipitation events caused by climate change kunkel et al 2013 these extreme events made a difference in the rainfall volumes between the historical and rcp 8 5 scenarios in the base case as the return period increased the total volume and peak flow steadily increased as well the historical and rcp 8 5 under 2 year return period produced similar values of the total volume and peak flow while the rcp 8 5 under 5 year and 10 year return period produced higher values of the total volume and peak flow than those from the historical scenarios among lids under the historical scenarios and rcp 8 5 the infiltration trench showed a high reduction capacity in terms of total volume because the infiltration trench has high k s and k slope values that can increase the infiltration rate table 2 the peak flow and the reduction trend of bioretention 1 and 2 showed similar patterns since both bioretention lids have similar k s and k slope values that are lower than those of infiltration trench table 2 in this regard the reduction effect of bioretention lids under all scenarios are lower compared to infiltration trench as shown in fig 7 and fig s6 s8 both historical scenarios and rcp 8 5 for the 2 year return period generated similar trends and values of the total volume and peak flow for all lid sizes meanwhile rcp 8 5 generated higher values of the total volume and peak flow than those of the historical scenarios for the 5 year and 10 year return periods these discrepancies were caused by the differences in rainfall volumes between the three return periods wherein the 2 year return period has the smallest difference between the scenarios followed respectively by the 5 year and 10 year return periods although the rainfall volume and duration obtained by huff s method huff 1967 were the same the huff 3rd and 4th quartiles fig s7 8 showed a higher increased in total flow and peak flow from lid than the huff 1st and 2nd fig 7 and fig s6 however the differences of the total flow between the huff s quartiles were not significant this may indicate that the peak flow was considerably influenced by the rainfall temporal variability 3 3 3 lid implementation on water quality figs 8 and 9 and fig s9 s12 present the total load and peak load of the base case without lids and the seven lid scenarios 10 70 under the historical scenarios and rcp 8 5 in contrast to the result of the total volume and peak flow the total load and peak load in the base case showed a negligible difference between historical scenarios and rcp 8 5 this is due to the constant amount of pollutants present in the urban area even when the rainfall volume increased with respect to each scenario the surface pollutants in the urban area accumulated logarithmically on dry days rossman and huber 2016 using the build up function in swmm the maximum amount of pollutant was calculated by estimating the urban surface accumulation of dust and dirt rossman and huber 2016 the results of the water quality simulations of lid revealed that the total and peak load from the historical and rcp 8 5 scenarios did not show significant differences this was because the maximum amount of the pollutant may not have been influenced by rainfall properties in the swmm simulations of lid scenarios the total load and peak load significantly decreased with increasing lid coverage from the base case at 0 until 20 fig 8 fig s9 10 from the lid coverage of 20 to 70 the reduction effect for total load and peak load remained unchanged the simulation results did not present a significant difference between lid types as the percentage of each lid area increased fig s13 16 and was weakly affected by the temporal rainfall distribution depending on huff s quantile fig 8 fig s9 10 this is may be due to the swmm limitation which lacks appropriate reduction functions for water quality in lid for the modified swmm simulation results the total load and peak load decreased with increasing lid size fig 10 fig s11 12 the bioretention 1 and 2 had a greater reduction effect for the total load and peak load compared to the relatively weak reduction effect of the infiltration trench fig s13 16 these discrepancies were due to the bioretention lids having higher values of the soil mixing zone thickness and the attachment rates of pollutants in the soil table 3 the total load and peak load of bioretention 1 and 2 decreased as the number of the huff s quartile and lid proportion increased fig 9 fig s11 on the other hand the discharge from urban area decreased while the pollutant concentration from urban area increased when the number of huff s quartile was increased in the initial period of rainfall event sansalone and buchberger 1997 obermann et al 2009 therefore the reduction effect can be greater in huff s 3rd and 4th quartiles compared to the other quartiles fig s13 16 this is because a small discharge causes to extend the retention time of pollutants in the lid thereby increasing the reduction effect for pollutants in the lid all lids showed a substantial reduction effect in terms of total as well as peak loads even though the lid size was only 10 of the study site in this regard this result was able to demonstrate that the urban pollutant reduction effect might require a smaller lid size compared to reducing the total volume and peak flow in addition some researchers have suggested that a relatively small facility size can improve water quality guo and urbonas 2002 kim and han 2010 baek et al 2015 the simulation results of the modified swmm were sensitive to the types and sizes of lids as well as the temporal distribution of rainfall while the results of the original swmm were relatively insensitive to these parameters this illustrates that the original swmm has limitations in providing detailed and accurate pollutant transport data in response to various lid conditions and rainfall patterns since important fate and transport process simulations are absent 4 conclusions in this study we modified the water quality module in swmm to improve the effects of lid on water quality we evaluated the performance of the enhanced lid module for simulating water quality and conducted a scenario analysis under different climate change conditions the major findings of this study are listed below 1 the sensitivity analysis determined that the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and suction head ψ were the most influential parameters for the hydrology module in the modified swmm on the other hand the thickness of the soil mixing zone d m i x and the soil attachment rates k a were the most sensitive parameters for the water quality module in the modified swmm the hydrology and water quality modules in lid successfully estimated the surface runoff and pollutants respectively these results were in good agreement with observations the lid water quality simulation of the modified swmm was superior to swmm when compared to the observed data 2 the modified swmm demonstrated that bioretention is strongly influenced by the attachment of pollutants to soil particles in the mixing zone while infiltration is sensitive to the straining effect on the pollutants decay did not have a substantial effect in reducing the amount of pollutants via bioretention and infiltration trench because the lids had a short retention time due to their small size 3 scenario analysis under the climate change conditions showed that the hydrological results varied depending on the rainfall scenarios whereas the water quality results were significantly influenced by the temporal distribution of rainfall the modified lid module proposed in this study improved water quality simulation of lid compared to the original module in swmm since the modified module can generate reasonable water quality simulations this modified swmm can be applied to develop effective strategies for better urban water sustainability and management it can also be useful in planning lid facilities and in formulating guidelines for lid installation 5 software availability program name modified lid water quality module in swmm developers unist ulsan national

5487,the rapid increase of impervious area and climate change greatly affect the hydrological environmental and ecological system at the local regional and global scales these phenomena can increase the peak flow and surface runoff carrying anthropogenic pollutants thereby severely deteriorating the water quality of the surface waters low impact development lid practices have been proposed as a promising urban management methodology to mitigate these environmental issues numerical models have been increasingly utilized as an analyzing tool for evaluating the lid performance however lid associated numerical models are oversimplified in terms of water quality simulation by only considering the dilution effect by rainfall in lids this study resolved this challenge by modifying the water quality module of lid in the stormwater management model swmm we evaluated the module performance for simulating total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp of the lid facilities using the developed model we conducted the lid scenario analysis under the climate change scenarios the scenario analysis was applied in the urban area which focused on flow rate and tss the modified module provided accurate results for pollutant simulations yielding an average value of root mean square error observation standard deviation ratio rsr of 0 52 while the original module showed an unacceptable performance with an rsr value of 1 11 scenario analysis showed that the hydrological outputs were sensitive to the volume of rainfall while the water quality results were sensitive to the temporal distribution of rainfall based on these statements the modified water quality module in lid developed in this study will be useful in designing lid facilities and in formulating guidelines for lid installation keywords low impact development storm water management model water quality climate change 1 introduction rampant urbanization greatly increases impervious areas thereby generating urban stormwater runoff with anthropogenic pollutants which can lead to severe water quality deterioration davis and mccuen 2005 kayhanian et al 2012 barbosa et al 2012 the increasing area of impervious cover can also affect the hydrological environmental and ecological system at the local regional and global scales gao et al 2003 shi et al 2016 in addition climate change has a huge impact on urban areas due to higher temperatures and the increasing occurrence of extreme precipitation events predicted in the near future douglas and fairbank 2010 interagency climate change adaptation task force 2011 ipcc 2012 these extreme weather conditions cause severe drought and flood which can transport pollutants hirabayashi et al 2013 hence it is important to improve how the urban management sectors address the water associated challenges especially accelerated generation of pollutants and urban runoff in the environmental cycle barbosa et al 2012 eshtawi et al 2016 in the past decade low impact development lid practices have been proposed to deliver better hydrologic and environmental functions elliott and trowsdale 2007 hunt et al 2008 these practices have switched the focus of urban storm water drainage systems from using pipes to designing storage and infiltration us epa 2000 coffman 2002 cembrano et al 2004 cipolla et al 2016 kong et al 2017 prior to lid installation it is difficult to identify the effectiveness of lid in terms of how it retains the hydrological and environmental functions even after urban development ahiablame et al 2012a baek et al 2017 though lid practices have many advantages in the urban environment the management and installation of lid structures are often expensive elliott and trowsdale 2007 hence governments and research groups established guidelines for the efficient implementation of lid through modeling approaches which are useful in evaluating the lid performance with various urban management scenarios prez pedini et al 2005 elliott and trowsdale 2007 therefore numerical models have been used as analytical tools to provide hydrological and environmental information of lid with limited urban water management funds prez pedini et al 2005 her et al 2017 pyo et al 2017 baek et al 2017 several research groups have developed numerical models to simulate lid processes e g swmm rossman 2015 sustain lee et al 2012 wwhm beyerlein 2011 and l thia lid ahiablame et al 2012b the swmm and sustain models apply the green ampt equation and a dilution effect for a hydrologic process and water quality simulation respectively rossman 2015 lee et al 2012 the wwhm model uses the darcy equation for lid hydrologic simulations it also utilizes a dilution effect and a first order decay for lid water quality simulations beyerlein 2011 the l thia lid model simulates hydrologic lid processes using the cn method and pollutant transport with the emc method ahiablame et al 2012b these models can simulate the effects of lid on the hydrological processes and have also been widely applied to evaluate pollution reduction in urban areas elliott and trowsdale 2007 ackerman and stein 2008 elliot et al 2009 li et al 2019 ja et al 2014 the lid modeling tools need to be further improved for effective management of urban environments elliott and trowsdale 2007 united states environmental protection agency us epa swmm has been widely used for analyzing lid performance because it is available as an open source software which can readily simulate lid practices elliott and trowsdale 2007 essential processes such as straining as well as decay or decomposition of pollutants and their attachment to particles in lid soil have to be simulated along with dilution which is the only process simulated in the swmm model this study attempted to overcome the limitations of the lid module in swmm specifically its simulations of water quality for lid the modified module was evaluated using the monitoring data of flow rate tss cod tn and tp from pilot scale lids in pyeongtaek south korea 37 03 00 7 n 127 03 04 3 e using the modified swmm model we tried to conduct lid scenario analysis under several climate change conditions in the urban area in yongin south korea 37 14 07 6 n 127 12 22 2 e the scenario analysis was applied by using the monitoring data of flow rate and tss the specific objectives of this study were 1 to conduct sensitivity analysis of the modified and original lid modules 2 to evaluate lid simulations based on the modified and original modules and 3 to apply lid scenario analysis under different climate change conditions the modified water quality module for lid in the swmm could increase the model accuracy and improve its performance in effect this would be beneficial for establishing new guidelines for urban stormwater management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites 2 1 1 pilot scale lid experiment for model evaluation fig 1 a we selected two different bioretentions and one infiltration trench to evaluate the hydrology and water quality simulations of the lid model tss cod tn and tp were used for the model evaluation of the water quality simulation these lids were constructed in a new town at pyeongtaek south korea 37 03 00 7 n 127 03 04 3 e fig 1 a for bioretention 1 the depth of soil layer storage layer and berm height were 20 0 cm 40 0 cm and 10 0 cm respectively bioretention 1 has a width of 2 00 m and length of 2 24 m on the other hand bioretention 2 has a soil layer depth storage layer depth and berm height of 20 0 cm 20 0 cm and 10 0 cm respectively it has dimensions of 1 0 m wide and 1 24 m long meanwhile the infiltration trench has a 40 0 cm storage layer depth and 10 0 cm berm height with dimensions of 2 0 m and 2 24 m for width and length respectively table s1 bioretentions 1 and 2 have vegetable soil and gravel as the media for the soil and storage layers while infiltration trench has gravel for the storage layer only in this study we conducted the infiltration experiment for the native soil using the guelph permeameter soilmoisture equipment corp which can measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil artificial inflow was collected from the road during rainfall events was then used for model evaluation flow tss cod tn and tp were monitored in the inflow and outflow flow measurements of the inflow and outflow were manually conducted based on the bucket method with 5 min interval trimmer 1994 tss was analyzed based on the apha method american public health association 1992 cod was conducted with the manganese iii reactor digestion method using humas water analyzer humas korea tn and tp analysis adopted the brucine method and ascorbic acid method respectively using humas water analyzer humas korea water samples were also collected at the sampling sites and were stored in polyethylene bottles for water quality analysis these water samples were transferred to the laboratory in both points of inflow and outflow the first grab sample was collected as soon as the discharge provoked and we acquired the sample with 5 min interval until stopping the discharge 2 1 2 urban subbasin for scenario analysis under climate change fig 1 b we selected an urban area located in yongin city 37 14 07 6 n 127 12 22 2 e fig 1 b one of the small and medium cities in south korea scenario analysis was applied by implementing climate change scenarios and performing tss simulations this site has an area of 0 0237 km2 with commercial and residential as the dominant land use which consists of offices residential buildings and restaurants runoff and tss from the urban area were monitored at the end of the drainage pipe we measured the runoff volume during the rainfall events on june 18 2013 and august 29 2013 using a flo tote 3 flowmeter usa at 1 min intervals water samples from the sampling sites were manually collected at the 5th 10th 20th and 60th minute and stored in polyethylene bottles these water samples were transferred to the laboratory tss was quantified based on the apha method american public health association 1992 the swmm model was calibrated for this study site to be used as a representative of the current status of the area without lid installation the effects of the lid system on the changes in the runoff volume and water quality were evaluated using the original and modified water quality modules which included the optimized water flow and water quality parameters from the urban subbasin 2 2 lid water quality simulation model modified swmm fig s2 a schematic diagram of the methodology for the urban watershed and lid simulation is shown in fig s2 the urban watershed simulation in epa swmm version 5 1 012 produced surface runoff rainfall and pollutant from the urban area fig s2 a fig s2 b shows that the lid simulation was divided into two modules hydrology module and water quality module the input for the hydrology module includes the simulated surface runoff and rainfall values from the area fig s2 c while the water quality module incorporates with the rainfall and the pollutant from the urban area fig s2 d the hydrology module produces the surface runoff infiltration and ponding depth from the lid fig s2 c this information is then transferred into the water quality module simulating the outflow concentration from lid fig s2 d after that the surface runoff and outflow concentration from lid are fed into the conduit in the urban watershed simulation the results of the modified and original lid modules were then evaluated by simulating two different bioretentions and one infiltration trench in which the flow and pollutant concentration were observed 2 2 1 hydrology module for lid simulation fig s2 a the hydrology module adopted the lid module in epa swmm version 5 1 012 for simulating the hydrologic performance of lid rossman and huber 2016 lid simulation includes a surface layer soil layer and storage layer

evaluation 2 3 1 sensitivity analysis we conducted the sensitivity analysis of the model using the elementary effects ees analysis morris et al 2014 this method has been established as an effective approach in terms of quantifying the effect of the interactions between parameters for nonlinear models saltelli et al 2008 morris et al 2014 the ees of the i th simulation is expressed as follows morris et al 2014 9 e e i y x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x k y x 1 x 2 x k δ where y is the new outcome y is the original outcome and δ is the increment depending on the range of x i the mean value of ees describes the level of influence by each parameter on the model output while standard deviation shows the existing interaction between parameters saltelli et al 2008 detailed explanations of the ees analysis are published in morris et al 2014 and saltelli et al 2008 the parameter ranges were obtained from previous literatures for the auto calibration and sensitivity analysis of hydrology and water quality modules rossman 2015 negev 2012 yang et al 2010 debele et al 2008 almasri et al 2007 simunek et al 2005 tables 1 and 2 these range was applied to each pollutant in each lid in this study we conducted the ees sensitivity analysis using the safe toolbox sensitivity analysis for everybody in matlab pianosi et al 2015 2 3 2 model accuarcy our study evaluated the modified and original lid module using the pilot scale lid experimental data fig s1 a the rsr was employed to assess the model accuracy fukunaga et al 2015 amatya and jha 2011 this metric has been used to quantitatively

calibration was applied by coupling swmm with matlab the mathworks inc using the pattern searching algorithm the pattern search is one of the optimization methods that can find an optimal set with a systematic direct search method sahu et al 2015 in addition this algorithm is an efficient approach in finding an optimal parameter set with time series data cho et al 2011 baek et al 2015 park et al 2015 tables 1 and 2 summarizes the lid parameters for calibration based on the pattern searching algorithm lewis and virginia 2002 2 4 scenario analysis under climate change fig s1 b 2 4 1 changes in design factors for a lid system we conducted scenario analyses using the original and modified swmm for an urban subbasin under climate change scenarios both models were calibrated using the observed flow rate and tss for the urban subbasin in yongin city fig 1 b the rainfall events on 06 18 2013 and 08 29 2013 were used to calibrate and validate respectively table s2 summarizes the optimized hydrology and water quality parameters for the urban watershed simulation the model calibration of the urban subbasin was implemented based on the pattern search algorithm in matlab the mathworks inc the scenarios analysis was then applied to the optimized bioretention 1 bioretention 2 and infiltration trench fig 1 a from the pilot scale lid experiment the climate change scenarios were estimated by the intensity duration and frequency idf curves and huff s method as shown in fig s3 b lima et al 2016 huff 1967 furthermore the original and modified swmm simulated the total volume peak flow load and peak load by expanding lid application areas from 0 to 70 of the study areas fig s3 c 2 4 2 climate change scenarios fig s3 b in this study we used rainfall idf curves under the climate change to build the rainfall climate change scenarios that have been widely adopted in hydrologic and environmental stormwater management singh 1992 lima et al 2016 the idf curves combines the rainfall frequency and intensity by relying on different durations using the idf curves generated by lima et al 2016 based on future climate change scenarios we analyze the effect of lid on the flow rates and tss the selected climate change scenarios were historical scenarios and representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp 8 5 scenarios the temporal precipitation distribution was also essential for the climate change scenarios hence we applied huff s method to analyze the temporal change in precipitation intensity and generate the temporal distribution huff 1967 azli and rao 2010 baek et al 2015 based on these scenarios this study used the design storm of a two five and ten year return period in seoul south korea as well as the average rainfall duration and antecedent dry hours adh kim et al 2005 using the climate change data the scenario analysis was conducted to analyze the performance of lid in the urban subbasin 3 results and discussion 3 1 model sensitivity analysis fig 2 a presents the sensitivity analysis for the simulation of the hydrology module in lid in the hydrology module the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and wetting front suction head ψ had the largest mean ee values among all parameters fig 2 a the standard deviation of the ee values for both parameters were also greater than those of the other parameters this implies that these parameters strongly influenced not only the model output but also the interaction effect of the parameters saltelli et al 2008 the results can also be attributed to the substantial influence of k s and ψ on the infiltration rate into soil based on eq 1 since these parameters are related to the surface layer eq 1 we can infer that surface layer parameters are more sensitive than those related to the soil layer eq 2 the sensitivity result for the modified water quality module in lid are presented in fig 2 b in the figure the thickness of soil mixing zone d mix and the attachment rates at soil k a were shown to have larger means and standard deviations of ees compared to other parameters this implies that these parameters had considerable effects on the model output and more interactions with other parameters pyo et al 2017 since both parameters are related to the mechanism of pollutant attachment we can presume that this mechanism has a strong influence on the water quality module in lid at the soil mixing zone the straining coefficient k str has the lowest mean and standard deviation of ees k str was one of the factors used to describe the straining effect of pollutants via vegetation during infiltration the low values indicate that the straining effect of pollutants is not crucial to the water quality module 3 2 model evaluation in the pilot scale lid experiment 3 2 1 hydrology module fig 3 presents the temporal variation in the observed surface runoff and inflow of each lid e g bioretention 1 bioretention 2 and infiltration trench the same hydrologic modules were used in the modified swmm as in the original eqs 1 5 in the figure both simulated and observed surface runoff values were at zero when the ponding depths were below the berm heights of the respective lids surface runoff was initiated when the ponding depth reached the berm height which can be observed by the sudden increase of surface runoff values in the plots afterwhich the trend of the surface runoff in every plot was notably similar to the inflow indicating that the inflow can influence surface runoff rsr values of the simulation were calculated to evaluate the performance of each lid bioretention 1 and 2 yielded rsr values of less than 0 6 which is within the good criterion while the simulation for the infiltration trench was 0 7 implying that model performance was satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 these results signify acceptable performances and a good agreement between the observed and simulated surface flow moriasi et al 2007 the optimal parameters for hydrology module are presented in table 2 for bioretention 1 and 2 the hydrology module optimized similar values for all parameters these values are similar to the soil properties of sandy loam and loam rossman 2015 on the other hand infiltration trench has different parameter values compared to the bioretention lids infiltration trench has larger porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity values and smaller field capacity wilting point and suction head these results entail that the soil in the infiltration trench had different properties compared to bioretention 1 and 2 the parameter values were similar to the soil properties of gravel which has high permeability and porosity lewis and cheney 2006 3 2 2 water quality module figs 4 6 show the comparison between the observed pollutant values and the pollutant simulations of the swmm and modified swmm simulated pollutants of modified swmm showed a good agreement with the observations while the swmm overestimated its pollutant simulation the figures show that the three lids have similar simulation trends of the load variation with their respective load inflow this indicates that the load inflow has a high influence on the load outflow from bioretention and infiltration trench rsr values of the swmm for biorientation 1 were above 0 7 which is within the unsatisfactory performance range 0 7 while biorientation 2 performances were satisfactory 0 6 to 0 7 except tp 2 52 the cod and tn simulations for infiltration trench can be regarded as satisfactory 0 6 to 0 7 while tss and tp were unsatisfactory 0 7 although few simulation results showed acceptable performance ratings the results of bioretention 1 and 2 presented considerable overestimations of the pollutant on the other hand the results of the infiltration trench were relatively close to the observed values albeit showing a slightly exaggerated simulation these results may indicate that swmm does not have enough functions on the pollutant reduction effect by lid since this model only used the dilution effect by rainfall the modified swmm results for bioretention 1 were acceptable with rsr values of less than 0 6 excluding tn 0 73 moriasi et al 2007 fig 4 shows that the modified model underestimated the tn values when compared to the observations and swmm had more overestimated the tn value than modified model the water quality simulation showed a peak load when the load inflow was high and a decreasing load outflow when the load inflow was low for bioretention 2 in fig 5 the rsr values obtained by the model were less than 0 4 implying that the model performance rating can be regarded as very good moriasi et al 2007 the load outflow computed by the model showed instantaneous changes in the early stage of surface runoff since the load of the inflow was high before surface runoff began after which a decrease in the load outflow can be observed with decreasing load inflow after the start of surface runoff the modified model showed that the tn simulation had the lowest value of rsr among water quality variables where lower rsr values indicate better model performance moriasi et al 2007 on the other hand the original swmm had the lowest rsr value in the cod simulation of bioretention 2 although the simulated result was overestimated these results indicate that the modified model may be more suitable for tn simulation from bioretention in fig 6 the infiltration trench yielded rsr values of less than 0 7 which is within the satisfactory performance rating for pollutant modeling moriasi et al 2007 the tss and tn were slightly overestimated while cod and tp were slightly underestimated by the proposed model simulations this may arise because the model focuses on the pollutant straining effect by vegetation during infiltration and the attachment of pollutants to particles in the soil mixing zone these effects were more important for bioretention rather than infiltration trench functioning which relies on rapid infiltration maniquiz et al 2010 heilweil and watt 2011 the simulation of infiltration trench by swmm showed better results than other lid types e g bioretention 1 and 2 even though its results were overestimations when compared to the observations this discrepancy might result from the simple structure of the infiltration trench in swmm it consists of only one layer showing that it is simpler than in other lid types in this regard it can be assumed that vegetation had a weaker reduction effect on the infiltration trench as compared to its effects on other lids table 2 therefore developing an additional reduction function for an infiltration trench is recommended for future research in the tn simulation from lids the model performance of modified swmm was superior to that of the original an accurate tn estimate is important in urban areas because nitrogen could provoke algal blooms and degrade the water source cirmo and mcdonnell 1997 rabalais 2002 barco et al 2008 b mayer et al 2010 however the performance may vary depending on the lid types this variation can be due to several factors affecting nitrogen concentrations vegetation soil type and lid nitrogen circulating in the atmosphere soil water and ecosystems can be converted into multiple chemical forms as shown by the nitrogen cycle steven and steven 2004 kuypers et al 2011 table 2 summarizes each pollutant parameter of the water quality module for bioretention 1 bioretention 2 and infiltration trench the water quality module for bioretention 1 and 2 had similar parameter values based on the type of pollutant however a different set of optimized parameter values were obtained for the infiltration trench we applied a larger kstr and a smaller ka to the infiltration trench while bioretention lids applied smaller kstr and larger ka values in addition the dmix of the infiltration trench was much smaller than that of bioretention lids these parameter sets indicate that bioretention was strongly affected by pollutant attachment to soil particles in the mixing zone while the infiltration trench was sensitive to the straining effect on the pollutant transport the decay rate values were low considering that all lid types had similar values and the target pollutant type also did not significantly affect the decay rate table 2 this reveals that the decay effect was ineffective at reducing pollutants in lid because the lid had a short retention time due to its small dimensions bioretention 1 and the infiltration trench have a width of 2 00 m and a length of 2 24 m while bioretention 2 has a width of 1 00 m and a length of 1 24 m the berm height of all lids is 10 cm table s1 the decay approach cannot be simulated in detail which differs from nitrification mineralization and pollutant removal by plant and microorganism in order to consider these detailed degradation processes of the pollutant in the lid model we need to have more data of the pollutant products e g nh4 no3 organic and inorganic suspended solids as well as additional parameters our study adopted the decay function in the model to simulate the pollutant degradation without considering these degradation products this indicates that this model did not require the pollutant product data and additional parameters previous studies have utilized a simple decay equation for tss zawilski and sakson 2008 crobeddu and bennis 2011 wong et al 2006 cod temprano et al 2006 tn and tp fletcher et al 2002 wong et al 2002 wong et al 2006 therefore the function was found to be convenient and versatile in simulating various pollutants al et al 2018 park et al 2015 3 3 scenario analysis under the climate change 3 3 1 model calibration fig s4 shows the observed and simulated flow rates and fig s5 shows the observed and simulated total suspended solids the flowrates and suspended solids simulations for both rainfall events showed good performance with rsr values of less than 0 6 the simulated peak flow and load were slightly lower than their respective observed values previous studies have shown that the peak flow and total suspended solids are substantially underestimated by swmm barco et al 2008 baek et al 2015 3 3 2 lid implementation on hydrology under the historical scenarios and rcp 8 5 the total volume and peak flow of the base case without lids and the seven lid scenarios 10 70 are presented in fig 7 and fig s6 8 table s3 summarizes the conditions of each rainfall scenario kim et al 2005 lima et al 2016 the historical rainfall volume of a 2 year return period was slightly larger than rcp scenarios in contrast the rcp 8 5 has a larger rainfall volume for the 5 year and 10 year return period as compared to the historical scenario these discrepancies might be caused by the extreme precipitation events caused by climate change kunkel et al 2013 these extreme events made a difference in the rainfall volumes between the historical and rcp 8 5 scenarios in the base case as the return period increased the total volume and peak flow steadily increased as well the historical and rcp 8 5 under 2 year return period produced similar values of the total volume and peak flow while the rcp 8 5 under 5 year and 10 year return period produced higher values of the total volume and peak flow than those from the historical scenarios among lids under the historical scenarios and rcp 8 5 the infiltration trench showed a high reduction capacity in terms of total volume because the infiltration trench has high k s and k slope values that can increase the infiltration rate table 2 the peak flow and the reduction trend of bioretention 1 and 2 showed similar patterns since both bioretention lids have similar k s and k slope values that are lower than those of infiltration trench table 2 in this regard the reduction effect of bioretention lids under all scenarios are lower compared to infiltration trench as shown in fig 7 and fig s6 s8 both historical scenarios and rcp 8 5 for the 2 year return period generated similar trends and values of the total volume and peak flow for all lid sizes meanwhile rcp 8 5 generated higher values of the total volume and peak flow than those of the historical scenarios for the 5 year and 10 year return periods these discrepancies were caused by the differences in rainfall volumes between the three return periods wherein the 2 year return period has the smallest difference between the scenarios followed respectively by the 5 year and 10 year return periods although the rainfall volume and duration obtained by huff s method huff 1967 were the same the huff 3rd and 4th quartiles fig s7 8 showed a higher increased in total flow and peak flow from lid than the huff 1st and 2nd fig 7 and fig s6 however the differences of the total flow between the huff s quartiles were not significant this may indicate that the peak flow was considerably influenced by the rainfall temporal variability 3 3 3 lid implementation on water quality figs 8 and 9 and fig s9 s12 present the total load and peak load of the base case without lids and the seven lid scenarios 10 70 under the historical scenarios and rcp 8 5 in contrast to the result of the total volume and peak flow the total load and peak load in the base case showed a negligible difference between historical scenarios and rcp 8 5 this is due to the constant amount of pollutants present in the urban area even when the rainfall volume increased with respect to each scenario the surface pollutants in the urban area accumulated logarithmically on dry days rossman and huber 2016 using the build up function in swmm the maximum amount of pollutant was calculated by estimating the urban surface accumulation of dust and dirt rossman and huber 2016 the results of the water quality simulations of lid revealed that the total and peak load from the historical and rcp 8 5 scenarios did not show significant differences this was because the maximum amount of the pollutant may not have been influenced by rainfall properties in the swmm simulations of lid scenarios the total load and peak load significantly decreased with increasing lid coverage from the base case at 0 until 20 fig 8 fig s9 10 from the lid coverage of 20 to 70 the reduction effect for total load and peak load remained unchanged the simulation results did not present a significant difference between lid types as the percentage of each lid area increased fig s13 16 and was weakly affected by the temporal rainfall distribution depending on huff s quantile fig 8 fig s9 10 this is may be due to the swmm limitation which lacks appropriate reduction functions for water quality in lid for the modified swmm simulation results the total load and peak load decreased with increasing lid size fig 10 fig s11 12 the bioretention 1 and 2 had a greater reduction effect for the total load and peak load compared to the relatively weak reduction effect of the infiltration trench fig s13 16 these discrepancies were due to the bioretention lids having higher values of the soil mixing zone thickness and the attachment rates of pollutants in the soil table 3 the total load and peak load of bioretention 1 and 2 decreased as the number of the huff s quartile and lid proportion increased fig 9 fig s11 on the other hand the discharge from urban area decreased while the pollutant concentration from urban area increased when the number of huff s quartile was increased in the initial period of rainfall event sansalone and buchberger 1997 obermann et al 2009 therefore the reduction effect can be greater in huff s 3rd and 4th quartiles compared to the other quartiles fig s13 16 this is because a small discharge causes to extend the retention time of pollutants in the lid thereby increasing the reduction effect for pollutants in the lid all lids showed a substantial reduction effect in terms of total as well as peak loads even though the lid size was only 10 of the study site in this regard this result was able to demonstrate that the urban pollutant reduction effect might require a smaller lid size compared to reducing the total volume and peak flow in addition some researchers have suggested that a relatively small facility size can improve water quality guo and urbonas 2002 kim and han 2010 baek et al 2015 the simulation results of the modified swmm were sensitive to the types and sizes of lids as well as the temporal distribution of rainfall while the results of the original swmm were relatively insensitive to these parameters this illustrates that the original swmm has limitations in providing detailed and accurate pollutant transport data in response to various lid conditions and rainfall patterns since important fate and transport process simulations are absent 4 conclusions in this study we modified the water quality module in swmm to improve the effects of lid on water quality we evaluated the performance of the enhanced lid module for simulating water quality and conducted a scenario analysis under different climate change conditions the major findings of this study are listed below 1 the sensitivity analysis determined that the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and suction head ψ were the most influential parameters for the hydrology module in the modified swmm on the other hand the thickness of the soil mixing zone d m i x and the soil attachment rates k a were the most sensitive parameters for the water quality module in the modified swmm the hydrology and water quality modules in lid successfully estimated the surface runoff and pollutants respectively these results were in good agreement with observations the lid water quality simulation of the modified swmm was superior to swmm when compared to the observed data 2 the modified swmm demonstrated that bioretention is strongly influenced by the attachment of pollutants to soil particles in the mixing zone while infiltration is sensitive to the straining effect on the pollutants decay did not have a substantial effect in reducing the amount of pollutants via bioretention and infiltration trench because the lids had a short retention time due to their small size 3 scenario analysis under the climate change conditions showed that the hydrological results varied depending on the rainfall scenarios whereas the water quality results were significantly influenced by the temporal distribution of rainfall the modified lid module proposed in this study improved water quality simulation of lid compared to the original module in swmm since the modified module can generate reasonable water quality simulations this modified swmm can be applied to develop effective strategies for better urban water sustainability and management it can also be useful in planning lid facilities and in formulating guidelines for lid installation 5 software availability program name modified lid water quality module in swmm developers unist ulsan national

in kashan plain aquifer kpa evolution of hydrogeochemical facies in kpa is ca hco3 19 04 mix ca cl and ca cl 9 52 mix na cl and na cl 72 26 based on the hfe m the isotopic composition of δ2h and δ18o varies from 8 38 to 6 48 with average of 4 49 for δ18o and 57 09 to 22 68 with average of 40 28 for δ2h the fresh and saline groundwater samples were plotted near the gmwl with a minor shift towards more enriched values indicating that the present meteoric water is the main origin of groundwater in the study area intrusion from salt lake and saltpan was rejected by ionic ratios and stable isotopes approaches further geophysical investigations ruled out contributions from the nasr abad salt dome as it is buried at about 480 m depth underneath the kpa in addition the radioisotopes results 3h and 14c showed that the kpa groundwaters comprise of modern meteoric waters mixed with deep paleo brine waters 10000 to 21000 yr bp further the na cl i cl cl br and li cl br cl ratios and 2h and 18o data showed that most probable source of salinity for this deep paleo brine water is halite dissolution in miocene marl and urfs formation in the bedrock of kpa the mixing ratio calculated by chloride concentration showed about 60 mixing between deep brine and groundwater samples consequently the source of salinity in kpa groundwater is dissolution of halite and gypsum in deep paleo brine which is likely upconing and mixing with fresh groundwaters during heavy pumping keywords salt water intrusion isotope hydrology groundwater dating deep paleo brine upconing 1 introduction the term groundwater salinization is used to specify an increase in overall chemical content over background levels in groundwater van weert et al 2009 numerous summits and conferences are held every year around the world to deal with the problem of aquifers salinization especially coastal aquifers the most important meeting on the influx of salt water intrusion swims into groundwater systems was established in 1968 mirzavand 2018 recently the swims are more discussed about modeling of water resources and hydrogeology hydrogeochemistry and isotopic studies of the groundwaters also a special group in cartagena was established since 2001 which called salt water intrusion in coastal aquifers swica to investigate the issue of saltwater intrusion on a global scale mirzavand 2018 obviously the issue of groundwater salinization is a global concern vengosh et al 2002 van weert et al 2009 and a serious problem especially in arid and semi arid areas where the ground water is a vital resource mirzavand et al 2020 proper management of accessible groundwater resources is impossible without knowledge of the distribution of fresh and saline groundwater and the processes that lead to salinization clark 2015 salt water intrusion is a long term process that could degrade groundwater system and restrict the availability of useable water for drinking irrigation and industry vengosh 2014 proximity of groundwater system to seawater salt lake mineral dissolution and anthropogenic activity such as over pumping in coastal aquifer could destroy freshwater resources vengosh 2014 2003 chemical composition of groundwater in a coastal aquifer is a function of the rate of fresh salt water mixing from different salinity sources such as water rock interaction cation exchange redox reaction carbonate and evaporate mineral dissolution old salty water tapped in the aquifer seawater salt lake intrusion bagheri et al 2014 clark 2015 mirzavand et al 2018 nadri et al 2014 vengosh 2003 for the effective management of groundwater resources policies are dependent on understanding the sources and mechanism of groundwater system salinization bagheri et al 2019 clark 2015 and on the degree and rate of salinization bagheri et al 2019 the causes for groundwater salinization can be unclear larsen et al 2017 but geochemical approaches as ionic to chloride ratios and trace elements may be useful in tracing the origin of salinity vengosh et al 1999 2002 mirnejad et al 2011 monjerezi 2012 trabelsi et al 2012 bagheri et al 2013 condomines and seidel 2017 sridharan and senthil nathan 2017 however the multiple sources of salinity and the influence of geochemical reactions and groundwater mixing brings a high degree of complexity to the task of identifying the origin and mechanism of salinization vengosh 2003 evaluations of major ion chemistry alone are often inconclusive or vague the integration of isotopic tracers e g isotopes of 2h and 18o is sometimes necessary to determine origin and mechanism of salinity ayadi et al 2016 bagheri et al 2013 clark 2015 farid et al 2015 han et al 2014 hogan and blum 2003 isawi 2016 li et al 2019 avner vengosh et al 2002 zarei et al 2013 many researchers used chemical and isotopic data e g isotopes of 2h and 18o for delineation of the origin and mechanism of salinization in groundwater system bagheri et al 2019 ibrahim and lyons 2017 in this study the processes of salinization of groundwater in the kashan plain aquifer kpa in central iran has been investigated kpa has experienced a significant decline in groundwater quality over the past decades due to salinization average of ec in kpa in 1965 to 2017 has changed from 5600 to 26 000 μs cm respectively kashan is one of the major cities in central of iran next to great kavir the main source of water for all uses in the kashan area is groundwater the kpa suffers from over pumping of water since 1965 and it has water table drawdown close to 1 m y mirzavand and ghazavi 2014 previous studies of groundwater in this region kpa focused on hydrogeological techniques and physiochemical characters of the aquifer mahjouri et al 2005 heydari et al 2013 and suggested that the salt lake was the main origin of salinity in kpa jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 vali khodjeini 1995 nevertheless due to the presence of multiplicity of sources of salinity salt dome evaporation mineral dissolution upconing and salt lake intrusion in kpa other sources and mechanisms of salinization must be considered by integration of hydrogeochemical and isotopic techniques the overall purposes of this study are to 1 identify the origin of salinity in the alluvial kpa 2 determine the mechanism of salinity and deterioration of groundwater in the kpa 3 determine the mixing

isfahan province central iran occupying an area of 2403 km2 fig 1 mirzavand and ghazavi 2014 substratum of the aquifer is represented by evaporites deposits of the miocene marl and upper red formation which is overlain by low level piedmont fan and valley terrace deposits 350 m that are mixture of fine silt coarse silt clay sand gravel boulder and conglomerate fig 2 the kpa is overlain by a perched aquifer in the sand dunes depth of water table 3 m on the east side and by a seasonal river along the west and southwest sides depth of water table 300 m fig 3 mirzavand and ghazavi 2014 in 1956 the first pumping wells were developed in kpa since then with increasing population and water demand the number of pumping wells has increased to more than 2000 wells so far and consequently the water table is currently decreasing by about one meter per year owing to this over pumping by intermediate and deep wells and low recharge in the arid climate of this region precipitation 131 mm y and potential evaporation 3000 mm y this aquifer was listed as one of the critical aquifers in iran in 1981 with water balance deficit of about 52 mm3 approximately 70 percent of water storage in this aquifer is used in addition to the critical water balance situation the aquifer suffers from chronic water quality degradation due to salt water intrusion mirzavand and ghazavi 2014 also owing to the high exploitation on groundwater in kpa land subsidence is occurring at a rate of 3 5 cm y ghazifard et al 2016 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and methods in july 2017 42 water samples were

groundwater and when the sample is taken out of the well suckow 2014 most of hydrogeologists are using from tritium 3h and carbon 14 14c for dating but choosing best radioisotope is strongly depended on the hydrogeological setting of study area as kpa is a quaternary and unconfined aquifer we assessed the groundwater age using 3h and 14c radioisotopes the presence of detectable activities of tritium in groundwater highlights the modern infiltration of rainwater in aquifers clark and fritz 1997 the presence of immeasurable tritium concentrations 0 1 tu of a sample reflects a low renewal of aquifers in the study area the shallow groundwaters were mainly recharged by recent precipitations while the thermal and deep groundwater with tritium contents 0 1 tu were dominantly recharged by precipitations priors to 1952 kpa groundwater age t based on 3h decay was calculated using equation 6 clark and fritz 1997 6 t 17 93 ln a t 3 h a o 3 h where ao 3h and at 3h are tritium contents of the rain and the sample respectively in case of groundwater dating using 14c the initial 14c content 14c0 of the dic recharged to aquifers must be adjusted to account for the accompanying geochemical reactions in radiocarbon dating even if the 14c concentration of soil co2 is assumed constant dissolution of carbonate minerals is one of the main processes affecting the 14c content of dic in groundwater during dissolution the dissolved carbon principally bicarbonate hco3 is derived from a mixture of soil co2 and carbon of inorganic origin in addition isotopic exchange may take place between the different carbon bearing species gas water and mineral due to reversibility of the reactions further affecting the 14c content of the dic some of the better known models for estimation of the initial 14c content of dic 14c0 in carbonate groundwater systems rely on mass balances of either major carbon species or 13c in dic in groundwater of these models some account for not only modification of 14c0 by simple dissolution of carbonate minerals by dissolved soil co2 but also by carbon isotopic exchange between different carbon bearing species δ13c is more negative in situations where the exchange occurs predominantly between soil co2 and hco3 than in situations where the exchange occurs predominantly between hco3 and solid carbonate minerals clark 2015 in the study area kpa the fraction modern carbon f14c is calculated according to reimer et al 2013 as the ratio of the sample 14c 12c ratio to the standard 14c 12c ratio measured in the same data block both 14c 12c ratios are background corrected and the result is corrected for spectrometer and preparation fractionation using the ams measured 13c 12c ratio and is normalized to δ13c pdb radiocarbon ages are calculated as t 8033 ln f14c and reported in 14c yr bp bp ce 1950 4 results and discussion the geochemistry of samples from the kpa provides insights into the origin of groundwater and salinity source in the study area while groundwater in the kpa is considered to be of local meteoric water from the greater catchment in the higher terrain surrounding the aquifer the salinity has a range of possible origins and mechanisms for incorporation into the kpa these include halite dissolution from the nasr abad buried salt dome nbsd intrusion of brine from the salt lake leaching of evaporites and incorporation of brine from the adjacent salt pan upconing of possible paleo deep brine and solute concentration by evaporation the probable origins of salinity in deep paleo brine below the kpa are halite dissolution and or evaporation the following hydrogeochemical and isotopic interpretations attempt to resolve the origin and mechanism of salinization 4 1 general hydrogrochemical characteristics in general groundwater flow is from the southwest to northeast but because of over pumping in western and central parts of the aquifer the hydraulic gradient is reversed locally in northwest of the aquifer the electrical conductivity ec of the samples ranges from 1462 to 212 000 µs cm with a mean value of 25 826 µs cm fig 3 for finding the ec values the interpolation method of inverse distance weighting idw was applied idw method is a mathematical deterministic method which assuming closer values are more related than further values with its function the idw method is mostly used for abnormal data such as major anions and cations interpolation this method has been implemented in arc gis 10 5 the salinity value increases in the groundwater toward the flow direction from southwest to northeast fig 3 in addition the tds value varies from 896 to 296 731 mg l for sample number 9 freshwater to number 35 salt pan the average of tds values in the study area is about 30149 mg l tds variation showed that by moving from west and southwest toward the east and northeast of kpa groundwater salinity increases reaching 296 731 and 291530 mg l in saltpan and salt lake respectively table 1 the ph ranges from 3 41 to 8 11 with a mean value of 7 12 the mean temperature of the samples was 26 41 c cl and so4 2 are the major anions and na and ca2 are the major cations the ca2 na and cl concentration ranges from 84 to 33873 202 to 83 597 and 71 to 204800 mg l respectively the value of so4 2 in the study area ranges from 5 3 to 10080 mg l the mean concentration of hco3 in kpa is 98 02 mg l the variation of hco3 in study area showed that by moving from west and southwest toward the east and northeast of kpa concentration of hco3 decreased the high concentration of hco3 in west and southwest of kpa should be due to carbonate materials in the aquifer the decrease in hco3 values in northeast of kpa should be due to intrusion the schoeller 1965 diagram is used to study the comparative changes in the concentrations and ratios of water quality parameters for different samples the different water quality parameters are plotted along with their concentrations meq l the ion concentrations of the saline samples are plotted on a schoeller diagram in fig 4 with the exception of the salt lake saltpan and shallow wells w10 w35 w13 and w15 respectively all the water samples follow a similar trend suggesting a similar initial origin in general the groundwater in the study area has evolved from a ca hco3 facies in the recharge areas meteoric recharge water to higher salinity na cl and ca so4 in the discharge areas saline water the kpa groundwaters in dissolved solids range from 900 mg l to 25 000 mg l the main possible salinity sources in the area can be halite and gypsum dissolution or modified evaporated seawater the possible sources of these saline components and their mechanisms for uptake are discussed below intrusion of brine from the salt lake because of over pumping and water table decline in the kpa has traditionally been considered the dominant mechanism of salinization this can be discounted because of two points first based on piezometric measurements the salt lake is at lower altitude than the water table in the discharge zone of aquifer by some 23 m therefore based on this gradient hydraulic condition the saline groundwaters are discharged to the salt lake and saltpan and therefore salt lake and saltpan are ruled out as sources of salinity in kpa further the salt lake water is dominated by a na cl geochemical facies simple mixing of water intruded to the kpa from the salt lake would not produce the strong ca so4 component observed in these groundwaters to assess the sequence of hydrogeochemical facies changes during freshening and intrusion processes and for investigation of the role of base exchange reactions in salinization of kpa hydrogeochemical facies evolution model hfe m have been used forcada 2015 fig 5 according to fig 5 and table 2 the evolution of hydrogeochemical facies in kpa is ca hco3 19 04 mix ca cl and ca cl 9 52 mix na cl and na cl 72 26 of water samples falls on these facies table 2 this supports that the major facies in the kpa is na cl during a saltwater intrusion stage and below conservative mixing line red solid circles in fig 5 the groundwater samples are slowly becoming saline with the water types evolving from ca hco3 to na cl however most of the samples depart from the mixing line green line which indicates cation exchange in kpa these changes well correlated with groundwater flow direction in addition ion exchange should be the main cause of these variations as mentioned above nbsd is one of the possible sources of salinity based on the geo electric data however the nbsd is situated at 480 m depth to the north of the kpa fig 6 with miocene marl and upper red formation bedrock found at 250 m depth regional groundwater flow is not well understood but these shallower formations are the likely hosts for halite contributing to the salinity of the deep brine also as shown in this geoelectric cross section fig 6 the location of this cross section showed at fig 1 a part of the lower red formation was disrupted by the shurab dehnar and ab shirin faults which may provide conduits for fluid flow and evaporite dissolution contributing to the increased salinity in northern parts of the aquifer 4 2 composite plots based on hydrogeochemical approaches the na cl molar ratio anticipated from the salt dissolution would be about 1 bagheri et al 2013 richter and kreitler 1993 while na vs cl molar ratios of the studied water samples vary close to this value fig 7 suggesting that halite dissolution is a likely origin of salinity water samples with high cl concentrations with na vs cl molar ratios less than 1 may have experienced cation exchange results of geochemical modeling with phreeqc table 1 show that all groundwater samples except samples nos 5 8 9 18 19 recharge zone with respect to calcite dolomite aragonite and sample no 27 with respect to anhydrite and gypsum other samples were undersaturated with respect to calcite dolomite aragonite anhydrite gypsum and halite suggesting that these minerals may have affected the hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater in kpa the average of sigypsum is close to equilibrium given that these saline groundwaters are in direct contact with gypsiferous layers in the bedrock of the aquifer in gypsiferous miocene marl according to the plot of i vs cl fig 8 all the water samples are located on a mixing line between a brine end member with similar geochemistry to the salt lake and fresh groundwater the hydrogeochemical characteristics of this brine end member may have been altered over time due to different processes such as ion exchange in addition as mentioned before based on the topography and water table elevation the salt lake and saltpan are the discharging points of the groundwater in kpa likewise based on the geological evidence the salt lake with 50 m depth should be situated on miocene marl and urfs formation so it may represent the outcrop of the deep brine aquifer beneath the kpa as a consequence of increased pumping over time upconing of the deep brine has to the upper fresh aquifer and degraded the quality of produced water from the wells in the kpa br versus cl concentration is presented in fig 9 as shown the high cl salinities are br depleted and unrelated to seawater evaporation as represented by the seawater evaporation trajectory set shown on the figure carpenter 1978 the seawater evaporation trend set has been extensively used to determine the origin of the salinity in different basins bagheri et al 2014 kharaka and hanor 2005 normally waters affected by halite dissolution and mixing between halite dissolution brine and fresh waters are above the set while evaporated waters lie on the set as shown in fig 9 the water samples in the study area lie above the set on a straight line and follow a well defined mixing or dilution trend the good fit implies that salinity in both fresh and brine end members are relatively uniform in composition and br and cl behave conservatively during the mixing process salt lake and salt pan samples plots above the set indicating of halite dissolution as main origin of salinity in these resources the deep brine end member in the kpa groundwaters has a similar salinity source bagheri et al 2014 proposed a diagram of li cl vs br cl as a tool to distinguish different water and salinity sources all the water samples fall on halite dissolution region fig 10 halite dissolution produces much lower li cl and br cl ratios than those found in fresh and evaporates formation waters therefore halite dissolution is the main origin of salinity in brine aquifer below the shallow kpa with no evidence for evaporated seawater contributions 4 3 evaporation loss the overall enrichments εtotal εv l δεv bl for evaporation under these conditions for the mean annual temperature of 30 c are then 16 4 for 18o and 78 for 2h give a residual water fraction ƒ of 0 50 on average and so an evaporative loss of 40 60 with an average of 50 thus only 50 of the discharged original water volume in the reservoir has reminded in the salt pan or salt lake therefore the isotopic values of surface water samples salt lake and pan are enriched about 10 12 fold the salinity value of these samples is increase during 50 evaporation loss of the original water during this process the salinity build up is close to 12 fold that is similar to isotopic value mccaffrey et al 1987 so based on the cl value of the about 5600 mmol l and enrichment factor of 10 fold the original cl concentration of initial brine below the aquifer can be calculated of 560 mmol l with salinity of about 100 150 g l 4 4 δ18o and δ2h δ2h and δ18o isotopes are very useful tools to distinguish different water sources clark and fritz 1997 the δ2h and δ18o isotope data of kpa salt lake and saltpan with global meteoric water line gmwl and east mediterranean of meteoric water line emmwl plotted in figure 11 provide the most compelling evidence for salinization by mixing with a deep brine rather than intrusion of brine from the salt lake the isotopic composition δ2h and δ18o varies from 8 38 to 6 48 with an average of 4 49 for δ18o and 57 09 to 22 68 with an average of 40 28 for δ2h table 3 the fresh and saline groundwater samples are plotted near the gmwl with a minor shift towards more enriched values indicating that the present meteoric water is the main origin of groundwater in the study area this is consistent with halite dissolution as the main origin of salinity in the brine end member considered to be contributing to salinity in the kpa given that halite dissolution cannot enrich the isotopic values of water samples bagheri et al 2014 in contrast the brine samples from dug wells in northeast of kpa w13 and w37 salt lake w10 and saltpan w35 plot below and far from the gmwl with enrichments in 18o and d in comparison to the other water samples fig 11 the initial origin of dug well samples w13 and w37 in the northeast of the aquifer salt lake and saltpan is likely then from discharging of mixed groundwater of fresh brine end member to the northeast of the plain with subsequent evaporative enrichment given the poor correlation between isotopes and salinity for kpa groundwaters compared with the salt lake the proposed brine end member likely plots near the gmwl fig 11 the lack of distinct correlation fig 12 suggests that the deep brine is also recharged from meteoric waters recharged within the basin the d excess defined as d excess δ2h 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 table 3 is a useful approach in delineation secondary processes affecting the vapor content in the evaporation condensation process in atmosphere craig 1961 mondal and gupta 2015 secondary evaporative processes such as irrigation water stacks at the cultivated area can alter the d excess of the original water zimmermann and ehhalt 1967 in this study the low d excess value implies return flow recharge component in relation with the irrigation return flow in kpa as shown in figure 12 the δ18o values changed gradually from 8 38 to 6 48 however δ2h and d excess showed considerable fluctuations from 57 09 to 22 68 and from 56 70 to 19 33 respectively based on the fig 13 by increasing the depth of sampling δ2h δ18o and d excess show enrichment most of the enrichment could be seen in salt lake w10 saltpan w35 w13 and w37 which are affected by high evaporation in the area by increasing the depth of sampling δ2h δ18o and d excess show more stability and more depletion than shallow groundwater however there is a significant positive correlation between d excess and δ18o r2 0 81 table 3 this may be attributed to the same recharge source water and hydrological conditions in kpa yang et al 2017 4 5 3h 13c and 14c isotope compositions the 3h data in kpa table 3 shows negligible tritium in the aquifer 0 8 tu although 3h in the tehran precipitation is low table 4 this confirms a largely sub modern age of fresh groundwater in the kpa and low recharge rate of groundwater by recent precipitation it is assumed that due to high evaporation in the study area most of the precipitation evaporating before penetrating in saturation media also groundwater dating using 14cdic has shown some old carbon in the system table 4 which would be attributed to the dissolved inorganic carbon derived from the fresh meteoric water component note the 13cdic data in table 4 that verify the pumping from statistic storage and pale groundwater in kpa the negative amounts of 13c shows some enrichment which could be due to carbonate minerals in the kpa 4 6 freshwater deep brine mixing it was assumed that the salt water that is representative of the saline groundwater intrusion from the deep brine below the kpa toward the alluvium aquifer had a tds of about 150 g l based on the freshest water sample w9 in the study area is suggested as fresh water end member in the formula eq 5 as such the of saltwater in freshwater for each well could be calculate as presented in table 5 as shown in table 5 the highest mixing was done in east w39 69 and northeast of the aquifer and the lowest mixing is in west and southwest of the aquifer 5 conclusion salinization of groundwaters as major source of water in kpa in an arid and semi arid region is a serious problem for which identifying the origin and mechanism of salinization is imperative for better management of this precious source of water the integration of geophysics hydrogeological hydrogeochemical and isotopic methods especially in regions with multiple potential sources of salinity is vital for this purpose these data were combined to make a conceptual model of salinization of groundwaters in the kpa various potential sources of salinity in the kpa include the nbsd salt lake intrusion salt pan leaching upconing and evaporation the geophysical information has shown that nbsd cannot be the source of salinity due to its depth and location peripheral to the kpa groundwater flow directions show that saline groundwaters are discharging to the salt lake and saltpan further δ2h and δ18o isotopes data confirm that saltwater intrusion from salt lake and saltpan to the aquifer does not occur since the lack of characteristic evaporated signature is not observed in kpa groundwaters the plots of na cl cl br and li cl vs br cl show that most groundwaters obtained salinity from halite dissolution also water samples in the study area lie above the set on a straight line and follow a well defined mixing or dilution trend implying that both fresh and brine end members are relatively uniform in composition br and cl behave conservatively and in an apparent mixing between meteoric waters recharged in the basin and brine derived from dissolution of halite and gypsum in the underlying tertiary evaporites it is concluded that upconing of this deep brine has degraded the shallow aquifer water quality due to over pumping tritium data show negligible tritium in the aquifer which confirms sub modern age of groundwater low activities of 14c in dic suggest that deep waters may have a significant age as this study is the first comprehensive hydrogeochemical and isotopic investigation of groundwater salinization in kpa and there is little information about paleo deep brine and nasr abad salt dome we kindly recommend other

varies from 8 38 to 6 48 with average of 4 49 for δ18o and 57 09 to 22 68 with average of 40 28 for δ2h the fresh and saline groundwater samples were plotted near the gmwl with a minor shift towards more enriched values indicating that the present meteoric water is the main origin of groundwater in the study area intrusion from salt lake and saltpan was rejected by ionic ratios and stable isotopes approaches further geophysical investigations ruled out contributions from the nasr abad salt dome as it is buried at about 480 m depth underneath the kpa in addition the radioisotopes results 3h and 14c showed that the kpa groundwaters comprise of modern meteoric waters mixed with deep paleo brine waters 10000 to 21000 yr bp further the na cl i cl cl br and li cl br cl ratios and 2h and 18o data showed that most probable source of salinity for this deep paleo brine water is halite dissolution in miocene marl and urfs formation in the bedrock of kpa the mixing ratio calculated by chloride concentration showed about 60 mixing between deep brine and groundwater samples consequently the source of salinity in kpa groundwater is dissolution of halite and gypsum in deep paleo brine which is likely upconing and mixing with fresh groundwaters during heavy pumping keywords salt water intrusion isotope hydrology groundwater dating deep paleo brine upconing 1 introduction the term groundwater salinization is used to specify an increase in overall chemical content over background levels in groundwater van weert et al 2009 numerous summits and conferences are held every year around the world to deal with the problem of aquifers salinization especially coastal aquifers the most important meeting on the influx of salt water intrusion swims into groundwater systems was established in 1968 mirzavand 2018 recently the swims are more discussed about modeling of water resources and hydrogeology hydrogeochemistry and isotopic studies of the groundwaters also a special group in cartagena was established since 2001 which called salt water intrusion in coastal aquifers swica to investigate the issue of saltwater intrusion on a global scale mirzavand 2018 obviously the issue of groundwater salinization is a global concern vengosh et al 2002 van weert et al 2009 and a serious problem especially in arid and semi arid areas where the ground water is a vital resource mirzavand et al 2020 proper management of accessible groundwater resources is impossible without knowledge of the distribution of fresh and saline groundwater and the processes that lead to salinization clark 2015 salt water intrusion is a long term process that could degrade groundwater system and restrict the availability of useable water for drinking irrigation and industry vengosh 2014 proximity of groundwater system to seawater salt lake mineral dissolution and anthropogenic activity such as over pumping in coastal aquifer could destroy freshwater resources vengosh 2014 2003 chemical composition of groundwater in a coastal aquifer is a function of the rate of fresh salt water mixing from different salinity sources such as water rock interaction cation exchange redox reaction carbonate and evaporate mineral dissolution old salty water tapped in the aquifer seawater salt lake intrusion bagheri et al 2014 clark 2015 mirzavand et al 2018 nadri et al 2014 vengosh 2003 for the effective management of groundwater resources policies are dependent on understanding the sources and mechanism of groundwater system salinization bagheri et al 2019 clark 2015 and on the degree and rate of salinization bagheri et al 2019 the causes for groundwater salinization can be unclear larsen et al 2017 but geochemical approaches as ionic to chloride ratios and trace elements may be useful in tracing the origin of salinity vengosh et al 1999 2002 mirnejad et al 2011 monjerezi 2012 trabelsi et al 2012 bagheri et al 2013 condomines and seidel 2017 sridharan and senthil nathan 2017 however the multiple sources of salinity and the influence of geochemical reactions and groundwater mixing brings a high degree of complexity to the task of identifying the origin and mechanism of salinization vengosh 2003 evaluations of major ion chemistry alone are often inconclusive or vague the integration of isotopic tracers e g isotopes of 2h and 18o is sometimes necessary to determine origin and mechanism of salinity ayadi et al 2016 bagheri et al 2013 clark 2015 farid et al 2015 han et al 2014 hogan and blum 2003 isawi 2016 li et al 2019 avner vengosh et al 2002 zarei et al 2013 many researchers used chemical and isotopic data e g isotopes of 2h and 18o for delineation of the origin and mechanism of salinization in groundwater system bagheri et al 2019 ibrahim and lyons 2017 in this study the processes of salinization of groundwater in the kashan plain aquifer kpa in central iran has been investigated kpa has experienced a significant decline in groundwater quality over the past decades due to salinization average of ec in kpa in 1965 to 2017 has changed from 5600 to 26 000 μs cm respectively kashan is one of the major cities in central of iran next to great kavir the main source of water for all uses in the kashan area is groundwater the kpa suffers from over pumping of water since 1965 and it has water table drawdown close to 1 m y mirzavand and ghazavi 2014 previous studies of groundwater in this region kpa focused on hydrogeological techniques and physiochemical characters of the aquifer mahjouri et al 2005 heydari et al 2013 and suggested that the salt lake was the main origin of salinity in kpa jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 vali khodjeini 1995 nevertheless due to the presence of multiplicity of sources of salinity salt dome evaporation mineral dissolution upconing and salt lake intrusion in kpa other sources and mechanisms of salinization must be considered by integration of hydrogeochemical and isotopic techniques the overall purposes of this study are to 1 identify the origin of salinity in the alluvial kpa 2 determine the mechanism of salinity and deterioration of groundwater in the kpa 3 determine the mixing ratio between the saltwater and fresh water and 4 assess the groundwater ages in kpa 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the kpa longitude 51 32 to 51 03 e latitude 33 27 to 34 13 n is located in isfahan province central iran occupying an area of 2403 km2 fig 1 mirzavand and ghazavi 2014 substratum of the aquifer is represented by evaporites deposits of the miocene marl and upper red formation which is overlain by low level piedmont fan and valley terrace deposits 350 m that are mixture of fine silt coarse silt clay sand gravel boulder and conglomerate fig 2 the kpa is overlain by a perched aquifer in the sand dunes depth of water table 3 m on the east side and by a seasonal river along the west and southwest sides depth of water table 300 m fig 3 mirzavand and ghazavi 2014 in 1956 the first pumping wells were developed in kpa since then with increasing population and water demand the number of pumping wells has increased to more than 2000 wells so far and consequently the water table is currently decreasing by about one meter per year owing to this over pumping by intermediate and deep wells and low recharge in the arid climate of this region precipitation 131 mm y and potential evaporation 3000 mm y this aquifer was listed as one of the critical aquifers in iran in 1981 with water balance deficit of about 52 mm3 approximately 70 percent of water storage in this aquifer is used in addition to the critical water balance situation the aquifer suffers from chronic water quality degradation due to salt water intrusion mirzavand and ghazavi 2014 also owing to the high exploitation on groundwater in kpa land subsidence is occurring at a rate of 3 5 cm y ghazifard et al 2016 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and methods in july 2017 42 water samples were

groundwater and when the sample is taken out of the well suckow 2014 most of hydrogeologists are using from tritium 3h and carbon 14 14c for dating but choosing best radioisotope is strongly depended on the hydrogeological setting of study area as kpa is a quaternary and unconfined aquifer we assessed the groundwater age using 3h and 14c radioisotopes the presence of detectable activities of tritium in groundwater highlights the modern infiltration of rainwater in aquifers clark and fritz 1997 the presence of immeasurable tritium concentrations 0 1 tu of a sample reflects a low renewal of aquifers in the study area the shallow groundwaters were mainly recharged by recent precipitations while the thermal and deep groundwater with tritium contents 0 1 tu were dominantly recharged by precipitations priors to 1952 kpa groundwater age t based on 3h decay was calculated using equation 6 clark and fritz 1997 6 t 17 93 ln a t 3 h a o 3 h where ao 3h and at 3h are tritium contents of the rain and the sample respectively in case of groundwater dating using 14c the initial 14c content 14c0 of the dic recharged to aquifers must be adjusted to account for the accompanying geochemical reactions in radiocarbon dating even if the 14c concentration of soil co2 is assumed constant dissolution of carbonate minerals is one of the main processes affecting the 14c content of dic in groundwater during dissolution the dissolved carbon principally bicarbonate hco3 is derived from a mixture of soil co2 and carbon of inorganic origin in addition isotopic exchange may take place between the different carbon bearing species gas water and mineral due to reversibility of the reactions further affecting the 14c content of the dic some of the better known models for estimation of the initial 14c content of dic 14c0 in carbonate groundwater systems rely on mass balances of either major carbon species or 13c in dic in groundwater of these models some account for not only modification of 14c0 by simple dissolution of carbonate minerals by dissolved soil co2 but also by carbon isotopic exchange between different carbon bearing species δ13c is more negative in situations where the exchange occurs predominantly between soil co2 and hco3 than in situations where the exchange occurs predominantly between hco3 and solid carbonate minerals clark 2015 in the study area kpa the fraction modern carbon f14c is calculated according to reimer et al 2013 as the ratio of the sample 14c 12c ratio to the standard 14c 12c ratio measured in the same data block both 14c 12c ratios are background corrected and the result is corrected for spectrometer and preparation fractionation using the ams measured 13c 12c ratio and is normalized to δ13c pdb radiocarbon ages are calculated as t 8033 ln f14c and reported in 14c yr bp bp ce 1950 4 results and discussion the geochemistry of samples from the kpa provides insights into the origin of groundwater and salinity source in the study area while groundwater in the kpa is considered to be of local meteoric water from the greater catchment in the higher terrain surrounding the aquifer the salinity has a range of possible origins and mechanisms for incorporation into the kpa these include halite dissolution from the nasr abad buried salt dome nbsd intrusion of brine from the salt lake leaching of evaporites and incorporation of brine from the adjacent salt pan upconing of possible paleo deep brine and solute concentration by evaporation the probable origins of salinity in deep paleo brine below the kpa are halite dissolution and or evaporation the following hydrogeochemical and isotopic interpretations attempt to resolve the origin and mechanism of salinization 4 1 general hydrogrochemical characteristics in general groundwater flow is from the southwest to northeast but because of over pumping in western and central parts of the aquifer the hydraulic gradient is reversed locally in northwest of the aquifer the electrical conductivity ec of the samples ranges from 1462 to 212 000 µs cm with a mean value of 25 826 µs cm fig 3 for finding the ec values the interpolation method of inverse distance weighting idw was applied idw method is a mathematical deterministic method which assuming closer values are more related than further values with its function the idw method is mostly used for abnormal data such as major anions and cations interpolation this method has been implemented in arc gis 10 5 the salinity value increases in the groundwater toward the flow direction from southwest to northeast fig 3 in addition the tds value varies from 896 to 296 731 mg l for sample number 9 freshwater to number 35 salt pan the average of tds values in the study area is about 30149 mg l tds variation showed that by moving from west and southwest toward the east and northeast of kpa groundwater salinity increases reaching 296 731 and 291530 mg l in saltpan and salt lake respectively table 1 the ph ranges from 3 41 to 8 11 with a mean value of 7 12 the mean temperature of the samples was 26 41 c cl and so4 2 are the major anions and na and ca2 are the major cations the ca2 na and cl concentration ranges from 84 to 33873 202 to 83 597 and 71 to 204800 mg l respectively the value of so4 2 in the study area ranges from 5 3 to 10080 mg l the mean concentration of hco3 in kpa is 98 02 mg l the variation of hco3 in study area showed that by moving from west and southwest toward the east and northeast of kpa concentration of hco3 decreased the high concentration of hco3 in west and southwest of kpa should be due to carbonate materials in the aquifer the decrease in hco3 values in northeast of kpa should be due to intrusion the schoeller 1965 diagram is used to study the comparative changes in the concentrations and ratios of water quality parameters for different samples the different water quality parameters are plotted along with their concentrations meq l the ion concentrations of the saline samples are plotted on a schoeller diagram in fig 4 with the exception of the salt lake saltpan and shallow wells w10 w35 w13 and w15 respectively all the water samples follow a similar trend suggesting a similar initial origin in general the groundwater in the study area has evolved from a ca hco3 facies in the recharge areas meteoric recharge water to higher salinity na cl and ca so4 in the discharge areas saline water the kpa groundwaters in dissolved solids range from 900 mg l to 25 000 mg l the main possible salinity sources in the area can be halite and gypsum dissolution or modified evaporated seawater the possible sources of these saline components and their mechanisms for uptake are discussed below intrusion of brine from the salt lake because of over pumping and water table decline in the kpa has traditionally been considered the dominant mechanism of salinization this can be discounted because of two points first based on piezometric measurements the salt lake is at lower altitude than the water table in the discharge zone of aquifer by some 23 m therefore based on this gradient hydraulic condition the saline groundwaters are discharged to the salt lake and saltpan and therefore salt lake and saltpan are ruled out as sources of salinity in kpa further the salt lake water is dominated by a na cl geochemical facies simple mixing of water intruded to the kpa from the salt lake would not produce the strong ca so4 component observed in these groundwaters to assess the sequence of hydrogeochemical facies changes during freshening and intrusion processes and for investigation of the role of base exchange reactions in salinization of kpa hydrogeochemical facies evolution model hfe m have been used forcada 2015 fig 5 according to fig 5 and table 2 the evolution of hydrogeochemical facies in kpa is ca hco3 19 04 mix ca cl and ca cl 9 52 mix na cl and na cl 72 26 of water samples falls on these facies table 2 this supports that the major facies in the kpa is na cl during a saltwater intrusion stage and below conservative mixing line red solid circles in fig 5 the groundwater samples are slowly becoming saline with the water types evolving from ca hco3 to na cl however most of the samples depart from the mixing line green line which indicates cation exchange in kpa these changes well correlated with groundwater flow direction in addition ion exchange should be the main cause of these variations as mentioned above nbsd is one of the possible sources of salinity based on the geo electric data however the nbsd is situated at 480 m depth to the north of the kpa fig 6 with miocene marl and upper red formation bedrock found at 250 m depth regional groundwater flow is not well understood but these shallower formations are the likely hosts for halite contributing to the salinity of the deep brine also as shown in this geoelectric cross section fig 6 the location of this cross section showed at fig 1 a part of the lower red formation was disrupted by the shurab dehnar and ab shirin faults which may provide conduits for fluid flow and evaporite dissolution contributing to the increased salinity in northern parts of the aquifer 4 2 composite plots based on hydrogeochemical approaches the na cl molar ratio anticipated from the salt dissolution would be about 1 bagheri et al 2013 richter and kreitler 1993 while na vs cl molar ratios of the studied water samples vary close to this value fig 7 suggesting that halite dissolution is a likely origin of salinity water samples with high cl concentrations with na vs cl molar ratios less than 1 may have experienced cation exchange results of geochemical modeling with phreeqc table 1 show that all groundwater samples except samples nos 5 8 9 18 19 recharge zone with respect to calcite dolomite aragonite and sample no 27 with respect to anhydrite and gypsum other samples were undersaturated with respect to calcite dolomite aragonite anhydrite gypsum and halite suggesting that these minerals may have affected the hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater in kpa the average of sigypsum is close to equilibrium given that these saline groundwaters are in direct contact with gypsiferous layers in the bedrock of the aquifer in gypsiferous miocene marl according to the plot of i vs cl fig 8 all the water samples are located on a mixing line between a brine end member with similar geochemistry to the salt lake and fresh groundwater the hydrogeochemical characteristics of this brine end member may have been altered over time due to different processes such as ion exchange in addition as mentioned before based on the topography and water table elevation the salt lake and saltpan are the discharging points of the groundwater in kpa likewise based on the geological evidence the salt lake with 50 m depth should be situated on miocene marl and urfs formation so it may represent the outcrop of the deep brine aquifer beneath the kpa as a consequence of increased pumping over time upconing of the deep brine has to the upper fresh aquifer and degraded the quality of produced water from the wells in the kpa br versus cl concentration is presented in fig 9 as shown the high cl salinities are br depleted and unrelated to seawater evaporation as represented by the seawater evaporation trajectory set shown on the figure carpenter 1978 the seawater evaporation trend set has been extensively used to determine the origin of the salinity in different basins bagheri et al 2014 kharaka and hanor 2005 normally waters affected by halite dissolution and mixing between halite dissolution brine and fresh waters are above the set while evaporated waters lie on the set as shown in fig 9 the water samples in the study area lie above the set on a straight line and follow a well defined mixing or dilution trend the good fit implies that salinity in both fresh and brine end members are relatively uniform in composition and br and cl behave conservatively during the mixing process salt lake and salt pan samples plots above the set indicating of halite dissolution as main origin of salinity in these resources the deep brine end member in the kpa groundwaters has a similar salinity source bagheri et al 2014 proposed a diagram of li cl vs br cl as a tool to distinguish different water and salinity sources all the water samples fall on halite dissolution region fig 10 halite dissolution produces much lower li cl and br cl ratios than those found in fresh and evaporates formation waters therefore halite dissolution is the main origin of salinity in brine aquifer below the shallow kpa with no evidence for evaporated seawater contributions 4 3 evaporation loss the overall enrichments εtotal εv l δεv bl for evaporation under these conditions for the mean annual temperature of 30 c are then 16 4 for 18o and 78 for 2h give a residual water fraction ƒ of 0 50 on average and so an evaporative loss of 40 60 with an average of 50 thus only 50 of the discharged original water volume in the reservoir has reminded in the salt pan or salt lake therefore the isotopic values of surface water samples salt lake and pan are enriched about 10 12 fold the salinity value of these samples is increase during 50 evaporation loss of the original water during this process the salinity build up is close to 12 fold that is similar to isotopic value mccaffrey et al 1987 so based on the cl value of the about 5600 mmol l and enrichment factor of 10 fold the original cl concentration of initial brine below the aquifer can be calculated of 560 mmol l with salinity of about 100 150 g l 4 4 δ18o and δ2h δ2h and δ18o isotopes are very useful tools to distinguish different water sources clark and fritz 1997 the δ2h and δ18o isotope data of kpa salt lake and saltpan with global meteoric water line gmwl and east mediterranean of meteoric water line emmwl plotted in figure 11 provide the most compelling evidence for salinization by mixing with a deep brine rather than intrusion of brine from the salt lake the isotopic composition δ2h and δ18o varies from 8 38 to 6 48 with an average of 4 49 for δ18o and 57 09 to 22 68 with an average of 40 28 for δ2h table 3 the fresh and saline groundwater samples are plotted near the gmwl with a minor shift towards more enriched values indicating that the present meteoric water is the main origin of groundwater in the study area this is consistent with halite dissolution as the main origin of salinity in the brine end member considered to be contributing to salinity in the kpa given that halite dissolution cannot enrich the isotopic values of water samples bagheri et al 2014 in contrast the brine samples from dug wells in northeast of kpa w13 and w37 salt lake w10 and saltpan w35 plot below and far from the gmwl with enrichments in 18o and d in comparison to the other water samples fig 11 the initial origin of dug well samples w13 and w37 in the northeast of the aquifer salt lake and saltpan is likely then from discharging of mixed groundwater of fresh brine end member to the northeast of the plain with subsequent evaporative enrichment given the poor correlation between isotopes and salinity for kpa groundwaters compared with the salt lake the proposed brine end member likely plots near the gmwl fig 11 the lack of distinct correlation fig 12 suggests that the deep brine is also recharged from meteoric waters recharged within the basin the d excess defined as d excess δ2h 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 table 3 is a useful approach in delineation secondary processes affecting the vapor content in the evaporation condensation process in atmosphere craig 1961 mondal and gupta 2015 secondary evaporative processes such as irrigation water stacks at the cultivated area can alter the d excess of the original water zimmermann and ehhalt 1967 in this study the low d excess value implies return flow recharge component in relation with the irrigation return flow in kpa as shown in figure 12 the δ18o values changed gradually from 8 38 to 6 48 however δ2h and d excess showed considerable fluctuations from 57 09 to 22 68 and from 56 70 to 19 33 respectively based on the fig 13 by increasing the depth of sampling δ2h δ18o and d excess show enrichment most of the enrichment could be seen in salt lake w10 saltpan w35 w13 and w37 which are affected by high evaporation in the area by increasing the depth of sampling δ2h δ18o and d excess show more stability and more depletion than shallow groundwater however there is a significant positive correlation between d excess and δ18o r2 0 81 table 3 this may be attributed to the same recharge source water and hydrological conditions in kpa yang et al 2017 4 5 3h 13c and 14c isotope compositions the 3h data in kpa table 3 shows negligible tritium in the aquifer 0 8 tu although 3h in the tehran precipitation is low table 4 this confirms a largely sub modern age of fresh groundwater in the kpa and low recharge rate of groundwater by recent precipitation it is assumed that due to high evaporation in the study area most of the precipitation evaporating before penetrating in saturation media also groundwater dating using 14cdic has shown some old carbon in the system table 4 which would be attributed to the dissolved inorganic carbon derived from the fresh meteoric water component note the 13cdic data in table 4 that verify the pumping from statistic storage and pale groundwater in kpa the negative amounts of 13c shows some enrichment which could be due to carbonate minerals in the kpa 4 6 freshwater deep brine mixing it was assumed that the salt water that is representative of the saline groundwater intrusion from the deep brine below the kpa toward the alluvium aquifer had a tds of about 150 g l based on the freshest water sample w9 in the study area is suggested as fresh water end member in the formula eq 5 as such the of saltwater in freshwater for each well could be calculate as presented in table 5 as shown in table 5 the highest mixing was done in east w39 69 and northeast of the aquifer and the lowest mixing is in west and southwest of the aquifer 5 conclusion salinization of groundwaters as major source of water in kpa in an arid and semi arid region is a serious problem for which identifying the origin and mechanism of salinization is imperative for better management of this precious source of water the integration of geophysics hydrogeological hydrogeochemical and isotopic methods especially in regions with multiple potential sources of salinity is vital for this purpose these data were combined to make a conceptual model of salinization of groundwaters in the kpa various potential sources of salinity in the kpa include the nbsd salt lake intrusion salt pan leaching upconing and evaporation the geophysical information has shown that nbsd cannot be the source of salinity due to its depth and location peripheral to the kpa groundwater flow directions show that saline groundwaters are discharging to the salt lake and saltpan further δ2h and δ18o isotopes data confirm that saltwater intrusion from salt lake and saltpan to the aquifer does not occur since the lack of characteristic evaporated signature is not observed in kpa groundwaters the plots of na cl cl br and li cl vs br cl show that most groundwaters obtained salinity from halite dissolution also water samples in the study area lie above the set on a straight line and follow a well defined mixing or dilution trend implying that both fresh and brine end members are relatively uniform in composition br and cl behave conservatively and in an apparent mixing between meteoric waters recharged in the basin and brine derived from dissolution of halite and gypsum in the underlying tertiary evaporites it is concluded that upconing of this deep brine has degraded the shallow aquifer water quality due to over pumping tritium data show negligible tritium in the aquifer which confirms sub modern age of groundwater low activities of 14c in dic suggest that deep waters may have a significant age as this study is the first comprehensive hydrogeochemical and isotopic investigation of groundwater salinization in kpa and there is little information about paleo deep brine and nasr abad salt dome we kindly recommend other

5489,the sulfidation of fe oxides hydroxides has an important effect on the migration and transformation of as in groundwater we examine the sulfidation of as iii bearing ferrihydrite and subsequent as repartitioning induced by sulfide in column experiments groundwater velocities has an obvious influence on sulfidation and the subsequent formation transformation of secondary minerals at a slower flow 1 pore volume d 1 adsorbed as blocks the ferrihydrite surface resulting in a slower sulfidation and thus slower generation of s0 and fe2 mackinawite is subsequently generated by reaction of fe2 with excess sulfide and then reacts with s0 to form greigite at a faster flow 5 pore volumes d 1 stronger water elution results in desorption of much of the adsorbed as faster sulfidation produces considerable amounts of s0 and fe2 and restricts the formation of mackinawite fe2 then adsorbs and catalyzes the conversion of residual ferrihydrite to hematite the mackinawite also reacts with s0 to form pyrrhotite rather than greigite overall heavy sulfidation does not effectively prevent the release of as caused by the reduction of ferrihydrite at either groundwater velocities sufficient as retention may be achieved by adjusting the hydrodynamic intensity of the system to determine the product of the sulfidation keywords arsenic ferrihydrite sulfidation hydrodynamic condition 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in groundwater has become an important environmental issue around the world the exact pathway by which as mobilization takes place in groundwater is quite complex the fe s as interaction induced by sulfide controls the fate of as in groundwater to a great extent field and laboratory based observations show that redox o day et al 2004 pi et al 2017 postma et al 2010 poulton et al 2004 ligand exchange kocar et al 2010 chemical substitution savage et al 2000 and precipitation reactions hunger and benning 2007 kirk et al 2010 can occur simultaneously or successively between sulfide and a variety of as bearing minerals as well as fe and as in the liquid phase all of which affect as solid solution partitioning fe s as interactions feature a variety of competing reaction pathways depending on the reactants themselves and also strongly on external environmental conditions such as ph co existing ions etc for example ph not only importantly affects the adsorption of as and co existing ions on fe oxides hydroxides fendorf et al 2010 but also some reaction pathways such as the catalytic transformation of ferrihydrite represented by feoh3 in the equation by fe2 burton et al 2011 wilkin et al 2006 zachara et al 2002 and the formation of pyrite benning et al 2000 wilkin and barnes 1997 realgar and orpiment kocar et al 2010 savage et al 2000 the adsorption of as and the transformation of metastable fe hydroxides are also affected by co existing ions such as po4 3 hco3 dixit and hering 2003 ni co zachara et al 2002 and rcho rickard et al 2001 the chemical forms and concentrations of as fe and s are also important factors determining the reaction pathways burton et al 2011 wan et al 2017 wolthers et al 2005 2007 yang et al 2010 the fate of geochemical elements are controlled by physical and chemical interactions the influence of physical factors such as advection on the fate of elements may not be limited to migration kocar et al 2010 show that advection promotes the accumulation of mackinawite and the release of as by continuously adding reactants to support sulfidation during biogenic sulfidation and transformation of ferrihydrite the reaction at the solid liquid interface is also affected by hydrodynamic conditions water advection can enhance the reduction of crystalline ferric iron oxide by relaxing thermodynamic constraints or surface passivation roden and urrutia 1999 roden et al 2000 the labile outer sphere complexes are sensitive to perturbations in flow conditions and arsenite present in outer sphere complexes on the surface of fe hydroxide can be released in large quantities kocar et al 2006 tufano and fendorf 2008 in addition the production of the polysulfide required for the formation of pyrite as an effective as adsorbent is controlled by diffusion which means that the reaction is limited by reactant transport hartler et al 1967 as mentioned above hydrodynamic conditions have a considerable influence on geochemical reactions but their role in fe s as systems remains unclear in this study we examined the effect of groundwater velocities on the sulfidation of as bearing fe iii minerals to achieve this objective we used as iii bearing ferrihydrite coated sand as the initial solid phase and carried out abiotic sulfidation column experiments at different groundwater velocities considering that high ph is a typical characteristic of many high as groundwater smedley and kinniburgh 2002 this study was conducted at alkaline ph as iii was used as the initial as oxidation state to eliminate the interference of increased as mobility caused by the reduction of as v on determining the effect of the groundwater velocities on as mobility burton et al 2011 the results provide a new perspective on the migration and transformation of as in fe s rich environments 2 methods 2 1 general methods all glass and plastic ware were cleaned by soaking in 10 v v hno3 for 24 h followed by repeated

solution with naoh to a ph of 7 5 within 5 min to avoid the precipitation of akaganeite after titration naoh solution was used to keep the ph of the ferrihydrite floc stable at 7 5 for 2 h dzomback

final ferrihydrite coated sand was about 1 6 μm g 1 column experiments were carried out under the hydrodynamic conditions of slow flow 1 v d 1 640 cm3 d 1 and fast flow 5 v d 1 3200 cm3 d 1 respectively five replicate columns filled with as iii bearing ferrihydrite coated sand were employed for each hydrodynamic condition four of which were fed artificial groundwater containing sulfide gws 300 μm prepared from na2s 9h2o from the bottom to study mineral changes caused by sulfidation the reactions in these four columns were stopped after 5 15 25 and 35 v respectively with solid phase samples then collected the duration was determined by the results of the preliminary experiments the fifth column was fed with gw for 35 v as a blank control without sulfidation 2 3 sampling and analysis during the 35 v reaction period pore water samples were collected at 1 v intervals solid phase samples were collected in high pure n2 99 999 environment from the sampling ports of the post reaction columns and sealed and preserved at 20 c solid samples were treated by vacuum freeze drying before analysis and all results are presented on a dry weight basis immediately after pore water samples were collected ph and redox potential were measured hach hq40d the concentrations of aqueous sulfide and as were analyzed by the methylene blue spectrophotometric method apha 1998 and hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs respectively 1 10 phenanthroline method was used to determined aqueous fe2 and total fe hydroxylamine hydrochloride was used as reductant apha 1998 solid phase total as and reactive solid phase fe extractions were performed by adding 50 ml of 1 m hcl to 2 g of sample and shaking for 1 h in unsealed container at 50 with ventilation extract remained transparent and free of precipitation total fe fe2 and as concentrations of extract were then determined in the same way as pore water fe3 concentrations were determined by subtracting the fe2 concentrations from the results of a total fe samples for scanning electron microscopy sem were mounted on aluminum based stubs coated with gold and rapidly transferred to a hitachi su8010 sem system to analyze surface morphology a laser micro raman spectrometer thermo scientific dxr was also used for secondary mineral identification excitation was provided by a 780 nm laser with the laser power varied between 0 5 and 3 mw to prevent excessive heating that could induce transformation of the sample hanesch 2009 mazzetti and thstlethwaite 2002 at least 10 test points were selected for each sample to obtain representative spectra and each test point was measured twice to ensure repeatability of the results a polyethylene standard sample was used to calibrate the raman frequency all samples were collected and measured in triplicate unless otherwise noted and the mean value were taken into account 3 results and discussion 3 1 aqueous phase sulfur and iron in both the fast and slow columns the sulfide concentration did not increase in a plug flow fashion but showed a gradual increase fig 1 concentrations from port 4 to port 10 were low and increased slowly results not shown in the slow columns fig 1a the sulfide concentration at port 1 obviously increased from the beginning of the reaction and reached a concentration of 300 mm at about 25 v at 21 v before the sulfide concentrations at slow port 1 peaked about 230 mm the sulfide concentrations at slow port 2 began to increase and reached a maximum at 35 v fig 1a in contrast to the slow columns the sulfides at fast ports 1 and fast port 2 peaked after only about 19 and 16 v respectively fig 1b sulfide can be trapped via three possible reaction pathways reacting with ferrihydrite to form elemental s s0 eq 1 poulton et al 2004 or with fe2 to form iron sulfide eqs 2 and 3 butler et al 2004 hunger and benning 2007 or with as to form as sulfide bostick et al 2004 newman et al 1997 o day et al 2004 the formation of these solid phase sulfides is directly or indirectly affected by as in the system campbell and nordstrom 2014 wolthers et al 2007 and thus the different sulfide evolution in the fast and slow columns may be attributed to differential partitioning of as 2 f e oh 3 h s 5 h 2 f e 2 s 0 6 h 2 o f e 2 h s f e s h fes s n 2 f e s 1 the pore water fe concentrations were low 0 03 mm in both the fast and slow columns despite fluctuations fig s2a effluent fe concentrations were maintained at about 0 002 mm fig s2b in the reaction between sulfide and ferrihydrite dissolution of fe2 is much slower than the oxidation of sulfide and the detachment of fe2 from the ferrihydrite surface is the overall rate limiting step poulton et al 2003 pyzik and sommer 1981 ph dependent detachment of fe2 also makes it difficult for surface fe2 to dissolve at high ph burton et al 2011 suter et al 1991 these two factors may account for the low pore water fe concentrations in the case of excess sulfide formation of fes precipitate eq 2 with poor solubility in alkaline environments rickard 2006 may also result in low dissolved iron concentrations 3 2 changes in iron mineralogy after 35 v the total solid fe in the fast and slow columns remained largely unchanged compared to the initial state fig s3a which is consistent with the minimal migration and release of fe in the pore water fig s1 this indicates that the transformation of as bearing ferrihydrite occurs in situ during the experiment the color of the solid phase in the 0 10 cm section at the inlet end hereinafter referred to as the heavily sulfidized zone of the column completely changed from initial orange to black and the downstream zone also showed slight blackening fig s4 corresponding to the color change hcl extractable fe iii in the heavily sulfidized zone of the fast column was negligible compared to the initial state and fe ii was the main form of fe fig s3b though low in content hcl extractable fe iii accounted for about 15 of total fe in the heavily sulfidized zone of the slow column fig s3c sem results show that apart from uniformity visual identification of secondary minerals is difficult due to the poor crystallinity in the heavily sulfidized zone of the slow column fig 2 these secondary minerals appear as aggregations of 100 nm platelets with porous structures similar to the amorphous mackinawite fesam eq 2 rickard 1997 however samples from the fast column show the presence of a widespread mesoporous hexagonal secondary mineral in addition to a small amount of fesam like minerals fig 2 this hexagonal feature gradually disappears from port fast port 1 to fast port 3 given the presence of mixture fe iii fe ii and high cl in the environment and the low as content in the heavily sulfidized zone fig 3 this mineral may be cl greenrust or a type of iron sulfide e g hexagonal pyrrhotite and pyrite pseudomorph after pyrrhotite the raman spectra of secondary minerals in the heavily sulfidized zone fig 4 port 1 3 of the slow columns are uniform the spectra show mackinawite peaks at 207 255 and 300 cm 1 bourdoiseau et al 2008 hansson et al 2006 and greigite peaks at approximately 350 and 370 cm 1 bourdoiseau et al 2008 the formation of greigite may be the reason for the existence of extractable fe iii in the heavily sulfidized zone fig s3c a set of strong ferrihydrite peaks at 360 505 and 700 cm 1 hanesch 2009 mazzetti and thstlethwaite 2002 are evident in samples from further downstream e g slow port 7 fig 4d indicating that ferrihydrite is still the main mineral in contrast the raman spectra of secondary minerals in the fast column vary with position in the heavily sulfidized zone fig 5 specifically two distinct types of raman spectra are evident for the minerals in section fast port 1 one with obvious peaks belonging to cyclic octamer s 8 0 at 84 152 218 437 and 472 cm 1 steudel et al 1981 ward 1968 and one with obvious asymmetric wide peaks coming from the mixture of mackinawite and greigite at 250 300 350 and 370 cm 1 garcía meza et al 2012 peaks in section fast port 2 represent s 8 0 hematite das and hendry 2011 hanesch 2009 at 220 290 401 498 and 604 cm 1 and mackinawite and greigite the spectra from samples from section fast port 3 are similar to those in section fast port 2 with obvious peaks indicating s 8 0 hematite and mackinawite and greigite further downstream fast port 7 ferrihydrite is also the major mineral note that the spectra from samples from the fast column do not show the characteristic peaks of pyrite main peaks at 345 and 384 cm 1 toniazzo et al 1999 or cl greenrust main peaks at 430 and 500 cm 1 tissier et al 2019 fig s5 so the pyrrhotite which is not raman active mernagh and trudu 1993 is the best description of widely distributed hexagonal minerals indicated in the sem images the formation of pyrrhotite a mineral considered stable at low temperatures kissin and scott 1982 will greatly limit the dissolution of fe s and other co precipitates caused by environmental fluctuations in fe s and o2 this observation is at odds with previous studies of sulfidation of fe oxide hydroxide in which mackinawite greigite goethite and magnetite were common products burton et al 2009 hunger and benning 2007 wilkin and ford 2006 the presence of pyrrhotite is not unprecedented as it has been observed in the products of interaction between hematite and sulfate reducing bacteria neal et al 2001 in addition as a metastable mineral mackinawite can be transformed to more stable pyrite in the presence of sulfur sources wan et al 2017 such as s0 or polysulfide benning et al 2000 hellige et al 2012 hunger and benning 2007 however this mineral transformation does not always happen as was the case in this study and alkaline ph wilkin and barnes 1997 the inhibition of as and the lack of crystal seeds wolthers et al 2007 may have contributed to the failure to form pyrite during the experiment the porewater in the heavily sulfidized zone had a period of supersaturation for the crystalline orpiment at both fs columns and ss columns fig s6 which means that the precipitation of orpiment was thermodynamically possible but the kinetics are slow under alkaline conditions kirk et al 2010 newman et al 1997 in addition the increase of sulfide concentration causes the pore water to become unsaturated again when the arsenic concentration was relatively stable the orpiment precipitation if present had dissolved at the end of the experiment in addition to precipite from supersaturated solutions local coordination environment similar to arsenic sulfide can be formed between arsenic and iron sulfide such as mackinawite bostick et al 2004 gallegos et al 2007 but anyway arsenic sulfide was not detectable by raman spectroscopy implying it was of negligible importance at the end of experiment 3 3 repartition of as between solution and minerals desorption resulted in slow control and fast control column effluent as concentrations reaching about 80 and 200 μm at 5 v respectively fig 6 a however desorption decreased exponentially with time by 35 v the effluent as concentration decreased to about 6 and 12 μm in the slow control and fast control columns respectively fig 6a the rapid decline in desorption indicates that part of the adsorbed as resides in a highly labile state that rapidly responds to disequilibrium fendorf et al 2010 arsenite is thought to bind to fe oxide hydroxide through a variety of inner sphere complexes of varying strength ona nguema et al 2005 in combination with outer sphere complexes and h bonded moieties giving rise to extensive but weak complexes huling et al 2017 as a consequence this fraction of arsenite can rapid desorb in response to decreases in aqueous concentrations caused by water flow therefore the faster flow in the fast control columns leads to stronger desorption correspondingly less residual as was present in the fast control column than in the slow control column fig 3a the introduction of sulfide led to a marked increase in the pore water as concentration in the slow columns compared to the slow control columns fig 6b the release of initially adsorbed as occupying a large proportion of active sites on the surface of the ferrihydrite could be initially driven by ligand exchange with sulfide followed by reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite it is also possible to generate highly soluble thioarsenite couture et al 2013 song et al 2015 zhao and jia 2017 in both slow and fast columns fig s6 in the slow column for example the thioarsenite may be generated at port 1 during 10 35 v fig s6 however it is difficult to determine the effect of thioarsenite on the release of as since the solid as content had been substantially reduced prior to the possible formation of thioarsenite fig 7 on the other hand the generation of thioarsenite in port 7 fig s6 did not result in a significant difference in solid as content between the experimental column and the blank control column fig 3 the situation of fast column was similar to that of slow column thus thioarsenite may have a limited contribution to release of as eventually the replacement of ferrihydrite by mackinawite and greigite has a decisive effect on the repartition of as in the heavily sulfidized zone the sorptive affinity of as for mackinawite is 3 6 orders of magnitude less than that of ferrihydrite smedley and kinniburgh 2002 wolthers et al 2005 and as such mackinawite was ineffective at immobilizing as although some studies reach contradictory conclusions han et al 2011 renock et al 2009 our findings of negligible solid as in the heavily sulfidized zone fig 3b 3c also indicate that mackinawite is not an effective as adsorbent although greigite is a relatively efficient as adsorbent wilkin and ford 2006 its presence in only small amounts failed to prevent the massive loss of as from the heavily sulfidized zone furthermore the increase of effluent as concentration in the slow columns relative to the slow control columns fig 6b indicates that as released from the heavily sulfidized zone was not retained again downstream as indicated by the almost identical solid as concentrations downstream in the slow and slow control columns fig 3b compared with fast control columns however as loss did not increase and was inhibited by sulfidation to some extent in the fast columns fig 6c similar to the slow columns as in the heavily sulfidized zone was almost completely released the secondary pyrrhotite in which the presence of vacancies gives it a high surface activity and adsorption capacity ekmekçi et al 2010 li et al 2013 lu et al 2006 widler and seward 2002 still failed to prevent the loss of as this may be because it takes some time for the formation of pyrrhotite as indicated by the gradual weakening of the hexagonal features from port fast port 1 to fast port 3 fig 2 during which as may lost other minerals such as s0 greigite and hematite also failed to prevent the release of as from the heavily sulfidized zone due to insufficient amounts or limited capacity however different from the slow columns as released by strong sulfidation was retained downstream in the fast columns resulting in higher solid as concentrations downstream in the fast columns than in the fast control columns fig 3c the reason for the difference in downstream as retention between the fast and slow columns is unclear although the transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite reduces the mobility of as pedersen et al 2006 the low pore water fe2 concentration at ph 8 in the present study cannot effectively catalyze the transformation as observed by burton et al 2011 in addition sem images and raman spectra show that goethite is not the main mineral downstream in the fast and slow columns and did not seem to be the cause of the difference 3 4 role of flow in sulfidation of as bearing ferrihydrite fe oxide hydroxide minerals with large surface area and thermodynamic instability such as ferrihydrite are susceptible to biological abiotic reduction reduction of fe iii within such phases does not lead to congruent dissolution but initiates the production of an intricate assortment of secondary minerals fendorf et al 2010 a complex combination of kinetic and thermodynamic factors controls whether a single thermodynamically stable mineral or a nonequilibrium mixture is the final product zachara et al 2002 in this experiment the as on the surface of the initial ferrihydrite represented about 75 of the maximum possible adsorption 200 mg g 1 fe kocar et al 2006 occupying most of the surface active sites the reduction of ferrihydrite by sulfide and the subsequent recrystallization may be restricted by the adsorbed as which stabilizes the poorly crystalline phase that has a large adsorption capacity campbell and nordstrom 2014 only after the adsorbed as is effectively removed can the sulfide fully react with the ferrihydrite the flow of water was critical to the desorption of as fig 6a the ligand exchange between sulfide and as kocar et al 2010 may also contribute to release of as at the end of the experiment the sulfide entering the columns was mainly captured in the heavily sulfidized zone from time s perspective the introduction rate of sulfide in fast column was higher than that in slow column the sulfide was retained at a faster rate in the fast columns as mentioned earlier s0 iron sulfide and as sulfide are three possible forms of solid phase s as sulfides may form in both saturated and unsaturated environments burton et al 2011 gallegos et al 2007 but no such secondary minerals were found in secondary minerals suggesting that the formation of s0 and iron sulfides rather than the precipitation of as sulfides may be the main reason for the difference in sulfide retention the main minerals in slow port 2 and slow port 3 were mackinawite and greigite and no significant s0 was observed which is counterintuitive considering that the production of mackinawite requires fe2 generated by the reduction of ferrihydrite and s0 will form with the production of fe2 eq 1 therefore the disappearance of s0 was largely due to its depletion in subsequent reactions e g with mackinawite to form greigite benning et al 2000 hunger and benning 2007 rickard and luther 2007 in stark contrast abundant s0 and hematite in addition to iron sulfides pyrrhotite and mackinawite were evident in ports port 2 and port 3 of the fast columns due to the stronger as release the sulfidation was initiated in an environment with less solid phase as taking port 2 as an example before the sulfidation started e g at 5 v the concentration of solid phase as in the fast and slow columns was about 40 and 77 μg g 1 26 and 48 of the maximum adsorption respectively fig 7 indicating that the effective ferrihydrite surface area in fast columns was higher than in the slow columns and faster sulfidation of ferrihydrite was therefore present in the fast column poulton et al 2003 and most of the introduced sulfide was consumed immediately eq 1 this faster sulfidation not only produced a large amount of s0 and fe2 but also led to deficient sulfide which limited the production of mackinawite and the subsequent consumption of s0 by mackinawite to form other iron sulfides eq 3 as such the presence of s0 can persist plentiful fe2 that has not been exhausted by forming mackinawite adsorbed and catalyzed the conversion of residual ferrihydrite into hematite fig 5 burton et al 2011 in the slow column the slower sulfidation leaved sufficient sulfide to support the generation of mackinawite and the consumption of countable fe2 eq 2 and s0 eq 3 the situation in port 1 of the columns was different the adsorbed as in both the fast and slow columns cannot be effectively removed because of the shorter release time and sulfidation of ferrihydrite was limited by effective surface area while that of sulfide was relatively abundant however the reaction products of s0 and mackinawite in the slow and fast columns were metastable greigite and stable hexagonal pyrrhotite respectively density functional theory dft calculations indicate the former is an exothermic reaction 19 3 kcal mol 1 and the latter is an endothermic reaction 11 3 kcal mol 1 li et al 2008 compared with greigite s fe 1 33 the lower s fe ratio s fe 1 11 in hexagonal pyrrhotite results in less s0 required for its formation which may be the main reason for the presence of s0 in 0 3 cm section in fast column but not slow column in simple terms hydrodynamic conditions controlled the surface activity of ferrihydrite by eluting the adsorbed as which indirectly affected the sulfidation and subsequent secondary mineralization pathways specially stronger hydrodynamic intensity appeared to induce specific reactions such as the production of hexagonal pyrrhotite further study is required to unravel exact mechanism of the observed difference in reaction pathways 4 conclusion and environmental significance our findings demonstrate that heavy sulfidation at both flow rates eventually results in almost complete release of the initial adsorbed as but the composition of the secondary minerals is different stronger water elution tends to provide an initial state with a lower solid as content in other words a higher ferrihydrite effective surface area for sulfidation leading to the reduction of ferrihydrite as the primary pathway by which the sulfide is trapped which also affects subsequent mineral transformation the most significant product of faster flow is pyrrhotite a stable adsorbent that does not appear to form rapidly under our experimental conditions overall our results suggest that the ratio of fe s and as in the system may be an important factor affecting the output of sulfidation in naturally contaminated aquifers sulfidation is affected by multiple factors one of the most important factors is the sulfide which usually comes from sulfate reducing bacteria srb the initial presence of high concentrations of as briones gallardo et al 2017 dowdle et al 1996 heavy metal kaksonen and puhakka 2007 labastida et al 2013 and the accumulation of sulfides teclu et al 2008 luo et al 2008 from srb reducing sulfates may be detrimental to the growth of srb and negatively impact the retention of arsenic accelerating the groundwater flow can dilute high concentrations toxic substances to facilitate the growth of srb and according to our experiments change the ratio fe s and as to affect the reaction pathways of the sulfidation however the groundwater velocities need to be optimized under various actual environmental conditions to achieve optimal

5489,the sulfidation of fe oxides hydroxides has an important effect on the migration and transformation of as in groundwater we examine the sulfidation of as iii bearing ferrihydrite and subsequent as repartitioning induced by sulfide in column experiments groundwater velocities has an obvious influence on sulfidation and the subsequent formation transformation of secondary minerals at a slower flow 1 pore volume d 1 adsorbed as blocks the ferrihydrite surface resulting in a slower sulfidation and thus slower generation of s0 and fe2 mackinawite is subsequently generated by reaction of fe2 with excess sulfide and then reacts with s0 to form greigite at a faster flow 5 pore volumes d 1 stronger water elution results in desorption of much of the adsorbed as faster sulfidation produces considerable amounts of s0 and fe2 and restricts the formation of mackinawite fe2 then adsorbs and catalyzes the conversion of residual ferrihydrite to hematite the mackinawite also reacts with s0 to form pyrrhotite rather than greigite overall heavy sulfidation does not effectively prevent the release of as caused by the reduction of ferrihydrite at either groundwater velocities sufficient as retention may be achieved by adjusting the hydrodynamic intensity of the system to determine the product of the sulfidation keywords arsenic ferrihydrite sulfidation hydrodynamic condition 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in groundwater has become an important environmental issue around the world the exact pathway by which as mobilization takes place in groundwater is quite complex the fe s as interaction induced by sulfide controls the fate of as in groundwater to a great extent field and laboratory based observations show that redox o day et al 2004 pi et al 2017 postma et al 2010 poulton et al 2004 ligand exchange kocar et al 2010 chemical substitution savage et al 2000 and precipitation reactions hunger and benning 2007 kirk et al 2010 can occur simultaneously or successively between sulfide and a variety of as bearing minerals as well as fe and as in the liquid phase all of which affect as solid solution partitioning fe s as interactions feature a variety of competing reaction pathways depending on the reactants themselves and also strongly on external environmental conditions such as ph co existing ions etc for example ph not only importantly affects the adsorption of as and co existing ions on fe oxides hydroxides fendorf et al 2010 but also some reaction pathways such as the catalytic transformation of ferrihydrite represented by feoh3 in the equation by fe2 burton et al 2011 wilkin et al 2006 zachara et al 2002 and the formation of pyrite benning et al 2000 wilkin and barnes 1997 realgar and orpiment kocar et al 2010 savage et al 2000 the adsorption of as and the transformation of metastable fe hydroxides are also affected by co existing ions such as po4 3 hco3 dixit and hering 2003 ni co zachara et al 2002 and rcho rickard et al 2001 the chemical forms and concentrations of as fe and s are also important factors determining the reaction pathways burton et al 2011 wan et al 2017 wolthers et al 2005 2007 yang et al 2010 the fate of geochemical elements are controlled by physical and chemical interactions the influence of physical factors such as advection on the fate of elements may not be limited to migration kocar et al 2010 show that advection promotes the accumulation of mackinawite and the release of as by continuously adding reactants to support sulfidation during biogenic sulfidation and transformation of ferrihydrite the reaction at the solid liquid interface is also affected by hydrodynamic conditions water advection can enhance the reduction of crystalline ferric iron oxide by relaxing thermodynamic constraints or surface passivation roden and urrutia 1999 roden et al 2000 the labile outer sphere complexes are sensitive to perturbations in flow conditions and arsenite present in outer sphere complexes on the surface of fe hydroxide can be released in large quantities kocar et al 2006 tufano and fendorf 2008 in addition the production of the polysulfide required for the formation of pyrite as an effective as adsorbent is controlled by diffusion which means that the reaction is limited by reactant transport hartler et al 1967 as mentioned above hydrodynamic conditions have a considerable influence on geochemical reactions but their role in fe s as systems remains unclear in this study we examined the effect of groundwater velocities on the sulfidation of as bearing fe iii minerals to achieve this objective we used as iii bearing ferrihydrite coated sand as the initial solid phase and carried out abiotic sulfidation column experiments at different groundwater velocities considering that high ph is a typical characteristic of many high as groundwater smedley and kinniburgh 2002 this study was conducted at alkaline ph as iii was used as the initial as oxidation state to eliminate the interference of increased as mobility caused by the reduction of as v on determining the effect of the groundwater velocities on as mobility burton et al 2011 the results provide a new perspective on the migration and transformation of as in fe s rich environments 2 methods 2 1 general methods all glass and plastic ware were cleaned by soaking in 10 v v hno3 for 24 h followed by repeated

generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs respectively 1 10 phenanthroline method was used to determined aqueous fe2 and total fe hydroxylamine hydrochloride was used as reductant apha 1998 solid phase total as and reactive solid phase fe extractions were performed by adding 50 ml of 1 m hcl to 2 g of sample and shaking for 1 h in unsealed container at 50 with ventilation extract remained transparent and free of precipitation total fe fe2 and as concentrations of extract were then determined in the same way as pore water fe3 concentrations were determined by subtracting the fe2 concentrations from the results of a total fe samples for scanning electron microscopy sem were mounted on aluminum based stubs coated with gold and rapidly transferred to a hitachi su8010 sem system to analyze surface morphology a laser micro raman spectrometer thermo scientific dxr was also used for secondary mineral identification excitation was provided by a 780 nm laser with the laser power varied between 0 5 and 3 mw to prevent excessive heating that could induce transformation of the sample hanesch 2009 mazzetti and thstlethwaite 2002 at least 10 test points were selected for each sample to obtain representative spectra and each test point was measured twice to ensure repeatability of the results a polyethylene standard sample was used to calibrate the raman frequency all samples were collected and measured in triplicate unless otherwise noted and the mean value were taken into account 3 results and discussion 3 1 aqueous phase sulfur and iron in both the fast and slow columns the sulfide concentration did not increase in a plug flow fashion but showed a gradual increase fig 1 concentrations from port 4 to port 10 were low and increased slowly results not shown in the slow columns fig 1a the sulfide concentration at port 1 obviously increased from the beginning of the reaction and reached a concentration of 300 mm at about 25 v at 21 v before the sulfide concentrations at slow port 1 peaked about 230 mm the sulfide concentrations at slow port 2 began to increase and reached a maximum at 35 v fig 1a in contrast to the slow columns the sulfides at fast ports 1 and fast port 2 peaked after only about 19 and 16 v respectively fig 1b sulfide can be trapped via three possible reaction pathways reacting with ferrihydrite to form elemental s s0 eq 1 poulton et al 2004 or with fe2 to form iron sulfide eqs 2 and 3 butler et al 2004 hunger and benning 2007 or with as to form as sulfide bostick et al 2004 newman et al 1997 o day et al 2004 the formation of these solid phase sulfides is directly or indirectly affected by as in the system campbell and nordstrom 2014 wolthers et al 2007 and thus the different sulfide evolution in the fast and slow columns may be attributed to differential partitioning of as 2 f e oh 3 h s 5 h 2 f e 2 s 0 6 h 2 o f e 2 h s f e s h fes s n 2 f e s 1 the pore water fe concentrations were low 0 03 mm in both the fast and slow columns despite fluctuations fig s2a effluent fe concentrations were maintained at about 0 002 mm fig s2b in the reaction between sulfide and ferrihydrite dissolution of fe2 is much slower than the oxidation of sulfide and the detachment of fe2 from the ferrihydrite surface is the overall rate limiting step poulton et al 2003 pyzik and sommer 1981 ph dependent detachment of fe2 also makes it difficult for surface fe2 to dissolve at high ph burton et al 2011 suter et al 1991 these two factors may account for the low pore water fe concentrations in the case of excess sulfide formation of fes precipitate eq 2 with poor solubility in alkaline environments rickard 2006 may also result in low dissolved iron concentrations 3 2 changes in iron mineralogy after 35 v the total solid fe in the fast and slow columns remained largely unchanged compared to the initial state fig s3a which is consistent with the minimal migration and release of fe in the pore water fig s1 this indicates that the transformation of as bearing ferrihydrite occurs in situ during the experiment the color of the solid phase in the 0 10 cm section at the inlet end hereinafter referred to as the heavily sulfidized zone of the column completely changed from initial orange to black and the downstream zone also showed slight blackening fig s4 corresponding to the color change hcl extractable fe iii in the heavily sulfidized zone of the fast column was negligible compared to the initial state and fe ii was the main form of fe fig s3b though low in content hcl extractable fe iii accounted for about 15 of total fe in the heavily sulfidized zone of the slow column fig s3c sem results show that apart from uniformity visual identification of secondary minerals is difficult due to the poor crystallinity in the heavily sulfidized zone of the slow column fig 2 these secondary minerals appear as aggregations of 100 nm platelets with porous structures similar to the amorphous mackinawite fesam eq 2 rickard 1997 however samples from the fast column show the presence of a widespread mesoporous hexagonal secondary mineral in addition to a small amount of fesam like minerals fig 2 this hexagonal feature gradually disappears from port fast port 1 to fast port 3 given the presence of mixture fe iii fe ii and high cl in the environment and the low as content in the heavily sulfidized zone fig 3 this mineral may be cl greenrust or a type of iron sulfide e g hexagonal pyrrhotite and pyrite pseudomorph after pyrrhotite the raman spectra of secondary minerals in the heavily sulfidized zone fig 4 port 1 3 of the slow columns are uniform the spectra show mackinawite peaks at 207 255 and 300 cm 1 bourdoiseau et al 2008 hansson et al 2006 and greigite peaks at approximately 350 and 370 cm 1 bourdoiseau et al 2008 the formation of greigite may be the reason for the existence of extractable fe iii in the heavily sulfidized zone fig s3c a set of strong ferrihydrite peaks at 360 505 and 700 cm 1 hanesch 2009 mazzetti and thstlethwaite 2002 are evident in samples from further downstream e g slow port 7 fig 4d indicating that ferrihydrite is still the main mineral in contrast the raman spectra of secondary minerals in the fast column vary with position in the heavily sulfidized zone fig 5 specifically two distinct types of raman spectra are evident for the minerals in section fast port 1 one with obvious peaks belonging to cyclic octamer s 8 0 at 84 152 218 437 and 472 cm 1 steudel et al 1981 ward 1968 and one with obvious asymmetric wide peaks coming from the mixture of mackinawite and greigite at 250 300 350 and 370 cm 1 garcía meza et al 2012 peaks in section fast port 2 represent s 8 0 hematite das and hendry 2011 hanesch 2009 at 220 290 401 498 and 604 cm 1 and mackinawite and greigite the spectra from samples from section fast port 3 are similar to those in section fast port 2 with obvious peaks indicating s 8 0 hematite and mackinawite and greigite further downstream fast port 7 ferrihydrite is also the major mineral note that the spectra from samples from the fast column do not show the characteristic peaks of pyrite main peaks at 345 and 384 cm 1 toniazzo et al 1999 or cl greenrust main peaks at 430 and 500 cm 1 tissier et al 2019 fig s5 so the pyrrhotite which is not raman active mernagh and trudu 1993 is the best description of widely distributed hexagonal minerals indicated in the sem images the formation of pyrrhotite a mineral considered stable at low temperatures kissin and scott 1982 will greatly limit the dissolution of fe s and other co precipitates caused by environmental fluctuations in fe s and o2 this observation is at odds with previous studies of sulfidation of fe oxide hydroxide in which mackinawite greigite goethite and magnetite were common products burton et al 2009 hunger and benning 2007 wilkin and ford 2006 the presence of pyrrhotite is not unprecedented as it has been observed in the products of interaction between hematite and sulfate reducing bacteria neal et al 2001 in addition as a metastable mineral mackinawite can be transformed to more stable pyrite in the presence of sulfur sources wan et al 2017 such as s0 or polysulfide benning et al 2000 hellige et al 2012 hunger and benning 2007 however this mineral transformation does not always happen as was the case in this study and alkaline ph wilkin and barnes 1997 the inhibition of as and the lack of crystal seeds wolthers et al 2007 may have contributed to the failure to form pyrite during the experiment the porewater in the heavily sulfidized zone had a period of supersaturation for the crystalline orpiment at both fs columns and ss columns fig s6 which means that the precipitation of orpiment was thermodynamically possible but the kinetics are slow under alkaline conditions kirk et al 2010 newman et al 1997 in addition the increase of sulfide concentration causes the pore water to become unsaturated again when the arsenic concentration was relatively stable the orpiment precipitation if present had dissolved at the end of the experiment in addition to precipite from supersaturated solutions local coordination environment similar to arsenic sulfide can be formed between arsenic and iron sulfide such as mackinawite bostick et al 2004 gallegos et al 2007 but anyway arsenic sulfide was not detectable by raman spectroscopy implying it was of negligible importance at the end of experiment 3 3 repartition of as between solution and minerals desorption resulted in slow control and fast control column effluent as concentrations reaching about 80 and 200 μm at 5 v respectively fig 6 a however desorption decreased exponentially with time by 35 v the effluent as concentration decreased to about 6 and 12 μm in the slow control and fast control columns respectively fig 6a the rapid decline in desorption indicates that part of the adsorbed as resides in a highly labile state that rapidly responds to disequilibrium fendorf et al 2010 arsenite is thought to bind to fe oxide hydroxide through a variety of inner sphere complexes of varying strength ona nguema et al 2005 in combination with outer sphere complexes and h bonded moieties giving rise to extensive but weak complexes huling et al 2017 as a consequence this fraction of arsenite can rapid desorb in response to decreases in aqueous concentrations caused by water flow therefore the faster flow in the fast control columns leads to stronger desorption correspondingly less residual as was present in the fast control column than in the slow control column fig 3a the introduction of sulfide led to a marked increase in the pore water as concentration in the slow columns compared to the slow control columns fig 6b the release of initially adsorbed as occupying a large proportion of active sites on the surface of the ferrihydrite could be initially driven by ligand exchange with sulfide followed by reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite it is also possible to generate highly soluble thioarsenite couture et al 2013 song et al 2015 zhao and jia 2017 in both slow and fast columns fig s6 in the slow column for example the thioarsenite may be generated at port 1 during 10 35 v fig s6 however it is difficult to determine the effect of thioarsenite on the release of as since the solid as content had been substantially reduced prior to the possible formation of thioarsenite fig 7 on the other hand the generation of thioarsenite in port 7 fig s6 did not result in a significant difference in solid as content between the experimental column and the blank control column fig 3 the situation of fast column was similar to that of slow column thus thioarsenite may have a limited contribution to release of as eventually the replacement of ferrihydrite by mackinawite and greigite has a decisive effect on the repartition of as in the heavily sulfidized zone the sorptive affinity of as for mackinawite is 3 6 orders of magnitude less than that of ferrihydrite smedley and kinniburgh 2002 wolthers et al 2005 and as such mackinawite was ineffective at immobilizing as although some studies reach contradictory conclusions han et al 2011 renock et al 2009 our findings of negligible solid as in the heavily sulfidized zone fig 3b 3c also indicate that mackinawite is not an effective as adsorbent although greigite is a relatively efficient as adsorbent wilkin and ford 2006 its presence in only small amounts failed to prevent the massive loss of as from the heavily sulfidized zone furthermore the increase of effluent as concentration in the slow columns relative to the slow control columns fig 6b indicates that as released from the heavily sulfidized zone was not retained again downstream as indicated by the almost identical solid as concentrations downstream in the slow and slow control columns fig 3b compared with fast control columns however as loss did not increase and was inhibited by sulfidation to some extent in the fast columns fig 6c similar to the slow columns as in the heavily sulfidized zone was almost completely released the secondary pyrrhotite in which the presence of vacancies gives it a high surface activity and adsorption capacity ekmekçi et al 2010 li et al 2013 lu et al 2006 widler and seward 2002 still failed to prevent the loss of as this may be because it takes some time for the formation of pyrrhotite as indicated by the gradual weakening of the hexagonal features from port fast port 1 to fast port 3 fig 2 during which as may lost other minerals such as s0 greigite and hematite also failed to prevent the release of as from the heavily sulfidized zone due to insufficient amounts or limited capacity however different from the slow columns as released by strong sulfidation was retained downstream in the fast columns resulting in higher solid as concentrations downstream in the fast columns than in the fast control columns fig 3c the reason for the difference in downstream as retention between the fast and slow columns is unclear although the transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite reduces the mobility of as pedersen et al 2006 the low pore water fe2 concentration at ph 8 in the present study cannot effectively catalyze the transformation as observed by burton et al 2011 in addition sem images and raman spectra show that goethite is not the main mineral downstream in the fast and slow columns and did not seem to be the cause of the difference 3 4 role of flow in sulfidation of as bearing ferrihydrite fe oxide hydroxide minerals with large surface area and thermodynamic instability such as ferrihydrite are susceptible to biological abiotic reduction reduction of fe iii within such phases does not lead to congruent dissolution but initiates the production of an intricate assortment of secondary minerals fendorf et al 2010 a complex combination of kinetic and thermodynamic factors controls whether a single thermodynamically stable mineral or a nonequilibrium mixture is the final product zachara et al 2002 in this experiment the as on the surface of the initial ferrihydrite represented about 75 of the maximum possible adsorption 200 mg g 1 fe kocar et al 2006 occupying most of the surface active sites the reduction of ferrihydrite by sulfide and the subsequent recrystallization may be restricted by the adsorbed as which stabilizes the poorly crystalline phase that has a large adsorption capacity campbell and nordstrom 2014 only after the adsorbed as is effectively removed can the sulfide fully react with the ferrihydrite the flow of water was critical to the desorption of as fig 6a the ligand exchange between sulfide and as kocar et al 2010 may also contribute to release of as at the end of the experiment the sulfide entering the columns was mainly captured in the heavily sulfidized zone from time s perspective the introduction rate of sulfide in fast column was higher than that in slow column the sulfide was retained at a faster rate in the fast columns as mentioned earlier s0 iron sulfide and as sulfide are three possible forms of solid phase s as sulfides may form in both saturated and unsaturated environments burton et al 2011 gallegos et al 2007 but no such secondary minerals were found in secondary minerals suggesting that the formation of s0 and iron sulfides rather than the precipitation of as sulfides may be the main reason for the difference in sulfide retention the main minerals in slow port 2 and slow port 3 were mackinawite and greigite and no significant s0 was observed which is counterintuitive considering that the production of mackinawite requires fe2 generated by the reduction of ferrihydrite and s0 will form with the production of fe2 eq 1 therefore the disappearance of s0 was largely due to its depletion in subsequent reactions e g with mackinawite to form greigite benning et al 2000 hunger and benning 2007 rickard and luther 2007 in stark contrast abundant s0 and hematite in addition to iron sulfides pyrrhotite and mackinawite were evident in ports port 2 and port 3 of the fast columns due to the stronger as release the sulfidation was initiated in an environment with less solid phase as taking port 2 as an example before the sulfidation started e g at 5 v the concentration of solid phase as in the fast and slow columns was about 40 and 77 μg g 1 26 and 48 of the maximum adsorption respectively fig 7 indicating that the effective ferrihydrite surface area in fast columns was higher than in the slow columns and faster sulfidation of ferrihydrite was therefore present in the fast column poulton et al 2003 and most of the introduced sulfide was consumed immediately eq 1 this faster sulfidation not only produced a large amount of s0 and fe2 but also led to deficient sulfide which limited the production of mackinawite and the subsequent consumption of s0 by mackinawite to form other iron sulfides eq 3 as such the presence of s0 can persist plentiful fe2 that has not been exhausted by forming mackinawite adsorbed and catalyzed the conversion of residual ferrihydrite into hematite fig 5 burton et al 2011 in the slow column the slower sulfidation leaved sufficient sulfide to support the generation of mackinawite and the consumption of countable fe2 eq 2 and s0 eq 3 the situation in port 1 of the columns was different the adsorbed as in both the fast and slow columns cannot be effectively removed because of the shorter release time and sulfidation of ferrihydrite was limited by effective surface area while that of sulfide was relatively abundant however the reaction products of s0 and mackinawite in the slow and fast columns were metastable greigite and stable hexagonal pyrrhotite respectively density functional theory dft calculations indicate the former is an exothermic reaction 19 3 kcal mol 1 and the latter is an endothermic reaction 11 3 kcal mol 1 li et al 2008 compared with greigite s fe 1 33 the lower s fe ratio s fe 1 11 in hexagonal pyrrhotite results in less s0 required for its formation which may be the main reason for the presence of s0 in 0 3 cm section in fast column but not slow column in simple terms hydrodynamic conditions controlled the surface activity of ferrihydrite by eluting the adsorbed as which indirectly affected the sulfidation and subsequent secondary mineralization pathways specially stronger hydrodynamic intensity appeared to induce specific reactions such as the production of hexagonal pyrrhotite further study is required to unravel exact mechanism of the observed difference in reaction pathways 4 conclusion and environmental significance our findings demonstrate that heavy sulfidation at both flow rates eventually results in almost complete release of the initial adsorbed as but the composition of the secondary minerals is different stronger water elution tends to provide an initial state with a lower solid as content in other words a higher ferrihydrite effective surface area for sulfidation leading to the reduction of ferrihydrite as the primary pathway by which the sulfide is trapped which also affects subsequent mineral transformation the most significant product of faster flow is pyrrhotite a stable adsorbent that does not appear to form rapidly under our experimental conditions overall our results suggest that the ratio of fe s and as in the system may be an important factor affecting the output of sulfidation in naturally contaminated aquifers sulfidation is affected by multiple factors one of the most important factors is the sulfide which usually comes from sulfate reducing bacteria srb the initial presence of high concentrations of as briones gallardo et al 2017 dowdle et al 1996 heavy metal kaksonen and puhakka 2007 labastida et al 2013 and the accumulation of sulfides teclu et al 2008 luo et al 2008 from srb reducing sulfates may be detrimental to the growth of srb and negatively impact the retention of arsenic accelerating the groundwater flow can dilute high concentrations toxic substances to facilitate the growth of srb and according to our experiments change the ratio fe s and as to affect the reaction pathways of the sulfidation however the groundwater velocities need to be optimized under various actual environmental conditions to achieve optimal
