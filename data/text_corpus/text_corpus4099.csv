20495,quantifying the risk of system failure is a key input to a risk based decision making process for the in service integrity management of aging steel catenary risers scrs which are prone to fatigue failure within the touchdown zone tdz however in practice the computational cost of assessing the probability of failure pof for scrs is prohibitive in this paper we propose an efficient framework for quantifying the fatigue pof within the scr tdz by using the bayesian machine learning technique adopting gaussian processes gp for regression gp based predictive models perform stochastic response prediction rapidly and are therefore attractive for rapid evaluation of the scr fatigue pof in this paper we introduce innovative techniques for predicting fatigue damage profiles within the scr tdz generated by an irregular sea state applied to the host vessel at its mean offset position and for dimensionality reduction in the regression analysis we utilize a realistic case study to demonstrate the framework which consists of a representative 20 scr connected to a semi submersible host vessel located in 950 m water depth in addition we use a site specific 32 year hindcast wave data and 1 year measured current data with associated statistical distributions for the long term fatigue loading conditions we also employ numerical simulation and a random sampling technique to create simulation based input and output datasets for training and testing of the derived probabilistic simulation based surrogate the results show that the proposed method is able to predict the fatigue life of the representative riser efficiently and accurately finally we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method by rapidly generating the fatigue pof for the 20 scr considering the uncertainties associated with input loads material properties geometric parameters and soil stiffness keywords riser scr fatigue assessment integrity management probabilistic assessments machine learning bayesian gaussian processes regression simulation based surrogates 1 introduction in recent decades several operators in the oil and gas industry have employed steel catenary risers scrs in deep water field developments enuganti et al 2011 many of these risers are now approaching their design operational life scrs are prone to fatigue failure campbell 1999 within their touchdown zone tdz where the riser departs the seabed fig 1 which is a region not readily accessible for inspection in order to assess their condition cook et al 2006 as a result operational integrity management of scrs has recently become more critical in order to ensure safe operations as part of a life extension program in service integrity management im of assets is a process for ensuring the ongoing fitness for purpose of structures throughout their operational life cook et al 2006 an efficient strategy for undertaking im is to adopt a risk based approach which makes use of the probability of failure pof for entering various limit states including fatigue failure in order to prioritize resource allocation and support the decision making process api 2014 however for scrs quantifying the fatigue pof is challenging because it requires that a large number of computationally expensive numerical simulations are performed elosta 2013 to facilitate such assessments one solution is to develop an efficient predictive model using a technique such as machine learning ml in a ml application a mathematical model may be trained rapidly using observed input and output datasets in order to predict outputs corresponding to unseen input data murphy 2012 in recent years researchers have been exploring the application of surrogate models which are trained by data from numerical simulations in order to replace computationally expensive finite element models and hence expedite engineering assessments for instance chojaczyk et al 2015 provided a review of studies conducted since the early 1990s on the application of artificial neural networks anns to the reliability analysis of steel structures other studies have explored the use of various surrogate models such as anns guarize et al 2007 wavelet network models de pina et al 2014 and nonlinear autoregressive models de pina et al 2013 for the analysis and design of slender offshore structures including mooring lines and marine risers monsalve giraldo et al 2018 francis and chaves 2018 hao wu et al 2019 chen and low 2021 similarly for the fatigue assessment of scrs qu√©au et al 2015 proposed a method that uses nine anns to approximate the maximum dynamic stress range within the tdz of a scr they created a database using numerical simulations in order to establish training and test data for developing the surrogate model although the suggested model can rapidly predict the peak dynamic stress range for various scr configurations it is limited to a regular input wave excitation which restricts its use for practical applications cortina et al 2018 suggested a more practical ann based surrogate model for the fatigue analysis of scrs based on irregular wave loading this method referred to as a hybrid fea ann by the authors requires that the ann is trained for each riser element and each load case using a 500s response time series obtained from a finite element analysis fea the anns are then used to forecast response over a 3 hr storm duration to enable a riser fatigue assessment to be undertaken for that storm although this approach is 20 times faster than adopting a full fea cortina et al 2018 the need to train one ann for each load case and each riser element potentially limits its application for the probabilistic fatigue assessment of scrs while the abovementioned studies suggest deterministic surrogate models recently developed stochastic surrogate models have shown promising results for using probabilistic analysis in offshore engineering problems for instance astfalck et al 2019 developed a statistical surrogate using the gaussian process gp concept rasmussen et al 2006 for stochastic prediction of the offsets of a ship shaped floating offshore facility subjected to ocean wave wind and current loads the gps can rapidly conduct nonlinear regression which is the process of estimating the relationship between dependent and independent variables or predictors gelman et al 2013 in high dimensional spaces prior knowledge may be incorporated in the development of the surrogate model and the output used to perform stochastic response prediction i e predict the long term probability density function pdf of a response of interest this is a powerful tool for rapid probabilistic structural assessment the main aim of this study is to propose an efficient framework for implementing the gp concept to rapidly quantify the fatigue pof within the tdz of a scr we utilize a realistic case study to demonstrate the method comprised of a representative 20 scr connected to a pontoon of a semi submersible host vessel located at a deep water site on the australian north west shelf nws in addition we use a 32 year hindcast wave dataset consisting of irregular seas swells and associated winds and a 1 yr measured current dataset with associated statistical distributions to establish a representative long term fatigue loading condition for the floating system we employ the latin hypercube sampling lhs technique shonkwiler and mendivil 2000 to randomly sample a dataset of input vectors from the input domain the lhs method guarantees the selection of samples from the entire input domain which is critical for training predictive models to avoid inaccurate extrapolation then we use commercially available fea software to perform numerical nonlinear dynamic simulations and estimate the stress time series at critical points along the scr a novel feature extraction technique is then proposed to create an output vector with only two dimensions for any given input vector next we adopt standard probabilistic programming and machine learning modules within python salvatier et al 2016 pedregosa et al 2011 to train and test several gps in order to form the probabilistic simulation based surrogates sbs needed to rapidly estimate the stochastic fatigue damage profile within the scr tdz when the host vessel is subjected to an irregular sea state this analysis is able to capture the damage spreading effects due to the migration of the touchdown point tdp induced by changes in the vessel mean offset during different sea states as described in hejazi 2021 finally in order to demonstrate the power of this approach we assess the effect of quantified uncertainties in the material geometry and soil stiffness input parameters on the fatigue life pdf for the representative 20 scr this could then be used as an input to a decision making process for risk based im of the scr furthermore the im methodology can be readily extended through the bayesian updating framework to incorporate full scale data on the performance of the scr or other relevant knowledge like vessel motion monitoring thereby materially improving the risk based approach the background theory and details of the proposed calculation framework are described briefly in the following two sections 2 background theory this section reviews the theoretical background of the key concepts used in this study 2 1 scr fatigue analysis fatigue failure is a structural failure mode in which micro cracks form and grow under cyclic tensile loadings at locations with defects such as welded joints the micro cracks reduce structural capacity until components cannot withstand normally applied loads a conventional method for estimating fatigue life is the s n curve method dnv 2012 1 n a s m where a and m are element specific coefficients derived by experiments s is the constant amplitude stress range and n is the number of cycles to failure at stress range s obtained from equation 1 s is often magnified by a stress concentration factor scf to account for the impact of geometrical irregularities on the distribution of the stress at the cross section of interest dnv 2012 for n regular stress cycles with an amplitude of s 2 the fatigue damage is estimated as n n for stress cycles with varying amplitudes the rainflow counting rfc method almar naess 1985 is typically combined with miner s rule miner 1945 to provide an accurate framework for estimating the total fatigue damage the rfc algorithm bins stress cycles into constant amplitude stress ranges si with a corresponding number of cycles of ni and then the total annual fatigue damage is estimated as dt ni ni finally the inverse of the total fatigue damage provides the fatigue life dnv 2010 an alternative approach to estimating fatigue damage due to a stress time history over a duration of time t is a spectral fatigue analysis in the frequency domain barltrop and adams 2013 this method combines the stress range spectrum defined the in frequency domain with a probabilistic representation of fatigue damage dnv 2010 in order to estimate the fatigue damage due to the stress time history 2 d t s e c f 0 a e s m f 0 a 0 s m f s s d s where f 0 is the mean number of the stress cycles per unit time and f s s is the probability distribution function of the stress cycles for instance for a narrow band stress spectrum with rayleigh distributed stress peaks and hence stress cycle amplitudes the fatigue damage per unit time is given by barltrop and adams 2013 3 d 1 t z a 2 2 œÉ s t d m Œ≥ m 2 1 where a and m are the s n curve coefficients and Œ≥ is the incomplete gamma function in addition the measured quantities tz and œÉstd are the mean zero crossing period and the standard deviation of stress values respectively the most accurate method for fatigue assessment of nonlinear scrs is to use the rfc method described above as their stress response is irregular adopting a more simplified model such as one presented in equation 3 may introduce some inaccuracy to the overall fatigue damage assessment total fatigue damage at scr critical points induced by the motions of a host vessel can be assessed explicitly the first step is to calculate the stress time series along scrs by performing dynamic numerical simulation these simulations are cumbersome and hence prohibitive in calculation of scrs fatigue pof machine learning techniques provide an alternative to enable structural risk assessment of scrs 2 2 gaussian process regression machine learning is the process of using observed data to train mathematical models in order to automatically detect patterns and perform specific tasks for example ml can be readily used for regression in which an output y of an unknown function f which corresponds to an input x is predicted murphy 2012 one powerful approach for regression is to employ the bayesian framework that interprets the probability as a degree of belief and employs bayes theorem gelman et al 2013 4 p œà y p y œà p œà p y to update a prior belief p œà or pdf of model parameters œà to a posterior belief p œà y using observed data y gaussian process regression gpr rasmussen et al 2006 makes use of this concept to perform supervised ml to learn the unknown functional relationship y f x between a given input x and output data y gpr models an unknown function f as a gaussian process gp prior and returns a univariate output from a set of n dimensional inputs in other words the output is a gaussian predictive distribution for f that is conditioned on its input vector rasmussen et al 2006 although the input domain can be continuous in practice we use a finite set of input and output data for both training and prediction and employ mean and covariance functions m and k respectively to express the gp priors mathematically 5 f x œà g p m x k x x where œà represents the vector of all unknown coefficients parameters of the two functions while the mean function models the global trends such as an upward or downward trend the covariance function controls the local variations of the underlying functions such as smoothness and periodicity rasmussen et al 2006 given a n dimensional set of input and output data x x1 xn y y1 yn the specific mean and covariance functions evaluated over the input data represent the prior likelihood of the output data in the form of a n dimensional multivariate normal mvn distribution 6 y x œà m v n Œº œÉ where m m x1 m xn is the mean vector and i j k xi xj is the covariance matrix of the multivariate distribution respectively then we update the prior belief by utilizing an optimizing algorithm such as maximum a posteriori map estimate gelman et al 2013 and the observed output data y1 yn to produce the posterior likelihood of the output data finally for predicting a new output y corresponding to an unseen input x we estimate the conditional distribution of the posterior as the probabilistic predictive model which returns a predictive mean Œº e y and a predictive variance œÉ2 var y 7 y x x y œà n Œº œÉ 2 appendix a provides a full mathematical formulation of the regression process in brief the gpr process includes the selection of functions for mean m and covariance k with unknown coefficients the selection of prior distributions for the hyper parameters the set of the model coefficients determination of the hyper parameters utilizing bayesian inference and finally determination of the probabilistic predictive models by evaluating the conditional posterior distributions for illustration fig 2 provides an example for nonlinear regression using gp where the blue lines represent the various realization of the gp trained using the observed data inside the training range 0 10 the predicted means closely follow the true function dashed line outside of the training regions x 10 the predicted mean approaches the mean function of the gp here m x 0 with a significantly larger predicted variance gpr provides significant benefits for adopting predictive models in engineering problems any prior knowledge on the behaviour of underlying functions or physics of the problem under consideration can be incorporated through the selection of appropriate mean and covariance functions lawrence et al 2019 these models indicate their poor performance within regions of the domain space where the model training is not adequate by returning high prediction variances the probabilistic nature of gpr models make them suitable for probabilistic and risk based engineering assessments the next section describes the proposed framework for implementing the gpr method to predict the scr fatigue responses 3 development of the scr probabilistic simulation based surrogates fig 3 shows the overall framework that we propose to use to develop a probabilistic simulation based surrogate sbs for rapid scr fatigue analysis a sbs is a data driven predictive tool constructed using the outputs of a simulator here we develop the scr probabilistic sbs by employing the bayesian updating concept further details are provided below 3 1 problem definition the first step for developing a sbs is to determine the target quantity for prediction based on the requirements of the im programs here the objective is to conduct a probabilistic fatigue assessment at the hotspot location within the tdz of a representative scr in other words the role of the trained sbs is not to predict the scr fatigue damage at every location along the scr but at one specific point that is the most critical for scr im the following sections provide a description of the floating system used in this study and the quantity of interest selected for developing the probabilistic sbs 3 1 1 floating system description we have selected a floating system consisting of a representative semi submersible with sample motion rao presented in fig 4 and a 20 scr with properties listed in table 1 connected to the pontoon of the host vessel at the hang off point via a flexible joint with a rotational stiffness of 100 kn m deg in addition we assume a 16 mooring line anchor spread at a representative 950 m deep site on the australian northwest shelf nws 3 1 2 quantity of interest the tdz fatigue performance of scrs is a critical component of riser im because it is not accessible for inspection during its operational life therefore we take the fatigue damage profile at the tdz fatigue hotspot of the scr at the critical riser circumferential angle of Œ∏ 180 shown in fig 5 as the quantity of interest for prediction fig 6 a illustrates two sample damage profiles within the scr tdz due to different loading conditions where the total fatigue damage per hour against the riser arc length al measured from the hang off point fig 1 is shown in order to expedite the calculations here we introduce an innovative technique to represent the tdz damage curve to approximate a tdz damage curve due to an input sea state we predict the damage at several points along the scr tdz within a few meters of the location of maximum damage the critical al alcrit and fit a quadratic curve to the points as illustrated in fig 6 over a short length of the scr the variation in fatigue damage including the peak is well represented by a quadratic for the regions outside the tdz we conservatively assume that the hourly damage remains constant at the boundary value either side of alcrit fig 7 although the location of the critical point changes due to host vessel offsets in different loading conditions here we adopt the al of the nominal tdp st i e the tdp for the scr static state under gravity load only which is a known system property to select the fixed prediction points for any loading condition the actual critical location falls within a few meters 4 6 m either side of this al during operational sea states fig 6 b shows the variation in damage along the scr versus the al normalized by st in the sample cases shown here the critical points for different sea states are all located near the nominal tdp we select six points with a 2 m spacing around and including the nominal tdp as fixed points for response prediction the quadratic response curve is then fit to the calculated damage values for the given loading condition then following the approach in hejazi 2021 we adjust the location of the critical point by predicting the alcrit and slide the response plot using the critical point shift Œ¥1 8 Œ¥ 1 a l c r i t s t 1 similarly to adjust for shift in the location of the critical point due to a vessel mean offset resulting from stoke s drift wind and current forces we calculate the offset shift Œ¥2 using the predicted in line mean vessel offset offset 9 Œ¥ 2 o f f s e t Œ≤ s t 1 where Œ≤ is also an analytically calculated system parameter sparks 2007 based on the value of the scr hang off point angle Œ∏t 90 Œ∏hp 10 Œ≤ 1 2 t a n Œ∏ t s i n h 1 t a n Œ∏ t cos Œ∏ t 1 cos Œ∏ t in summary we select six fixed points within the scr tdz namely p1 to p6 outlined in table 2 and illustrated in fig 6 b to approximate the damage profile due to a sea state using a quadratic curve we then assume that the damage profile outside of the tdz remains constant at the boundary value as shown in fig 7 the curve is then offset along the horizontal axis by total shift value of Œ¥1 Œ¥2 to adjust the location of the peak damage due to the input sea state finally we construct the total damage profile by adding the shifted individual damage profiles to achieve this we train individual gps for predicting responses at p1 to p6 critical arc length alcrit and the inline host vessel offset offset due to an input sea state by using the methodology described below 3 2 input parameters the input parameters to the scr probabilistic sbs are those that affect the quantity of interest we form an input vector x from the seabed stiffness within the tdz and the environmental variables listed in table 3 as input to training the gps x hs tp Œ∏w uwind Œ∏wind ucur Œ∏cur k from which the damage profile due to a sea state may be predicted we employ statistical distributions to present the domains and account for the variability of input parameters for waves a full hindcast dataset 32 years presents the long term wave conditions in the representative site with a joint distribution of significant wave heights hs and peak period tp shown in fig 8 we adopt the jonswap spectrum to describe the irregular wave conditions for numerical simulations with peakedness parameter Œ≥ 1 5 and 2 5 for seas and swells respectively as the representative values for the region of interest wind seas and swell waves are statistically uncorrelated at the site and are hence treated separately similarly fig 9 presents the distribution of the wind and surface current data adopted here although it can be observed that speed and direction can be considered statistically correlated over some ranges of input domain for both data sets for simplicity we assume statistical independence finally to represent seabed stiffness in the tdz for a typical site at 950 m water depth on the nws we select a linear soil stiffness to model the riser seabed interaction after hejazi et al 2018a with values that follows a log uniform distribution with lower and upper bounds of 100 kpa and 5000 kpa respectively 3 3 sampling the input domain the aim for sampling the input domain is to create data sets for training and validating the gps for regression we use the latin hypercube sampling technique lhs shonkwiler and mendivil 2000 for drawing random samples from the input domains to guarantee that samples are obtained from the entire likely domain and more samples are drawn from regions with a larger likelihood we first construct the empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs from the marginal probability distribution of all eight input parameters next we draw 200 samples from each cdf to establish the training and validation datasets for illustration table 3 lists the randomly generated inputs for five simulation cases 3 4 numerical simulation the aim of this step is to produce the output values corresponding to 200 randomly generated sets of inputs using numerical simulation we employ the commercial finite element analysis fea software orcaflex orcina 2018 to obtain the stress time histories at the critical point of the 20 scr due to each sampled sea state by conducting a rigorous 3d nonlinear time domain dynamic analysis we undertake a rao response amplitude operators motion analysis at the host vessel mean offset to incorporate the vessel motion characteristics into the riser structural analysis with the same assumptions as used in hejazi et al 2019 in addition we estimate fatigue damage values at critical points using the s n curve approach per section 2 1 with a dnv d class imperfection curve dnv 2012 and a stress concentration factor of unity 3 5 dimensionality reduction the aim of this step is to extract the key response features needed for the regression process in order to reduce the complexity of the analysis and increase the efficiency of the proposed method fig 10 illustrates a typical stress response a stress time series at the scr fatigue hotspot due a representative sea state and suitably trained predictive models should be able to produce such responses although several methods exist for predicating a time series such as duvenaud 2014 here we propose a novel approach to reduce the complexity of the regression process for practical use by reducing the dimension of response stress time series to a feature vector with only two elements hejazi et al 2018b demonstrated good agreement between fatigue damage estimates within the tdz of scrs calculated using a time domain approach rfc method and a spectral method in other words it may be assumed that the stress responses within the tdz of scrs follow a narrow banded gaussian distribution with amplitudes peaks that follow a rayleigh distribution therefore for a given stress time series one can estimate the expected scr fatigue damage at the tdz analytically using equation 3 we argue that output stress feature vector tz œÉstd contains sufficient information for the purposes of fatigue analysis one objective of the trained sbs is to predict the stress feature vectors tz œÉstd at the six selected points along the scr tdz for a given input vector x from which the corresponding fatigue damages may be calculated via equation 3 in addition examining the stress responses due to a given sea state at various points within the scr tdz reveals that the generated tz values are almost identical for every point whereas the value of œÉstd varies throughout this implies that when predicting the stress response at locations p1 to p6 we only need to train one gp to predict the tz value for a given input sea state and six gps to predict the second component œÉstd one for each location finally as illustrated in table 4 an additional two gps are trained to predict offset and alcrit defined in section 3 1 2 giving nine gps which are trained to predict nine parameters for constructing the fatigue damage profile within the scr tdz due to a given input sea state 3 6 data preparation the aim of this step is to prepare the input and output datasets for use in training and validation of the gp regression models by normalizing the input data and splitting it into training and validation datasets here we use 200 data points a relatively modest number for traditional ml applications firstly we normalize the input dataset to enhance the stability of the optimization algorithms during the learning process murphy 2012 we select the maximum values of each sampled input variable for normalization of the input vectors with the values listed in table 5 for the case studied here secondly in order to reduce the bias in predicting the future unseen values we randomly split the entire dataset 200 input vectors and corresponding output vectors into a training 150 data points and validation dataset 50 data points the scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 pre processing module of python s machine learning library is used to normalize the input vectors and split the data for training and testing the gps 3 7 model selection the aim of this step is to select the mean and covariance functions for the nine gps used to predict output variables as discussed we select nine gps to predict the components needed to construct the fatigue damage profile within the 20 scr tdz due to an input sea state these include six gps namely gp p1 to gp p6 that predict the œÉstd at the selected points p1 p6 within the tdz and gp p7 to gp p9 to predict tz offset and alcrit respectively using the eight input parameters listed in table 3 although the input vector x hs tp Œ∏w uwind Œ∏wind ucur Œ∏cur k has eight parameters we only select those found to have significant impact on the output response when training the gps since using a gp with higher input dimensions requires more training data for an accurate prediction here we only have 150 training points and thus we try to maximize accuracy by reducing the gp number of input parameters dimension or dim as demonstrated in hejazi 2021 the input wind speed and direction has minimal impact on the magnitude of œÉstd as such here we consider gp pi to be six dimensional dim 6 this defines the input vector as x œÉstd x1 hs x2 tp x3 Œ∏w x4 ucur x5 Œ∏cur x6 k table 6 lists the name dimension and the input parameters of all other gps for every dimension xi of the input vectors x of each gp we employ the following squared exponential se covariance function following duvenaud 2014 11 k i x i x i Œ∑ i 2 exp x i x i 2 2 ‚Ñì i ‚Ñì i 0 where ‚Ñì 0 is the characteristic length scale governing the output function smoothness as detailed in rasmussen et al 2006 and Œ∑ is the scale parameter determining the scale of the output function then we define the global covariance function for each gp as the product of individual covariance function for each dimension 12 k x x i 1 d i m k i x i x i for all gps we select a zero mean function m x 0 as discussed in appendix a while within the training range of gps the prediction mean is determined by gps covariance function k x x equation a 12 out of their training range the gps prediction mean converges to values obtained by the mean function m x as illustrated in fig 2 here to avoid accidental large error in predictions we select zero mean function finally we use the training dataset to find the optimized model parameter values where the gp prediction error is minimised 3 8 model training the aim of this step is to determine the model parameters by minimizing the prediction errors for the training datasets regression is a supervised machine learning process in which known input and corresponding output data are used to tune the parameters in order to minimise model under and over fit murphy 2012 in this study we employ the probabilistic programming module of python pymc3 salvatier et al 2016 to train the gps following duvenaud 2014 chen and wang 2018 first we select gamma and half cauchy distributions as the priors for the ses parameters length scale ‚Ñì and scale parameter Œ∑ respectively next we assume initial values for the fixed parameters of gamma and half cauchy distributions and employ optimization algorithms to find the ‚Ñì and Œ∑ values for the gps at the map points this is a trial and error process that we repeat until the mean squared error mse of the gps converge this approach is common for similar types of probabilistic regression problems as described in rasmussen et al 2006 and murphy 2012 finally we verify the accuracy of the trained gps by using the validation dataset 3 9 model validation the aim of this step is to examine the adequacy of sbss here gps to predict the outputs corresponding to the unseen input vectors we perform validation by comparing the results obtained from orcaflex the 3d fe simulator and the sbs using the validation dataset visualisation of the sbs outputs for inspection is not possible due to the high input dimensionality therefore we utilize several of the statistical diagnostics presented in bastos et al 2009 to test convergence i e we examine prediction intervals individual prediction errors and prediction variances in addition to these measures which will help to diagnose common issues in the performance of the gps to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed methodology we undertake a full fatigue analysis using orcaflex for an additional 283 sea states and compare this to the results of the trained sbs the overall process is summarized in fig 11 and the corresponding results are presented in the next section 4 results and discussion 4 1 model training results as discussed in the previous section the training step determines the optimized values of the sbs parameters which are the coefficients of the se covariance functions ‚Ñìi and Œ∑i for each gp table 7 lists these values for the 6 dimensionl gp œÉstd at the nominal tdp p4 with values for the remainder of the gps presented in appendix b these numbers may be interpreted in terms of the sensitivity of the underlying predictive functions realized by gps to variations in the input variables referring to the se covariance function equation 12 the correlation between two input values of any xi located 4‚Ñìi apart is practically zero 0 0003 as such for any input a larger length scale implies a lower rate of change in the response surface realized by gp in the direction of the input for instance the length scale parameter for hs is 1 01 and for tp is 0 29 ‚Ñì hs and ‚Ñì tp in table 7 this indicates that the expected value of stress range œÉstd at the location of the nominal tdp varies with a slower rate with variation of the peak period compared with variation of the significant wave height in this case current speed and direction has the largest length scale among all the inputs here we use the water speed and direction at the sea surface to scale a pre defined linear current profile following hejazi 2021 for a more realistic prediction a measure of the current profile shape could be included in the input vector finally the calculated model parameters are then used to validate the gps using the validation dataset as described in the next section 4 2 model validation and diagnostic we conduct model validation to examine the adequacy of the trained gps to predict the nine outputs defined in section 3 1 2 for constructing the damage profile within the tdz of the 20 scr due to unseen input vectors for this we employ the input validation dataset the corresponding results from the fea orcaflex simulations output dataset and the three gp diagnostic measures described in section 3 9 4 2 1 prediction intervals firstly we utilize the prediction intervals to identify potential structure in the errors of the gps for instance regular over or under prediction for input values in fig 12 we plot the values of œÉstd at the nominal tdp p4 obtained from the fea orcaflex simulations against the gp p4 prediction intervals the mid points of the prediction intervals show the mean value of the gp prediction Œº and length of the vertical lines indicate the variance of the gp predictions with the interval length of Œº 2œÉ Œº 2œÉ with a smaller length indicating a higher confidence in the gp prediction a systematic over or under prediction would be evidenced by the mean values on one side of the identity line 1 1 line in fig 7 which does not occur here the ideal case would be to have all intervals vertical lines crossing the identity line at the mid point with a relatively short total length fig c 1 in appendix c presents the gp prediction intervals for the remaining eight outputs the results show that there is a good overall agreement between the gp predictions and the orcaflex results there are regions where the gps return predictions with higher variance for example the gp tz in fig c 1 within the region of tz 8 12 s such larger discrepancies are likely associated with the lhs sampling method employed here which generates more training data within the input space with larger likelihood consequently the gps predict more accurate results for inputs located near the peak of the input statistical distributions such as the hs tp joint distribution fig 8 in summary the prediction intervals show that there is no systematic error in the gp predictions and they perform well within the regions of interest in the input space i e the parameter values which generate the bulk of the long term damage 4 2 2 prediction variance secondly we use the prediction variance measure to examine whether the trained gps are accurate enough to be statistically meaningful at a selected threshold here following bastos et al 2009 we compare the empirical distribution of the gp predictive variances with the threshold defined as the 5 percent of the total output variances from the fea orcaflex simulations fig 13 a depicts the empirical density of the predictive var œÉstd at the nominal tdp p4 and its corresponding threshold vertical line at 0 43 which shows that 98 of the predicted data lies beneath the limit similarly as shown in fig c 2 the corresponding percentages for tz offset and alcrit are 100 96 and 73 respectively suggesting that the majority of the predictions are statistically accurate at the selected threshold as noted in section 4 2 1 gps exhibit a larger variance within regions with a lower number of training data points thus we expect to observe such values because of the random lhs technique adopted to generate training data points overall we find the prediction of the gps accurate within the regions of interest in the input domain space 4 2 3 individual prediction error lastly we employ standardized individual prediction errors to examine the level of agreement between the fea orcaflex simulations and the gp predictions the difference between the orcaflex outputs and the gp mean values normalized by the gp predictive standard deviation defines the standardized error bastos et al 2009 for each gp prediction as detailed in bastos et al 2009 given the gaussian assumptions used for gps the standardized error should follow a normal distribution therefore error values located within reasonable probability bounds for a standard normal distribution such as 3 3 standard deviations from a zero mean indicate good agreement between the outputs of orcaflex and the trained gps fig 13 b illustrates the comparison between the standard normal distribution dashed curve and the empirical density of the output gp œÉstd at point p4 for this case 86 of the validation data points are calculated to be within the expected 3 3 standard deviation interval similarly fig c 3 shows this percentage for other gps the results indicate good agreement between the outputs of orcaflex and the trained gps for the majority of the validation data the orcaflex model of the riser system is highly nonlinear and default assumptions such as model homogeneity or gaussian distributed outputs used in regression with gps may not hold true and thus lead to disagreement between the orcaflex and gp outputs despite this as shown in table 8 the absolute values of average error for the gps are reasonably low and hence considered acceptable for estimating the riser fatigue damage in other words as illustrated in fig 12 and fig c 1 some responses are over predicted and some under predicted by the gps with errors that are normally distributed and therefore it is expected that the overall error will be small when the cumulative effects are considered in the riser fatigue analysis 4 3 validation of the proposed methodology after undertaking model validation and diagnostics for the gps we examine the overall accuracy of the final output of the proposed probabilistic sbs detailed in fig 11 by comparing the fatigue life of the representative scr calculated using the rigorous fea orcaflex simulation and the validated model here following hejazi 2021 we select 283 representative irregular sea states different from the training and validation dataset with associated wind and current soil stiffness of 1000 kpa and a s n curve with m 3 and log a 11 764 to estimate the expected annual fatigue damage at the critical point of the riser for illustration fig 14 compares the fatigue damage profile at the tdz of the scr generated by both fea orcaflex simulation and the sbs mean prediction for a single representative operating sea state it demonstrates a good accuracy of the sbs in predicting both location and magnitude of the generated fatigue damage similarly fig 15 plots the fatigue life of the 20 scr within the riser tdz estimated by fea orcaflex simulation and the critical fatigue life range estimated by the probabilistic sbs the resulting critical fatigue life values are listed in table 9 here the mean high and low prediction values refer to the fatigue life of the scr estimated using the predictive mean of the gps and the predictive mean plus or minus two predictive standard deviations respectively we consider the performance of the proposed method to be accurate from a practical viewpoint with the more accurate results obtained from the combined fea rfc method 26 years located within the predictive two standard deviation interval 20 29 years and the predictive mean fatigue life of 24 years very close to the fea results 7 conservative comparing the run times for the two methods 20 h are needed to complete the combined fea rfc calculation on a standard pc set up cpu 3 4 ghz and ram 32 gb for fatigue analysis using a wave scatter diagram whereas the trained probabilistic sbs predicts the fatigue life within seconds this rapid run time for the sbs thus unlocks the potential to undertake a scr quantitative risk assessment as part of an im framework such as performing monte carlo simulations for quantifying the uncertainties associated with the fatigue life within the scr tdz 4 4 use in practice quantification of tdz fatigue life uncertainty here we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method for the quantitative risk assessment of scr fatigue failure we employ the trained probabilistic sbs to rapidly construct the cumulative distribution

thickness wt are considered to be deterministic values because of the strict specifications normally used during the manufacture of line pipes table 10 lists the statistical distributions of random variables selected here based on industry guidelines such as dnv 1992 we utilize the monte carlo simulation method shonkwiler and mendivil 2000 to conduct probabilistic estimation of the scr fatigue life by propagating uncertainties of the input parameters through the calculation process as follows firstly we finely discretise the long term joint probability distribution of hs tp fig 8 and select a large number of irregular sea states about 300 and corresponding annual probability of occurrence for the representative swell dominant region on the australian nws these parameters represent the annual expected wave conditions at the site where the wave direction is drawn randomly from the marginal cdf constructed from the long term hindcast wave data fig 16 similarly after hejazi 2021 for each representative sea state we select wind and current parameters speed and direction by randomly drawing samples from their marginal cdfs shown in fig 17 after constructing the irregular wave scatter diagram including wind and current we set up the cdf of other random variables seabed stiffness log a parameter and the scf in the case of the latter the standard relationship between scf and pipeline geometrical parameters is employed dnv 2012 13 s c f 1 3 Œ¥ m w t e w t o d to construct the pdf and cdf of the scf by randomly sampling from the uniform distribution of Œ¥m and calculating the associated value if this is repeated many times 100 000 the scf statistical distributions may be accurately constructed finally we conduct the monte carlo simulation by repeatedly sampling 10 000 times from the constructed cdfs of k log a and scf shown in fig 18 along with a representative full wave scatter diagram fig 8 and use these values as inputs into the trained probabilistic sbs developed for riser fatigue life in addition we verify the convergence of the simulation by plotting the statistics of the predictive fatigue life as the simulation progresses for illustration fig 19 plots the convergence of the mean value of the predictive mean fatigue life fig 20 illustrates the final product of the monte carlo simulation combined with the sbs which are probabilistic distributions of the mean fl m low mean minus two standard deviation fl l and high mean plus two standard deviation fl h predictive fatigue lives the corresponding statistical distribution parameters are listed in table 11 the variability between the fl l fl m and fl h measures is due to the sbs uncertainty model uncertainties in predicting the stress range at the critical point of the scr conversely variability in the predicted fatigue lives for either of these distributions results from the propagation of k log a and scf uncertainties in the estimation of the fatigue life for illustration the adopted variation in parameter log a fig 18 a may be taken to represent the uncertainty is selecting an appropriate s n curve class here we cover the range of dnv curve c and d classes where the log a values of c c1 c2 and d are 11 764 11 901 12 049 and 12 192 respectively dnv 2012 similarly the adopted uncertainty in parameters k fig 18 b and scf fig 18 c are equivalent to selecting a soil stiffness and scf value within the range of about 300 1500 kpa and 1 to 1 24 the accurate fatigue life of 26 years presented in section 4 3 is calculated using a single input for these parameters k 1000 kpa log a 11 764 and scf 1 the resulting mean value of the fl m fatigue probability distribution is illustrated in fig 20 c the combined effect of introducing the noted uncertainty into these parameters results in a potential fatigue life range of Œºfl l 28 1 yrs Œºfl h 41 8 yrs with a Œºfl m fatigue life of 36 5 years in this case combining a lower bound value of scf 1 with upper bound values for k 1000 and log a 11 764 in the accurate deterministic calculation results in a scr fatigue life approximately 30 smaller than the mean value calculated when parameter uncertainty is introduced in brief using the bayesian ml approach such as the probabilistic sbss developed here enables quantitative risk based assessment of scr fatigue failure by enabling rapid generation of the scr fatigue life cdf fig 21 this approach is practically impossible using conventional fea combined with rfc owing to the long simulation time required for each set of input parameters the approach unlocks the potential for more efficient decision making in the im of the deep water risers in addition the methodology could be readily extended to enable the integration of any new field data into the risk based approach via a bayesian updating framework gelman et al 2013 5 conclusion while the in service integrity management of scrs will benefit significantly from quantitative assessment of the risk of fatigue failure in practice the use of computationally expensive numerical simulations makes such assessment infeasible motivated by enabling rapid quantification of the probability of fatigue failure within the scr tdz here we have proposed an efficient framework for predicting the fatigue damage profile within the scr tdz in a stochastic manner resulting from irregular input sea states we have introduced an innovative method for dimensionality reduction in the prediction of stress time series and a systematic approach for developing and verifying probabilistic simulation based surrogates using the gaussian process concept for predicting the scr damage profile the trained predictive model offers a significant run time advantage by reducing the response prediction time for a single set of inputs from 1 to 2 h using fea orcaflex simulation to 20 ms this enables the rapid implementation of monte carlo techniques for quantifying the probability of failure we have demonstrated the accuracy and usefulness of the proposed framework using a realistic case study where we quantify the probability distribution of the fatigue life of a representative scr attached to a host vessel at a typical nws location the presented method relies on the results obtained from fea simulations on the training and validation input data sets in order to accurately calculate riser response outputs however as an alternative the observed input metocean conditions combined with field data obtained from an installed riser monitoring system may be used to train the response model instead of using fea in a similar vein the proposed method can also enable the predicted probability distributions to be updated using new field data to provide real

20495,quantifying the risk of system failure is a key input to a risk based decision making process for the in service integrity management of aging steel catenary risers scrs which are prone to fatigue failure within the touchdown zone tdz however in practice the computational cost of assessing the probability of failure pof for scrs is prohibitive in this paper we propose an efficient framework for quantifying the fatigue pof within the scr tdz by using the bayesian machine learning technique adopting gaussian processes gp for regression gp based predictive models perform stochastic response prediction rapidly and are therefore attractive for rapid evaluation of the scr fatigue pof in this paper we introduce innovative techniques for predicting fatigue damage profiles within the scr tdz generated by an irregular sea state applied to the host vessel at its mean offset position and for dimensionality reduction in the regression analysis we utilize a realistic case study to demonstrate the framework which consists of a representative 20 scr connected to a semi submersible host vessel located in 950 m water depth in addition we use a site specific 32 year hindcast wave data and 1 year measured current data with associated statistical distributions for the long term fatigue loading conditions we also employ numerical simulation and a random sampling technique to create simulation based input and output datasets for training and testing of the derived probabilistic simulation based surrogate the results show that the proposed method is able to predict the fatigue life of the representative riser efficiently and accurately finally we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method by rapidly generating the fatigue pof for the 20 scr considering the uncertainties associated with input loads material properties geometric parameters and soil stiffness keywords riser scr fatigue assessment integrity management probabilistic assessments machine learning bayesian gaussian processes regression simulation based surrogates 1 introduction in recent decades several operators in the oil and gas industry have employed steel catenary risers scrs in deep water field developments enuganti et al 2011 many of these risers are now approaching their design operational life scrs are prone to fatigue failure campbell 1999 within their touchdown zone tdz where the riser departs the seabed fig 1 which is a region not readily accessible for inspection in order to assess their condition cook et al 2006 as a result operational integrity management of scrs has recently become more critical in order to ensure safe operations as part of a life extension program in service integrity management im of assets is a process for ensuring the ongoing fitness for purpose of structures throughout their operational life cook et al 2006 an efficient strategy for undertaking im is to adopt a risk based approach which makes use of the probability of failure pof for entering various limit states including fatigue failure in order to prioritize resource allocation and support the decision making process api 2014 however for scrs quantifying the fatigue pof is challenging because it requires that a large number of computationally expensive numerical simulations are performed elosta 2013 to facilitate such assessments one solution is to develop an efficient predictive model using a technique such as machine learning ml in a ml application a mathematical model may be trained rapidly using observed input and output datasets in order to predict outputs corresponding to unseen input data murphy 2012 in recent years researchers have been exploring the application of surrogate models which are trained by data from numerical simulations in order to replace computationally expensive finite element models and hence expedite engineering assessments for instance chojaczyk et al 2015 provided a review of studies conducted since the early 1990s on the application of artificial neural networks anns to the reliability analysis of steel structures other studies have explored the use of various surrogate models such as anns guarize et al 2007 wavelet network models de pina et al 2014 and nonlinear autoregressive models de pina et al 2013 for the analysis and design of slender offshore structures including mooring lines and marine risers monsalve giraldo et al 2018 francis and chaves 2018 hao wu et al 2019 chen and low 2021 similarly for the fatigue assessment of scrs qu√©au et al 2015 proposed a method that uses nine anns to approximate the maximum dynamic stress range within the tdz of a scr they created a database using numerical simulations in order to establish training and test data for developing the surrogate model although the suggested model can rapidly predict the peak dynamic stress range for various scr configurations it is limited to a regular input wave excitation which restricts its use for practical applications cortina et al 2018 suggested a more practical ann based surrogate model for the fatigue analysis of scrs based on irregular wave loading this method referred to as a hybrid fea ann by the authors requires that the ann is trained for each riser element and each load case using a 500s response time series obtained from a finite element analysis fea the anns are then used to forecast response over a 3 hr storm duration to enable a riser fatigue assessment to be undertaken for that storm although this approach is 20 times faster than adopting a full fea cortina et al 2018 the need to train one ann for each load case and each riser element potentially limits its application for the probabilistic fatigue assessment of scrs while the abovementioned studies suggest deterministic surrogate models recently developed stochastic surrogate models have shown promising results for using probabilistic analysis in offshore engineering problems for instance astfalck et al 2019 developed a statistical surrogate using the gaussian process gp concept rasmussen et al 2006 for stochastic prediction of the offsets of a ship shaped floating offshore facility subjected to ocean wave wind and current loads the gps can rapidly conduct nonlinear regression which is the process of estimating the relationship between dependent and independent variables or predictors gelman et al 2013 in high dimensional spaces prior knowledge may be incorporated in the development of the surrogate model and the output used to perform stochastic response prediction i e predict the long term probability density function pdf of a response of interest this is a powerful tool for rapid probabilistic structural assessment the main aim of this study is to propose an efficient framework for implementing the gp concept to rapidly quantify the fatigue pof within the tdz of a scr we utilize a realistic case study to demonstrate the method comprised of a representative 20 scr connected to a pontoon of a semi submersible host vessel located at a deep water site on the australian north west shelf nws in addition we use a 32 year hindcast wave dataset consisting of irregular seas swells and associated winds and a 1 yr measured current dataset with associated statistical distributions to establish a representative long term fatigue loading condition for the floating system we employ the latin hypercube sampling lhs technique shonkwiler and mendivil 2000 to randomly sample a dataset of input vectors from the input domain the lhs method guarantees the selection of samples from the entire input domain which is critical for training predictive models to avoid inaccurate extrapolation then we use commercially available fea software to perform numerical nonlinear dynamic simulations and estimate the stress time series at critical points along the scr a novel feature extraction technique is then proposed to create an output vector with only two dimensions for any given input vector next we adopt standard probabilistic programming and machine learning modules within python salvatier et al 2016 pedregosa et al 2011 to train and test several gps in order to form the probabilistic simulation based surrogates sbs needed to rapidly estimate the stochastic fatigue damage profile within the scr tdz when the host vessel is subjected to an irregular sea state this analysis is able to capture the damage spreading effects due to the migration of the touchdown point tdp induced by changes in the vessel mean offset during different sea states as described in hejazi 2021 finally in order to demonstrate the power of this approach we assess the effect of quantified uncertainties in the material geometry and soil stiffness input parameters on the fatigue life pdf for the representative 20 scr this could then be used as an input to a decision making process for risk based im of the scr furthermore the im methodology can be readily extended through the bayesian updating framework to incorporate full scale data on the performance of the scr or other relevant knowledge like vessel motion monitoring thereby materially improving the risk based approach the background theory and details of the proposed calculation framework are described briefly in the following two sections 2 background theory this section reviews the theoretical background of the key concepts used in this study 2 1 scr fatigue analysis fatigue failure is a structural failure mode in which micro cracks form and grow under cyclic tensile loadings at locations with defects such as welded joints the micro cracks reduce structural capacity until components cannot withstand normally applied loads a conventional method for estimating fatigue life is the s n curve method dnv 2012 1 n a s m where a and m are element specific coefficients derived by experiments s is the constant amplitude stress range and n is the number of cycles to failure at stress range s obtained from equation 1 s is often magnified by a stress concentration factor scf to account for the impact of geometrical irregularities on the distribution of the stress at the cross section of interest dnv 2012 for n regular stress cycles with an amplitude of s 2 the fatigue damage is estimated as n n for stress cycles with varying amplitudes the rainflow counting rfc method almar naess 1985 is typically combined with miner s rule miner 1945 to provide an accurate framework for estimating the total fatigue damage the rfc algorithm bins stress cycles into constant amplitude stress ranges si with a corresponding number of cycles of ni and then the total annual fatigue damage is estimated as dt ni ni finally the inverse of the total fatigue damage provides the fatigue life dnv 2010 an alternative approach to estimating fatigue damage due to a stress time history over a duration of time t is a spectral fatigue analysis in the frequency domain barltrop and adams 2013 this method combines the stress range spectrum defined the in frequency domain with a probabilistic representation of fatigue damage dnv 2010 in order to estimate the fatigue damage due to the stress time history 2 d t s e c f 0 a e s m f 0 a 0 s m f s s d s where f 0 is the mean number of the stress cycles per unit time and f s s is the probability distribution function of the stress cycles for instance for a narrow band stress spectrum with rayleigh distributed stress peaks and hence stress cycle amplitudes the fatigue damage per unit time is given by barltrop and adams 2013 3 d 1 t z a 2 2 œÉ s t d m Œ≥ m 2 1 where a and m are the s n curve coefficients and Œ≥ is the incomplete gamma function in addition the measured quantities tz and œÉstd are the mean zero crossing period and the standard deviation of stress values respectively the most accurate method for fatigue assessment of nonlinear scrs is to use the rfc method described above as their stress response is irregular adopting a more simplified model such as one presented in equation 3 may introduce some inaccuracy to the overall fatigue damage assessment total fatigue damage at scr critical points induced by the motions of a host vessel can be assessed explicitly the first step is to calculate the stress time series along scrs by performing dynamic numerical simulation these simulations are cumbersome and hence prohibitive in calculation of scrs fatigue pof machine learning techniques provide an alternative to enable structural risk assessment of scrs 2 2 gaussian process regression machine learning is the process of using observed data to train mathematical models in order to automatically detect patterns and perform specific tasks for example ml can be readily used for regression in which an output y of an unknown function f which corresponds to an input x is predicted murphy 2012 one powerful approach for regression is to employ the bayesian framework that interprets the probability as a degree of belief and employs bayes theorem gelman et al 2013 4 p œà y p y œà p œà p y to update a prior belief p œà or pdf of model parameters œà to a posterior belief p œà y using observed data y gaussian process regression gpr rasmussen et al 2006 makes use of this concept to perform supervised ml to learn the unknown functional relationship y f x between a given input x and output data y gpr models an unknown function f as a gaussian process gp prior and returns a univariate output from a set of n dimensional inputs in other words the output is a gaussian predictive distribution for f that is conditioned on its input vector rasmussen et al 2006 although the input domain can be continuous in practice we use a finite set of input and output data for both training and prediction and employ mean and covariance functions m and k respectively to express the gp priors mathematically 5 f x œà g p m x k x x where œà represents the vector of all unknown coefficients parameters of the two functions while the mean function models the global trends such as an upward or downward trend the covariance function controls the local variations of the underlying functions such as smoothness and periodicity rasmussen et al 2006 given a n dimensional set of input and output data x x1 xn y y1 yn the specific mean and covariance functions evaluated over the input data represent the prior likelihood of the output data in the form of a n dimensional multivariate normal mvn distribution 6 y x œà m v n Œº œÉ where m m x1 m xn is the mean vector and i j k xi xj is the covariance matrix of the multivariate distribution respectively then we update the prior belief by utilizing an optimizing algorithm such as maximum a posteriori map estimate gelman et al 2013 and the observed output data y1 yn to produce the posterior likelihood of the output data finally for predicting a new output y corresponding to an unseen input x we estimate the conditional distribution of the posterior as the probabilistic predictive model which returns a predictive mean Œº e y and a predictive variance œÉ2 var y 7 y x x y œà n Œº œÉ 2 appendix a provides a full mathematical formulation of the regression process in brief the gpr process includes the selection of functions for mean m and covariance k with unknown coefficients the selection of prior distributions for the hyper parameters the set of the model coefficients determination of the hyper parameters utilizing bayesian inference and finally determination of the probabilistic predictive models by evaluating the conditional posterior distributions for illustration fig 2 provides an example for nonlinear regression using gp where the blue lines represent the various realization of the gp trained using the observed data inside the training range 0 10 the predicted means closely follow the true function dashed line outside of the training regions x 10 the predicted mean approaches the mean function of the gp here m x 0 with a significantly larger predicted variance gpr provides significant benefits for adopting predictive models in engineering problems any prior knowledge on the behaviour of underlying functions or physics of the problem under consideration can be incorporated through the selection of appropriate mean and covariance functions lawrence et al 2019 these models indicate their poor performance within regions of the domain space where the model training is not adequate by returning high prediction variances the probabilistic nature of gpr models make them suitable for probabilistic and risk based engineering assessments the next section describes the proposed framework for implementing the gpr method to predict the scr fatigue responses 3 development of the scr probabilistic simulation based surrogates fig 3 shows the overall framework that we propose to use to develop a probabilistic simulation based surrogate sbs for rapid scr fatigue analysis a sbs is a data driven predictive tool constructed using the outputs of a simulator here we develop the scr probabilistic sbs by employing the bayesian updating concept further details are provided below 3 1 problem definition the first step for developing a sbs is to determine the target quantity for prediction based on the requirements of the im programs here the objective is to conduct a probabilistic fatigue assessment at the hotspot location within the tdz of a representative scr in other words the role of the trained sbs is not to predict the scr fatigue damage at every location along the scr but at one specific point that is the most critical for scr im the following sections provide a description of the floating system used in this study and the quantity of interest selected for developing the probabilistic sbs 3 1 1 floating system description we have selected a floating system consisting of a representative semi submersible with sample motion rao presented in fig 4 and a 20 scr with properties listed in table 1 connected to the pontoon of the host vessel at the hang off point via a flexible joint with a rotational stiffness of 100 kn m deg in addition we assume a 16 mooring line anchor spread at a representative 950 m deep site on the australian northwest shelf nws 3 1 2 quantity of interest the tdz fatigue performance of scrs is a critical component of riser im because it is not accessible for inspection during its operational life therefore we take the fatigue damage profile at the tdz fatigue hotspot of the scr at the critical riser circumferential angle of Œ∏ 180 shown in fig 5 as the quantity of interest for prediction fig 6 a illustrates two sample damage profiles within the scr tdz due to different loading conditions where the total fatigue damage per hour against the riser arc length al measured from the hang off point fig 1 is shown in order to expedite the calculations here we introduce an innovative technique to represent the tdz damage curve to approximate a tdz damage curve due to an input sea state we predict the damage at several points along the scr tdz within a few meters of the location of maximum damage the critical al alcrit and fit a quadratic curve to the points as illustrated in fig 6 over a short length of the scr the variation in fatigue damage including the peak is well represented by a quadratic for the regions outside the tdz we conservatively assume that the hourly damage remains constant at the boundary value either side of alcrit fig 7 although the location of the critical point changes due to host vessel offsets in different loading conditions here we adopt the al of the nominal tdp st i e the tdp for the scr static state under gravity load only which is a known system property to select the fixed prediction points for any loading condition the actual critical location falls within a few meters 4 6 m either side of this al during operational sea states fig 6 b shows the variation in damage along the scr versus the al normalized by st in the sample cases shown here the critical points for different sea states are all located near the nominal tdp we select six points with a 2 m spacing around and including the nominal tdp as fixed points for response prediction the quadratic response curve is then fit to the calculated damage values for the given loading condition then following the approach in hejazi 2021 we adjust the location of the critical point by predicting the alcrit and slide the response plot using the critical point shift Œ¥1 8 Œ¥ 1 a l c r i t s t 1 similarly to adjust for shift in the location of the critical point due to a vessel mean offset resulting from stoke s drift wind and current forces we calculate the offset shift Œ¥2 using the predicted in line mean vessel offset offset 9 Œ¥ 2 o f f s e t Œ≤ s t 1 where Œ≤ is also an analytically calculated system parameter sparks 2007 based on the value of the scr hang off point angle Œ∏t 90 Œ∏hp 10 Œ≤ 1 2 t a n Œ∏ t s i n h 1 t a n Œ∏ t cos Œ∏ t 1 cos Œ∏ t in summary we select six fixed points within the scr tdz namely p1 to p6 outlined in table 2 and illustrated in fig 6 b to approximate the damage profile due to a sea state using a quadratic curve we then assume that the damage profile outside of the tdz remains constant at the boundary value as shown in fig 7 the curve is then offset along the horizontal axis by total shift value of Œ¥1 Œ¥2 to adjust the location of the peak damage due to the input sea state finally we construct the total damage profile by adding the shifted individual damage profiles to achieve this we train individual gps for predicting responses at p1 to p6 critical arc length alcrit and the inline host vessel offset offset due to an input sea state by using the methodology described below 3 2 input parameters the input parameters to the scr probabilistic sbs are those that affect the quantity of interest we form an input vector x from the seabed stiffness within the tdz and the environmental variables listed in table 3 as input to training the gps x hs tp Œ∏w uwind Œ∏wind ucur Œ∏cur k from which the damage profile due to a sea state may be predicted we employ statistical distributions to present the domains and account for the variability of input parameters for waves a full hindcast dataset 32 years presents the long term wave conditions in the representative site with a joint distribution of significant wave heights hs and peak period tp shown in fig 8 we adopt the jonswap spectrum to describe the irregular wave conditions for numerical simulations with peakedness parameter Œ≥ 1 5 and 2 5 for seas and swells respectively as the representative values for the region of interest wind seas and swell waves are statistically uncorrelated at the site and are hence treated separately similarly fig 9 presents the distribution of the wind and surface current data adopted here although it can be observed that speed and direction can be considered statistically correlated over some ranges of input domain for both data sets for simplicity we assume statistical independence finally to represent seabed stiffness in the tdz for a typical site at 950 m water depth on the nws we select a linear soil stiffness to model the riser seabed interaction after hejazi et al 2018a with values that follows a log uniform distribution with lower and upper bounds of 100 kpa and 5000 kpa respectively 3 3 sampling the input domain the aim for sampling the input domain is to create data sets for training and validating the gps for regression we use the latin hypercube sampling technique lhs shonkwiler and mendivil 2000 for drawing random samples from the input domains to guarantee that samples are obtained from the entire likely domain and more samples are drawn from regions with a larger likelihood we first construct the empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs from the marginal probability distribution of all eight input parameters next we draw 200 samples from each cdf to establish the training and validation datasets for illustration table 3 lists the randomly generated inputs for five simulation cases 3 4 numerical simulation the aim of this step is to produce the output values corresponding to 200 randomly generated sets of inputs using numerical simulation we employ the commercial finite element analysis fea software orcaflex orcina 2018 to obtain the stress time histories at the critical point of the 20 scr due to each sampled sea state by conducting a rigorous 3d nonlinear time domain dynamic analysis we undertake a rao response amplitude operators motion analysis at the host vessel mean offset to incorporate the vessel motion characteristics into the riser structural analysis with the same assumptions as used in hejazi et al 2019 in addition we estimate fatigue damage values at critical points using the s n curve approach per section 2 1 with a dnv d class imperfection curve dnv 2012 and a stress concentration factor of unity 3 5 dimensionality reduction the aim of this step is to extract the key response features needed for the regression process in order to reduce the complexity of the analysis and increase the efficiency of the proposed method fig 10 illustrates a typical stress response a stress time series at the scr fatigue hotspot due a representative sea state and suitably trained predictive models should be able to produce such responses although several methods exist for predicating a time series such as duvenaud 2014 here we propose a novel approach to reduce the complexity of the regression process for practical use by reducing the dimension of response stress time series to a feature vector with only two elements hejazi et al 2018b demonstrated good agreement between fatigue damage estimates within the tdz of scrs calculated using a time domain approach rfc method and a spectral method in other words it may be assumed that the stress responses within the tdz of scrs follow a narrow banded gaussian distribution with amplitudes peaks that follow a rayleigh distribution therefore for a given stress time series one can estimate the expected scr fatigue damage at the tdz analytically using equation 3 we argue that output stress feature vector tz œÉstd contains sufficient information for the purposes of fatigue analysis one objective of the trained sbs is to predict the stress feature vectors tz œÉstd at the six selected points along the scr tdz for a given input vector x from which the corresponding fatigue damages may be calculated via equation 3 in addition examining the stress responses due to a given sea state at various points within the scr tdz reveals that the generated tz values are almost identical for every point whereas the value of œÉstd varies throughout this implies that when predicting the stress response at locations p1 to p6 we only need to train one gp to predict the tz value for a given input sea state and six gps to predict the second component œÉstd one for each location finally as illustrated in table 4 an additional two gps are trained to predict offset and alcrit defined in section 3 1 2 giving nine gps which are trained to predict nine parameters for constructing the fatigue damage profile within the scr tdz due to a given input sea state 3 6 data preparation the aim of this step is to prepare the input and output datasets for use in training and validation of the gp regression models by normalizing the input data and splitting it into training and validation datasets here we use 200 data points a relatively modest number for traditional ml applications firstly we normalize the input dataset to enhance the stability of the optimization algorithms during the learning process murphy 2012 we select the maximum values of each sampled input variable for normalization of the input vectors with the values listed in table 5 for the case studied here secondly in order to reduce the bias in predicting the future unseen values we randomly split the entire dataset 200 input vectors and corresponding output vectors into a training 150 data points and validation dataset 50 data points the scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 pre processing module of python s machine learning library is used to normalize the input vectors and split the data for training and testing the gps 3 7 model selection the aim of this step is to select the mean and covariance functions for the nine gps used to predict output variables as discussed we select nine gps to predict the components needed to construct the fatigue damage profile within the 20 scr tdz due to an input sea state these include six gps namely gp p1 to gp p6 that predict the œÉstd at the selected points p1 p6 within the tdz and gp p7 to gp p9 to predict tz offset and alcrit respectively using the eight input parameters listed in table 3 although the input vector x hs tp Œ∏w uwind Œ∏wind ucur Œ∏cur k has eight parameters we only select those found to have significant impact on the output response when training the gps since using a gp with higher input dimensions requires more training data for an accurate prediction here we only have 150 training points and thus we try to maximize accuracy by reducing the gp number of input parameters dimension or dim as demonstrated in hejazi 2021 the input wind speed and direction has minimal impact on the magnitude of œÉstd as such here we consider gp pi to be six dimensional dim 6 this defines the input vector as x œÉstd x1 hs x2 tp x3 Œ∏w x4 ucur x5 Œ∏cur x6 k table 6 lists the name dimension and the input parameters of all other gps for every dimension xi of the input vectors x of each gp we employ the following squared exponential se covariance function following duvenaud 2014 11 k i x i x i Œ∑ i 2 exp x i x i 2 2 ‚Ñì i ‚Ñì i 0 where ‚Ñì 0 is the characteristic length scale governing the output function smoothness as detailed in rasmussen et al 2006 and Œ∑ is the scale parameter determining the scale of the output function then we define the global covariance function for each gp as the product of individual covariance function for each dimension 12 k x x i 1 d i m k i x i x i for all gps we select a zero mean function m x 0 as discussed in appendix a while within the training range of gps the prediction mean is determined by gps covariance function k x x equation a 12 out of their training range the gps prediction mean converges to values obtained by the mean function m x as illustrated in fig 2 here to avoid accidental large error in predictions we select zero mean function finally we use the training dataset to find the optimized model parameter values where the gp prediction error is minimised 3 8 model training the aim of this step is to determine the model parameters by minimizing the prediction errors for the training datasets regression is a supervised machine learning process in which known input and corresponding output data are used to tune the parameters in order to minimise model under and over fit murphy 2012 in this study we employ the probabilistic programming module of python pymc3 salvatier et al 2016 to train the gps following duvenaud 2014 chen and wang 2018 first we select gamma and half cauchy distributions as the priors for the ses parameters length scale ‚Ñì and scale parameter Œ∑ respectively next we assume initial values for the fixed parameters of gamma and half cauchy distributions and employ optimization algorithms to find the ‚Ñì and Œ∑ values for the gps at the map points this is a trial and error process that we repeat until the mean squared error mse of the gps converge this approach is common for similar types of probabilistic regression problems as described in rasmussen et al 2006 and murphy 2012 finally we verify the accuracy of the trained gps by using the validation dataset 3 9 model validation the aim of this step is to examine the adequacy of sbss here gps to predict the outputs corresponding to the unseen input vectors we perform validation by comparing the results obtained from orcaflex the 3d fe simulator and the sbs using the validation dataset visualisation of the sbs outputs for inspection is not possible due to the high input dimensionality therefore we utilize several of the statistical diagnostics presented in bastos et al 2009 to test convergence i e we examine prediction intervals individual prediction errors and prediction variances in addition to these measures which will help to diagnose common issues in the performance of the gps to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed methodology we undertake a full fatigue analysis using orcaflex for an additional 283 sea states and compare this to the results of the trained sbs the overall process is summarized in fig 11 and the corresponding results are presented in the next section 4 results and discussion 4 1 model training results as discussed in the previous section the training step determines the optimized values of the sbs parameters which are the coefficients of the se covariance functions ‚Ñìi and Œ∑i for each gp table 7 lists these values for the 6 dimensionl gp œÉstd at the nominal tdp p4 with values for the remainder of the gps presented in appendix b these numbers may be interpreted in terms of the sensitivity of the underlying predictive functions realized by gps to variations in the input variables referring to the se covariance function equation 12 the correlation between two input values of any xi located 4‚Ñìi apart is practically zero 0 0003 as such for any input a larger length scale implies a lower rate of change in the response surface realized by gp in the direction of the input for instance the length scale parameter for hs is 1 01 and for tp is 0 29 ‚Ñì hs and ‚Ñì tp in table 7 this indicates that the expected value of stress range œÉstd at the location of the nominal tdp varies with a slower rate with variation of the peak period compared with variation of the significant wave height in this case current speed and direction has the largest length scale among all the inputs here we use the water speed and direction at the sea surface to scale a pre defined linear current profile following hejazi 2021 for a more realistic prediction a measure of the current profile shape could be included in the input vector finally the calculated model parameters are then used to validate the gps using the validation dataset as described in the next section 4 2 model validation and diagnostic we conduct model validation to examine the adequacy of the trained gps to predict the nine outputs defined in section 3 1 2 for constructing the damage profile within the tdz of the 20 scr due to unseen input vectors for this we employ the input validation dataset the corresponding results from the fea orcaflex simulations output dataset and the three gp diagnostic measures described in section 3 9 4 2 1 prediction intervals firstly we utilize the prediction intervals to identify potential structure in the errors of the gps for instance regular over or under prediction for input values in fig 12 we plot the values of œÉstd at the nominal tdp p4 obtained from the fea orcaflex simulations against the gp p4 prediction intervals the mid points of the prediction intervals show the mean value of the gp prediction Œº and length of the vertical lines indicate the variance of the gp predictions with the interval length of Œº 2œÉ Œº 2œÉ with a smaller length indicating a higher confidence in the gp prediction a systematic over or under prediction would be evidenced by the mean values on one side of the identity line 1 1 line in fig 7 which does not occur here the ideal case would be to have all intervals vertical lines crossing the identity line at the mid point with a relatively short total length fig c 1 in appendix c presents the gp prediction intervals for the remaining eight outputs the results show that there is a good overall agreement between the gp predictions and the orcaflex results there are regions where the gps return predictions with higher variance for example the gp tz in fig c 1 within the region of tz 8 12 s such larger discrepancies are likely associated with the lhs sampling method employed here which generates more training data within the input space with larger likelihood consequently the gps predict more accurate results for inputs located near the peak of the input statistical distributions such as the hs tp joint distribution fig 8 in summary the prediction intervals show that there is no systematic error in the gp predictions and they perform well within the regions of interest in the input space i e the parameter values which generate the bulk of the long term damage 4 2 2 prediction variance secondly we use the prediction variance measure to examine whether the trained gps are accurate enough to be statistically meaningful at a selected threshold here following bastos et al 2009 we compare the empirical distribution of the gp predictive variances with the threshold defined as the 5 percent of the total output variances from the fea orcaflex simulations fig 13 a depicts the empirical density of the predictive var œÉstd at the nominal tdp p4 and its corresponding threshold vertical line at 0 43 which shows that 98 of the predicted data lies beneath the limit similarly as shown in fig c 2 the corresponding percentages for tz offset and alcrit are 100 96 and 73 respectively suggesting that the majority of the predictions are statistically accurate at the selected threshold as noted in section 4 2 1 gps exhibit a larger variance within regions with a lower number of training data points thus we expect to observe such values because of the random lhs technique adopted to generate training data points overall we find the prediction of the gps accurate within the regions of interest in the input domain space 4 2 3 individual prediction error lastly we employ standardized individual prediction errors to examine the level of agreement between the fea orcaflex simulations and the gp predictions the difference between the orcaflex outputs and the gp mean values normalized by the gp predictive standard deviation defines the standardized error bastos et al 2009 for each gp prediction as detailed in bastos et al 2009 given the gaussian assumptions used for gps the standardized error should follow a normal distribution therefore error values located within reasonable probability bounds for a standard normal distribution such as 3 3 standard deviations from a zero mean indicate good agreement between the outputs of orcaflex and the trained gps fig 13 b illustrates the comparison between the standard normal distribution dashed curve and the empirical density of the output gp œÉstd at point p4 for this case 86 of the validation data points are calculated to be within the expected 3 3 standard deviation interval similarly fig c 3 shows this percentage for other gps the results indicate good agreement between the outputs of orcaflex and the trained gps for the majority of the validation data the orcaflex model of the riser system is highly nonlinear and default assumptions such as model homogeneity or gaussian distributed outputs used in regression with gps may not hold true and thus lead to disagreement between the orcaflex and gp outputs despite this as shown in table 8 the absolute values of average error for the gps are reasonably low and hence considered acceptable for estimating the riser fatigue damage in other words as illustrated in fig 12 and fig c 1 some responses are over predicted and some under predicted by the gps with errors that are normally distributed and therefore it is expected that the overall error will be small when the cumulative effects are considered in the riser fatigue analysis 4 3 validation of the proposed methodology after undertaking model validation and diagnostics for the gps we examine the overall accuracy of the final output of the proposed probabilistic sbs detailed in fig 11 by comparing the fatigue life of the representative scr calculated using the rigorous fea orcaflex simulation and the validated model here following hejazi 2021 we select 283 representative irregular sea states different from the training and validation dataset with associated wind and current soil stiffness of 1000 kpa and a s n curve with m 3 and log a 11 764 to estimate the expected annual fatigue damage at the critical point of the riser for illustration fig 14 compares the fatigue damage profile at the tdz of the scr generated by both fea orcaflex simulation and the sbs mean prediction for a single representative operating sea state it demonstrates a good accuracy of the sbs in predicting both location and magnitude of the generated fatigue damage similarly fig 15 plots the fatigue life of the 20 scr within the riser tdz estimated by fea orcaflex simulation and the critical fatigue life range estimated by the probabilistic sbs the resulting critical fatigue life values are listed in table 9 here the mean high and low prediction values refer to the fatigue life of the scr estimated using the predictive mean of the gps and the predictive mean plus or minus two predictive standard deviations respectively we consider the performance of the proposed method to be accurate from a practical viewpoint with the more accurate results obtained from the combined fea rfc method 26 years located within the predictive two standard deviation interval 20 29 years and the predictive mean fatigue life of 24 years very close to the fea results 7 conservative comparing the run times for the two methods 20 h are needed to complete the combined fea rfc calculation on a standard pc set up cpu 3 4 ghz and ram 32 gb for fatigue analysis using a wave scatter diagram whereas the trained probabilistic sbs predicts the fatigue life within seconds this rapid run time for the sbs thus unlocks the potential to undertake a scr quantitative risk assessment as part of an im framework such as performing monte carlo simulations for quantifying the uncertainties associated with the fatigue life within the scr tdz 4 4 use in practice quantification of tdz fatigue life uncertainty here we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method for the quantitative risk assessment of scr fatigue failure we employ the trained probabilistic sbs to rapidly construct the cumulative distribution function cdf of fatigue life for the representative 20 scr incorporating reasonable uncertainties associated with input loads metocean data modelling tdz interaction represented by a linear seabed stiffness the pipe material properties s n curve parameters and the fabrication process line pipes misalignment Œ¥m may occur during offshore welding dnv 2012 the scr outer diameter od and wall thickness wt are considered to be deterministic values because of the strict specifications normally used during the manufacture of line pipes table 10 lists the statistical distributions of random variables selected here based on industry guidelines such as dnv 1992 we utilize the monte carlo simulation method shonkwiler and mendivil 2000 to conduct probabilistic estimation of the scr fatigue life by propagating uncertainties of the input parameters through the calculation process as follows firstly we finely discretise the long term joint probability distribution of hs tp fig 8 and select a large number of irregular sea states about 300 and corresponding annual probability of occurrence for the representative swell dominant region on the australian nws these parameters represent the annual expected wave conditions at the site where the wave direction is drawn randomly from the marginal cdf constructed from the long term hindcast wave data fig 16 similarly after hejazi 2021 for each representative sea state we select wind and current parameters speed and direction by randomly drawing samples from their marginal cdfs shown in fig 17 after constructing the irregular wave scatter diagram including wind and current we set up the cdf of other random variables seabed stiffness log a parameter and the scf in the case of the latter the standard relationship between scf and pipeline geometrical parameters is employed dnv 2012 13 s c f 1 3 Œ¥ m w t e w t o d to construct the pdf and cdf of the scf by randomly sampling from the uniform distribution of Œ¥m and calculating the associated value if this is repeated many times 100 000 the scf statistical distributions may be accurately constructed finally we conduct the monte carlo simulation by repeatedly sampling 10 000 times from the constructed cdfs of k log a and scf shown in fig 18 along with a representative full wave scatter diagram fig 8 and use these values as inputs into the trained probabilistic sbs developed for riser fatigue life in addition we verify the convergence of the simulation by plotting the statistics of the predictive fatigue life as the simulation progresses for illustration fig 19 plots the convergence of the mean value of the predictive mean fatigue life fig 20 illustrates the final product of the monte carlo simulation combined with the sbs which are probabilistic distributions of the mean fl m low mean minus two standard deviation fl l and high mean plus two standard deviation fl h predictive fatigue lives the corresponding statistical distribution parameters are listed in table 11 the variability between the fl l fl m and fl h measures is due to the sbs uncertainty model uncertainties in predicting the stress range at the critical point of the scr conversely variability in the predicted fatigue lives for either of these distributions results from the propagation of k log a and scf uncertainties in the estimation of the fatigue life for illustration the adopted variation in parameter log a fig 18 a may be taken to represent the uncertainty is selecting an appropriate s n curve class here we cover the range of dnv curve c and d classes where the log a values of c c1 c2 and d are 11 764 11 901 12 049 and 12 192 respectively dnv 2012 similarly the adopted uncertainty in parameters k fig 18 b and scf fig 18 c are equivalent to selecting a soil stiffness and scf value within the range of about 300 1500 kpa and 1 to 1 24 the accurate fatigue life of 26 years presented in section 4 3 is calculated using a single input for these parameters k 1000 kpa log a 11 764 and scf 1 the resulting mean value of the fl m fatigue probability distribution is illustrated in fig 20 c the combined effect of introducing the noted uncertainty into these parameters results in a potential fatigue life range of Œºfl l 28 1 yrs Œºfl h 41 8 yrs with a Œºfl m fatigue life of 36 5 years in this case combining a lower bound value of scf 1 with upper bound values for k 1000 and log a 11 764 in the accurate deterministic calculation results in a scr fatigue life approximately 30 smaller than the mean value calculated when parameter uncertainty is introduced in brief using the bayesian ml approach such as the probabilistic sbss developed here enables quantitative risk based assessment of scr fatigue failure by enabling rapid generation of the scr fatigue life cdf fig 21 this approach is practically impossible using conventional fea combined with rfc owing to the long simulation time required for each set of input parameters the approach unlocks the potential for more efficient decision making in the im of the deep water risers in addition the methodology could be readily extended to enable the integration of any new field data into the risk based approach via a bayesian updating framework gelman et al 2013 5 conclusion while the in service integrity management of scrs will benefit significantly from quantitative assessment of the risk of fatigue failure in practice the use of computationally expensive numerical simulations makes such assessment infeasible motivated by enabling rapid quantification of the probability of fatigue failure within the scr tdz here we have proposed an efficient framework for predicting the fatigue damage profile within the scr tdz in a stochastic manner resulting from irregular input sea states we have introduced an innovative method for dimensionality reduction in the prediction of stress time series and a systematic approach for developing and verifying probabilistic simulation based surrogates using the gaussian process concept for predicting the scr damage profile the trained predictive model offers a significant run time advantage by reducing the response prediction time for a single set of inputs from 1 to 2 h using fea orcaflex simulation to 20 ms this enables the rapid implementation of monte carlo techniques for quantifying the probability of failure we have demonstrated the accuracy and usefulness of the proposed framework using a realistic case study where we quantify the probability distribution of the fatigue life of a representative scr attached to a host vessel at a typical nws location the presented method relies on the results obtained from fea simulations on the training and validation input data sets in order to accurately calculate riser response outputs however as an alternative the observed input metocean conditions combined with field data obtained from an installed riser monitoring system may be used to train the response model instead of using fea in a similar vein the proposed method can also enable the predicted probability distributions to be updated using new field data to provide real time inputs into a risk based decision making process for integrity management of scrs credit authorship contribution statement rasoul hejazi conceptualization investigation methodology software

20496,the analytical solutions of stress and displacement at the bond between two adjacent layers of composite pipe including wet insulation pipe and a new design equation for the external pressure of wet insulation pipe are proposed in this paper the stress distribution and bearing capacity of wet insulation pipe have been exploded a series of 3d models are developed in commercial finite element software to discuss the influence factors of radial stress and compare numerical results with analytical solutions results showed that the distribution of radial stress and displacement is influenced by wall thickness modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio of each layer when other conditions remain unchanged the radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers increases with the increase of internal pressure and outer wall thickness the radial stress decreases with the increase of inner wall thickness modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio of outer layer under external pressure the radial stress will first increases and then decreases along radial direction from outside to inside and it will reach the maximum at the bond between insulation layer and steel pipe this phenomenon will increase pressure loaded on the outer surface of steel pipe which makes wet insulation pipe more prone to collapse consequently in some cases for the same size of steel pipe the collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe is smaller than that of internal steel pipe keywords wet insulation pipe composite pipe radial stress collapse pressure 1 introduction the offshore pipeline technology has been rapidly progressing during the last three decades developing technical capabilities to enable construction and operation into increasingly deep waters and harsh environments bruschi et al 2015 the exploration of energy resources has been moving into deep above 500 m and ultra deep above 1500 m waters saint marcoux 2014 song et al 2016 with the increase of water depth and demand there is an increasing demand for thermal insulation for offshore oil and gas production facilities zhang et al 2014 in aspect of analysis for optimal economic insulation thickness of pipe mustafa ert√ºrk 2016 used life cycle cost analysis lcca for different diameters of a pipe for the first time and evaluated the optimum insulation thickness according to sensitivity analysis ali da≈üdemir et al 2017 used life cycle cost analysis for different pipe material types for the first time and determined optimum insulation thickness of various pipe diameters ali da≈üdemir et al 2017 analyzed the effects of air gap on insulation thickness and life cycle costs for different diameter steel pipes for buildings located in ankara use of air space with single equipment and calculate the optimal unit density oyk total cost energy saving and back payment time mustafa ert√ºrk 2016 mustafa ert√ºrk 2017 predicted the exergetic optimum insulation thickness and the payback period which included four innovations for the structure of submarine steel pipes at present the most common types are pipe in pipe pip sandwich pipe sp and wet insulation pipe or single layer insulation pipe the main characteristic of a pip is a jacket pipe also known as outer or protective pipe and a carrier pipe also known as inner or production pipe where the annulus between the two pipes is generally filled with thermal insulation materials wang 2014 pip systems provide better insulation than conventional single pipelines due to the excellent thermal insulation properties of pip systems it is the best pipeline system for the transportation of crude oil and can prevent hydrate formation kristoffersen et al 2012 jiwa et al 2014 sandwich pipe systems can be categorized as pip systems a sandwich pipe typically consists of two thin walled pipes an inner pipe and an outer pipe and a core layer that completely fills the annular space between the pipes and is bonded to them onyegiri and kashtalyan 2017 with such a configuration an sp can enjoy the structural and thermal insulation benefits provided by the two stiffer pipes sandwiching a core material that offers efficient thermal and structural properties arjomandi 2011 however it is not economical to use steel pipe as protective pipe and the inner and outer pipes need to be welded separately in the laying process which reduces the laying efficiency and increases the installation cost to a great extent compared with pip systems for the shallow water area the use of the wet insulation pipe can not only save nearly 2 3 of the steel but reduce the welding workload in the pipe laying process so as to improve the pipe laying efficiency and reduce the project investment cost feng et al 1999 the wet insulation is applied directly outside the steel pipe with composite foam material and is laid to the seafloor without any protective layer the low density spherical void in the composite foam material reduces the weight of the insulation layer and reduces the thermal conductivity of the insulation layer there are three main types of wet insulation polyurethane polypropylene and epoxy resin the first two kinds of elastomers are more flexible than epoxy resin the flexibility of the wet insulation pipeline is conducive to transportation while the greater rigidity increases the compressive strength the research contents of references can be divided into two categories one is to calculate the optimal economic thickness of pipe insulation by lcca method the other is to focus on a series of mechanical properties of pip and sp during transportation installation and use including the research on residual stress radial buckling vortex induced vibration and failure mode of pipe the scholars however did not study the mechanical behavior of the wet insulation pipe under external pressure especially use the method to analyze radial stress of composite pipe to explore the collapse resistance of the wet insulation pipe in this paper based on the research of two layer composite pipe combined with engineering practice the wet insulation pipe is taken as specific research object and the analysis is carried out through the combination of theoretical equation and numerical simulation specific research contents include the analytical solutions of stress and displacement at the bond between two adjacent layers of composite pipe the influence factors of stress and displacement under uniform pressure the influence of material parameters of insulation layer on collapse pressure for wet insulation pipe and a new design equation for the external pressure of wet insulation pipe in order to meet the service requirements of the insulation system the wet insulation system has a multi layer insulation structure take the two layer thermal insulation system as an example the structure of traditional wet insulation pipe can be divided into pressure bearing layer insulation layer and corresponding bonding layer the inner layer is the main pressure bearing layer and the outer part is the insulation system see fig 1 and fig 2 similar to the hydrostatic pressure acting on the outer surface of the pipe the radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers can be regarded as the uniform external pressure loaded on the inner layer of pipe in the current design of wet insulation pipe however the distribution of radial stress along the radial direction has not been studied according to api american petroleum institute the design external pressure of wet insulation pipe only considers the pressure on the internal steel pipe and the outer insulation layer is regarded as a safety reserve in the design of offshore pipeline that is if the internal steel pipe meets the design requirements the wet insulation pipe meets the requirements api rp 1111 2015 but in fact poisson s ratio wall thickness and modulus of elasticity of insulation materials have great influence on radial stress at the bond between insulation layer and steel pipe the external non metallic materials in wet insulation pipe have adverse effects on collapse performance for the whole pipe so that in some cases for the same size of steel pipe the collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe is smaller than that of internal steel pipe based on this context we will propose the analytical solutions of stress and displacement at the bond between outer layer and inner layer of composite pipe in section 2 we will discuss the influence factors of radial stress and compare numerical results with analytical solutions in section 3 to illustrate the influence in different modulus of elasticity poisson s ratio and thickness of insulation layer on collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe we will develop a series of 3d models in commercial finite element software abaqus 2014 in section 4 moreover combined with the analytical solutions we proposed we also propose a new design equation for the external pressure of wet insulation pipe based on api recommended external pressure design equations 2 analytical solutions of composite pipe from the point of view of theory of elasticity timoshenko and goodier 2004 a simplification is possible when the dimension of the body in the z direction is very large if a long cylindrical body is loaded by forces that are perpendicular to the longitudinal elements and do not vary along the length it may be assumed that all cross sections are in the same condition the wet insulation pipe can be simplified as a thick wall cylinder model which is under uniform pressure and the direction of force is perpendicular to the axis plane which conforms to the plane strain therefore the three dimensional problem can be simplified as a two dimensional plane problem according to the theory of elasticity the analytical solutions of stress and displacement of single material thick walled cylinder under uniform internal and external pressure are as follows 1 œÉ r p a 1 b 2 r 2 a

combination of two pipes with single material layer that is internal pressure of the outer pipe is equal to external pressure of the inner pipe according to the deformation compatibility condition the displacement at the bond between two layers should be equal 5 u c 1 u c 2 where u c 1 is the displacement of inner surface of outer layer at the bond between two adjacent layers and u c 2 the displacement of outer surface of inner layer at the bond between two adjacent layers the following expression is obtained 6 p c c 2 1 Œº 1 e 1 b 2 c 2 b 2 c 1 2 Œº 1 c p b b 2 1 Œº 1 e 1 b 2 c 2 c 2 c

bond between two adjacent layers e 1 the modulus of elasticity of outer layer ŒΩ 1 the poisson s ratio of outer layer e 2 the modulus of elasticity of inner layer and ŒΩ 2 the poisson s ratio of inner layer it can be seen from eq 7 that the influence factors of the radial stress are internal pressure external pressure the modulus of elasticity of inner and outer layers poisson s ratio of inner and outer layers and wall thickness of inner and outer layers the circumferential stress axial stress and displacement can be expressed by radial stress so the above factors are also applicable to them for the analytical solutions of plane stress we just need to change e to e 1 2 ŒΩ 1 ŒΩ 2 and ŒΩ to ŒΩ 1 ŒΩ in eq 7 eq 8 eq 9 and eq 10 the equations of stress and displacement of plane stress are as

adjacent layers of plane stress 3 influence factors of radial stress according to eq 7 the factors that influence the radial stress are internal pressure external pressure the modulus of elasticity of inner and outer layers poisson s ratio of inner and outer layers and wall thickness of inner and outer layers in ocean engineering however the range of the modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio of internal steel pipe is small so they are not the main influence factors which will not be discussed in this paper we will discuss the influence of inner wall thickness outer wall thickness the modulus of elasticity of outer layer poisson s ratio of outer layer and internal pressure on the radial stress variation and compare numerical results with analytical solutions in this section to simulate the wet insulation pipe a series of 3d finite element models were developed using the commercial fe software abaqus 2014 the inner diameter of model is 4 inches 101 6 mm the axial length is 500 mm the wall thickness of inner layer is 5 mm the modulus of elasticity of inner layer is 204 gpa the poisson s ratio of inner layer is 0 3 the wall thickness of outer layer is 25 mm the modulus of elasticity of outer layer is 1 gpa and the poisson s ratio of outer layer is 0 3 the step is dynamic explicit and calculation time 0 1s in order to simulate the infinite axisymmetric pipeline cylindrical coordinate system is established to constrain the third fourth and fifth degrees of freedom of two end faces that is to constrain the axial linear displacement radial angular displacement and circumferential angular displacement of two end faces to prevent the rigid body displacement of the structure the radial linear displacement and circumferential linear displacement of a point on the end face are constrained the uniform pressure is loaded on inner and outer surfaces of the model and the linear loading time is 0 1 s the model parameters are demonstrated in table 1 3 1 influence of wall thickness to illustrate the influence of different inner thickness values on radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers the thickness range of inner wall is 5 25 mm and the results of radial stress are given when the internal pressure is 0 external pressure is 1 mpa and thickness of inner wall is 5 mm 10 mm 15 mm 20 mm and 25 mm respectively similarly to illustrate the influence of different outer thickness values on radial stress at the bond of two layers the thickness range of outer wall is 5 40 mm and the results of radial stress are given when the internal pressure is 0 external pressure is 1 mpa and thickness of outer wall is 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm respectively as shown in table 2 fig 4 shows the curves of the analytical solution and the numerical result with different wall thicknesses the fitting degree between the numerical results and the analytical solutions is high and the error is about 1 when other conditions remain unchanged with increase of inner wall thickness the increment of radial stress at the bond between two layers decreases conversely with the increase of outer wall thickness the increment of radial stress at the bond of two layers increases that is the greater the difference between inner wall thickness and outer wall thickness the greater the increment of radial stress 3 2 influence of outer material 3 2 1 modulus of elasticity to illustrate the influence of different modulus of elasticity of outer layer on radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers the value range of modulus of elasticity is 0 1 3 gpa and the results of radial stress are given when the internal pressure is 0 external pressure is 1 mpa and modulus of elasticity is 0 1 gpa 0 3 gpa 1 gpa 2 gpa 3 gpa respectively as shown in table 3 3 2 2 poisson s ratio to illustrate the influence of different poisson s ratio of outer layer on radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers the value range of poisson s ratio is 0 3 0 48 and the results of radial stress are given when the internal pressure is 0 external pressure is 1 mpa and poisson s ratio is 0 3 0 35 0 4 0 45 0 48 respectively as shown in table 4 fig 5 and fig 6 show the curves of analytical solution and numerical result of different modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio of outer layer respectively the increment of radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers decreases with the increase of modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio of outer layer and the value of poisson s ratio has a great influence on the change of radial stress if outer layer is a completely incompressible layer i e the limit state of ŒΩ 0 5 the increment of radial stress is 0 which is equivalent to the effect of hydrostatic pressure 3 3 influence of internal pressure to illustrate the influence of different internal pressure on radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers the value range of internal pressure is 0 2 mpa and the results of radial stress are given when the external pressure is 1 mpa and internal pressure is 0 0 5 mpa 1 mpa 1 5 mpa 2 mpa respectively as shown in table 5 fig 7 shows the curve of the analytical solution and the numerical result of different internal pressures when other conditions remain unchanged the increment of radial stress at the bond between two layers increases with the increase of internal pressure which indicates that internal pressure also contributes to the increment of radial stress at the bond between two layers in fact for composite pipe with any material whether the radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers increases depend on the ratio of the modulus of elasticity between inner layer and outer layer take the plane strain as an example for eq 7 let p c p b the ratio of the modulus of elasticity between inner layer and outer layer in the critical state can be obtained 15 e 2 e 1 1 ŒΩ 1 a 2 c 2 1 2 ŒΩ 2 p b 2 a 2 1 ŒΩ 2 p a p b 1 ŒΩ 2 c 2 a 2 1 2 ŒΩ 1 the ratio is a constant and for convenience let 1 ŒΩ 1 a 2 c 2 1 2 ŒΩ 2 p b 2 a 2 1 ŒΩ 2 p a p b 1 ŒΩ 2 c 2 a 2 1 2 ŒΩ 1 Œ≤ when 0 e 2 e 1 Œ≤ p c p b and when e 2 e 1 Œ≤ p c p b and when e 2 e 1 Œ≤ p c p b 4 collapse analysis there is no internal pressure in the process of pipeline installation when the internal external pressure difference is the largest it is most prone to collapse it can be seen from previous analysis that poisson s ratio modulus of elasticity and wall thickness of outer layer have great influence on p c for the same size of steel pipe in some cases the collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe may be smaller than that of internal steel pipe therefore we will discuss the influence of material parameters of external insulation layer on overall collapse pressure under the condition of the same steel pipe parameters in section 4 1 according to the fact that the radial stress increment is not considered in api we will propose an equation suitable for external pressure design of wet insulation pipe in section 4 2 4 1 simulation of collapse process the collapse simulation is completed in fe software abaqus 2014 the inner diameter of the model is 4 inches and the modulus of elasticity of outer layer is taken as 0 03 gpa 0 1 gpa 0 3 gpa 0 6 gpa 1 gpa respectively the parameters of model are shown in table 6 x65 pipeline steel is selected as the internal steel pipe the detailed material parameters are shown in table 7 the collapse calculation involves material nonlinearity when load increases to a certain extent material plastic deformation occurs we assume that the external non metallic material is an ideal elastic material without considering plastic deformation the constitutive equation of x65 pipeline steel is based on ramberg osgood mode de sousa et al 2010 xu 2014 has established a global two stage stress strain constitutive equation which is more suitable for actual working conditions through tensile experiments the constitutive equation is directly given here 16 Œµ œÉ 207000 1 8 15 œÉ 450 14 œÉ œÉ p 0 2 œÉ 450 16535 43 0 00547 œÉ 450 45 43 28 0 0028 œÉ œÉ p 0 2 where Œµ is the strain of x65 pipeline steel œÉ the stress of x65 pipeline steel and œÉ p 0 2 the stress corresponding to 0 2 remaining plastic deformation after unloading fig 8 shows the constitutive relations curve of x65 pipeline steel fig 9 shows the load displacement curve of steel pipe and wet insulation pipe with different modulus of elasticity under uniform external pressure the abscissa is the load ratio the maximum value of load ratio represents the ratio of the collapse pressure between the wet insulation pipe and the steel pipe the ordinate is the radial displacement when the load increases to a certain value the material will undergo plastic deformation the displacement value will increase sharply and the whole structure will be unstable table 8 shows the collapse pressures of each model with different modulus of elasticity of insulation layer for the same size of steel pipe if the modulus of elasticity of thermal insulation material is low the collapse pressure of the wet insulation pipe is smaller than that of steel pipe on the contrary the collapse pressure of the wet insulation pipe is larger than that of steel pipe the reason for this phenomenon is when material is stressed the higher the modulus of elasticity is the greater the ability to resist deformation is and the greater the external force required for the material to produce the same deformation is although the pressure loaded on the steel pipe is greater than the external pressure the insulation layer also plays a certain role in resisting the deformation of the steel pipe however the resistance will weaken with the decrease of the modulus of elasticity of the thermal insulation material when the modulus of elasticity decreases to a certain extent the bearing capacity of wet insulation pipe will be weaker than that of steel pipe in addition to the modulus of elasticity of insulation layer it can be seen from section 3 that poisson s ratio and wall thickness of insulation layer also have a great influence on the increment of radial stress to calculate the collapse pressure of different models similarly the modulus of elasticity of insulation layer is 0 3 gpa the poisson s ratio of insulation layer is 0 3 0 35 0 4 0 45 0 48 respectively and the thickness of insulation layer is 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm respectively other parameters are the same as tables 6 and 7 table 9 shows the collapse pressures of models with different poisson s ratio and wall thickness of insulation layer when e 1 0 3 gpa the modulus of elasticity of the insulation layer is low and the resistance of insulation layer to deformation of steel pipe is weak therefore except for ŒΩ 1 0 48 the collapse pressures of other models are smaller than that of the steel pipe the results of model b1 model b5 show that with the increase of poisson s ratio of insulation layer the collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe increases gradually which is consistent with the analysis for influence of poisson s ratio on radial stress increment at the bond between two adjacent layers in section 2 2 when the radial stress increment is not enough to offset the supporting effect of insulation material on the deformation of steel pipe collapse pressure will be greater than that of steel pipe the results of model c1 model c5 show that the collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe will be reduced under each thickness of insulation layer when the modulus of elasticity of the insulation layer is low however the influence of wall thickness on collapse pressure is not monotonous for the 4 inch wet insulation pipe in this paper the collapse pressure first increases and then decreases with the increase of insulation layer thickness which is also the result of combined effect of radial stress increase and resistance of insulation layer to steel pipe deformation fig 10 shows the collapse pressure with different insulation thickness and poisson s ratio therefore for wet insulation pipe choose the material with higher modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio as thermal insulation material would be conducive to reducing the adverse effect of increase in radial stress on the whole pipeline pressure bearing capacity moreover it is not that the thicker insulation layer the more contribute to resist collapse the influence of insulation layer on collapse pressure for wet insulation pipe depends on the combined effect of modulus of elasticity poisson s ratio and wall thickness 4 2 external pressure design equation the sea water pressure acts on the outer surface of the insulation layer will increase after it is transferred to the steel pipe through the insulation layer the specific increment depends on the values of inner wall thickness outer wall thickness the modulus of elasticity of outer layer poisson s ratio of outer layer and internal pressure therefore the actual pressure acts on the steel pipe is greater than the seawater pressure that acts on the outer surface of insulation layer based on this on the basis of api rp 1111 2015 recommended external pressure calculation equation combined with eq 7 the equation of wet insulation pipe design external pressure is obtained 17 p o e 1 1 ŒΩ 1 b 2 c 2 a 2 c 2 1 2 ŒΩ

diameter of steel pipe table 10 shows the comparison between the calculation results of api recommended equation and eq 17 the design external pressure calculated by eq 17 is smaller than that calculated by api which indicates that the insulation layer has adverse effect on the bearing capacity of the subsea pipe the external pressure equation recommended by api takes the seawater pressure on the outer surface of insulation layer as the design external pressure of the steel pipe api only considers the bearing capacity of steel pipe and regards the insulation layer as a safety reserve but in fact for wet insulation pipe the radial stress caused by external seawater pressure increases first and then decreases along the radial direction from outside to inside and reaches the maximum at the bond between insulation layer and steel pipe therefore the actual pressure acted on the steel pipe is greater than the seawater pressure on the insulation layer so it is unsafe to take the external seawater pressure as the design external pressure of the steel pipe directly the influence of insulation layer on the radial stress increase is considered in the design pressure of steel pipe obtained by the external pressure equation of wet insulation pipe proposed in this paper the calculation results are less than the current equation and are more suitable for engineering practice 5 conclusions in view of the phenomenon of radial stress increase under uniform external pressure we proposed the analytical solutions of stress and displacement at the bond between insulation layer and steel pipe of wet insulation pipe moreover we studied the factors influence the stress change to address the issue that the pressure increase is not considered in current design specification for wet insulation pipe we presented a new design equation for the external pressure of wet insulation pipe based on our proposed analytical solutions based on the present study the following conclusions can be drawn for composite pipe with any material that loaded by uniform external pressure the change of radial stress is influenced by internal pressure the modulus of elasticity of each layer the poisson s ratio of each layer and the wall thickness of each layer when the ratio of the modulus of elasticity between inner layer and outer layer e 2 e 1 1 ŒΩ 1 a 2 c 2 1 2 ŒΩ 2 p b 2 a 2 1 ŒΩ 2 p a

poisson s ratio of outer layer under the external pressure radial stress of wet insulation pipe first increases and then decreases along the radial direction from outside to inside and reaches the maximum at the bond between insulation layer and steel pipe the influence of insulation layer on collapse pressure for wet insulation pipe depends on the combined effect of modulus of elasticity poisson s ratio and wall thickness choose material with higher modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio as thermal insulation material would be conducive to reducing the adverse effect of increase in radial stress on the whole pipeline pressure bearing capacity the external pressure equation recommended by api takes the seawater pressure on the outer surface of the insulation layer as the design external pressure of the steel pipe and only considers the bearing capacity of the steel pipe but in fact the actual pressure on the steel pipe is greater than the seawater pressure on the insulation layer which means the insulation layer has adverse effect on the bearing capacity of the subsea pipe therefore we suggest that eq 17 would be used to calculate the external design pressure of wet insulation pipe which considers the increase of radial stress in insulation layer credit authorship contribution statement haoran zhang methodology software data curation writing original draft

exploration of energy resources has been moving into deep above 500 m and ultra deep above 1500 m waters saint marcoux 2014 song et al 2016 with the increase of water depth and demand there is an increasing demand for thermal insulation for offshore oil and gas production facilities zhang et al 2014 in aspect of analysis for optimal economic insulation thickness of pipe mustafa ert√ºrk 2016 used life cycle cost analysis lcca for different diameters of a pipe for the first time and evaluated the optimum insulation thickness according to sensitivity analysis ali da≈üdemir et al 2017 used life cycle cost analysis for different pipe material types for the first time and determined optimum insulation thickness of various pipe diameters ali da≈üdemir et al 2017 analyzed the effects of air gap on insulation thickness and life cycle costs for different diameter steel pipes for buildings located in ankara use of air space with single equipment and calculate the optimal unit density oyk total cost energy saving and back payment time mustafa ert√ºrk 2016 mustafa ert√ºrk 2017 predicted the exergetic optimum insulation thickness and the payback period which included four innovations for the structure of submarine steel pipes at present the most common types are pipe in pipe pip sandwich pipe sp and wet insulation pipe or single layer insulation pipe the main characteristic of a pip is a jacket pipe also known as outer or protective pipe and a carrier pipe also known as inner or production pipe where the annulus between the two pipes is generally filled with thermal insulation materials wang 2014 pip systems provide better insulation than conventional single pipelines due to the excellent thermal insulation properties of pip systems it is the best pipeline system for the transportation of crude oil and can prevent hydrate formation kristoffersen et al 2012 jiwa et al 2014 sandwich pipe systems can be categorized as pip systems a sandwich pipe typically consists of two thin walled pipes an inner pipe and an outer pipe and a core layer that completely fills the annular space between the pipes and is bonded to them onyegiri and kashtalyan 2017 with such a configuration an sp can enjoy the structural and thermal insulation benefits provided by the two stiffer pipes sandwiching a core material that offers efficient thermal and structural properties arjomandi 2011 however it is not economical to use steel pipe as protective pipe and the inner and outer pipes need to be welded separately in the laying process which reduces the laying efficiency and increases the installation cost to a great extent compared with pip systems for the shallow water area the use of the wet insulation pipe can not only save nearly 2 3 of the steel but reduce the welding workload in the pipe laying process so as to improve the pipe laying efficiency and reduce the project investment cost feng et al 1999 the wet insulation is applied directly outside the steel pipe with composite foam material and is laid to the seafloor without any protective layer the low density spherical void in the composite foam material reduces the weight of the insulation layer and reduces the thermal conductivity of the insulation layer there are three main types of wet insulation polyurethane polypropylene and epoxy resin the first two kinds of elastomers are more flexible than epoxy resin the flexibility of the wet insulation pipeline is conducive to transportation while the greater rigidity increases the compressive strength the research contents of references can be divided into two categories one is to calculate the optimal economic thickness of pipe insulation by lcca method the other is to focus on a series of mechanical properties of pip and sp during transportation installation and use including the research on residual stress radial buckling vortex induced vibration and failure mode of pipe the scholars however did not study the mechanical behavior of the wet insulation pipe under external pressure especially use the method to analyze radial stress of composite pipe to explore the collapse resistance of the wet insulation pipe in this paper based on the research of two layer composite pipe combined with engineering practice the wet insulation pipe is taken as specific research object and the analysis is carried out through the combination of theoretical equation and numerical simulation specific research contents include the analytical solutions of stress and displacement at the bond between two adjacent layers of composite pipe the influence factors of stress and displacement under uniform pressure the influence of material parameters of insulation layer on collapse pressure for wet insulation pipe and a new design equation for the external pressure of wet insulation pipe in order to meet the service requirements of the insulation system the wet insulation system has a multi layer insulation structure take the two layer thermal insulation system as an example the structure of traditional wet insulation pipe can be divided into pressure bearing layer insulation layer and corresponding bonding layer the inner layer is the main pressure bearing layer and the outer part is the insulation system see fig 1 and fig 2 similar to the hydrostatic pressure acting on the outer surface of the pipe the radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers can be regarded as the uniform external pressure loaded on the inner layer of pipe in the current design of wet insulation pipe however the distribution of radial stress along the radial direction has not been studied according to api american petroleum institute the design external pressure of wet insulation pipe only considers the pressure on the internal steel pipe and the outer insulation layer is regarded as a safety reserve in the design of offshore pipeline that is if the internal steel pipe meets the design requirements the wet insulation pipe meets the requirements api rp 1111 2015 but in fact poisson s ratio wall thickness and modulus of elasticity of insulation materials have great influence on radial stress at the bond between insulation layer and steel pipe the external non metallic materials in wet insulation pipe have adverse effects on collapse performance for the whole pipe so that in some cases for the same size of steel pipe the collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe is smaller than that of internal steel pipe based on this context we will propose the analytical solutions of stress and displacement at the bond between outer layer and inner layer of composite pipe in section 2 we will discuss the influence factors of radial stress and compare numerical results with analytical solutions in section 3 to illustrate the influence in different modulus of elasticity poisson s ratio and thickness of insulation layer on collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe we will develop a series of 3d models in commercial finite element software abaqus 2014 in section 4 moreover combined with the analytical solutions we proposed we also propose a new design equation for the external pressure of wet insulation pipe based on api recommended external pressure design equations 2 analytical solutions of composite pipe from the point of view of theory of elasticity timoshenko and goodier 2004 a simplification is possible when the dimension of the body in the z direction is very large if a long cylindrical body is loaded by forces that are perpendicular to the longitudinal elements and do not vary along the length it may be assumed that all cross sections are in the same condition the wet insulation pipe can be simplified as a thick wall cylinder model which is under uniform pressure and the direction of force is perpendicular to the axis plane which conforms to the plane strain therefore the three dimensional problem can be simplified as a two dimensional plane problem according to the theory of elasticity the analytical solutions of stress and displacement of single material thick walled cylinder under uniform internal and external pressure are as follows 1 œÉ r p a 1 b 2 r 2 a

combination of two pipes with single material layer that is internal pressure of the outer pipe is equal to external pressure of the inner pipe according to the deformation compatibility condition the displacement at the bond between two layers should be equal 5 u c 1 u c 2 where u c 1 is the displacement of inner surface of outer layer at the bond between two adjacent layers and u c 2 the displacement of outer surface of inner layer at the bond between two adjacent layers the following expression is obtained 6 p c c 2 1 Œº 1 e 1 b 2 c 2 b 2 c 1 2 Œº 1 c p b b 2 1 Œº 1 e 1 b 2 c 2 c 2 c

p c t the circumferential stress at bond between two adjacent layers p c z the axial stress at bond between two adjacent layers u c the displacement at bond between two adjacent layers c the radius at bond between two adjacent layers e 1 the modulus of elasticity of outer layer ŒΩ 1 the poisson s ratio of outer layer e 2 the modulus of elasticity of inner layer and ŒΩ 2 the poisson s ratio of inner layer it can be seen from eq 7 that the influence factors of the radial stress are internal pressure external pressure the modulus of elasticity of inner and outer layers poisson s ratio of inner and outer layers and wall thickness of inner and outer layers the circumferential stress axial stress and displacement can be expressed by radial stress so the above factors are also applicable to them for the analytical solutions of plane stress we just need to change e to e 1 2 ŒΩ 1 ŒΩ 2 and ŒΩ to ŒΩ 1 ŒΩ in eq 7 eq 8 eq 9 and eq 10 the equations of stress and displacement of plane stress are as

t the circumferential stress at bond between two adjacent layers of plane stress p c z the axial stress at bond between two adjacent layers of plane stress and u c the displacement at bond between two adjacent layers of plane stress 3 influence factors of radial stress according to eq 7 the factors that influence the radial stress are internal pressure external pressure the modulus of elasticity of inner and outer layers poisson s ratio of inner and outer layers and wall thickness of inner and outer layers in ocean engineering however the range of the modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio of internal steel pipe is small so they are not the main influence factors which will not be discussed in this paper we will discuss the influence of inner wall thickness outer wall thickness the modulus of elasticity of outer layer poisson s ratio of outer layer and internal pressure on the radial stress variation and compare numerical results with analytical solutions in this section to simulate the wet insulation pipe a series of 3d finite element models were developed using the commercial fe software abaqus 2014 the inner diameter of model is 4 inches 101 6 mm the axial length is 500 mm the wall thickness of inner layer is 5 mm the modulus of elasticity of inner layer is 204 gpa the poisson s ratio of inner layer is 0 3 the wall thickness of outer layer is 25 mm the modulus of elasticity of outer layer is 1 gpa and the poisson s ratio of outer layer is 0 3 the step is dynamic explicit and calculation time 0 1s in order to simulate the infinite axisymmetric pipeline cylindrical coordinate system is established to constrain the third fourth and fifth degrees of freedom of two end faces that is to constrain the axial linear displacement radial angular displacement and circumferential angular displacement of two end faces to prevent the rigid body displacement of the structure the radial linear displacement and circumferential linear displacement of a point on the end face are constrained the uniform pressure is loaded on inner and outer surfaces of the model and the linear loading time is 0 1 s the model parameters are demonstrated in table 1 3 1 influence of wall thickness to illustrate the influence of different inner thickness values on radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers the thickness range of inner wall is 5 25 mm and the results of radial stress are given when the internal pressure is 0 external pressure is 1 mpa and thickness of inner wall is 5 mm 10 mm 15 mm 20 mm and 25 mm respectively similarly to illustrate the influence of different outer thickness values on radial stress at the bond of two layers the thickness range of outer wall is 5 40 mm and the results of radial stress are given when the internal pressure is 0 external pressure is 1 mpa and thickness of outer wall is 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm respectively as shown in table 2 fig 4 shows the curves of the analytical solution and the numerical result with different wall thicknesses the fitting degree between the numerical results and the analytical solutions is high and the error is about 1 when other conditions remain unchanged with increase of inner wall thickness the increment of radial stress at the bond between two layers decreases conversely with the increase of outer wall thickness the increment of radial stress at the bond of two layers increases that is the greater the difference between inner wall thickness and outer wall thickness the greater the increment of radial stress 3 2 influence of outer material 3 2 1 modulus of elasticity to illustrate the influence of different modulus of elasticity of outer layer on radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers the value range of modulus of elasticity is 0 1 3 gpa and the results of radial stress are given when the internal pressure is 0 external pressure is 1 mpa and modulus of elasticity is 0 1 gpa 0 3 gpa 1 gpa 2 gpa 3 gpa respectively as shown in table 3 3 2 2 poisson s ratio to illustrate the influence of different poisson s ratio of outer layer on radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers the value range of poisson s ratio is 0 3 0 48 and the results of radial stress are given when the internal pressure is 0 external pressure is 1 mpa and poisson s ratio is 0 3 0 35 0 4 0 45 0 48 respectively as shown in table 4 fig 5 and fig 6 show the curves of analytical solution and numerical result of different modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio of outer layer respectively the increment of radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers decreases with the increase of modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio of outer layer and the value of poisson s ratio has a great influence on the change of radial stress if outer layer is a completely incompressible layer i e the limit state of ŒΩ 0 5 the increment of radial stress is 0 which is equivalent to the effect of hydrostatic pressure 3 3 influence of internal pressure to illustrate the influence of different internal pressure on radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers the value range of internal pressure is 0 2 mpa and the results of radial stress are given when the external pressure is 1 mpa and internal pressure is 0 0 5 mpa 1 mpa 1 5 mpa 2 mpa respectively as shown in table 5 fig 7 shows the curve of the analytical solution and the numerical result of different internal pressures when other conditions remain unchanged the increment of radial stress at the bond between two layers increases with the increase of internal pressure which indicates that internal pressure also contributes to the increment of radial stress at the bond between two layers in fact for composite pipe with any material whether the radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers increases depend on the ratio of the modulus of elasticity between inner layer and outer layer take the plane strain as an example for eq 7 let p c p b the ratio of the modulus of elasticity between inner layer and outer layer in the critical state can be obtained 15 e 2 e 1 1 ŒΩ 1 a 2 c 2 1 2 ŒΩ 2 p b 2 a 2 1 ŒΩ 2 p a p b 1 ŒΩ 2 c 2 a 2 1 2 ŒΩ 1 the ratio is a constant and for convenience let 1 ŒΩ 1 a 2 c 2 1 2 ŒΩ 2 p b 2 a 2 1 ŒΩ 2 p a p b 1 ŒΩ 2 c 2 a 2 1 2 ŒΩ 1 Œ≤ when 0 e 2 e 1 Œ≤ p c p b and when e 2 e 1 Œ≤ p c p b and when e 2 e 1 Œ≤ p c p b 4 collapse analysis there is no internal pressure in the process of pipeline installation when the internal external pressure difference is the largest it is most prone to collapse it can be seen from previous analysis that poisson s ratio modulus of elasticity and wall thickness of outer layer have great influence on p c for the same size of steel pipe in some cases the collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe may be smaller than that of internal steel pipe therefore we will discuss the influence of material parameters of external insulation layer on overall collapse pressure under the condition of the same steel pipe parameters in section 4 1 according to the fact that the radial stress increment is not considered in api we will propose an equation suitable for external pressure design of wet insulation pipe in section 4 2 4 1 simulation of collapse process the collapse simulation is completed in fe software abaqus 2014 the inner diameter of the model is 4 inches and the modulus of elasticity of outer layer is taken as 0 03 gpa 0 1 gpa 0 3 gpa 0 6 gpa 1 gpa respectively the parameters of model are shown in table 6 x65 pipeline steel is selected as the internal steel pipe the detailed material parameters are shown in table 7 the collapse calculation involves material nonlinearity when load increases to a certain extent material plastic deformation occurs we assume that the external non metallic material is an ideal elastic material without considering plastic deformation the constitutive equation of x65 pipeline steel is based on ramberg osgood mode de sousa et al 2010 xu 2014 has established a global two stage stress strain constitutive equation which is more suitable for actual working conditions through tensile experiments the constitutive equation is directly given here 16 Œµ œÉ 207000 1 8 15 œÉ 450 14 œÉ œÉ p 0 2 œÉ 450 16535 43 0 00547 œÉ 450 45 43 28 0 0028 œÉ œÉ p 0 2 where Œµ is the strain of x65 pipeline steel œÉ the stress of x65 pipeline steel and œÉ p 0 2 the stress corresponding to 0 2 remaining plastic deformation after unloading fig 8 shows the constitutive relations curve of x65 pipeline steel fig 9 shows the load displacement curve of steel pipe and wet insulation pipe with different modulus of elasticity under uniform external pressure the abscissa is the load ratio the maximum value of load ratio represents the ratio of the collapse pressure between the wet insulation pipe and the steel pipe the ordinate is the radial displacement when the load increases to a certain value the material will undergo plastic deformation the displacement value will increase sharply and the whole structure will be unstable table 8 shows the collapse pressures of each model with different modulus of elasticity of insulation layer for the same size of steel pipe if the modulus of elasticity of thermal insulation material is low the collapse pressure of the wet insulation pipe is smaller than that of steel pipe on the contrary the collapse pressure of the wet insulation pipe is larger than that of steel pipe the reason for this phenomenon is when material is stressed the higher the modulus of elasticity is the greater the ability to resist deformation is and the greater the external force required for the material to produce the same deformation is although the pressure loaded on the steel pipe is greater than the external pressure the insulation layer also plays a certain role in resisting the deformation of the steel pipe however the resistance will weaken with the decrease of the modulus of elasticity of the thermal insulation material when the modulus of elasticity decreases to a certain extent the bearing capacity of wet insulation pipe will be weaker than that of steel pipe in addition to the modulus of elasticity of insulation layer it can be seen from section 3 that poisson s ratio and wall thickness of insulation layer also have a great influence on the increment of radial stress to calculate the collapse pressure of different models similarly the modulus of elasticity of insulation layer is 0 3 gpa the poisson s ratio of insulation layer is 0 3 0 35 0 4 0 45 0 48 respectively and the thickness of insulation layer is 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm respectively other parameters are the same as tables 6 and 7 table 9 shows the collapse pressures of models with different poisson s ratio and wall thickness of insulation layer when e 1 0 3 gpa the modulus of elasticity of the insulation layer is low and the resistance of insulation layer to deformation of steel pipe is weak therefore except for ŒΩ 1 0 48 the collapse pressures of other models are smaller than that of the steel pipe the results of model b1 model b5 show that with the increase of poisson s ratio of insulation layer the collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe increases gradually which is consistent with the analysis for influence of poisson s ratio on radial stress increment at the bond between two adjacent layers in section 2 2 when the radial stress increment is not enough to offset the supporting effect of insulation material on the deformation of steel pipe collapse pressure will be greater than that of steel pipe the results of model c1 model c5 show that the collapse pressure of wet insulation pipe will be reduced under each thickness of insulation layer when the modulus of elasticity of the insulation layer is low however the influence of wall thickness on collapse pressure is not monotonous for the 4 inch wet insulation pipe in this paper the collapse pressure first increases and then decreases with the increase of insulation layer thickness which is also the result of combined effect of radial stress increase and resistance of insulation layer to steel pipe deformation fig 10 shows the collapse pressure with different insulation thickness and poisson s ratio therefore for wet insulation pipe choose the material with higher modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio as thermal insulation material would be conducive to reducing the adverse effect of increase in radial stress on the whole pipeline pressure bearing capacity moreover it is not that the thicker insulation layer the more contribute to resist collapse the influence of insulation layer on collapse pressure for wet insulation pipe depends on the combined effect of modulus of elasticity poisson s ratio and wall thickness 4 2 external pressure design equation the sea water pressure acts on the outer surface of the insulation layer will increase after it is transferred to the steel pipe through the insulation layer the specific increment depends on the values of inner wall thickness outer wall thickness the modulus of elasticity of outer layer poisson s ratio of outer layer and internal pressure therefore the actual pressure acts on the steel pipe is greater than the seawater pressure that acts on the outer surface of insulation layer based on this on the basis of api rp 1111 2015 recommended external pressure calculation equation combined with eq 7 the equation of wet insulation pipe design external pressure is obtained 17 p o e 1 1 ŒΩ 1 b 2 c 2 a 2 c 2 1 2 ŒΩ

diameter of steel pipe table 10 shows the comparison between the calculation results of api recommended equation and eq 17 the design external pressure calculated by eq 17 is smaller than that calculated by api which indicates that the insulation layer has adverse effect on the bearing capacity of the subsea pipe the external pressure equation recommended by api takes the seawater pressure on the outer surface of insulation layer as the design external pressure of the steel pipe api only considers the bearing capacity of steel pipe and regards the insulation layer as a safety reserve but in fact for wet insulation pipe the radial stress caused by external seawater pressure increases first and then decreases along the radial direction from outside to inside and reaches the maximum at the bond between insulation layer and steel pipe therefore the actual pressure acted on the steel pipe is greater than the seawater pressure on the insulation layer so it is unsafe to take the external seawater pressure as the design external pressure of the steel pipe directly the influence of insulation layer on the radial stress increase is considered in the design pressure of steel pipe obtained by the external pressure equation of wet insulation pipe proposed in this paper the calculation results are less than the current equation and are more suitable for engineering practice 5 conclusions in view of the phenomenon of radial stress increase under uniform external pressure we proposed the analytical solutions of stress and displacement at the bond between insulation layer and steel pipe of wet insulation pipe moreover we studied the factors influence the stress change to address the issue that the pressure increase is not considered in current design specification for wet insulation pipe we presented a new design equation for the external pressure of wet insulation pipe based on our proposed analytical solutions based on the present study the following conclusions can be drawn for composite pipe with any material that loaded by uniform external pressure the change of radial stress is influenced by internal pressure the modulus of elasticity of each layer the poisson s ratio of each layer and the wall thickness of each layer when the ratio of the modulus of elasticity between inner layer and outer layer e 2 e 1 1 ŒΩ 1 a 2 c 2 1 2 ŒΩ 2 p b 2 a 2 1 ŒΩ 2 p a p b 1 ŒΩ 2 c 2 a 2 1 2 ŒΩ 1 the radial stress increases in the outer layer along the radial direction from outside to inside when other conditions remain unchanged the radial stress at the bond between two adjacent layers increases with the increase of internal pressure and outer wall thickness the radial stress decreases with the increase of inner wall thickness modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio of outer layer under the external pressure radial stress of wet insulation pipe first increases and then decreases along the radial direction from outside to inside and reaches the maximum at the bond between insulation layer and steel pipe the influence of insulation layer on collapse pressure for wet insulation pipe depends on the combined effect of modulus of elasticity poisson s ratio and wall thickness choose material with higher modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio as thermal insulation material would be conducive to reducing the adverse effect of increase in radial stress on the whole pipeline pressure bearing capacity the external pressure equation recommended by api takes the seawater pressure on the outer surface of the insulation layer as the design external pressure of the steel pipe and only considers the bearing capacity of the steel pipe but in fact the actual pressure on the steel pipe is greater than the seawater pressure on the insulation layer which means the insulation layer has adverse effect on the bearing capacity of the subsea pipe therefore we suggest that eq 17 would be used to calculate the external design pressure of wet insulation pipe which considers the increase of radial stress in insulation layer credit authorship contribution statement haoran zhang methodology software data curation writing original draft

20497,this study investigates the problems in the automatic route planning method which is a critical function for the safe navigation of manned and unmanned ships we designed a route planning process by extracting the water depth information such as the position and depth value of water depth points using the electronic navigation chart enc data the discrete water depth points were reorganized to form a delaunay triangulation dt data structure which is the basis of the dt algorithm the l algorithm was proposed and employed on the dt map to provide an appropriate planning route furthermore the fo l final optimization l algorithm was used to design an optimized planning route connected by vital waypoints only finally two closed loop experiments were performed on an electronic chart display and information system platform to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms time cost and length of routes were also given to illustrate differences of them the results of this study indicated that different route planning approaches can be designed based on different safety depths by using the l and fo l algorithms based on enc data rather than grid maps or other pre processed maps keywords route planning enc data l algorithm fo l algorithm 1 introduction route planning is a vital step that needs to be completed before navigation on manned ships route planning is designed and verified by the second officer and the captain of the ship an autonomous ship navigation system is a promising and effective approach towards route planning in unmanned ships while considering route safety presently three route planning methods are being used for ship navigation 1 global route planning which plans routes to avoid intersections or adjacencies with shorelines reefs and other known static obstacles chen et al 2020 han and yang 2020 liang et al 2020 2 local route planning which plans routes to avoid areas where collisions are detected mingheng and chaokuang 2010 stentz 1994 3 hybrid route planning zhang 2020 an unmanned ship first follows a global route which tracks the route and completes navigation provided there are no collision risks on the route if collision risk persists local route planning is carried out however the hybrid route planning is more comprehensive and hence most researchers prefer studying the global and local planning methods separately in this study we analyze the global route planning method due to its significant ability to complete navigation tasks in addition the problem of collisions is solved using approaches other than route planning methods gil et al 2020 big data analysis in ship navigation systems is a significant approach to route planning big data are mainly obtained from the ais automatic identification system altan and otay 2017 by analyzing the routes previously taken by a large number of ships zhang et al 2019 comprehensively analyzed the energy efficiency of an ice going ship a data driven based algorithm for automatic maritime routing was proposed by zhang et al 2018 which focused on processes like data pre processing and data analysis han and yang 2020 used data mining technology to extract ship routes from big data via noise however the premise of big data analysis is that the ais data must be obtained in advance the global ais data is difficult to obtain compared to the regional ais data therefore big data analysis is more popular for designing the planning route between two ports wen et al 2020 to solve the global route planning ensuring navigation safety many researchers have used the dijkstra and a algorithms that are carried out based on a grid map xu et al 2020 employed the dijkstra algorithm to obtain the primary route points with geomagnetic navigation matching regions and optimization was carried out using the particle swarm optimization algorithm under ship kinetic constraints wang et al 2019 proposed a three dimensional dijkstra optimization algorithm that allows a ship to plan its waypoints and the sailing speeds along each waypoint the a algorithm was improved using the dijkstra algorithm by using a heuristic function to reduce the search grids as compared to the grids in dijkstra algorithm the heuristic function was modified to reduce the algorithm search time guruji et al 2016 the theta algorithm was proposed to improve the optimality of the path formed by the grid edges by considering the route smoothness daniel et al 2010 the lazy theta algorithm was developed to reduce the time cost of the theta algorithm nash and koenig 2013 by avoiding the non sense line of sight check between the nodes additionally xie et al 2019 introduced a global multi directional a algorithm similar to the theta algorithm in terms of route planning however the dijkstra and a algorithms or their modified algorithms are mainly based on a grid map a long distance route will have a large number of grid nodes thereby increasing the time cost to solve this problem additional map forms were employed for route searching to investigate long distance route planning shah and gupta 2020 employed a quadtree map which reduced the number of search nodes in addition kang et al 2014 2015 used the delaunay triangulation map for route planning furthermore various other methods for designing and planning routes were investigated mannarini et al 2020 proposed a graph search ship routing model to obtain the time optimal planning route of ships the model estimated the time optimal ship heading and speeds through water considering the dynamic ocean wave fields chen et al 2020 proposed a hybrid approach for global path planning for maritime autonomous surface ships which generated the shortest path while considering the collision risk by estimating the proximity between the path and obstacles garcia et al 2012 discussed several alternatives based on graph search to calculate the uav trajectories that avoid regions that are least deviated from the shortest trajectory and exhibit dangerous weather effects lehtola et al 2019 analyzed and discussed the safety of automatic route planning from a sea captain s perspective chuang et al 2010 proposed a fuzzy genetic algorithm for route planning in liner shipping that not only evaluates the market demand shipping and berthing time of the container ships simultaneously but also the most suitable route for container ships in general automatic route planning has been carried out based on raster maps in most studies although the position of obstacles such as shorelines and reefs was considered actual water depth which is an important factor for navigation safety was ignored the water depth determines whether an area can be crossed as per the route planned however in grid maps it is difficult to estimate the depth of each grid based on vector data because of the substantial time cost and calculations therefore the water depth information including the position and depth of depth points is extracted from the electronic navigation chart enc data the delaunay triangulation dt map is established based on the water depth information and employed in determining the planning route using the l and fo l algorithms in fact there are some studies that have investigated the application of the dt map on route planning of ships or robots in a port area beeker 2004 used the dt map to calculate the shortest path when using depth information to design the planning route automatically the dt map was used to increase the number of water depth points dongwoo et al 2015 in addition marine lane boundary information was extracted using adaptive extraction precision by applying dt on the marine lane grid data wang et al 2020 to improve the efficiency of mobile robot path planning the dt algorithm was used to process complex obstacles and generate voronoi points as pathfinding priority nodes liu et al 2021 moreover factors like wind tides and water depth should be considered for suitable route planning however this study mainly focuses on providing a suitable route planning method based on the water depth to protect ships from grounding the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 accuracy the water depth information acquired from the enc data can be applied to provide a suitable planning route errors caused by conventional map conversion are eliminated 2

navigation safety is guaranteed 3 feasibility l and fo l algorithms are applied on an electronic chart display and information system ecdis platform which demonstrates that the algorithms are feasible for practical use the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the preliminary knowledge of route planning section 3 provides a detailed description of the l and fo l algorithms for automatic route planning section 4 presents the simulation and analysis results section 5 provides the discussion and conclusion of this study 2 preliminary knowledge 2 1 enc basis enc is a publication of electronic navigational charts for maritime research performance reports about hydrographical surveys and maritime observations it presents real world objects such as shorelines reefs depth contours and sounding depth as a combination of spatial and feature information iho 2000 most encs employ mercator projections which are equiangular cylindrical projections among which the tangent cylindrical projection is the oldest and most commonly used when displaying the enc data the cartesian coordinate system is used to fix the position of the objects that are employed in the route planning algorithms for convenience purposes the earth is considered a sphere rather than an ellipsoid and coordinate conversion from the mercator to the cartesian coordinate system is given by 1 x 60 Œª y 7915 70447 log 10 tan œÄ 4 œà 2 where Œª œà is the mercator coordinate system x y is the cartesian coordinate system Œª is the longitude and œà is the latitude of earth in contrast coordinate conversion from the cartesian to the mercator coordinate system is given by 2 Œª x 60 œï 2 180 œÄ a tan 10 y 7915 70447 œÄ 4 in the algorithms eq 1 is used to convert the latitudes and longitudes to cartesian coordinates once the waypoints of the route are obtained the cartesian coordinates are reconverted to latitudes and longitudes using eq 2 as mentioned the earth is considered a sphere rather than an ellipsoid to avoid errors in the algorithm considering that eqs 1 and 2 are inverse transformation relations 2 2 delaunay triangulation dt algorithm 2 2 1basis of dt dt structures are widely used in the field of computer technology jun and meng lin 2010 kallis et al 2017 shinan et al 2020 stepanov and smith 2012 employed the dt to estimate the shortest path and obtain the initial results definition 1 delaunay triangulation for a given set of discrete points p in a plane is a triangulation dt p such that no point in p lies within the circumcircle of any triangle in dt p the above definition provides a concrete description of the dt the dt structure in the 2d plane is shown in fig 1 point p does not exist in any triangle t 2 2 2dt algorithm for route planning based on enc as seen in fig 2 the distribution of water depth points in the enc is discrete and uneven making it difficult to build a grid map however the dt is capable of reorganizing the water depth points therefore the environment of the navigation route was modeled using a dt structure based on the enc data there are two definitions to model the navigation environment depth node and dt map definition 2 the depth node is the center of the triangle in the dt map which exhibits two properties the node position and depth value definition 3 the dt map comprises the dt structure and depth nodes remark 1 the depth node can be estimated from the minimum depth value of the three water depth points that form the triangle remark 2 considering the minimum depth value of the three water depth points that form the triangle confirms that the actual depth of the depth node is larger than that in algorithm which ensures navigation safety fig 3 shows the dt map used to design the route the center of each triangle is considered as a node which is similar to the single grid in the grid map the main function of dt structure is to generate more water depth nodes which contributes to route planning in fact there are various methods to induce dt structure which may affect the results of planning routes but they are out of scope of this study instead we only consider one kind of dt structure kallis et al 2017 as the foundation of route planning algorithms further researches in terms of effectiveness of dt structure can be developed based on this study 3 route planning algorithms l and fo l this paper presents the l and fo l final optimization l algorithms based on the dt map for route planning the algorithms use the enc data which is assumed to be accurate and updated in real time in this section the algorithms are described in detail 3 1 l algorithm the l algorithm is used to develop an optimal automatic route planning method if route planning is carried out on a grid map the enc data is pre processed by converting the image to grayscale however unlike the dijkstra algorithm the a and l algorithms can be used on the dt map directly although the search process of the l algorithm is similar to that of the a algorithm the strategy to find the nodes adjacent to the current node is completely different fig 4 illustrates the search process of the l algorithm which can be divided into four steps step 1 according to navigation tasks position departure and destination of ships should be converted into cartesian coordinates at first step 2 extract vector data and obtain depth information of ecn involved use delaunay algorithm to increase the number of water depth nodes dongwoo et al 2015 step 3 initialize parameters used in a algorithm guruji et al 2016 sets f hn g open closed and parent are maintained f n is the cost value of the nth water depth node that is the sum of hn n and g n where g n is the length of the path from the departure to the nth water depth node and hn n is the heuristic distance from nth water depth node to the destination open is a list containing water depth nodes to be checked and closed is the list that includes water depth nodes that need not be checked parent is a list that records the relationships between nodes step 4 employ proposed strategy shown as fig 5 and fig 6 to find adjacent water depth nodes and ensure water depth between current water depth node and adjacent ones meets safety requirement in addition the forms of sets f hn g open closed parent are maintained as lists instead of tables to reduce the calculation pressure on the cpu because the algorithm uses a dt map instead of the grid map in the grid map the adjacent nodes can be easily located owing to the coordinate relationship between the current and adjacent nodes however locating the adjacent nodes on the dt map using the same closest distance strategy is difficult as it may never find the destination owing to the uneven distribution of the water depth points as shown in fig 5 the red and green dots indicate the current and destination nodes respectively the adjacent nodes of the current node cannot be determined based on coordinate relationships therefore to enable the algorithm to search along the direction of the destination the water depth point is divided into four parts according to the quadrant as shown in fig 6 the parts i ii iii and iv were measured counterclockwise from the positive x axis as 0 90 90 180 180 270 and 270 360 respectively the same number of adjacent nodes should be selected from all four parts to ensure that the uneven distribution of water depth points does not affect the searching direction 3 2 fo l algorithm the l algorithm provides the route which is composed of water depth nodes however the route planning is not a smooth process owing to the uneven distribution of water depth nodes the characteristics of the l algorithm are presented in the simulation section section 4 in practical navigation route planning only considers the vital waypoints that are presented in the form of polylines and is called waypoints based route planning liang et al 2020 therefore the fo l final optimization l algorithm is proposed to optimize and obtain the waypoint based planning route the fo l algorithm comprises two parts the l algorithm and the final optimization process fig 7 illustrates the functioning of the fo l algorithm to provide an optimized route it is a multiple rounds line of sight optimization process where depth information is fully considered first the waypoints of the basic route defined by the l algorithm were used assuming that the number of waypoints is Œ∂ the first and last waypoints were considered as the current waypoint Œ± and the tbc to be checked waypoint Œ≤ respectively the two points can be considered as the ends of a straight line Œ± Œ≤ which is 1 Œ∂ Œ± 1 Œ≤ Œ∂ at the beginning of optimization further the area passing the straight line 1 Œ∂ is checked to determine whether the water depth nodes meet the requirements the line of sight check depends on the dda digital differential analyzer algorithm which is widely used in computer technology if the line of sight does not exist the second to last waypoint Œ∂ 1 is classified as tbc waypoint Œ≤ Œ∂ 1 and the line of sight check will be carried out again on the contrary if the line of sight exists the waypoints between the current and tbc waypoints are eliminated furthermore it is necessary to ensure that the entire optimization process is completed that is when Œ± Œ∂ to verify the optimized waypoints of the route if the optimization process is incomplete the tbc and current waypoints are updated Œ± Œ≤ Œ≤ Œ∂ and the line of sight check is carried out until the entire process is completed steps ‚ë† and ‚ë° in fig 7 update the current and tbc waypoints respectively to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms two cases are studied in section 4 4 simulation 4 1 simulation preparation the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms was verified using a closed loop simulation system as shown in fig 8 enc data of ecdis platform was extracted firstly to get vector information then the route planning based algorithms was carried out generalize waypoints which determine a route finally the route was exhibited on ecdis platform to guide the navigation of ship the specifications of the computer used are as follows macbook pro 13 inch 2017 two thunderbolt 3 ports 2 3 ghz intel core i5 8 gb 2133 mhz lpddr3 4 2 simulation and analysis of case i in the first experiment route planning was designed for the gulf of mexico based on the proposed algorithms the experimental area is shown in fig 9 the latitude and longitude range from 17 47 31 n to 33 37 00 n and 98 w to 76 7 10 w respectively the enc data chart numbers and scales used in the experiment are given in table 1 first the water depth information extracted from the enc data was reorganized to obtain the dt map as seen in fig 10 the depth nodes were present in the center of the delaunay triangle the water depth of a depth node depends on the minimum water depth of the three adjacent water depth points which is smaller in real time than the true water depth the l and fo l algorithms were carried out on the dt map assuming that the departure and destination points were positioned at 20 0 78  πn 95 33 45 w and 31 19 46 n 78 47 85 w respectively fig 11 illustrates the route planning using the l and fo l algorithms the route defined by the l algorithm was connected by a large number of depth nodes because of the large inertia of the ship it was feasible to maintain a straight line trajectory at a fixed speed therefore the route only included vital waypoints for practical navigation however considering a large number of unnecessary waypoints route planning using the l algorithm is not suitable for the tracking of ships as the ship tracks each waypoint individually owing to its large inertia alternatively route planning using the fo l algorithm comprises seven vital waypoints which conforms to practical navigation furthermore the computational cost also determines the effectiveness of the algorithm lazakis and khan 2021 therefore time costs are taken as the index of computational cost in terms of both algorithms mannarini et al 2020 chuang et al 2010 etc the detailed differences between the two algorithms are shown in table 2 although the time cost of the fo l algorithm is higher the node quantity and route length are smaller than in the l algorithm in addition to verify the safety of the routes they were displayed on the ecdis platform for further analysis fig 12 shows an overview of the route planning using the l and fo l algorithms in general the safety of the routes was guaranteed which in turn verified the proposed algorithms however small scale charts cannot detect shallow water and certain obstacles therefore verifying the route on a large scale chart was required in this study route planning using the fo l algorithm was employed for navigation consequently the route determined was further checked on a large scale chart as seen in fig 13 the planned route does not cross regions with shallow waters or obstacles which further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm it is necessary to understand the effect of water depth on route planning therefore case ii is discussed in the next section 4 3 simulation and analysis of case ii in case ii a part of the mississippi river was selected as the experimental area as shown in fig 14 a single enc chart was used in this case whose number and scale were us6la53m and 1 12000 respectively the departure point was near billers whose concrete position was 20 20 55 585 n 089 29 34 124 w the destination point was near port nickel whose concrete position was 29 51 π 42 911 ∫ n 089 58 π 44 604 ∫ w in addition three routes were designed using the proposed algorithm with the safe water depths at 5 10 and 15 m the results are shown in fig 15 to clarify the results subareas a b c d e f and g were enlarged as seen in fig 16 when the ship navigates a safe water depth larger than the ship draft ensures protection of the ship against grounding as seen in the figure the routes with different safety water depths were different although they coincide in some areas fig 16 i shows the departure area it is known that all routes start from the same departure point fig 16 ii iii iv v and vi show the center areas of the entire route it is clear that the routes pass through different areas especially in river bends fig 16 vii shows that all routes end at the same destination point from the above observations it is obvious that the safety of the routes is guaranteed additionally the characteristics of the routes were also investigated table 3 provides information on the number of waypoints and time consumption of generating routes the number of waypoints of the route planned using the fo l algorithm is much smaller than that in the route planned using the l algorithm the time consumption is also considered to be acceptable because the routes were planned before navigation and not in real time in the search process the dt algorithm was used to generate more water depth nodes cases i and ii deployed various numbers of water depth nodes and as a result provided improved routes based on the safe water depth values therefore the algorithms proposed in this study can be applied as long as water depth nodes are present although generating a dt mesh is the key problem in some fields it has not been involved in this study in general closed loop simulations have verified the feasibility of route planning approaches the planned route can be achieved using the proposed algorithms based on the enc data 5 conclusion and discussion in this study we investigated the problems in the automatic route planning approach considering the vector map comprises more information than the raster map the dt structure was introduced the water information which comprises the water depth position and depth value is extracted from the enc data and reorganized as a dt structure to form a dt map the l and fo l algorithms were proposed to attempt route planning on the dt map the entire process was simulated on the ecdis platform using matlab software this study contributes to the further development of smart ecdis platforms however some limitations should be addressed 1 a traffic separation scheme should be considered in further research 2 weather conditions should be considered to ensure safe ship navigation 3 the recommended routes should be able to obtain the final route planned 4 the effect of various dt structure on planning routes should be study further in future credit authorship contribution statement cailei liang

20497,this study investigates the problems in the automatic route planning method which is a critical function for the safe navigation of manned and unmanned ships we designed a route planning process by extracting the water depth information such as the position and depth value of water depth points using the electronic navigation chart enc data the discrete water depth points were reorganized to form a delaunay triangulation dt data structure which is the basis of the dt algorithm the l algorithm was proposed and employed on the dt map to provide an appropriate planning route furthermore the fo l final optimization l algorithm was used to design an optimized planning route connected by vital waypoints only finally two closed loop experiments were performed on an electronic chart display and information system platform to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms time cost and length of routes were also given to illustrate differences of them the results of this study indicated that different route planning approaches can be designed based on different safety depths by using the l and fo l algorithms based on enc data rather than grid maps or other pre processed maps keywords route planning enc data l algorithm fo l algorithm 1 introduction route planning is a vital step that needs to be completed before navigation on manned ships route planning is designed and verified by the second officer and the captain of the ship an autonomous ship navigation system is a promising and effective approach towards route planning in unmanned ships while considering route safety presently three route planning methods are being used for ship navigation 1 global route planning which plans routes to avoid intersections or adjacencies with shorelines reefs and other known static obstacles chen et al 2020 han and yang 2020 liang et al 2020 2 local route planning which plans routes to avoid areas where collisions are detected mingheng and chaokuang 2010 stentz 1994 3 hybrid route planning zhang 2020 an unmanned ship first follows a global route which tracks the route and completes navigation provided there are no collision risks on the route if collision risk persists local route planning is carried out however the hybrid route planning is more comprehensive and hence most researchers prefer studying the global and local planning methods separately in this study we analyze the global route planning method due to its significant ability to complete navigation tasks in addition the problem of collisions is solved using approaches other than route planning methods gil et al 2020 big data analysis in ship navigation systems is a significant approach to route planning big data are mainly obtained from the ais automatic identification system altan and otay

practical navigation route planning only considers the vital waypoints that are presented in the form of polylines and is called waypoints based route planning liang et al 2020 therefore the fo l final optimization l algorithm is proposed to optimize and obtain the waypoint based planning route the fo l algorithm comprises two parts the l algorithm and the final optimization process fig 7 illustrates the functioning of the fo l algorithm to provide an optimized route it is a multiple rounds line of sight optimization process where depth information is fully considered first the waypoints of the basic route defined by the l algorithm were used assuming that the number of waypoints is Œ∂ the first and last waypoints were considered as the current waypoint Œ± and the tbc to be checked waypoint Œ≤ respectively the two points can be considered as the ends of a straight line Œ± Œ≤ which is 1 Œ∂ Œ± 1 Œ≤ Œ∂ at the beginning of optimization further the area passing the straight line 1 Œ∂ is checked to determine whether the water depth nodes meet the requirements the line of sight check depends on the dda digital differential analyzer algorithm which is widely used in computer technology if the line of sight does not exist the second to last waypoint Œ∂ 1 is classified as tbc waypoint Œ≤ Œ∂ 1 and the line of sight check will be carried out again on the contrary if the line of sight exists the waypoints between the current and tbc waypoints are eliminated furthermore it is necessary to ensure that the entire optimization process is completed that is when Œ± Œ∂ to verify the optimized waypoints of the route if the optimization process is incomplete the tbc and current waypoints are updated Œ± Œ≤ Œ≤ Œ∂ and the line of sight check is carried out until the entire process is completed steps ‚ë† and ‚ë° in fig 7 update the current and tbc waypoints respectively to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms two cases are studied in section 4 4 simulation 4 1 simulation preparation the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms was verified using a closed loop simulation system as shown in fig 8 enc data of ecdis platform was extracted firstly to get vector information then the route planning based algorithms was carried out generalize waypoints which determine a route finally the route was exhibited on ecdis platform to guide the navigation of ship the specifications of the computer used are as follows macbook pro 13 inch 2017 two thunderbolt 3 ports 2 3 ghz intel core i5 8 gb 2133 mhz lpddr3 4 2 simulation and analysis of case i in the first experiment route planning was designed for the gulf of mexico based on the proposed algorithms the experimental area is shown in fig 9 the latitude and longitude range from 17 47 31 n to 33 37 00 n and 98 w to 76 7 10 w respectively the enc data chart numbers and scales used in the experiment are given in table 1 first the water depth information extracted from the enc data was reorganized to obtain the dt map as seen in fig 10 the depth nodes were present in the center of the delaunay triangle the water depth of a depth node depends on the minimum water depth of the three adjacent water depth points which is smaller in real time than the true water depth the l and fo l algorithms were carried out on the dt map assuming that the departure and destination points were positioned at 20 0 78  πn 95 33 45 w and 31 19 46 n 78 47 85 w respectively fig 11 illustrates the route planning using the l and fo l algorithms the route defined by the l algorithm was connected by a large number of depth nodes because of the large inertia of the ship it was feasible to maintain a straight line trajectory at a fixed speed therefore the route only included vital waypoints for practical navigation however considering a large number of unnecessary waypoints route planning using the l algorithm is not suitable for the tracking of ships as the ship tracks each waypoint individually owing to its large inertia alternatively route planning using the fo l algorithm comprises seven vital waypoints which conforms to practical navigation furthermore the computational cost also determines the effectiveness of the algorithm lazakis and khan 2021 therefore time costs are taken as the index of computational cost in terms of both algorithms mannarini et al 2020 chuang et al 2010 etc the detailed differences between the two algorithms are shown in table 2 although the time cost of the fo l algorithm is higher the node quantity and route length are smaller than in the l algorithm in addition to verify the safety of the routes they were displayed on the ecdis platform for further analysis fig 12 shows an overview of the route planning using the l and fo l algorithms in general the safety of the routes was guaranteed which in turn verified the proposed algorithms however small scale charts cannot detect shallow water and certain obstacles therefore verifying the route on a large scale chart was required in this study route planning using the fo l algorithm was employed for navigation consequently the route determined was further checked on a large scale chart as seen in fig 13 the planned route does not cross regions with shallow waters or obstacles which further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm it is necessary to understand the effect of water depth on route planning therefore case ii is discussed in the next section 4 3 simulation and analysis of case ii in case ii a part of the mississippi river was selected as the experimental area as shown in fig 14 a single enc chart was used in this case whose number and scale were us6la53m and 1 12000 respectively the departure point was near billers whose concrete position was 20 20 55 585 n 089 29 34 124 w the destination point was near port nickel whose concrete position was 29 51 π 42 911 ∫ n 089 58 π 44 604 ∫ w in addition three routes were designed using the proposed algorithm with the safe water depths at 5 10 and 15 m the results are shown in fig 15 to clarify the results subareas a b c d e f and g were enlarged as seen in fig 16 when the ship navigates a safe water depth larger than the ship draft ensures protection of the ship against grounding as seen in the figure the routes with different safety water depths were different although they coincide in some areas fig 16 i shows the departure area it is known that all routes start from the same departure point fig 16 ii iii iv v and vi show the center areas of the entire route it is clear that the routes pass through different areas especially in river bends fig 16 vii shows that all routes end at the same destination point from the above observations it is obvious that the safety of the routes is guaranteed additionally the characteristics of the routes were also investigated table 3 provides information on the number of waypoints and time consumption of generating routes the number of waypoints of the route planned using the fo l algorithm is much smaller than that in the route planned using the l algorithm the time consumption is also considered to be acceptable because the routes were planned before navigation and not in real time in the search process the dt algorithm was used to generate more water depth nodes cases i and ii deployed various numbers of water depth nodes and as a result provided improved routes based on the safe water depth values therefore the algorithms proposed in this study can be applied as long as water depth nodes are present although generating a dt mesh is the key problem in some fields it has not been involved in this study in general closed loop simulations have verified the feasibility of route planning approaches the planned route can be achieved using the proposed algorithms based on the enc data 5 conclusion and discussion in this study we investigated the problems in the automatic route planning approach considering the vector map comprises more information than the raster map the dt structure was introduced the water information which comprises the water depth position and depth value is extracted from the enc data and reorganized as a dt structure to form a dt map the l and fo l algorithms were proposed to attempt route planning on the dt map the entire process was simulated on the ecdis platform using matlab software this study contributes to the further development of smart ecdis platforms however some limitations should be addressed 1 a traffic separation scheme should be considered in further research 2 weather conditions should be considered to ensure safe ship navigation 3 the recommended routes should be able to obtain the final route planned 4 the effect of various dt structure on planning routes should be study further in future credit authorship contribution statement cailei liang

20498,the strong coupling effect between an air bubble attached to a flexible plate and a nearby spark generated bubble is investigated experimentally while also considering the structural deformation of the plate numerous interesting and complex bubble behaviors that depend strongly on the attached air bubble and deformation effect of the structure are observed with a high speed camera a multitude of bubble jet behaviors are observed during the two bubble pulsations such as bubble splitting jets away from the plate jets toward the plate upward and downward movement after splitting and splitting after the coalescence of the two bubbles moreover the attached air bubble can appear hemispherical mushroom shaped or cup shaped to gain a better understanding of the interaction between the bubble and the flexible boundary the displacement time history curves at the center point of the flexible structure and at the top and bottom vertices of the bubble are obtained the motion response mode of the flexible plate under bubble loading is explored to summarize the deformation pattern of the flexible structure and the motion characteristics of the bubble an air bubble attached to the flexible structure can change the motion characteristics of the spark generated bubble to some extent keywords bubble dynamics attached air bubble spark generated bubble flexible structure bubble jets 1 introduction the interaction between pulsating bubbles and their surrounding boundaries is a common phenomenon of interest in natural and industrial applications and it also plays an important role in science and military applications pulsating bubbles near different boundaries have a wide range of beneficial applications and destructive effects and their dynamics are of great significance saleki haselghoubi et al 2018 in many industrial applications such as ship propellers zhu and fang 2012 steam turbines ƒçdina 2003 and cryogenic pumps bahaj et al 2007 excessive cavitation bubbles are generated which not only damage structures huang et al 2013 ma et al 2017b and generate vibration huang et al 2014 and noise ma et al 2016 but also greatly reduce the operating efficiency huang et al 2010 although cavitation bubbles can erode or damage solid materials brujan et al 2001a b lauterborn and kurz 2010 cavitation also helps to achieve the desired results in ice breaking and biomedical ultrasound as well as laser mediated surgical applications cui et al 2018 miller et al 1996 vogel and venugopalan 2003 during bubble contraction the pressure gradient around the bubble changes due to the presence of surrounding boundaries resulting in non spherical bubble contraction and jet generation which is responsible for damage to the nearby boundary choi and chahine 2015 and marlin and chahine 2018 demonstrated that coated polyurea provides a good performance against cavitation erosion peters and moctar 2020 developed a new numerical method and applied it to assess cavitation induced erosion sagar and moctar 2020 investigated the dynamics and the induced damage of a cavitation bubble near a solid surface cui et al 2020 brujan et al 2018 and wang 2019 studied the jet characteristics of collapsing bubbles near mixed corner boundaries and observed oblique and planar jets reuter et al 2016 monitored the time dependent impact of bubbles on the near wall diffusion layer blake et al 1993 investigated the motion of two cavitation bubbles near a rigid boundary whereas luo et al 2018 studied the impact characteristics of cavitation bubble collapse on the wall surface they determined that the dimensionless distance has an important effect on the impact of cavitation bubble collapse on the wall ye et al 2020 considered the size effect of materials in the formation of a cavitation pit and analyzed the cavitation pit inversely poar et al 2021 studied the interaction between a nanosecond laser striking a cavitation structure in water near a concave surface and shock waves they observed that the concave surface refocused the shock wave and later induced a secondary cavitation near the acoustic focus denner et al 2021 investigated the asymmetric collapse of cavitation bubbles near a solid substrate and demonstrated that an accurate measurement of the pressure pulse emitted during bubble inception and of the maximum bubble radius allowed for an accurate reproduction of the asymmetric collapse wang et al 2020 studied bubble dynamics at a corner formed by two flat rigid boundaries and noted that the oscillation period and the jet width increased but the jet velocity decreased compared to a bubble near a flat wall zeng et al 2020 studied the dynamics of cavitation bubbles and induced jets in a thin liquid gap bounded by two rigid walls and determined that the jet dynamics direction and strength were dependent on the choice of the gap thickness and location of bubble inception liu et al 2021 studied bubble collapse characteristics near a solid wall under different hypergravity environments and determined that the bubble motion the formation position of the bubble jet the liquid jet velocity and the pressure induced by the bubble will change significantly under different hypergravity environments in order to control cavitation bubbles and prevent their consequences materials for fluid mechanics have been further developed to provide a significant elasticity ma et al 2017a gibson and blake 1982 blake and gibson 1987 and duncan and zhang 1991 conducted early explorations by experimentally studying the properties of bubbles near the rubber coating on a structure surface they determined that the bubble dynamics were dependent on the nearby rubber body and that the bubble split into smaller bubbles brujan et al 2001a b experimentally investigated the interaction between a laser induced cavitation bubble and an elastic membrane and determined that during the contraction phase the bubble appeared to be mushroom like due to the rebound and deformation of the elastic boundary tomita and kodama 2003 and shima et al 1989 experimentally demonstrated that when a bubble pulses near an elastic boundary the boundary will affect the fluid flow around the bubble cui et al 2016b studied the generation of underwater explosive bubbles using the same charge near an elastic wall boundary under different conditions the results showed that the bubble behavior and the pulse pressure characteristics changed compared to those with a solid boundary gong et al 2018 investigated the interaction between a two layer composite beam and a spark generated bubble and gong 2019 examined the transient response of a composite structure subjected to an underwater explosion the results showed that the composite hull performs better in amortizing the impact pressure caused by the bubble compared to the steel hull in practical applications cavitation bubbles often do not exist alone studies considering the coupling effect between multiple cavitation bubbles of different sizes are extremely difficult to perform luo et al 2019 studied the collapse direction of a cavitation bubble under the dual action of an air bubble and a wall they determined that cavitation bubbles near air bubbles may only collapse toward or away from the air bubbles li et al 2019 presented experimental and numerical investigations on the nonlinear interaction coalescence collapse and rebound of two pulsating bubbles and determined that the collapse of the two bubble systems was less violent than that of a single bubble cui et al 2020 studied ice breaking caused by a pair of interacting collapsing bubbles via an experimental approach and summarized the regions where the damaging potential of the bubble pair is strengthened or weakened zhang 2010 studied the motions of a spark induced cavitation bubble and an air bubble near a rigid boundary and determined that placing a bubble between the rigid boundary and a cavitation bubble could prevent the collapsing jet of the bubble from being directed toward the boundary smith and mesler 1972 discussed the interaction of a bubble attached to a solid boundary with a vapor bubble produced by nearby sparks and showed that the bubble attached to the boundary could protect the surface from damage goh et al 2014 conducted an electric spark bubble test with an air bubble attached to a 5 mm polyvinyl chloride pvc flexible boundary and determined that the dimensionless pulsation period ratio between the two bubbles was an important factor in determining the direction of the bubble jet wang et al 2020 investigated the dynamics of a spark generated bubble near a stationary bubble attached to a plate and determined that the coupling behavior of the two bubbles was closely related to the dimensionless distance between the spark bubble and the plate the relative sizes of the two bubbles and the dimensionless bubble oscillation time in actual structures an obvious structural response will occur under bubble loading however in the current research process only the bubble dynamics near the rigid surface of the attached bubble have been studied while there are relatively few studies on the bubble dynamics near a flexible structure with an attached air bubble unlike studies on bubble dynamics near a solid boundary with attached air bubbles in addition to the coupling of the oscillating bubble the attached air bubble and the deformation structure the influence of the deformation structure on the two bubbles should be considered moreover the effect of the energy stored and released by the deformed structure on two bubbles pulsation is not clear in this study the jet morphology of a bubble generated near a flexible structure with an attached air bubble and the pulsation response of the attached air bubble are investigated using a spark generated bubble and a high speed camera in addition particular attention is given to the coupled responses of the oscillating bubble the attached air bubble and the flexible boundary the effect of the attached air bubble on the motion characteristics of the generated bubble at different distances is observed and we aim to elucidate the strong coupling effect between the attached air bubble and the oscillating bubble considering the structural deformation effect in addition we focus on the effect of the attached air bubble on the deformation of the flexible structure and the bubble jets to provide a better understanding of this phenomenon evaluate the protection mechanism of the attached air bubble on the flexible boundary against the bubble jet load and provide a reference for the impact load protection of an underwater ship 2 experimental setup the experimental setup shown in fig 1 includes a low voltage discharge system a high speed camera an adjustable structure positioning device an illuminated light source a pvc plate with elastic modulus e 600 mpa and a surface attached air bubble the tests were performed in a 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m glass water tank the air bubble under the pvc plate was generated by using a 1 0 ml syringe with 100 scales and this gives rise to an attached air bubble that is hemispherical with a contact angle of 90 6 both sides of the pvc plate are fixed on the lifting gear with three degrees of freedom the air bubble is not fixed in the pvc plate and it can move freely the discharge circuit is mainly controlled by a 1 kœâ resistor and a 6600 Œºf capacitor which is imported to transfer 220 v ac to 100 v dc when the voltage reached approximately 100 v the discharge was triggered the spark discharge method has the advantages of precisely controlling the bubble nucleation location and having a low cost the major drawbacks are less precise control of the bubble size and frequent replacement of the electrodes which are immersed in water chew et al 2011 fong et al 2009 the electrodes will break after being short circuited and thus must be replaced after every experiment chew et al 2011 in our experiments to minimize the possible interference caused by the electrodes a thin copper wire with a diameter of 0 25 mm was short circuited to vaporize the surrounding liquid at a high temperature and generate a spark bubble in the tank the electrodes are arranged in a simply touching each other and the requirement for the two crossed copper wires is that there is only one connect point at this discharge voltage the maximum pulsating bubble radius was approximately 2 7 mm thus the radius of the copper wire was approximately 1 8 6 3 of the maximum bubble radius and the influence of the copper wire on the bubble dynamics could be neglected cui et al 2016a 2020 gong et al 2018 we recorded the experiments using a fastcam mini ux100 high speed camera at 10 240 frames per second and a shutter speed of 1 100 000 s a 2 kw spot light was placed on the other side of the water tank to provide sufficient brightness for the high speed camera a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a the experiments used 1 mm and 3 mm pvc plates as flexible boundaries in which the structural positioning device had three degrees of freedom the copper wires were then crossed and touched at their ends in water to ensure that there was only one contact point when the copper wire was fixed a specific experimental condition was quantitatively achieved by adjusting the position of the structure in the transverse longitudinal and vertical directions this arrangement of electrodes promotes the formation of a spark bubble at voltages much lower than the few kilovolts required for experiments using no contact electrodes buogo and cannelli 2002 the definitions of the measure points and bubble parameters are shown in fig 1 b p1 is a measurement point on the flexible plate located in the center of the attached air bubble p2 and p3 are the top and bottom vertices of the bubble h s represents the distance from the center of the bubble to the boundary h w represents the width of the air bubble r m represents the equivalent radius when the bubble reaches the maximum volume v m and r e represents the equivalent radius corresponding to the volume of the attached bubble based on the above parameters the following four dimensionless quantities are defined a dimensionless distance parameter h a dimensionless volume ratio v a dimensionless pulsation period ratio t and a dimensionless cavitation bubble oscillation time t 1 h h s r m 2 v v m c v 0 where cv 0 is the initial air bubble volume 3 t t r max œÅ p p v where t is the pulsation period of the spark bubble p is the reference hydrostatic pressure 1 bar œÅ is the density of the water and the denominator is a value related to the rayleigh bubble pulsation period zhang et al 2015 2016 cui et al 2020 yang et al 2013 4 t t 2 œÄ r e œÅ 3 Œ≥ 1 p where Œ≥ 1 1 4 is the ratio of the specific heats of the gas in the attached air bubble and the denominator is the theoretical period of oscillation of an air bubble goh et al 2014 this value is only used for cases of a flexible plate with an attached air bubble 3 experimental results the bubble dynamics close to 1 mm and 3 mm pvc plates with and without an attached air bubble were investigated in detail the dimensionless distance parameter Œ∑ used in the bubble behavior experiments ranged from 0 6 to 3 7 a special emphasis was placed on the influences of the relative distance between the oscillating bubble and the flexible plate the attached air bubble and the flexible plate thickness on the temporal evolution of the oscillating bubble shape air bubble shape jet formation and response pattern of the flexible plate 3 1 effect of an attached air bubble on the motion characteristics of bubbles at different distances 3 1 1 comparison of bubble dynamics close to a 1 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble to describe the effect of an attached air bubble on the structural response and bubble shapes some selected cases were chosen with similar parameters of h and r max for convenience of the analysis the experimental parameters of the test conditions shown in figs 2 4 are listed in table 1 the spark discharge setup provides less precise control over the bubble size therefore in the following analysis two cases with bubble size differences of less than 13 are considered to be of a similar size chew et al 2011 fig 2 illustrates the behavior of the bubble generated in the vicinity of a 1 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 1 in fig 2 a the interaction between an oscillating bubble and an air bubble attached to a 1 mm pvc plate is explored the bubble expands to its maximum volume at t 1 34 and the upper surface is flattened due to the inhibition of the attached air bubble at t 1 66 under the combined effect of the attraction of the oscillating contractive bubble and the expansion of the attached air bubble bubble coalescence is observed as two bubble boundaries very close to one another subsequently the two parts of the coalesced bubble contract synchronously as a single bubble at t 2 33 and a large downward displacement of 0 111 mm is observed in the flexible plate under the suction of the coalesced bubble it can be seen that a bubble splitting phenomenon along the horizontal direction emerges for the coalescence of two vertically arranged bubbles in the studies by han et al 2018 and rungsiyaphornrat et al 2003 however it is interesting to note that the bubble splitting phenomenon along the vertical direction occurs after the coalescence of attached air bubble and oscillating bubble as shown in fig 1 a a possible reason for this phenomenon may be because the elastic restoring force from the flexible plate shown in fig 2 a4 and a5 injects the stored energy and the deformed plate moves upward and returns to its original position blake and gibson 1987 shima et al 1989 for the second sequence shown in fig 2 b the bubble reaches its maximum radius at t 1 80 and maintains a regular spherical shape during the early stage of the bubble collapse phase and the bubble shrinks into a gourd like shape at t 2 61 as shown in fig 2 b4 and b5 the lower surface of the bubble contracts faster than the upper surface and the liquid jets are directed obliquely upward toward the flexible boundary while the upper surface remains almost unchanged this differs from the bubble evolution close to a rigid boundary which exhibits a jet in the vertical direction chew et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the bubble splits into smaller bubbles of different sizes at t 3 27 the upper larger sub bubble migrates upward to the boundary while the smaller sub bubble moves in the direction away from the boundary the bubble pulsation period is 3 11 and the maximum displacement of the measurement point on the plate is 0 118 mm fig 2 shows that due to the presence of the attached air bubble at h 1 the bubble pulsation period is significantly reduced by 15 7 and the movement of the measurement point above the bubble is reduced by 10 fig 3 illustrates the behavior of a bubble in the vicinity of a 1 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 1 4 as shown in fig 3 a as the oscillating bubble contracts the attached air bubble undergoes a non spherical contraction and expansion phase the bubble then reaches its maximum volume at t 1 42 and in fig 3 a2 the top surface of the bubble appears distinctly flattened meanwhile the attached air bubble volume further increases and then decreases with an oscillating bubble contraction as shown in fig 3 a3 the two bubbles exhibit special morphologies in the late bubble contraction the attached air bubble and oscillating bubble are observed as a mushroom shape and a jar shape respectively where the width of the top of the attached air bubble is smaller than that of the bottom a more pronounced phenomenon occurs during the bubble rebound phase in which the bubble splits into two smaller bubbles of a similar size that then migrate upward and downward at t 3 27 splitting of the attached air bubble is observed and the two bubbles are found to split at the same time in fig 3 b the bubble is observed as a peanut shape at the end of the bubble contraction phase subsequently the bubble splits into two smaller bubbles of different sizes at t 4 64 and both sub bubbles migrate upward to the boundary after a further analysis it can be seen that in the case of h 1 4 and r max 4 8 the maximum displacements of the measurement point above the bubble are 0 71 mm and 0 85 mm respectively which indicates that the presence of an attached air bubble at h 1 4 has an effect on the bubble at the same time the pulsation period of the bubble is significantly shortened fig 4 illustrates the behavior of a bubble in the vicinity of a 1 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 2 as shown in fig 4 a due to the relatively large distance parameter the bubble maintains a regular spherical shape during the expansion stage and the bubble reaches its maximum and minimum radii at t 1 20 and 2 37 respectively a flattened shape is observed at the top surface of the oscillating bubble at t 2 37 and the attached air bubble maintains a constant shape in the first cycle of pulsation in the rebound stage the oscillating bubble splits into two smaller bubbles that then move upward and downward with severe distortion of the attached air bubble observed which appears as a cup lid shape subsequently under the rebound effect of the attached air bubble both small sub bubbles move downward and away from the flexible boundary for the second sequence shown in fig 4 b the bubble remains spherical throughout the pulsation phase and reaches its maximum and minimum radii at t 2 02 and 3 51 respectively a significant increase in the cycle of the bubble pulsation is observed at this time at t 3 89 the bubble splits into two smaller bubbles of similar size and the two sub bubbles are observed to pulsate with no deviation from the flexible boundary fig 4 shows that the pulsation period of the bubble is significantly reduced a plausible cause of which could be the presence of the attached air bubble 3 1 2 comparison of the bubble dynamics close to a 3 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble the experimental parameters of the test conditions shown in figs 5 7 are listed in table 2 as seen from tables 1 and 2 there is a small difference in the volume of the attached air bubble which has a small effect on the bubble pulsation on the contrary the bubble motion characteristics in these cases are mainly influenced by the distance parameter fig 5 illustrates the behavior of a bubble in the vicinity of a 3 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 1 55 as shown in fig 5 a the attached air bubble initially contracts and then expands under the expansion of the oscillating bubble and the oscillating bubble and attached air bubble reach their maximum volumes simultaneously at t 2 07 as shown in fig 5 a4 during bubble contraction the width of the top of the attached air bubble is smaller than that of the bottom and a mushroom shape is observed in the air bubble at t 3 20 the air bubble exhibits a mallet shape with a small width at the top and bottom of the bubble and a large width at the middle of the bubble from the trails of the oscillating bubble at t 3 39 it can be seen that the bubble exhibits a jet toward the flexible boundary with upward movement as shown in fig 5 b the bubble morphology is constant during most of the expansion and contraction phases the bubble phenomena are thus not described here special attention is given to the bubble shape at the end of the contraction phase where an ellipsoid shape is observed at t 4 25 as shown in fig 5 b5 the bottom of the bubble becomes cuspidal and induces a jet toward the flexible boundary at t 4 99 comparing the experimental observations in figs 3 and 5 reveals that the increase in the thickness of the pvc plate results in a significant reduction in the displacement of the point on the flexible plate when the distance parameter is close fig 6 illustrates the behavior of a bubble in the vicinity of a 3 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 2 as the distance parameter increases in the first cycle of bubble oscillation the oscillating bubble remains spherical and the attached air bubble exhibits a regular hemispherical shape at t 2 44 the width of the middle of the oscillating bubble is reduced to a gourd shape and the attached air bubble exhibits a column shape during the bubble rebound phase the oscillating bubble splits into two smaller bubbles of different sizes at t 2 64 and the two sub bubbles then move upward and downward at t 3 10 splitting of the attached air bubble is observed subsequently under the impulsive effect of repeated pulsation of the attached air bubble the two split oscillating bubbles finally move downward and away from the flexible boundary in the second sequence in fig 6 b it can be seen that during the bubble rebound stage the liquid jets are directed upward toward the flexible boundary with no deviation it is interesting to note that due to the presence of an attached air bubble the directions of the jets and bubble migration change fundamentally while the jet loads often cause local structural damage therefore these results also indicate that the presence of an attached air bubble at h 2 plays a significant role in protecting the boundary from jet impact damage fig 7 illustrates the behavior of a bubble in the vicinity of a 3 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 3 as shown in fig 7 a the bubble expands to its maximum volume at t 1 71 the attached air bubble initially contracts and then expands during the first expansion of the oscillating bubble as the oscillating bubble contracts the attached air bubble expands to a maximum volume at t 2 57 in the oscillating bubble rebound phase the air bubble is observed to enter its second contraction phase at t 3 16 the two bubble phenomena observed in the first pulsation cycle are relatively common the oscillating bubble remains spherical and the attached air bubble maintains a hemispherical shape an unusual phenomenon then occurs at the end of the oscillating bubble rebound phase the bubble trails in fig 7 a6 indicate that the oscillating bubble produces a clear jet away from the flexible boundary and exhibits downward migration and a change from a hemispherical shape to a cup cover shape is observed in the attached air bubble during this process as shown in fig 7 b this unusual phenomenon also occurs in the bubble rebound phase the bubble appears to split with no change in position therefore due to the presence of the attached air bubble at h 3 the increased repulsive force of the pvc plate on the bubble is a plausible reason for the downward migration of the bubble comparing the behaviors of the bubbles in the vicinity of a 1 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble shown in figs 2 4 reveals that the presence of the attached air bubble increases the deformation effect of the structure on the oscillating bubble however it also enhances the effect of the flexible structure on the oscillating bubble and the splitting of the bubble becomes easier in the case of a flexible plate without an attached air bubble the bubble is prone to splitting into smaller bubbles of different sizes the upward migration of the bubble indicates the effect of the bjerknes force of the structure on the bubble similarly the splitting of the bubble indicates the influence of the deformation effect of the structure from figs 5 7 it can be seen that the behaviors of the bubble in the vicinity of a 3 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble exhibit similar phenomena downward jets away from the plate after splitting and upward jets toward the flexible boundary are observed for a flexible plate with and without an attached air bubble at h 2 respectively downward migration and splitting are then observed for the flexible plate with and without an attached air bubble at h 3 which also shows that the presence of an attached air bubble enhances the influence of the deformation of the structure on the bubble fig 8 shows the variation of the jet in the case of flexible plate with attached air bubble with the distance parameter h as the horizontal axis and t as the vertical axis in fig 8 b the direction of the jet in the vicinity of the 3 mm pvc plate with an attached air bubble is summarized and the dimensionless time parameter t is determined to be critical for the jet direction of the spark generated bubble when t 1 3 the bubble behavior is mainly characterized by the formation of a jet toward the boundary whereas when t 1 0 the bubble tends to produce a jet away from the boundary when t 1 2 the bubble tends to split in the middle during bubble collapse followed by the formation of jets toward and away from the boundary which indicates that the generation of different jet directions is closely related to the pulsation phase difference between the two bubbles however in fig 8 a the correlation between the jet and t is not significant which indicates that for the structure surface with an attached air bubble the direction of the jet is related not only to t but also to the thickness of the plate because of the large deformation of the 1 mm pvc plate and the large bounce capacity the elastic response of the deformed boundary competes with the bjerknes attractive force caused by the low pressure between the bubble and boundary which develops during the collapse phase brujan et al 2001b it has been established that for rigid boundaries the bubble behavior is characterized by the formation of a jet toward the boundary luo et al 2018 sagar and moctar 2020 in contrast the bubble near a flexible plate of a large thickness with an attached air bubble forms a variable direction jet and t is an important factor in determining the jet direction of the bubble goh et al 2014 this dependence is mainly a result of the coupling effect between the processes of storage and the release of energy during the passive pulsation of the attached air bubble and the oscillating bubble when the bubble pulsates in the vicinity of the flexible boundary the deformation of the flexible plate has an effect on bubble pulsation shima et al 1989 tomita and kodama 2003 and changes the jet direction of the bubble fig 9 shows the jet in the case of the flexible plate with and without attached air bubble with the distance parameter h as the horizontal axis and the maximum bubble radius r max as the vertical axis in fig 9 it can be observed that in the case of a 1 mm flexible plate with an attached air bubble splitting phenomenon and downward jets are observed whereas for the case of a flexible plate without an attached air bubble only the splitting phenomenon is observed in the bubble for a 3 mm flexible plate with an attached air bubble the bubble exhibits upward jets splitting and downward jets whereas for the flexible plate without an attached air bubble the bubble mainly exhibits upward jets and a small part of the splitting phenomenon in this study the variation in the jet under the combined effect of the plate thickness and the attached air bubble is comprehensively considered the results of this study provide a deeper understanding of the jet direction of a bubble in the vicinity of a structure surface with an attached air bubble 3 1 3 effect of an attached air bubble on the motion characteristics of the bubble based on the analysis and summary of a large number of experiments some selected cases are chosen with similar distance parameters h and the maximum radii of the spark generated bubble r max the displacement time history curves at the top and bottom vertices p2 and p3 of the bubble near flexible structures of varying thickness with and without an attached air bubble are presented in figs 10 and 11 for the convenience of observation the line of square points represents the displacement of the bubble pulsation at the top and bottom vertices for the case of a flexible plate without an attached air bubble whereas the line of circular points represents the displacement of the bubble pulsation at the top and bottom vertices for the case of a flexible plate with an attached air bubble due to the influence of camera exposure individual displacement values which are difficult to measure are omitted two trends in the displacement time curves for the top and bottom of the bubble can be observed in fig 10 which shows only the first cycle of bubble pulsation as shown in fig 10 during the early stage of the bubble expansion phase the difference between the coordinates of the upper and lower measurement points of the bubble in the two situations is not significant whereas at the end of the expansion phase the measurement point p2 exhibits a slight difference the bubble reaches its maximum radius at t 1 17 after which measurement point p2 moves downward sharply a plausible cause of this movement is the expansion of the attached air bubble however for the case of a flexible plate without an attached air bubble there is little difference in the displacement of measurement point p2 at this time and only measurement point p3 migrates upward as shown in fig 2 b5 under the effect of the formation of a convective jet in the middle of the bubble the change in the displacement of the upper and lower measurement points is relatively minimal the observed phenomena have a striking similarity in the case shown in fig 10 b the trends of the bubble measurement points are almost identical throughout the cycle of bubble pulsation from fig 10 a and b it can be seen that due to the presence of the attached air bubble the cycle of an oscillating bubble pulsation is significantly shortened and the displacement of the top measurement point on the bubble is also significantly reduced this indicates that the presence of the attached air bubble has a positive effect on weakening the destruction of bubble loads fig 11 a depicts the displacement time history curves for the positions of the top and bottom bubble points corresponding to the cases shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 11 a during the early stage of the bubble expansion phase the expansion of the oscillating bubble near a flexible plate with an attached air bubble is slightly faster than the case of a single plate in the middle stage of the bubble expansion phase measurement point p2 slowly moves upward toward the flexible plate the bubble reaches its maximum radius at t 2 07 after which the bubble is observed to shrink markedly measurement point p2 moves sharply downward away from the flexible boundary and measurement point p3 simultaneously moves sharply upward in the case of the single plate a slight change is observed in the bubble for a period of time after reaching its maximum volume during the end stage of the bubble contraction phase measurement point p2 migrates downward slightly compared to measurement point p3 which migrates upward prominently the corresponding phenomena are displayed in fig 5 b5 the bottom of the bubble is observed as a cuspidal shape inducing a jet toward the flexible boundary in fig 11 b it can be seen that during the early stage of the expansion phase the bubble exhibits little difference however the velocity of measurement point p2 in the case of a flexible plate with an attached air bubble decreases at the end of the expansion phase in the case of a flexible plate with an attached air bubble the oscillating bubble reaches its maximum radius at t 1 41 after which point p3 moves upward sharply unlike measurement point p2 in the case of the single plate the displacement of measurement point p2 is almost unchanged and only measurement point p3 migrates upward toward the flexible boundary 3 2 effect of an attached air bubble on the structural deformation based on the analysis and summary of a large number of experiments three representative displacement time history curves at the central measurement point p1 of a flexible plate with or without an attached air bubble are presented in figs 12 and 13 under similar distance parameters and maximum volumes for the spark generated bubble for visual observation the line of circular points represents the displacement of the flexible plate without an attached air bubble due to nearby bubble pulsation whereas the line of square points represents the displacement of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble to visualize the displacement of the flexible plate the individual approximate displacement values are omitted due to the limitations of identification accuracy fig 12 shows the displacement time history curves for the measurement point p1 at the center of the flexible plate for the cases shown in fig 2 the flexible plate is initially pushed slightly away from the bubble during the expansion phase the maximum upward displacement of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble is larger than that of the flexible plate without an air bubble and the peak position of the plate deformation is observed earlier due to the slightly shorter expansion period in terms of the inclination of the curve the rebound speed of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble during the contraction phase is faster the flexible plate reaches a reverse maximum amplitude at t 2 83 which is earlier than in the case of the single plate a high velocity of the rebounding bubble and multiple fluctuations caused by the jet loads are observed which demonstrates that the presence of an attached air bubble enhances the influence of the deformed structure on the oscillating bubble the flexible plate without an attached air bubble reaches a maximum upward displacement of 0 118 mm at t 1 96 under the effect of the continuous contraction of the bubble downward movement is observed in the flexible plate at t 4 3 the flexible plate reaches its reverse maximum amplitude and the flexible plate then accelerates to rebound upward under the effect of the jet loads the bubble energy subsequently decreases and the flexible plate naturally rebounds to its initial position fig 13 a shows the displacement time history curves for the position of the measurement point p1 at the center of the flexible plate for the cases shown in fig 5 the flexibility of the 3 mm pvc plate is small under the effect of the outward moving flow field the flexible plate moves upward during the expansion phase and reaches its maximum displacement at t 2 07 the times at which the upward and downward maximum displacements of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble are observed are advanced by approximately one time interval the peak position of the upward displacement of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble occurs earlier than that of the flexible plate without an air bubble and a shorter cycle of expansion is observed in the oscillating bubble a plausible cause foe this phenomenon is the buffering effect of the attached air bubble fig 13 b depicts the displacement time history curves for the position of the measurement point p1 at the center of the flexible plate at h 1 13 for a flexible plate with an attached air bubble the plate reaches its reverse maximum displacement at t 3 82 as shown the upward maximum displacement of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble is larger than that of a flexible plate without an air bubble and the peak position is relatively backward in the case of the flexible plate without an attached air bubble the flexible plate reaches its upward maximum displacement of 0 068 mm at t 1 28 after which the flexible plate begins to move downward with the contraction of the bubble reaching its reverse maximum amplitude at t 3 59 subsequently under the effect of the jet loads the flexible plate accelerates to rebound upward to its initial position figs 12 and 13 show that the displacement of the center measurement point of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble is larger than that of a single plate under the same maximum bubble radius in addition the deformation of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble during bubble pulsation is more pronounced with a larger structural response which is a very interesting phenomenon that is worthy of a more in depth analysis however after an intensive analysis it was determined that the maximum bubble radius is smaller for bubble pulsation near the boundary compared with that in the free field at the same charge and depth of charge and for the free surface the maximum volume of the bubble is observed to increase as the distance parameter increases wang et al 1996 therefore with the same maximum bubble radius more energy is contained inside the initial bubble in the vicinity of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble and it can also be seen in fig 14 that the phase of bubble expansion to the maximum radius is an energy output phase in this process under the effect of bubble pulsation the volume of the attached air bubble initially decreases and the energy of the pulsating bubble is stored in the attached air bubble subsequently the attached air bubble begins to expand resulting in the forced pulsation phenomenon wang et al 2020 therefore when the maximum bubble radii of the two cases are the same due to the energy stored in the attached air bubble the total energy of the entire system in the case of the plate with an attached air bubble is greater than that in the case of a single plate which results in a larger structural response in the case of the plate with an attached air bubble fig 15 displays the overall displacement response of the flexible plate as the oscillating bubble changes for the cases shown in fig 3 the displacement is given as a function of the distance of the measurement point from the center point and the fluctuations produced by the flexible plate are distributed almost symmetrically in the x direction in fig 15 a the bubble is in the expansion phase at t 2 42 and reaches its maximum volume at t 3 06 as a whole upward movement is observed for all measurement points during the collapse phase the top of the bubble moves down forming the jet and the flexible plate begins to move down due to the rapid displacement change in the central region and the relatively slow displacement change in the neighboring region the flexible plate is observed in a state of two spikes and presents a third order response mode at t 3 67 after t 4 08 the peak position gradually spreads to the sides and the amplitude decreases gradually it is interesting to investigate the changes in the overall displacement curve under similar dimensionless distance parameters the observed phenomena have a striking similarity in the case shown in fig 15 b at t 2 39 the bubble reaches its maximum volume and the flexible plate presents a first order whip like response mode at t 3 20 the flexible plate enters the rebound phase and begins to move downward at t 4 0 the flexible plate is observed in a state of two symmetrical spikes at t 4 39 the peak position expands to both sides and the amplitude decreases gradually which indicates that the process of two spike variations is similar to the decreasing wave transmitted to both sides of the flexible plate at t 4 80 downward movement is observed for all measurement points except for the peak point the center point is still at the reverse maximum displacement and continuous extension of the position of the two spikes to both sides of the flexible plate is observed 4 conclusions in this study bubble pulsation near a flexible plate with an attached air bubble was experimentally studied using a low pressure spark generated bubble special emphasis was placed on the coupling of the pulsation of the oscillating bubble attached air bubble and flexible boundary based on bubble pulsation the response of the attached air bubble jet morphology and response characteristics of the flexible plate were analyzed under different distance parameters and thickness parameters of the flexible plate and the effects of the bubble motion and structural deformation characteristics of the flexible plate with and without an attached air bubble were comprehensively considered the jet behavior of bubbles which depends strongly on the deformation effect of the flexible structure close to the flexible plate is summarized and the motion response mode and deformation pattern of the flexible plate under bubble loading are explored the primary findings included the following 1 in the coupling process between the oscillating bubble attached air bubble and flexible boundary the two bubbles tend to form a mushroom like annular jet near the flexible boundary accompanied by a series of complex phenomena including rebounding splitting after coalescence of the two bubbles jets away from the boundary and splitting in the middle of the bubble the direction of the jets and bubble migration fundamentally change in the case of a flexible boundary with an attached air bubble and the presence of an attached air bubble enhances the deformation rebound effect of the flexible boundary 2 for the case of a 1 mm flexible plate with an attached air bubble the splitting phenomenon and downward jets away from the boundary are observed in the oscillating bubble but no upward jets are this is because of the large deformation and bounce capacity of the 1 mm pvc plate the elastic response of the deformed boundary competes with the bjerknes attractive force caused by the low pressure between the bubble and boundary for the case of the 3 mm flexible plate both the splitting phenomenon and upward movement of the bubble are observed while downward jets away from the boundary are observed only for the case with an attached air bubble 3 comparing the displacement time history curves at the top and bottom points of the bubble to that of the center point of the flexible boundary reveals that the first cycle of bubble pulsation is significantly shortened when the flexible plate has an attached air bubble as shown in figs 10 13 the presence of an attached air bubble in the rebounding phase enhances the influence of the deformation of the structure on the bubble 4 the overall motion trend of the flexible plate under bubble loads is summarized and it is observed that during the expansion phase the flexible plate exhibits a first order response mode during the bubble collapse stage the time difference between the response of the central region and that of the neighboring regions contributes to the formation of two spikes on the flexible plate these two spikes are transmitted to both sides in the form of a wave and their amplitude decreases gradually during the rebounding phase stage a rise in the middle of the flexible plate and a continuous decline in the neighboring regions are observed credit authorship contribution statement jiaxia wang writing original draft formal analysis visualization data

20498,the strong coupling effect between an air bubble attached to a flexible plate and a nearby spark generated bubble is investigated experimentally while also considering the structural deformation

structure can change the motion characteristics of the spark generated bubble to some extent keywords bubble dynamics attached air bubble spark generated bubble flexible structure bubble jets 1 introduction the interaction between pulsating bubbles and their surrounding boundaries is a common phenomenon of interest in natural and industrial applications and it also plays an important role in science and military applications pulsating bubbles near different boundaries have a wide range of beneficial applications and destructive effects and their dynamics are of great significance saleki haselghoubi et al 2018 in many industrial applications such as ship propellers zhu and fang 2012 steam turbines ƒçdina 2003 and cryogenic pumps bahaj et al 2007 excessive cavitation bubbles are generated which not only damage structures huang et al 2013 ma et al 2017b and generate vibration huang et al 2014 and noise ma et al 2016 but also greatly reduce the operating efficiency huang et al 2010 although cavitation bubbles can erode or damage solid materials brujan et al 2001a b lauterborn and kurz 2010 cavitation also helps to achieve the desired results in ice breaking and biomedical ultrasound as well as laser mediated surgical applications cui et al 2018 miller et al 1996 vogel and venugopalan 2003 during bubble contraction the pressure gradient around the bubble changes due to the presence of surrounding boundaries resulting in non spherical bubble contraction and jet generation which is responsible for damage to the nearby boundary choi and chahine 2015 and marlin and chahine 2018 demonstrated that coated polyurea provides a good performance against cavitation erosion peters and moctar 2020 developed a new numerical method and applied it to assess cavitation induced erosion sagar and moctar 2020 investigated the dynamics and the induced damage of a cavitation bubble near a solid surface cui et al 2020 brujan et al 2018 and wang 2019 studied the jet characteristics of collapsing bubbles near mixed corner boundaries and observed oblique and planar jets reuter et al 2016 monitored the time dependent impact of bubbles on the near wall diffusion layer blake et al 1993 investigated the motion of two cavitation bubbles near a rigid boundary whereas luo et al 2018 studied the impact characteristics of cavitation bubble collapse on the wall surface they determined that the dimensionless distance has an important effect on the impact of cavitation bubble collapse on the wall ye et al 2020 considered the size effect of materials in the formation of a cavitation pit and analyzed the cavitation pit inversely poar et al 2021 studied the interaction between a nanosecond laser striking a cavitation structure in water near a concave surface and shock waves they observed that the concave surface refocused the shock wave and later induced a secondary cavitation near the acoustic focus denner et al 2021 investigated the asymmetric collapse of cavitation bubbles near a solid substrate and demonstrated that an accurate measurement of the pressure pulse emitted during bubble inception and of the maximum bubble radius allowed for an accurate reproduction of the asymmetric collapse wang et al 2020 studied bubble dynamics at a corner formed by two flat rigid boundaries and noted that the oscillation period and the jet width increased but the jet velocity decreased compared to a bubble near a flat wall zeng et al 2020 studied the dynamics of cavitation bubbles and induced jets in a thin liquid gap bounded by two rigid walls and determined that the jet dynamics direction and strength were dependent on the choice of the gap thickness and location of bubble inception liu et al 2021 studied bubble collapse characteristics near a solid wall under different hypergravity environments and determined that the bubble motion the formation position of the bubble jet the liquid jet velocity and the pressure induced by the bubble will change significantly under different hypergravity environments in order to control cavitation bubbles and prevent their consequences materials for fluid mechanics have been further developed to provide a significant elasticity ma et al 2017a gibson and blake 1982 blake and gibson 1987 and duncan and zhang 1991 conducted early explorations by experimentally studying the properties of bubbles near the rubber coating on a structure surface they determined that the bubble dynamics were dependent on the nearby rubber body and that the bubble split into smaller bubbles brujan et al 2001a b experimentally investigated the interaction between a laser induced cavitation bubble and an elastic membrane and determined that during the contraction phase the bubble appeared to be mushroom like due to the rebound and deformation of the elastic boundary tomita and kodama 2003 and shima et al 1989 experimentally demonstrated that when a bubble pulses near an elastic boundary the boundary will affect the fluid flow around the bubble cui et al 2016b studied the generation of underwater explosive bubbles using the same charge near an elastic wall boundary under different conditions the results showed that the bubble behavior and the pulse pressure characteristics changed compared to those with a solid boundary gong et al 2018 investigated the interaction between a two layer composite beam and a spark generated bubble and gong 2019 examined the transient response of a composite structure subjected to an underwater explosion the results showed that the composite hull performs better in amortizing the impact pressure caused by the bubble compared to the steel hull in practical applications cavitation bubbles often do not exist alone studies considering the coupling effect between multiple cavitation bubbles of different sizes are extremely difficult to perform luo et al 2019 studied the collapse direction of a cavitation bubble under the dual action of an air bubble and a wall they determined that cavitation bubbles near air bubbles may only collapse toward or away from the air bubbles li et al 2019 presented experimental and numerical investigations on the nonlinear interaction coalescence collapse and rebound of two pulsating bubbles and determined that the collapse of the two bubble systems was less violent than that of a single bubble cui et al 2020 studied ice breaking caused by a pair of interacting collapsing bubbles via an experimental approach and summarized the regions where the damaging potential of the bubble pair is strengthened or weakened zhang 2010 studied the motions of a spark induced cavitation bubble and an air bubble near a rigid boundary and determined that placing a bubble between the rigid boundary and a cavitation bubble could prevent the collapsing jet of the bubble from being directed toward the boundary smith and mesler 1972 discussed the interaction of a bubble attached to a solid boundary with a vapor bubble produced by nearby sparks and showed that the bubble attached to the boundary could protect the surface from damage goh et al 2014 conducted an electric spark bubble test with an air bubble attached to a 5 mm polyvinyl chloride pvc flexible boundary and determined that the dimensionless pulsation period ratio between the two bubbles was an important factor in determining the direction of the bubble jet wang et al 2020 investigated the dynamics of a spark generated bubble near a stationary bubble attached to a plate and determined that the coupling behavior of the two bubbles was closely related to the dimensionless distance between the spark bubble and the plate the relative sizes of the two bubbles and the dimensionless bubble oscillation time in actual structures an obvious structural response will occur under bubble loading however in the current research process only the bubble dynamics near the rigid surface of the attached bubble have been studied while there are relatively few studies on the bubble dynamics near a flexible structure with an attached air bubble unlike studies on bubble dynamics near a solid boundary with attached air bubbles in addition to the coupling of the oscillating bubble the attached air bubble and the deformation structure the influence of the deformation structure on the two bubbles should be considered moreover the effect of the energy stored and released by the deformed structure on two bubbles pulsation is not clear in this study the jet morphology of a bubble generated near a flexible structure with an attached air bubble and the pulsation response of the attached air bubble are investigated using a spark generated bubble and a high speed camera in addition particular attention is given to the coupled responses of the oscillating bubble the attached air bubble and the flexible boundary the effect of the attached air bubble on the motion characteristics of the generated bubble at different distances is observed and we aim to elucidate the strong coupling effect between the attached air bubble and the oscillating bubble considering the structural deformation effect in addition we focus on the effect of the attached air bubble on the deformation of the flexible structure and the bubble jets to provide a better understanding of this phenomenon evaluate the protection mechanism of the attached air bubble on the flexible boundary against the bubble jet load and provide a reference for the impact load protection of an underwater ship 2 experimental setup the experimental setup shown in fig 1 includes a low voltage discharge system a high speed camera an adjustable structure positioning device an illuminated light source a pvc plate with elastic modulus e 600 mpa and a surface attached air bubble the tests were performed in a 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m glass water tank the air bubble under the pvc plate was generated by using a 1 0 ml syringe with 100 scales and this gives rise to an attached air bubble that is hemispherical with a contact angle of 90 6 both sides of the pvc plate are fixed on the lifting gear with three degrees of freedom the air bubble is not fixed in the pvc plate and it can move freely the discharge circuit is mainly controlled by a 1 kœâ resistor and a 6600 Œºf capacitor which is imported to transfer 220 v ac to 100 v dc when the voltage reached approximately 100 v the discharge was triggered the spark discharge method has the advantages of precisely controlling the bubble nucleation location and having a low cost the major drawbacks are less precise control of the bubble size and frequent replacement of the electrodes which are immersed in water chew et al 2011 fong et al 2009 the electrodes will break after being short circuited and thus must be replaced after every experiment chew et al 2011 in our experiments to minimize the possible interference caused by the electrodes a thin copper wire with a diameter of 0 25 mm was short circuited to vaporize the surrounding liquid at a high temperature and generate a spark bubble in the tank the electrodes are arranged in a simply touching each other and the requirement for the two crossed copper wires is that there is only one connect point at this discharge voltage the maximum pulsating bubble radius was approximately 2 7 mm thus the radius of the copper wire was approximately 1 8 6 3 of the maximum bubble radius and the influence of the copper wire on the bubble dynamics could be neglected cui et al 2016a 2020 gong et al 2018 we recorded the experiments using a fastcam mini ux100 high speed camera at 10 240 frames per second and a shutter speed of 1 100 000 s a 2 kw spot light was placed on the other side of the water tank to provide sufficient brightness for the high speed camera a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a the experiments used 1 mm and 3 mm pvc plates as flexible boundaries in which the structural positioning device had three degrees of freedom the copper wires were then crossed and touched at their ends in water to ensure that there was only one contact point when the copper wire was fixed a specific experimental condition was quantitatively achieved by adjusting the position of the structure in the transverse longitudinal and vertical directions this arrangement of electrodes promotes the formation of a spark bubble at voltages much lower than the few kilovolts required for experiments using no contact electrodes buogo and cannelli 2002 the definitions of the measure points and bubble parameters are shown in fig 1 b p1 is a measurement point on the flexible plate located in the center of the attached air bubble p2 and p3 are the top and bottom vertices of the bubble h s represents the distance from the center of the bubble to the boundary h w represents the width of the air bubble r m represents the equivalent radius when the bubble reaches the maximum volume v m and r e represents the equivalent radius corresponding to the volume of the attached bubble based on the above parameters the following four dimensionless quantities are defined a dimensionless distance parameter h a dimensionless volume ratio v a dimensionless pulsation period ratio t and a dimensionless cavitation bubble oscillation time t 1 h h s r m 2 v v m c v 0 where cv 0 is the initial air bubble volume 3 t t r max œÅ p p v where t is the pulsation period of the spark bubble p is the reference hydrostatic pressure 1 bar œÅ is the density of the water and the denominator is a value related to the rayleigh bubble pulsation period zhang et al 2015 2016 cui et al 2020 yang et al 2013 4 t t 2 œÄ r e œÅ 3 Œ≥ 1 p where Œ≥ 1 1 4 is the ratio of the specific heats of the gas in the attached air bubble and the denominator is the theoretical period of oscillation of an air bubble goh et al 2014 this value is only used for cases of a flexible plate with an attached air bubble 3 experimental results the bubble dynamics close to 1 mm and 3 mm pvc plates with and without an attached air bubble were investigated in detail the dimensionless distance parameter Œ∑ used in the bubble behavior experiments ranged from 0 6 to 3 7 a special emphasis was placed on the influences of the relative distance between the oscillating bubble and the flexible plate the attached air bubble and the flexible plate thickness on the temporal evolution of the oscillating bubble shape air bubble shape jet formation and response pattern of the flexible plate 3 1 effect of an attached air bubble on the motion characteristics of bubbles at different distances 3 1 1 comparison of bubble dynamics close to a 1 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble to describe the effect of an attached air bubble on the structural response and bubble shapes some selected cases were chosen with similar parameters of h and r max for convenience of the analysis the experimental parameters of the test conditions shown in figs 2 4 are listed in table 1 the spark discharge setup provides less precise control over the bubble size therefore in the following analysis two cases with bubble size differences of less than 13 are considered to be of a similar size chew et al 2011 fig 2 illustrates the behavior of the bubble generated in the vicinity of a 1 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 1 in fig 2 a the interaction between an oscillating bubble and an air bubble attached to a 1 mm pvc plate is explored the bubble expands to its maximum volume at t 1 34 and the upper surface is flattened due to the inhibition of the attached air bubble at t 1 66 under the combined effect of the attraction of the oscillating contractive bubble and the expansion of the attached air bubble bubble coalescence is observed as two bubble boundaries very close to one another subsequently the two parts of the coalesced bubble contract synchronously as a single bubble at t 2 33 and a large downward displacement of 0 111 mm is observed in the flexible plate under the suction of the coalesced bubble it can be seen that a bubble splitting phenomenon along the horizontal direction emerges for the coalescence of two vertically arranged bubbles in the studies by han et al 2018 and rungsiyaphornrat et al 2003 however it is interesting to note that the bubble splitting phenomenon along the vertical direction occurs after the coalescence of attached air bubble and oscillating bubble as shown in fig 1 a a possible reason for this phenomenon may be because the elastic restoring force from the flexible plate shown in fig 2 a4 and a5 injects the stored energy and the deformed plate moves upward and returns to its original position blake and gibson 1987 shima et al 1989 for the second sequence shown in fig 2 b the bubble reaches its maximum radius at t 1 80 and maintains a regular spherical shape during the early stage of the bubble collapse phase and the bubble shrinks into a gourd like shape at t 2 61 as shown in fig 2 b4 and b5 the lower surface of the bubble contracts faster than the upper surface and the liquid jets are directed obliquely upward toward the flexible boundary while the upper surface remains almost unchanged this differs from the bubble evolution close to a rigid boundary which exhibits a jet in the vertical direction chew et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the bubble splits into smaller bubbles of different sizes at t 3 27 the upper larger sub bubble migrates upward to the boundary while the smaller sub bubble moves in the direction away from the boundary the bubble pulsation period is 3 11 and the maximum displacement of the measurement point on the plate is 0 118 mm fig 2 shows that due to the presence of the attached air bubble at h 1 the bubble pulsation period is significantly reduced by 15 7 and the movement of the measurement point above the bubble is reduced by 10 fig 3 illustrates the behavior of a bubble in the vicinity of a 1 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 1 4 as shown in fig 3 a as the oscillating bubble contracts the attached air bubble undergoes a non spherical contraction and expansion phase the bubble then reaches its maximum volume at t 1 42 and in fig 3 a2 the top surface of the bubble appears distinctly flattened meanwhile the attached air bubble volume further increases and then decreases with an oscillating bubble contraction as shown in fig 3 a3 the two bubbles exhibit special morphologies in the late bubble contraction the attached air bubble and oscillating bubble are observed as a mushroom shape and a jar shape respectively where the width of the top of the attached air bubble is smaller than that of the bottom a more pronounced phenomenon occurs during the bubble rebound phase in which the bubble splits into two smaller bubbles of a similar size that then migrate upward and downward at t 3 27 splitting of the attached air bubble is observed and the two bubbles are found to split at the same time in fig 3 b the bubble is observed as a peanut shape at the end of the bubble contraction phase subsequently the bubble splits into two smaller bubbles of different sizes at t 4 64 and both sub bubbles migrate upward to the boundary after a further analysis it can be seen that in the case of h 1 4 and r max 4 8 the maximum displacements of the measurement point above the bubble are 0 71 mm and 0 85 mm respectively which indicates that the presence of an attached air bubble at h 1 4 has an effect on the bubble at the same time the pulsation period of the bubble is significantly shortened fig 4 illustrates the behavior of a bubble in the vicinity of a 1 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 2 as shown in fig 4 a due to the relatively large distance parameter the bubble maintains a regular spherical shape during the expansion stage and the bubble reaches its maximum and minimum radii at t 1 20 and 2 37 respectively a flattened shape is observed at the top surface of the oscillating bubble at t 2 37 and the attached air bubble maintains a constant shape in the first cycle of pulsation in the rebound stage the oscillating bubble splits into two smaller bubbles that then move upward and downward with severe distortion of the attached air bubble observed which appears as a cup lid shape subsequently under the rebound effect of the attached air bubble both small sub bubbles move downward and away from the flexible boundary for the second sequence shown in fig 4 b the bubble remains spherical throughout the pulsation phase and reaches its maximum and minimum radii at t 2 02 and 3 51 respectively a significant increase in the cycle of the bubble pulsation is observed at this time at t 3 89 the bubble splits into two smaller bubbles of similar size and the two sub bubbles are observed to pulsate with no deviation from the flexible boundary fig 4 shows that the pulsation period of the bubble is significantly reduced a plausible cause of which could be the presence of the attached air bubble 3 1 2 comparison of the bubble dynamics close to a 3 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble the experimental parameters of the test conditions shown in figs 5 7 are listed in table 2 as seen from tables 1 and 2 there is a small difference in the volume of the attached air bubble which has a small effect on the bubble pulsation on the contrary the bubble motion characteristics in these cases are mainly influenced by the distance parameter fig 5 illustrates the behavior of a bubble in the vicinity of a 3 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 1 55 as shown in fig 5 a the attached air bubble initially contracts and then expands under the expansion of the oscillating bubble and the oscillating bubble and attached air bubble reach their maximum volumes simultaneously at t 2 07 as shown in fig 5 a4 during bubble contraction the width of the top of the attached air bubble is smaller than that of the bottom and a mushroom shape is observed in the air bubble at t 3 20 the air bubble exhibits a mallet shape with a small width at the top and bottom of the bubble and a large width at the middle of the bubble from the trails of the oscillating bubble at t 3 39 it can be seen that the bubble exhibits a jet toward the flexible boundary with upward movement as shown in fig 5 b the bubble morphology is constant during most of the expansion and contraction phases the bubble phenomena are thus not described here special attention is given to the bubble shape at the end of the contraction phase where an ellipsoid shape is observed at t 4 25 as shown in fig 5 b5 the bottom of the bubble becomes cuspidal and induces a jet toward the flexible boundary at t 4 99 comparing the experimental observations in figs 3 and 5 reveals that the increase in the thickness of the pvc plate results in a significant reduction in the displacement of the point on the flexible plate when the distance parameter is close fig 6 illustrates the behavior of a bubble in the vicinity of a 3 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 2 as the distance parameter increases in the first cycle of bubble oscillation the oscillating bubble remains spherical and the attached air bubble exhibits a regular hemispherical shape at t 2 44 the width of the middle of the oscillating bubble is reduced to a gourd shape and the attached air bubble exhibits a column shape during the bubble rebound phase the oscillating bubble splits into two smaller bubbles of different sizes at t 2 64 and the two sub bubbles then move upward and downward at t 3 10 splitting of the attached air bubble is observed subsequently under the impulsive effect of repeated pulsation of the attached air bubble the two split oscillating bubbles finally move downward and away from the flexible boundary in the second sequence in fig 6 b it can be seen that during the bubble rebound stage the liquid jets are directed upward toward the flexible boundary with no deviation it is interesting to note that due to the presence of an attached air bubble the directions of the jets and bubble migration change fundamentally while the jet loads often cause local structural damage therefore these results also indicate that the presence of an attached air bubble at h 2 plays a significant role in protecting the boundary from jet impact damage fig 7 illustrates the behavior of a bubble in the vicinity of a 3 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble at a distance of h 3 as shown in fig 7 a the bubble expands to its maximum volume at t 1 71 the attached air bubble initially contracts and then expands during the first expansion of the oscillating bubble as the oscillating bubble contracts the attached air bubble expands to a maximum volume at t 2 57 in the oscillating bubble rebound phase the air bubble is observed to enter its second contraction phase at t 3 16 the two bubble phenomena observed in the first pulsation cycle are relatively common the oscillating bubble remains spherical and the attached air bubble maintains a hemispherical shape an unusual phenomenon then occurs at the end of the oscillating bubble rebound phase the bubble trails in fig 7 a6 indicate that the oscillating bubble produces a clear jet away from the flexible boundary and exhibits downward migration and a change from a hemispherical shape to a cup cover shape is observed in the attached air bubble during this process as shown in fig 7 b this unusual phenomenon also occurs in the bubble rebound phase the bubble appears to split with no change in position therefore due to the presence of the attached air bubble at h 3 the increased repulsive force of the pvc plate on the bubble is a plausible reason for the downward migration of the bubble comparing the behaviors of the bubbles in the vicinity of a 1 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble shown in figs 2 4 reveals that the presence of the attached air bubble increases the deformation effect of the structure on the oscillating bubble however it also enhances the effect of the flexible structure on the oscillating bubble and the splitting of the bubble becomes easier in the case of a flexible plate without an attached air bubble the bubble is prone to splitting into smaller bubbles of different sizes the upward migration of the bubble indicates the effect of the bjerknes force of the structure on the bubble similarly the splitting of the bubble indicates the influence of the deformation effect of the structure from figs 5 7 it can be seen that the behaviors of the bubble in the vicinity of a 3 mm pvc plate with and without an attached air bubble exhibit similar phenomena downward jets away from the plate after splitting and upward jets toward the flexible boundary are observed for a flexible plate with and without an attached air bubble at h 2 respectively downward migration and splitting are then observed for the flexible plate with and without an attached air bubble at h 3 which also shows that the presence of an attached air bubble enhances the influence of the deformation of the structure on the bubble fig 8 shows the variation of the jet in the case of flexible plate with attached air bubble with the distance parameter h as the horizontal axis and t as the vertical axis in fig 8 b the direction of the jet in the vicinity of the 3 mm pvc plate with an attached air bubble is summarized and the dimensionless time parameter t is determined to be critical for the jet direction of the spark generated bubble when t 1 3 the bubble behavior is mainly characterized by the formation of a jet toward the boundary whereas when t 1 0 the bubble tends to produce a jet away from the boundary when t 1 2 the bubble tends to split in the middle during bubble collapse followed by the formation of jets toward and away from the boundary which indicates that the generation of different jet directions is closely related to the pulsation phase difference between the two bubbles however in fig 8 a the correlation between the jet and t is not significant which indicates that for the structure surface with an attached air bubble the direction of the jet is related not only to t but also to the thickness of the plate because of the large deformation of the 1 mm pvc plate and the large bounce capacity the elastic response of the deformed boundary competes with the bjerknes attractive force caused by the low pressure between the bubble and boundary which develops during the collapse phase brujan et al 2001b it has been established that for rigid boundaries the bubble behavior is characterized by the formation of a jet toward the boundary luo et al 2018 sagar and moctar 2020 in contrast the bubble near a flexible plate of a large thickness with an attached air bubble forms a variable direction jet and t is an important factor in determining the jet direction of the bubble goh et al 2014 this dependence is mainly a result of the coupling effect between the processes of storage and the release of energy during the passive pulsation of the attached air bubble and the oscillating bubble when the bubble pulsates in the vicinity of the flexible boundary the deformation of the flexible plate has an effect on bubble pulsation shima et al 1989 tomita and kodama 2003 and changes the jet direction of the bubble fig 9 shows the jet in the case of the flexible plate with and without attached air bubble with the distance parameter h as the horizontal axis and the maximum bubble radius r max as the vertical axis in fig 9 it can be observed that in the case of a 1 mm flexible plate with an attached air bubble splitting phenomenon and downward jets are observed whereas for the case of a flexible plate without an attached air bubble only the splitting phenomenon is observed in the bubble for a 3 mm flexible plate with an attached air bubble the bubble exhibits upward jets splitting and downward jets whereas for the flexible plate without an attached air bubble the bubble mainly exhibits upward jets and a small part of the splitting phenomenon in this study the variation in the jet under the combined effect of the plate thickness and the attached air bubble is comprehensively considered the results of this study provide a deeper understanding of the jet direction of a bubble in the vicinity of a structure surface with an attached air bubble 3 1 3 effect of an attached air bubble on the motion characteristics of the bubble based on the analysis and summary of a large number of experiments some selected cases are chosen with similar distance parameters h and the maximum radii of the spark generated bubble r max the displacement time history curves at the top and bottom vertices p2 and p3 of the bubble near flexible structures of varying thickness with and without an attached air bubble are presented in figs 10 and 11 for the convenience of observation the line of square points represents the displacement of the bubble pulsation at the top and bottom vertices for the case of a flexible plate without an attached air bubble whereas the line of circular points represents the displacement of the bubble pulsation at the top and bottom vertices for the case of a flexible plate with an attached air bubble due to the influence of camera exposure individual displacement values which are difficult to measure are omitted two trends in the displacement time curves for the top and bottom of the bubble can be observed in fig 10 which shows only the first cycle of bubble pulsation as shown in fig 10 during the early stage of the bubble expansion phase the difference between the coordinates of the upper and lower measurement points of the bubble in the two situations is not significant whereas at the end of the expansion phase the measurement point p2 exhibits a slight difference the bubble reaches its maximum radius at t 1 17 after which measurement point p2 moves downward sharply a plausible cause of this movement is the expansion of the attached air bubble however for the case of a flexible plate without an attached air bubble there is little difference in the displacement of measurement point p2 at this time and only measurement point p3 migrates upward as shown in fig 2 b5 under the effect of the formation of a convective jet in the middle of the bubble the change in the displacement of the upper and lower measurement points is relatively minimal the observed phenomena have a striking similarity in the case shown in fig 10 b the trends of the bubble measurement points are almost identical throughout the cycle of bubble pulsation from fig 10 a and b it can be seen that due to the presence of the attached air bubble the cycle of an oscillating bubble pulsation is significantly shortened and the displacement of the top measurement point on the bubble is also significantly reduced this indicates that the presence of the attached air bubble has a positive effect on weakening the destruction of bubble loads fig 11 a depicts the displacement time history curves for the positions of the top and bottom bubble points corresponding to the cases shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 11 a during the early stage of the bubble expansion phase the expansion of the oscillating bubble near a flexible plate with an attached air bubble is slightly faster than the case of a single plate in the middle stage of the bubble expansion phase measurement point p2 slowly moves upward toward the flexible plate the bubble reaches its maximum radius at t 2 07 after which the bubble is observed to shrink markedly measurement point p2 moves sharply downward away from the flexible boundary and measurement point p3 simultaneously moves sharply upward in the case of the single plate a slight change is observed in the bubble for a period of time after reaching its maximum volume during the end stage of the bubble contraction phase measurement point p2 migrates downward slightly compared to measurement point p3 which migrates upward prominently the corresponding phenomena are displayed in fig 5 b5 the bottom of the bubble is observed as a cuspidal shape inducing a jet toward the flexible boundary in fig 11 b it can be seen that during the early stage of the expansion phase the bubble exhibits little difference however the velocity of measurement point p2 in the case of a flexible plate with an attached air bubble decreases at the end of the expansion phase in the case of a flexible plate with an attached air bubble the oscillating bubble reaches its maximum radius at t 1 41 after which point p3 moves upward sharply unlike measurement point p2 in the case of the single plate the displacement of measurement point p2 is almost unchanged and only measurement point p3 migrates upward toward the flexible boundary 3 2 effect of an attached air bubble on the structural deformation based on the analysis and summary of a large number of experiments three representative displacement time history curves at the central measurement point p1 of a flexible plate with or without an attached air bubble are presented in figs 12 and 13 under similar distance parameters and maximum volumes for the spark generated bubble for visual observation the line of circular points represents the displacement of the flexible plate without an attached air bubble due to nearby bubble pulsation whereas the line of square points represents the displacement of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble to visualize the displacement of the flexible plate the individual approximate displacement values are omitted due to the limitations of identification accuracy fig 12 shows the displacement time history curves for the measurement point p1 at the center of the flexible plate for the cases shown in fig 2 the flexible plate is initially pushed slightly away from the bubble during the expansion phase the maximum upward displacement of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble is larger than that of the flexible plate without an air bubble and the peak position of the plate deformation is observed earlier due to the slightly shorter expansion period in terms of the inclination of the curve the rebound speed of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble during the contraction phase is faster the flexible plate reaches a reverse maximum amplitude at t 2 83 which is earlier than in the case of the single plate a high velocity of the rebounding bubble and multiple fluctuations caused by the jet loads are observed which demonstrates that the presence of an attached air bubble enhances the influence of the deformed structure on the oscillating bubble the flexible plate without an attached air bubble reaches a maximum upward displacement of 0 118 mm at t 1 96 under the effect of the continuous contraction of the bubble downward movement is observed in the flexible plate at t 4 3 the flexible plate reaches its reverse maximum amplitude and the flexible plate then accelerates to rebound upward under the effect of the jet loads the bubble energy subsequently decreases and the flexible plate naturally rebounds to its initial position fig 13 a shows the displacement time history curves for the position of the measurement point p1 at the center of the flexible plate for the cases shown in fig 5 the flexibility of the 3 mm pvc plate is small under the effect of the outward moving flow field the flexible plate moves upward during the expansion phase and reaches its maximum displacement at t 2 07 the times at which the upward and downward maximum displacements of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble are observed are advanced by approximately one time interval the peak position of the upward displacement of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble occurs earlier than that of the flexible plate without an air bubble and a shorter cycle of expansion is observed in the oscillating bubble a plausible cause foe this phenomenon is the buffering effect of the attached air bubble fig 13 b depicts the displacement time history curves for the position of the measurement point p1 at the center of the flexible plate at h 1 13 for a flexible plate with an attached air bubble the plate reaches its reverse maximum displacement at t 3 82 as shown the upward maximum displacement of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble is larger than that of a flexible plate without an air bubble and the peak position is relatively backward in the case of the flexible plate without an attached air bubble the flexible plate reaches its upward maximum displacement of 0 068 mm at t 1 28 after which the flexible plate begins to move downward with the contraction of the bubble reaching its reverse maximum amplitude at t 3 59 subsequently under the effect of the jet loads the flexible plate accelerates to rebound upward to its initial position figs 12 and 13 show that the displacement of the center measurement point of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble is larger than that of a single plate under the same maximum bubble radius in addition the deformation of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble during bubble pulsation is more pronounced with a larger structural response which is a very interesting phenomenon that is worthy of a more in depth analysis however after an intensive analysis it was determined that the maximum bubble radius is smaller for bubble pulsation near the boundary compared with that in the free field at the same charge and depth of charge and for the free surface the maximum volume of the bubble is observed to increase as the distance parameter increases wang et al 1996 therefore with the same maximum bubble radius more energy is contained inside the initial bubble in the vicinity of the flexible plate with an attached air bubble and it can also be seen in fig 14 that the phase of bubble expansion to the maximum radius is an energy output phase in this process under the effect of bubble pulsation the volume of the attached air bubble initially decreases and the energy of the pulsating bubble is stored in the attached air bubble subsequently the attached air bubble begins to expand resulting in the forced pulsation phenomenon wang et al 2020 therefore when the maximum bubble radii of the two cases are the same due to the energy stored in the attached air bubble the total energy of the entire system in the case of the plate with an attached air bubble is greater than that in the case of a single plate which results in a larger structural response in the case of the plate with an attached air bubble fig 15 displays the overall displacement response of the flexible plate as the oscillating bubble changes for the cases shown in fig 3 the displacement is given as a function of the distance of the measurement point from the center point and the fluctuations produced by the flexible plate are distributed almost symmetrically in the x direction in fig 15 a the bubble is in the expansion phase at t 2 42 and reaches its maximum volume at t 3 06 as a whole upward movement is observed for all measurement points during the collapse phase the top of the bubble moves down forming the jet and the flexible plate begins to move down due to the rapid displacement change in the central region and the relatively slow displacement change in the neighboring region the flexible plate is observed in a state of two spikes and presents a third order response mode at t 3 67 after t 4 08 the peak position gradually spreads to the sides and the amplitude decreases gradually it is interesting to investigate the changes in the overall displacement curve under similar dimensionless distance parameters the observed phenomena have a striking similarity in the case shown in fig 15 b at t 2 39 the bubble reaches its maximum volume and the flexible plate presents a first order whip like response mode at t 3 20 the flexible plate enters the rebound phase and begins to move downward at t 4 0 the flexible plate is observed in a state of two symmetrical spikes at t 4 39 the peak position expands to both sides and the amplitude decreases gradually which indicates that the process of two spike variations is similar to the decreasing wave transmitted to both sides of the flexible plate at t 4 80 downward movement is observed for all measurement points except for the peak point the center point is still at the reverse maximum displacement and continuous extension of the position of the two spikes to both sides of the flexible plate is observed 4 conclusions in this study bubble pulsation near a flexible plate with an attached air bubble was experimentally studied using a low pressure spark generated bubble special emphasis was placed on the coupling of the pulsation of the oscillating bubble attached air bubble and flexible boundary based on bubble pulsation the response of the attached air bubble jet morphology and response characteristics of the flexible plate were analyzed under different distance parameters and thickness parameters of the flexible plate and the effects of the bubble motion and structural deformation characteristics of the flexible plate with and without an attached air bubble were comprehensively considered the jet behavior of bubbles which depends strongly on the deformation effect of the flexible structure close to the flexible plate is summarized and the motion response mode and deformation pattern of the flexible plate under bubble loading are explored the primary findings included the following 1 in the coupling process between the oscillating bubble attached air bubble and flexible boundary the two bubbles tend to form a mushroom like annular jet near the flexible boundary accompanied by a series of complex phenomena including rebounding splitting after coalescence of the two bubbles jets away from the boundary and splitting in the middle of the bubble the direction of the jets and bubble migration fundamentally change in the case of a flexible boundary with an attached air bubble and the presence of an attached air bubble enhances the deformation rebound effect of the flexible boundary 2 for the case of a 1 mm flexible plate with an attached air bubble the splitting phenomenon and downward jets away from the boundary are observed in the oscillating bubble but no upward jets are this is because of the large deformation and bounce capacity of the 1 mm pvc plate the elastic response of the deformed boundary competes with the bjerknes attractive force caused by the low pressure between the bubble and boundary for the case of the 3 mm flexible plate both the splitting phenomenon and upward movement of the bubble are observed while downward jets away from the boundary are observed only for the case with an attached air bubble 3 comparing the displacement time history curves at the top and bottom points of the bubble to that of the center point of the flexible boundary reveals that the first cycle of bubble pulsation is significantly shortened when the flexible plate has an attached air bubble as shown in figs 10 13 the presence of an attached air bubble in the rebounding phase enhances the influence of the deformation of the structure on the bubble 4 the overall motion trend of the flexible plate under bubble loads is summarized and it is observed that during the expansion phase the flexible plate exhibits a first order response mode during the bubble collapse stage the time difference between the response of the central region and that of the neighboring regions contributes to the formation of two spikes on the flexible plate these two spikes are transmitted to both sides in the form of a wave and their amplitude decreases gradually during the rebounding phase stage a rise in the middle of the flexible plate and a continuous decline in the neighboring regions are observed credit authorship contribution statement jiaxia wang writing original draft formal analysis visualization data

shanghai 200240 china the suction bucket foundation is considered as an effective option for offshore wind turbines because of its advantages in rapid installation and recyclability however the depth of the suction bucket inserted into the seabed is shallower compared to the monopile earthquakes and liquefaction threaten the safety and stability of suction bucket foundations in the north sea of europe and the chinese offshore where earthquakes are active and the seabed is prone to liquefaction this paper investigated the behavior of the suction bucket foundation located in the liquefiable sand under earthquakes using an advanced liquefaction model the fe fd method with the cyclic mobility constitutive model for soil was used to carry out the nonlinear dynamic analyses responses of the excess pore water pressure ratio acceleration displacement and rotation were studied under different earthquake magnitudes and sand density the distribution of excess pore water pressure of the suction bucket foundation from the results show strong space time characteristics the failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation after liquefaction was revealed the numerical results indicate that offshore wind turbines will be subjected to permanent displacements and tilt to reach 40 of the safety threshold due to earthquakes and liquefaction thus seismic load and liquefaction of the foundation must be considered in the design keywords offshore wind turbine suction bucket foundation liquefaction earthquake response finite element analysis 1 introduction renewable energy is attracting worldwide attention due to its rich resources sustainable utilization and environmentally friendly offshore wind power is a dark horse in the renewable energy field and developing fast around the world kaldellis et al 2016 it is estimated that wind energy will meet more than 20 demand for the world s electricity by 2050 tabassum abbasi et al 2014 by 2030 the eu will invest almost 12 billion euros in the offshore wind market blanco 2009 the u s department of energy has set a target of 54 gw by offshore wind power lindenberg et al 2009 in china offshore wind power resources are estimated to be 200 gw nearly 10 times the installed capacity of onshore wind power hutao and li 2016 for offshore wind turbines owts the construction of the foundation is considered relatively expensive especially at shallow water depths below 30 m its construction requires approximately 20 30 capital cost and 12 25 life cycle cost musial and ram 2010 versteijlen et al 2011 besides the foundation needs about 60 of the total installation cost of offshore wind power plants wang et al 2018 most of the early owts adopted the gravity foundation kaldellis et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2015 later the monopile foundations were widely used shi et al 2013 wu et al 2019 the suction bucket foundation is fast to install and easy to recycle it nither requires special large scale equipment for installation nor generate noise when drilling cox and bhattacharya 2017 d j kim et al 2014 latini and zania 2017 therefore the suction bucket foundation is now considered as an effective option for owts barari and ibsen 2012 byrne et al 2002 kourkoulis et al 2014 larsen et al 2013 the concept of the suction bucket foundation was first introduced to the offshore industry in 1982 it was originally developed for the offshore oil and gas industry bang et al 2000 and was considered as the support structure for owts byrne et al 2002 the first owt with the bucket foundation was installed at frederick and armstrong 2007 and then in the uk 2014 and xiangshui china 2017 leblanc et al 2010 nielsen 2013 wang et al 2018 the suction bucket foundation has attracted a lot of attention in recent years which provides important guidance for the design and application of the bucket foundation bagheri and kim 2019 bransby and yun 2009 ding et al 2020 gourvenec 2007 gourvenec and randolph 2003 haddad et al 2019 hirai 2020 kelly et al 2006 koteras and ibsen 2019 sun et al 2020 vicent et al 2019 q wang et al 2019 x wang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the shape of the suction bucket is like an inverted water bucket it is inserted into the seabed by its gravity and the negative pressure formed by vacuum pumping owts with the suction bucket foundation is shown in fig 1 owts are subjected to cyclic loads such as wind and waves for a long time the serviceability of offshore structures founded under the cyclic load has been studied by many researchers arany and bhattacharya 2018 cox and bhattacharya 2017 j zhang et al 2007 zhu et al 2013 zhu et al 2011 zhu et al 2018 the strength and stiffness of the soil are degraded by cyclic loading which reduces the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation shen et al 2017 j wang et al 2019 wind and waves are important considerations in the suction bucket design but the role of earthquakes is often ignored including current standards dnv os j101 veritas 2007 however earthquakes can produce more energy in a short time interval compared to wind or waves the europe north seabed is composed mainly of sands bhattacharya et al 2009 and the chinese offshore is mainly composed of sand silt and clay bhattacharya et al 2017 jin et al 2010 which are inclined to liquefaction easily bucci et al 2018 in these areas earthquakes and liquefaction play an important role in the safety and stability of support structures of owts kaynia 2019 for example in the 2011 tohoku earthquake one wind turbine with a monopile foundation tilted due to the seabed liquefaction bhattacharya and goda 2016 the slenderness of the suction bucket foundation of owts is small the depth of insertion into the sandy seabed is shallower compared with the monopile foundation the safety of the suction bucket foundation is more vulnerable to earthquake liquefaction than the monopile foundation earthquake magnitude and sand density are often taken into account in the design of the suction buckets dnv os j101 besides the acceleration caused by an earthquake may have an irrecoverable impact on the working state of the rotor even leading to the failure of the wind turbine in serious cases kaynia 2019 the growing trend of owts construction in high earthquake areas requires a more rigorous assessment of the problem kourkoulis et al 2014 investigated the response of wind turbines founded on suction caissons subjected to monotonic lateral cyclic and earthquake loadings although not instantly catastrophic the accumulation of the foundation rotation could lead to the turbine reaching serviceability limits early during its operation kourkoulis et al 2014 kaynia 2019 demonstrated that earthquake is a design concern in seismic areas such as east asia and the western united states and the design of owts for earthquake loading is driven by performance based considerations asareh et al 2016 studied the eÔ¨Äects of seismic and aerodynamic load inter action on the structural dynamic response of multi megawatt utility scale horizontal axis wind turbines and results showed the structural design requirements should be improved under the earthquake smith and mahmoud 2016 evaluated the performance of wind turbines with various heights under the wind operation and seismic loads by realistic numerical models although the installation and bearing capacity of caisson has been studied the specific response of caisson under dynamic load remains unclear senpere and auvergne 1982 in the offshore field the seismic motion causes significant pore water pressure in saturated sand especially in areas near the seabed surface these pore water pressures can significantly reduce the lateral resistance of sand to suction bucket deformation and seriously increase the lateral displacement and rotational stiffness of the suction bucket foundation the accumulation of excess pore water pressure epwp will lead to liquefaction of the seabed the occurrence of liquefaction during the earthquake will lead to the destruction of the owts negro et al 2014 however the number of researches reported on the behavior of the suction bucket foundation under earthquake is limited especially considering liquefaction it is very difficult to test the response of the suction bucket in the earthquake several small scale centrifugal tests were carried out to study the performance of suction buckets under earthquakes choo et al 2015 wang et al 2017a 2017c yu et al 2014 however the centrifugal model is carried out in the case of scale reduction and only the parameters of a certain part can be obtained due to the difficulty of sensor layout the numerical simulation with low cost controllable conditions and rich results can overcome the shortcomings of the centrifuge test the springs with appropriate hysteretic behavior and additional elements instead of the far field were applied to seismic analysis boulanger et al 1999 markou and kaynia 2018 a simple kinematic hardening model with von mises failure criterion and associated flow rule which is available in the abaqus 2008 library was used to simulate soil structure interaction systems under cyclic or seismic loading anastasopoulos et al 2011 kourkoulis et al 2014 however the model only applies to clay materials the constitutive model proposed by armstrong and frederick 1966 was used to describe the seismic capacity of caisson foundations supporting bridge piers zafeirakos and gerolymos 2014 wind turbines and subsea structures on closed caisson foundations in the earthquake were analyzed by using a nonlinear spring model athanasiu et al 2015 however the constitutive models mentioned above are inadequate in describing the accumulation of epwp and liquefaction under seismic loads several constitutive models for liquefaction analysis have been proposed for example bowl model hypoplastic model isa hypoplasticity model sanisand kutter et al 2020 each model has its advantages and disadvantages in describing the different materials the cyclic mobility cm model zhang et al 2007 has its own advantages in simulating seismic liquefaction of sand and has been confirmed by many researchers bao et al 2012 hamayoon et al 2017 xia et al 2013 ye et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 proposed the cm model based on the modifying cam clay model sub loading hashiguchi 1977 and super loading asaoka et al 2002 in the cm model stress induced anisotropy over consolidation and structure are considered and then their evolution rules are given the drained and undrained mechanical properties of sand or clay under monotonic and dynamic loads are described in a unified way including the cyclic mobility of medium dense sand and clay the cam clay model cannot describe the mechanical properties of soil under cyclic loading and the plastic strain in reloading and re unloading these shortcomings are solved in the cm model all the behavior of toyoura sand no matter what loading and drainage conditions may be its mechanical behavior is described with a fixed set of material parameters the parameters involved in the model have clear physical meanings and can be easily determined by undrained triaxial cyclic loading tests and drained triaxial compression tests the values of the eight parameters are fixed in all loading processes once they are determined from the laboratory tests the cm model has great potential to solve the problems related to soil liquefaction under cyclic loading bao et al 2017 in this paper the cm model embedded in a soil water fully coupling finite element finite difference fe fd code is considered the code called dbleaves x which is the new edition of dbleaves ye 2011 is applied to describe the behavior of the suction bucket foundation located in liquefiable sand under earthquake to investigate the behavior of the suction bucket foundation located in liquefiable sand under earthquake several scenarios of earthquake and sand density are considered in this study the response is evaluated in terms of the excess pore water pressure acceleration and displacement throughout the earthquake the entire liquefaction development process of the seabed foundation can be accurately described 2 numerical method 2 1 cyclic mobility model a brief illustration of each yield surface

shiomi 1984 the governing equations are as follows 1 equilibrium equation 18 œÅ u i s œÉ i j x j œÅ b i where œÅ and u s denote the soil density and displacement respectively u means the first derivative of the displacement u and √º means the second derivative of the displacement u the derivative representation of the other physical symbols is similar œÉ ij is the effective stress tensor b i is the body force 2 continuity equation 19 œÅ f Œµ i i s 2 p d x i x i Œ≥ w k Œµ i i s n 1 k f p d 0 where œÅ f is the fluid density Œµ s i i is the volumetric strain of soil skeleton p d is the pore pressure Œ≥ w is the unit weight of the pore fluid k f and n denote the volumetric compressibility of the fluid and the soil porosity k is the coefficient of permeability respectively a finite element and finite difference fe fd hybrid scheme is adopted for spatial discretization of the governing eqs 18 and 19 the displacements in the equilibrium equation are discretized in the space domain by the finite element method whereas the terms of excess pore water pressures in the continuity equation are spatially discretized by the finite difference method the brief introduction of the fe fd method is as follows the equilibrium eq 18 is discretized in space domain by finite element method 20 m u n c u n k Œ¥ u n k v p d e f d r d t where k m and c are the stiffness matrix mass matrix and

numerical method the triaxial compression test results of loose sand and dense sand were compared with the numerical simulation results the numerical results in fig 3 a are in good agreement with the experimental results the results for dense sand in fig 3 b match well before the peak strength but a discrepancy exists between the numerical results and the experiment results in the residual state in general the cm model can describe the behavior of the sand in these tests the experimental conditions of toyoura sand samples subjected to cyclic loadings with different amplitudes are listed in table 1 the sine wave loading with a frequency of 0 01 hz is applied under confining stress of 98 kpa fig 4 and fig 5 show the experimental results and numerical results of undrained triaxial cyclic loading test with different shearing ratios q 2p 0 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 respectively the p represents the mean effective stress and the q represents the stress difference the effective stress paths and stress strain relations predicted by the cm model are qualitatively consistent with the experimental results while the cyclic number necessary for causing cyclic mobility is less than the experimental results zhang et al 2010 when the shear stress ratio is small liquefaction tends to occur much faster in the numerical analysis than in the experiment this is mainly due to the difficulty in determining accurate initial parameters for sand which affects the speed of liquefaction e g parameters of overconsolidation or structure the simulation results in fig 5 a show that the plastic strain develops fast and the liquefaction resistance of sand is underestimated this is normally regarded as conservative in the numerical calculation due to the underestimation of the liquefaction resistance of sand it can be seen from fig 4 that the stress path and stress strain relationship in the test are asymmetric the asymmetry of stress paths and stress strain relationships in the tension and compression sides cannot be described by the simulation in fig 5 this is because the effect of the intermediate principal stress is not considered in the constitutive equations in the constitutive model the extended von mises failure criterion is adopted the proposed constitutive model can well predict the test results well in the triaxial compression condition while it overestimates the soil strength in the triaxial extension tests on the one hand the effect of the intermediate principal stress on the strength of sand is limited on the other hand the convergence of the finite element code becomes worse when the intermediate principal stress is considered it is worth sacrificing a small part of the accuracy to ensure the convergence of the finite element code the current constitutive model mainly focuses on its capability in capturing the cyclic mobility behavior of the liquefied sand and the induced accumulated deformation hysteresis damping in the region of large strain cannot be quantitatively described in the constitutive model therefore the results presented in the study are considered to be qualitatively correct the results of numerical simulation should be used mainly in a comparative sense in this paper the cm model can be used to model the undrained cyclic behavior of sand under various conditions such as stress induced anisotropy consolidation conditions and structure the model can accurately describe the cyclic flow characteristics liquefaction strength stress strain relationship and effective stress path of sand jin et al 2010 have been simulated element tests of the sand specimen subjected to cyclic load under different loading conditions in the triaxial test using the code named as dbleaves bao et al 2017 have investigated the seismic behavior of a large rectangular metro tunnel in liquefiable soil by dbleaves xia et al 2010 have studied the repeated shake consolidation process of earth embankment on a liquefiable foundation matsuda et al 2016 have studied instability on the sandy ground under breakwater due to earthquake and tsunami by dbleaves liquefaction and post liquefaction ground settlements of breakwaters on the complex ground were studied by dbleaves gu et al 2018 according to the research bao et al 2012 2014a 2014b hamayoon et al 2017 xia et al 2013 ye et al 2015 dbleaves has its unique advantages in dealing with the problems about the earthquake and liquefaction 3 numerical model of suction bucket 3 1 earthquake motion as shown in fig 6 large earthquake medium earthquake and small earthquake are used as input seismic waves of the model the frequency of a seismic wave is 1 hz and the duration is 25 s this wave has been used many times in related research wang et al 2017b yu et al 2015 a direct integration method for newmark Œ≤ is used in the dynamic analysis the integral time interval is 0 02 s the damping type is rayleigh damping although the stiffness of the suction bucket foundation will change due to the nonlinearity of the material for simplicity the viscosity matrix calculated by rayleigh damping is assumed to be constant without considering the change of stiffness matrix rayleigh damping Œ≤ with 0 05 is used for the ground and the structure 3 2 numerical models and boundary conditions a finite element model was established according to the suction bucket of a typical 8 mw owt dnv 2017 as shown in fig 7 a symmetric mode is adopted the center of the suction bucket cover coincides with the center of the upper surface of the soil layer the diameter d of the suction bucket is 20 m the bucket skirt is completely inserted into the soil with a length of 10 m and a thickness of 0 05 m a cylindrical platform with a diameter of 4 m and a height of 6 m is set on the top of the suction bucket to study the seismic response of the superstructure the length width and height of soil layer are 200 m 100 m and 40 m respectively as shown in fig 7 a the model is divided into hexahedral meshes and the mesh near the suction bucket is densified fig 7 b shows the top view and front view of the model respectively the monitoring points are arranged at 0 m a0 b0 c0 5 m a1 b1 c1 15 m a2 b2 c2 25 m a3 b3 c3 35 m a4 b4 c4 the monitoring points are also arranged at the top of the cylinder d the skirt tip l r they are used to monitor acceleration displacement and pore pressure the boundary conditions of the model are as follows the mud line is flush with the cover of the suction bucket the seismic acceleration is applied to the bedrock and propagates upward therefore a fixed boundary is applied at the bottom of the model the seismic acceleration is applied to the entire model as a volume load on the two sides parallel to the xoz plane the node y direction is fixed the equal displacement boundary condition is applied to the x direction of two sides parallel to the yoz plane to simulate the dynamic response of infinite horizontal strata nodes with the same height on both sides of the analytical region are bound together the displacement is always consistent which is called equivalent displacement conditions so the effect of reflected waves is eliminated kimura and zhang 2000 xia et al 2010 3 3 soil parameters in the model a single layer of saturated toyoura sand is used the material parameters and initial state parameters are shown in table 2 and 3 the suction bucket and the above cylindrical cap are made of steel and the elastic modulus e is 70 gpa the triaxial undrained cyclic loading simulation of loose sand e 0 801 and dense sand e 0 646 was carried out fig 8 shows the stress path and stress strain relationship of sand with different density in the undrained test for loose sand the effective stress path is directed toward the origin it can be observed that the shrinkage state transits to the expansion state and finally produces a large failure strain as shown in fig 8 a for very dense sand only a small amount of strain is produced and no cyclic fluidity occurs as shown in fig 8 b as shown in fig 8 c the loose sand reaches peak strength and then collapses and flows rapidly toward the origin of the stress space showing a typical strain softening and contractive behavior however dense sand only shows strain hardening 4 coseismic behavior of suction bucket foundation 4 1 excess pore water pressure ratio response fig 9 a shows the excess pore water pressure ratio epwpr of the monitoring points a1 b1 and c1 in loose sand and dense sand on the whole the epwp accumulates with the development of the earthquake as shown in fig 9 the accumulation of epwp can be roughly divided into three stages whether inside or outside the suction bucket one is the rapid development stage of epwp about 0 10 s the second is the stage that epwp rises slowly about 10 15 s the third is the steady stage of epwp about 20 25 s however the epwpr of the suction bucket foundation in loose sand and dense sand is obviously different the epwpr of loose sand is significantly higher than that of dense sand the development rate is also faster than that of dense sand therefore loose sand is more likely to liquefy than dense sand a1 is located inside the suction bucket and b1 is located outside the suction bucket c1 is outside the influence range of the suction bucket and can be regarded as free soil it is observed that the development rate of epwpr is a1 b1 c1 the epwpr in the suction bucket is significantly lower than that in the external free field showing liquefaction resistance this phenomenon can be explained by a kinematic constraint mechanism the stiffness of the soil inside the suction bucket is enhanced by the constraint of the suction bucket the kinematic constraint caused by the large foundation stiffness can inhibit the shear strain in the soil inside the suction bucket thus the excess pore water pressure diminishes however the suction bucket experiences a dynamic response different from the surrounding soil and interacts with the surrounding soil during an earthquake due to the lack of restraint the soil near the bucket tip easily liquefy the time history of epwpr with different earthquakes is shown in fig 9 b the epwpr is positively correlated with the input seismic acceleration time the epwpr of loose sand is larger than that of dense sand under the same earthquake magnitude the greater the magnitude the greater the epwpr and the more likely the sand will liquefy the epwpr at different times and depths at point a are plotted in fig 10 the temporal and spatial distribution of epwpr inside the suction bucket in an earthquake is obtained as shown in fig 10 the epwpr of the loose sand and dense sand show strong space time characteristics when the depth of the loose sand and dense sand is less than 25 m and 15 m respectively the epwpr is accumulated with time it shows that the shallow part of the sand layer is easy to liquefy from the change of the epwpr with depth at a certain time it can be seen that epwpr is non linearly distributed along with the skirt with the increase of depth the epwpr gradually decreases the deeper the soil layer the less likely it is to liquefy however the depth of the suction bucket inserted into the seabed is only 10 m liquefaction occurs in the shallow part of loose sand epwpr 0 90 which may be disastrous for the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation the epwpr in the shallow part of dense sand is only about 0 6 and there is no liquefaction however the increase of epwp will reduce the effective stress and affect the bearing capacity of the suction bucket the generation and accumulation of epwp in the soil determine the tendency of soil liquefaction which determines the behavior of the suction bucket fig 11 presents the distribution of epwpr of loose sand and dense sand at different times the liquefaction of loose sand and dense sand occurred in different degrees and developed with time the liquefaction of loose sand is greater than dense sand at the same time and the final liquefaction depth is deeper the epwpr inside the bucket is significantly lower than that of the free sand at the same depth however the skirt of the suction bucket is very thin due to the concentrated stress at the skirt tip the shear stress increases and the epwpr increases which leads to liquefaction therefore attention should be paid to the soil near the skirt tip besides the shallow soil layer in the liquefaction remediation of the suction bucket foundation 4 2 acceleration response the acceleration time history at the top of the cylindrical table d and sand surface c0 are shown in fig 12 the acceleration of c0 can be divided into two stages one is the rapid development stage of acceleration which occurs at the beginning of the earthquake the second is the acceleration attenuation stage at this stage the surface of sand has been liquefied which attenuates the transmission of seismic waves however the acceleration of d does not show an obvious attenuation trend this shows that the soil under the suction bucket is not fully liquefied fig 13 shows the acceleration time history of dense sand and loose sand at different depths of point a below the suction bucket and point c free sand at the depths of 25 m and 35 m the acceleration responses of free sand c are similar to sand a under the bucket however the acceleration response of free sand attenuates obviously at the depth of 5 m and 0 m especially the acceleration of c0 rapidly decays to near 0 after 5 s the reason is that the sand of free field c0 will liquefy after 5 s with the accumulation of epwp which will filter and isolate seismic waves due to the constraints and additional loads of the suction bucket the acceleration attenuation of soil under the suction bucket a0 is smaller than that at the free field c0 compared with the free sand the sand in the suction bucket has an enhanced ability to resist liquefaction the transmission law of seismic waves in dense sand and loose sand also shows the obvious difference the depth of influence of the suction bucket in dense sand is small the time history of acceleration in dense sand under the bucket and free dense sand are inconsistent at 5 m above this value is 25 m above in loose sand there is little difference between the acceleration response of loose sand and dense sand in the deep depth the acceleration attenuation of loose sand is faster than that of the dense sand on the seabed surface the different acceleration responses of sand reflect the development of epwp in the earthquake to analyze the dynamic response of the suction bucket under the earthquake the acceleration response coefficient Œª is defined as the ratio of the maximum acceleration of the suction bucket column top to the maximum acceleration of input seismic wave the acceleration response coefficient of the suction bucket in loose sand is 1 37 while that in dense sand is 1 59 the acceleration response of the suction bucket in dense sand is 15 67 higher than that in loose sand the reason is that the loose sand is easier to liquefy than the dense sand and the pore water pressure has a damping effect on the development of acceleration however this is only an example under a specific condition the results are different at distinct input motion s frequency and the tower s natural frequency the parameters of foundation including material properties used in its construction the stiffness of the soil suction bucket aspect ratio and suction bucket mass have an effect on the system natural frequency fundamental frequencies of the foundation shifted to lower frequencies owing to softening associated with the increase of excess pore pressure manandhar et al 2021 besides the rate of generation of excess pore water pressure damping ratio increases with the increase of the frequency and the shear modulus in sand decreases with the increase of the frequency dash and sitharam 2016 in the design of the suction bucket foundation the amplification effect of different foundation soil on acceleration should be considered and checked to avoid overload of the rotor the damping effect caused by the development of epwp of different foundation soils should also be considered to avoid economic waste due to excessive safety factor if necessary the impact of frequency also needs to be evaluated 4 3 displacement and rotation of soil and wind turbine the earthquake and the highly nonlinear of soil will cause a permanent inclination of the wind turbine fig 14 shows the settlement of skirt tip of left l and right r column top d the soil under the suction bucket and soil at the free field in loose sand and dense sand during earthquakes the settlement of the suction bucket in loose sand is larger than that in dense sand the settlement of d a1 and c1 in loose sand is about 6 67 times 6 23 times and 3 49 times of that in dense sand respectively the suction bucket affected by horizontal seismic load shakes left and right and sinks continuously the settlement of the left skirt is less than that of the right skirt uneven settlement causes the overall rotation of owts the angle of the suction bucket can be calculated by the ratio of the settlement difference between the left and right sides of the bucket skirt and the diameter of the suction bucket the rotation angles of the bucket foundation in different simulations are shown in table 4 the angle of the suction bucket in loose sand is larger than that in dense sand under the same earthquake magnitude the difference of the angles of the suction bucket between loose sand and dense sand is significant with the increase of earthquake magnitude the angle of the suction bucket increases with the increase of earthquake magnitude the increasing trend is more obvious in loose sand compared with dense sand this phenomenon is explained by the influence of the larger pore ratio of loose sand and liquefaction the suction bucket appeared an angle of 0 068 in loose sand few people pay attention to the rotor displacement caused by the displacement of the foundation d h kim et al 2014 although this is not catastrophic it tends to reach the service limit at the early stage of the turbine kim et al 2014b owts are usually as high as 180 m even if the foundation has a small angle of 0 068 at the top of the owts the horizontal displacement is close to 0 21 m therefore there are strict requirements for foundation angle in offshore wind power code 0 5 in germany kuo et al 2009 0 25 for thornton bank wind farm in the uk peire et al 2009 and 0 17 in china zhu et al 2014 fig 15 shows the settlement of a1 for loose sand and dense sand under different magnitudes the settlement of loose sand is significantly greater than that of dense sand under the same magnitude the settlement also increases with the increase of earthquake magnitude the influence of the relative density of sand is greater than that of magnitude the sand density has a significant influence on the settlement control of the suction bucket foundation 5 failure mechanisms the variation law of displacement field during an earthquake is shown in fig 16 the failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation after liquefaction is revealed as shown in fig 19 at the beginning of the earthquake the suction bucket moves with the sand the influence on the sand displacement field is not obvious at this time the sliding displacement is smaller than the shaking displacement therefore shaking is the main failure mechanism the different magnitude of positive and negative accelerations of earthquakes produce different inertial forces the plastic deformation and liquefaction of sand will make the inertial force more significant the acceleration is transmitted to the suction bucket through the sand the suction bucket can not keep pace with the soil because of the different materials the suction bucket vibrates and applies horizontal and vertical moment loads on the adjacent sand when liquefaction occurs the degradation of soil strength results in a decrease in its resistance to deformation when the load is greater than the resistance provided by the soil the displacement and rotation will accumulate the entire sand moves asymmetrically and the liquefied sand moves laterally the suction bucket will rotate around the axis at the same time it also forces the sand around it to accumulate and move the soil in the suction bucket is restrained by the bucket skirt its lateral movement and rotation are limited and the soil is forced to settle vertically this displacement mechanism is similar to the flow of fluid around the piston without shear the suction bucket seems to squeeze out the liquefied soil under it and then the soil moves upward a failure mechanism of bearing capacity is triggered during earthquakes the development of the pore water pressure has an important influence on the failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation the earthquake induced shear stress produces the deviatoric strain in soil the volumetric strain caused by pore water pressure gives rise to the settlement of the foundations the water migrates in the seabed foundation and causes a small local volumetric strain during the earthquake with the increase of pore water pressure the soil skeleton is destroyed and the upper soil begins to liquefy the soil strength decreases and the soil particles are redistributed the deviatoric strain plays an important role near the suction bucket the extra static shear stress added by owts aggravates the strength loss of soil and leads to the settlement and inclination of the suction bucket the cyclic shear stress due to earthquakes and the interaction of the soil and the bucket result in the accumulation of settlement the increase of local pore water pressure will accelerate this process the epwpr time history and strain time history of the soil element 1 near the suction bucket tip and the free soil element 2 at the same depth are shown in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively they can reveal the failure mechanisms of the suction bucket foundation the epwpr near the suction bucket tip shows a strong fluctuation than that at the free field the fluctuation of the epwpr exactly corresponds to the uplift and settlement of the suction bucket tip during the earthquake the reason is that the periodic uplift and settlement of the suction bucket in the earthquake cause the disturbance of the soil near the tip the strain of the soil at the suction bucket tip accumulates continuously and is obviously larger than that at the free field compared with the soil in the free field the soil under the suction bucket tip is greatly disturbed due to the lifting and sinking of the suction bucket when the acceleration is in the x direction positive the suction bucket moves to the right and rotates clockwise due to inertia local compression leads to the increase of pore pressure the increased shear force is carried by the soil below the right edge as a result the soil becomes weaker there is no obvious resistance to liquefaction inevitably it moves outward laterally pushing along the fully liquefied soil in the free field forming a passive zone and allowing the suction bucket to settle the local drainage of the rising pore pressure may be the potential reason for the increase of settlement on the right side of the foundation the left edge of the skirt moves up to unload the unsettled area below it and reduce the pore water pressure when the soil in the free field moves to the bucket skirt it will encounter the bucket skirt and the area of increasing effective stress the region was unable to push forward and was forced to move up in this case the periodic shear force exerted by the foundation plays a leading role in driving local soil displacement it can be realized that footing settlements develop due to a newmark type sliding block mechanism rather than densification of the sand when the acceleration is in the negative x direction negative the foundation repeats the opposite motion generally speaking the settlement of the suction bucket is mainly driven by the extensional failure mechanism in each half cycle a large amount of soil under the suction bucket accumulates vertical displacement because of the loss of lateral support of the surrounding soil with this mechanism the local volume strain due to drainage also increases the displacement the uplift of the opposite edge of the foundation disturbed the soil under the foundation it causes the next round of load at this location to cause more settlement this mechanism leads to the accumulated uneven settlement of the suction bucket foundation 6 conclusions the behavior of the suction bucket foundation of owts located in liquefiable sand under earthquakes was studied using three dimensional soil water fully coupling fe fd code an advanced elasto plastic constitutive model was used for sand the dynamic spatial temporal development of epwp acceleration displacement and rotation of the suction bucket foundation under different earthquake magnitude and sand type were investigated the following conclusions were drawn 1 based on the elasto plastic constitutive model which describes the liquefaction of sand and the fe fd method the liquefaction of the seabed around the suction bucket foundation can be accurately described the generation and accumulation of epwp in the seabed determines the tendency of seabed liquefaction which determines the behavior of the suction bucket 2 the distribution of epwpr of the suction bucket foundation shows strong space time characteristics epwp accumulates over time and decreases nonlinearly with depth the epwpr inside the suction bucket is significantly lower than that in the free field at the same height as for the epwpr distribution inside the suction bucket a high pore water pressure appears near the top cap and the skirt tip which reduces the effective stress and affects the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation 3 the development of acceleration under the suction bucket was different from that of free soil due to the influence of epwp the acceleration of free soil gradually attenuates to 0 in the shallow soil while it decayed little under the suction bucket in the design of the suction bucket foundation the amplification effect of different soil on acceleration should be checked the damping effect caused by the development of epwp in different soil should be considered to avoid economic loss caused by an excessive safety factor 4 the failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation after liquefaction was revealed uneven settlement occurred in the earthquake because of the asymmetry of seismic load and plastic accumulation of the soil furthermore liquefaction occurs at the seabed shallow and increased the inclination of the foundation the earthquake can cause the inclination of the suction bucket foundation to reach 40 of the safety threshold seriously affecting the safe operation of owts the actual marine environment is much more complicated than the factors considered in this paper such as geological conditions wind waves and currents however the interaction between factors makes it difficult to distinguish the effects of the factors of concern the results show that the tilt of the wind turbine is likely to occur in earthquakes even without considering other loads there are few seismic design codes for the suction bucket foundation of owts the design standard of the suction bucket should be improved especially in the north sea of europe and the chinese offshore where earthquakes are active and the seabed is prone to liquefaction further research on seismic analysis and safety assessment of the suction bucket foundation must be carried out data availability statement all data models and code generated or used

shanghai 200240 china the suction bucket foundation is considered as an effective option for offshore wind turbines because of its advantages in rapid installation and recyclability however the depth of the suction bucket inserted into the seabed is shallower compared to the monopile earthquakes and liquefaction threaten the safety and stability of suction bucket foundations in the north sea of europe and the chinese offshore where earthquakes are active and the seabed is prone to liquefaction this paper investigated the behavior of the suction bucket foundation located in the liquefiable sand under earthquakes using an advanced liquefaction model the fe fd method with the cyclic mobility constitutive model for soil was used to carry out the nonlinear dynamic analyses responses of the excess pore water pressure ratio acceleration displacement and rotation were studied under different earthquake magnitudes and sand density the distribution of excess pore water pressure of the suction bucket foundation from the results show strong space time characteristics the failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation after liquefaction was revealed the numerical results indicate that offshore wind turbines will be subjected to permanent displacements and tilt to reach 40 of the safety threshold due to earthquakes and liquefaction thus seismic load and liquefaction of the foundation must be considered in the design keywords offshore wind turbine suction bucket foundation liquefaction earthquake response finite element analysis 1 introduction renewable energy is attracting worldwide attention due to its rich resources sustainable utilization and environmentally friendly offshore wind power is a dark horse in the renewable energy field and developing fast around the world kaldellis et al 2016 it is estimated that wind energy will meet more than 20 demand for the world s electricity by 2050 tabassum abbasi et al 2014 by 2030 the eu will invest almost 12 billion euros in the offshore wind market blanco 2009 the u s department of energy has set a target of 54 gw by offshore wind power lindenberg et al 2009 in china offshore wind power resources are estimated to be 200 gw nearly 10 times the installed capacity of onshore wind power hutao and li 2016 for offshore wind turbines owts the construction of the foundation is considered relatively expensive especially at shallow water depths below 30 m its construction requires approximately 20 30 capital cost and 12 25 life cycle cost musial and ram 2010 versteijlen et al 2011 besides the foundation needs about 60 of the total installation cost of offshore wind power plants wang et al 2018 most of the early owts adopted the gravity foundation kaldellis et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2015 later the monopile foundations were widely used shi et al 2013 wu et al 2019 the suction bucket foundation is fast to install and easy to recycle it nither requires special large scale equipment for installation nor generate noise when drilling cox and bhattacharya 2017 d j kim et al 2014 latini and zania 2017 therefore the suction bucket foundation is now considered as an effective option for owts barari and ibsen 2012 byrne et al 2002 kourkoulis et al 2014 larsen et al 2013 the concept of the suction bucket foundation was first introduced to the offshore industry in 1982 it was originally developed for the offshore oil and gas industry bang et al 2000 and was considered as the support structure for owts byrne et al 2002 the first owt with the bucket foundation was installed at frederick and armstrong 2007 and then in the uk 2014 and xiangshui china 2017 leblanc et al 2010 nielsen 2013 wang et al 2018 the suction bucket foundation has attracted a lot of attention in recent years which provides important guidance for the design and application of the bucket foundation bagheri and kim 2019 bransby and yun 2009 ding et al 2020 gourvenec 2007 gourvenec and randolph 2003 haddad et al 2019 hirai 2020 kelly et al 2006 koteras and ibsen 2019 sun et al 2020 vicent et al 2019 q wang et al 2019 x wang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the shape of the suction bucket is like an inverted water bucket it is inserted into the seabed by its gravity and the negative pressure formed by vacuum pumping owts with the suction bucket foundation is shown in fig 1 owts are subjected to cyclic loads such as wind and waves for a long time the serviceability of offshore structures founded under the cyclic load has been studied by many researchers arany and bhattacharya 2018 cox and bhattacharya 2017 j zhang et al 2007 zhu et al 2013 zhu et al 2011 zhu et al 2018 the strength and stiffness of the soil are degraded by cyclic loading which reduces the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation shen et al 2017 j wang et al 2019 wind and waves are important considerations in the suction bucket design but the role of earthquakes is often ignored including current standards dnv os j101 veritas 2007 however earthquakes can produce more energy in a short time interval compared to wind or waves the europe north seabed is composed mainly of sands bhattacharya et al 2009 and the chinese offshore is mainly composed of sand silt and clay bhattacharya et al 2017 jin et al 2010 which are inclined to liquefaction easily bucci et al 2018 in these areas earthquakes and liquefaction play an important role in the safety and stability of support structures of owts kaynia 2019 for example in the 2011 tohoku earthquake one wind turbine with a monopile foundation tilted due to the seabed liquefaction bhattacharya and goda 2016 the slenderness of the suction bucket foundation of owts is small the depth of insertion into the sandy seabed is shallower compared with the monopile foundation the safety of the suction bucket foundation is more vulnerable to earthquake liquefaction than the monopile foundation earthquake magnitude and sand density are often taken into account in the design of the suction buckets dnv os j101 besides the acceleration caused by an earthquake may have an irrecoverable impact on the working state of the rotor even leading to the failure of the wind turbine in serious cases kaynia 2019 the growing trend of owts construction in high earthquake areas requires a more rigorous assessment of the problem kourkoulis et al 2014 investigated the response of wind turbines founded on suction caissons subjected to monotonic lateral cyclic and earthquake loadings although not instantly catastrophic the accumulation of the foundation rotation could lead to the turbine reaching serviceability limits early during its operation kourkoulis et al 2014 kaynia 2019 demonstrated that earthquake is a design concern in seismic areas such as east asia and the western united states and the design of owts for earthquake loading is driven by performance based considerations asareh et al 2016 studied the eÔ¨Äects of seismic and aerodynamic load inter action on the structural dynamic response of multi megawatt utility scale horizontal axis wind turbines and results showed the structural design requirements should be improved under the earthquake smith and mahmoud 2016 evaluated the performance of wind turbines with various heights under the wind operation and seismic loads by realistic numerical models although the installation and bearing capacity of caisson has been studied the specific response of caisson under dynamic load remains unclear senpere and auvergne 1982 in the offshore field the seismic motion causes significant pore water pressure in saturated sand especially in areas near the seabed surface these pore water pressures can significantly reduce the lateral resistance of sand to suction bucket deformation and seriously increase the lateral displacement and rotational stiffness of the suction bucket foundation the accumulation of excess pore water pressure epwp will lead to liquefaction of the seabed the occurrence of liquefaction during the earthquake will lead to the destruction of the owts negro et al 2014 however the number of researches reported on the behavior of the suction bucket foundation under earthquake is limited especially considering liquefaction it is very difficult to test the response of the suction bucket in the earthquake several small scale centrifugal tests were carried out to study the performance of suction buckets under earthquakes choo et al 2015 wang et al 2017a 2017c yu et al 2014 however the centrifugal model is carried out in the case of scale reduction and only the parameters of a certain part can be obtained due to the difficulty of sensor layout the numerical simulation with low cost controllable conditions and rich results can overcome the shortcomings of the centrifuge test the springs with appropriate hysteretic behavior and additional elements instead of the far field were applied to seismic analysis boulanger et al 1999 markou and kaynia 2018 a simple kinematic hardening model with von mises failure criterion and associated flow rule which is available in the abaqus 2008 library was used to simulate soil structure interaction systems under cyclic or seismic loading anastasopoulos et al 2011 kourkoulis et al 2014 however the model only applies to clay materials the constitutive model proposed by armstrong and frederick 1966 was used to describe the seismic capacity of caisson foundations supporting bridge piers zafeirakos and gerolymos 2014 wind turbines and subsea structures on closed caisson foundations in the earthquake were analyzed by using a nonlinear spring model athanasiu et al 2015 however the constitutive models mentioned above are inadequate in describing the accumulation of epwp and liquefaction under seismic loads several constitutive models for liquefaction analysis have been proposed for example bowl model hypoplastic model isa hypoplasticity model sanisand kutter et al 2020 each model has its advantages and disadvantages in describing the different materials the cyclic mobility cm model zhang et al 2007 has its own advantages in simulating seismic liquefaction of sand and has been confirmed by many researchers bao et al 2012 hamayoon et al 2017 xia et al 2013 ye et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 proposed the cm model based on the modifying cam clay model sub loading hashiguchi 1977 and super loading asaoka et al 2002 in the cm model stress induced anisotropy over consolidation and structure are considered and then their evolution rules are given the drained and undrained mechanical properties of sand or clay under monotonic and dynamic loads are described in a unified way including the cyclic mobility of medium dense sand and clay the cam clay model cannot describe the mechanical properties of soil under cyclic loading and the plastic strain in reloading and re unloading these shortcomings are solved in the cm model all the behavior of toyoura sand no matter what loading and drainage conditions may be its mechanical behavior is described with a fixed set of material parameters the parameters involved in the model have clear physical meanings and can be easily determined by undrained triaxial cyclic loading tests and drained triaxial compression tests the values of the eight parameters are fixed in all loading processes once they are determined from the laboratory tests the cm model has great potential to solve the problems related to soil liquefaction under cyclic loading bao et al 2017 in this paper the cm model embedded in a soil water fully coupling finite element finite difference fe fd code is considered the code called dbleaves x which is the new edition of dbleaves ye 2011 is applied to describe the behavior of the suction bucket foundation located in liquefiable sand under earthquake to investigate the behavior of the suction bucket foundation located in liquefiable sand under earthquake several scenarios of earthquake and sand density are considered in this study the response is evaluated in terms of the excess pore water pressure acceleration and displacement throughout the earthquake the entire liquefaction development process of the seabed foundation can be accurately described 2 numerical method 2 1 cyclic mobility model a brief illustration of each yield surface

anisotropy these three parameters can be obtained by the laboratory test 2 2 fe fd method in the dynamic fem a fully coupled two phase field theory with the u p formulation is adopted zienkiewicz and shiomi 1984 the governing equations are as follows 1 equilibrium equation 18 œÅ u i s œÉ i j x j œÅ b i where œÅ and u s denote the soil density and displacement respectively u means the first derivative of the displacement u and √º means the second derivative of the displacement u the derivative representation of the other physical symbols is similar œÉ ij is the effective stress tensor b i is the body force 2 continuity equation 19 œÅ f Œµ i i s 2 p d x i x i Œ≥ w k Œµ i i s n 1 k f p d 0 where œÅ f is the fluid density Œµ s i i is the volumetric strain of soil skeleton p d is the pore pressure Œ≥ w is the unit weight of the pore fluid k f and n denote the volumetric compressibility of the fluid and the soil porosity k is the coefficient of permeability respectively a finite element and finite difference fe fd hybrid scheme is adopted for spatial discretization of the governing eqs 18 and 19 the displacements in the equilibrium equation are discretized in the space domain by the finite element method whereas the terms of excess pore water pressures in the continuity equation are spatially discretized by the finite difference method the brief introduction of the fe fd method is as follows the equilibrium eq 18 is discretized in space domain by finite element method 20 m u n c u n k Œ¥ u n k v p d e f d r d t where k m and c are the stiffness matrix mass matrix and

numerical method the triaxial compression test results of loose sand and dense sand were compared with the numerical simulation results the numerical results in fig 3 a are in good agreement with the experimental results the results for dense sand in fig 3 b match well before the peak strength but a discrepancy exists between the numerical results and the experiment results in the residual state in general the cm model can describe the behavior of the sand in these tests the experimental conditions of toyoura sand samples subjected to cyclic loadings with different amplitudes are listed in table 1 the sine wave loading with a frequency of 0 01 hz is applied under confining stress of 98 kpa fig 4 and fig 5 show the experimental results and numerical results of undrained triaxial cyclic loading test with different shearing ratios q 2p 0 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 respectively the p represents the mean effective stress and the q represents the stress difference the effective stress paths and stress strain relations predicted by the cm model are qualitatively consistent with the experimental results while the cyclic number necessary for causing cyclic mobility is less than the experimental results zhang et al 2010 when the shear stress ratio is small liquefaction tends to occur much faster in the numerical analysis than in the experiment this is mainly due to the difficulty in determining accurate initial parameters for sand which affects the speed of liquefaction e g parameters of overconsolidation or structure the simulation results in fig 5 a show that the plastic strain develops fast and the liquefaction resistance of sand is underestimated this is normally regarded as conservative in the numerical calculation due to the underestimation of the liquefaction resistance of sand it can be seen from fig 4 that the stress path and stress strain relationship in the test are asymmetric the asymmetry of stress paths and stress strain relationships in the tension and compression sides cannot be described by the simulation in fig 5 this is because the effect of the intermediate principal stress is not considered in the constitutive equations in the constitutive model the extended von mises failure criterion is adopted the proposed constitutive model can well predict the test results well in the triaxial compression condition while it overestimates the soil strength in the triaxial extension tests on the one hand the effect of the intermediate principal stress on the strength of sand is limited on the other hand the convergence of the finite element code becomes worse when the intermediate principal stress is considered it is worth sacrificing a small part of the accuracy to ensure the convergence of the finite element code the current constitutive model mainly focuses on its capability in capturing the cyclic mobility behavior of the liquefied sand and the induced accumulated deformation hysteresis damping in the region of large strain cannot be quantitatively described in the constitutive model therefore the results presented in the study are considered to be qualitatively correct the results of numerical simulation should be used mainly in a comparative sense in this paper the cm model can be used to model the undrained cyclic behavior of sand under various conditions such as stress induced anisotropy consolidation conditions and structure the model can accurately describe the cyclic flow characteristics liquefaction strength stress strain relationship and effective stress path of sand jin et al 2010 have been simulated element tests of the sand specimen subjected to cyclic load under different loading conditions in the triaxial test using the code named as dbleaves bao et al 2017 have investigated the seismic behavior of a large rectangular metro tunnel in liquefiable soil by dbleaves xia et al 2010 have studied the repeated shake consolidation process of earth embankment on a liquefiable foundation matsuda et al 2016 have studied instability on the sandy ground under breakwater due to earthquake and tsunami by dbleaves liquefaction and post liquefaction ground settlements of breakwaters on the complex ground were studied by dbleaves gu et al 2018 according to the research bao et al 2012 2014a 2014b hamayoon et al 2017 xia et al 2013 ye et al 2015 dbleaves has its unique advantages in dealing with the problems about the earthquake and liquefaction 3 numerical model of suction bucket 3 1 earthquake motion as shown in fig 6 large earthquake medium earthquake and small earthquake are used as input seismic waves of the model the frequency of a seismic wave is 1 hz and the duration is 25 s this wave has been used many times in related research wang et al 2017b yu et al 2015 a direct integration method for newmark Œ≤ is used in the dynamic analysis the integral time interval is 0 02 s the damping type is rayleigh damping although the stiffness of the suction bucket foundation will change due to the nonlinearity of the material for simplicity the viscosity matrix calculated by rayleigh damping is assumed to be constant without considering the change of stiffness matrix rayleigh damping Œ≤ with 0 05 is used for the ground and the structure 3 2 numerical models and boundary conditions a finite element model was established according to the suction bucket of a typical 8 mw owt dnv 2017 as shown in fig 7 a symmetric mode is adopted the center of the suction bucket cover coincides with the center of the upper surface of the soil layer the diameter d of the suction bucket is 20 m the bucket skirt is completely inserted into the soil with a length of 10 m and a thickness of 0 05 m a cylindrical platform with a diameter of 4 m and a height of 6 m is set on the top of the suction bucket to study the seismic response of the superstructure the length width and height of soil layer are 200 m 100 m and 40 m respectively as shown in fig 7 a the model is divided into hexahedral meshes and the mesh near the suction bucket is densified fig 7 b shows the top view and front view of the model respectively the monitoring points are arranged at 0 m a0 b0 c0 5 m a1 b1 c1 15 m a2 b2 c2 25 m a3 b3 c3 35 m a4 b4 c4 the monitoring points are also arranged at the top of the cylinder d the skirt tip l r they are used to monitor acceleration displacement and pore pressure the boundary conditions of the model are as follows the mud line is flush with the cover of the suction bucket the seismic acceleration is applied to the bedrock and propagates upward therefore a fixed boundary is applied at the bottom of the model the seismic acceleration is applied to the entire model as a volume load on the two sides parallel to the xoz plane the node y direction is fixed the equal displacement boundary condition is applied to the x direction of two sides parallel to the yoz plane to simulate the dynamic response of infinite horizontal strata nodes with the same height on both sides of the analytical region are bound together the displacement is always consistent which is called equivalent displacement conditions so the effect of reflected waves is eliminated kimura and zhang 2000 xia et al 2010 3 3 soil parameters in the model a single layer of saturated toyoura sand is used the material parameters and initial state parameters are shown in table 2 and 3 the suction bucket and the above cylindrical cap are made of steel and the elastic modulus e is 70 gpa the triaxial undrained cyclic loading simulation of loose sand e 0 801 and dense sand e 0 646 was carried out fig 8 shows the stress path and stress strain relationship of sand with different density in the undrained test for loose sand the effective stress path is directed toward the origin it can be observed that the shrinkage state transits to the expansion state and finally produces a large failure strain as shown in fig 8 a for very dense sand only a small amount of strain is produced and no cyclic fluidity occurs as shown in fig 8 b as shown in fig 8 c the loose sand reaches peak strength and then collapses and flows rapidly toward the origin of the stress space showing a typical strain softening and contractive behavior however dense sand only shows strain hardening 4 coseismic behavior of suction bucket foundation 4 1 excess pore water pressure ratio response fig 9 a shows the excess pore water pressure ratio epwpr of the monitoring points a1 b1 and c1 in loose sand and dense sand on the whole the epwp accumulates with the development of the earthquake as shown in fig 9 the accumulation of epwp can be roughly divided into three stages whether inside or outside the suction bucket one is the rapid development stage of epwp about 0 10 s the second is the stage that epwp rises slowly about 10 15 s the third is the steady stage of epwp about 20 25 s however the epwpr of the suction bucket foundation in loose sand and dense sand is obviously different the epwpr of loose sand is significantly higher than that of dense sand the development rate is also faster than that of dense sand therefore loose sand is more likely to liquefy than dense sand a1 is located inside the suction bucket and b1 is located outside the suction bucket c1 is outside the influence range of the suction bucket and can be regarded as free soil it is observed that the development rate of epwpr is a1 b1 c1 the epwpr in the suction bucket is significantly lower than that in the external free field showing liquefaction resistance this phenomenon can be explained by a kinematic constraint mechanism the stiffness of the soil inside the suction bucket is enhanced by the constraint of the suction bucket the kinematic constraint caused by the large foundation stiffness can inhibit the shear strain in the soil inside the suction bucket thus the excess pore water pressure diminishes however the suction bucket experiences a dynamic response different from the surrounding soil and interacts with the surrounding soil during an earthquake due to the lack of restraint the soil near the bucket tip easily liquefy the time history of epwpr with different earthquakes is shown in fig 9 b the epwpr is positively correlated with the input seismic acceleration time the epwpr of loose sand is larger than that of dense sand under the same earthquake magnitude the greater the magnitude the greater the epwpr and the more likely the sand will liquefy the epwpr at different times and depths at point a are plotted in fig 10 the temporal and spatial distribution of epwpr inside the suction bucket in an earthquake is obtained as shown in fig 10 the epwpr of the loose sand and dense sand show strong space time characteristics when the depth of the loose sand and dense sand is less than 25 m and 15 m respectively the epwpr is accumulated with time it shows that the shallow part of the sand layer is easy to liquefy from the change of the epwpr with depth at a certain time it can be seen that epwpr is non linearly distributed along with the skirt with the increase of depth the epwpr gradually decreases the deeper the soil layer the less likely it is to liquefy however the depth of the suction bucket inserted into the seabed is only 10 m liquefaction occurs in the shallow part of loose sand epwpr 0 90 which may be disastrous for the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation the epwpr in the shallow part of dense sand is only about 0 6 and there is no liquefaction however the increase of epwp will reduce the effective stress and affect the bearing capacity of the suction bucket the generation and accumulation of epwp in the soil determine the tendency of soil liquefaction which determines the behavior of the suction bucket fig 11 presents the distribution of epwpr of loose sand and dense sand at different times the liquefaction of loose sand and dense sand occurred in different degrees and developed with time the liquefaction of loose sand is greater than dense sand at the same time and the final liquefaction depth is deeper the epwpr inside the bucket is significantly lower than that of the free sand at the same depth however the skirt of the suction bucket is very thin due to the concentrated stress at the skirt tip the shear stress increases and the epwpr increases which leads to liquefaction therefore attention should be paid to the soil near the skirt tip besides the shallow soil layer in the liquefaction remediation of the suction bucket foundation 4 2 acceleration response the acceleration time history at the top of the cylindrical table d and sand surface c0 are shown in fig 12 the acceleration of c0 can be divided into two stages one is the rapid development stage of acceleration which occurs at the beginning of the earthquake the second is the acceleration attenuation stage at this stage the surface of sand has been liquefied which attenuates the transmission of seismic waves however the acceleration of d does not show an obvious attenuation trend this shows that the soil under the suction bucket is not fully liquefied fig 13 shows the acceleration time history of dense sand and loose sand at different depths of point a below the suction bucket and point c free sand at the depths of 25 m and 35 m the acceleration responses of free sand c are similar to sand a under the bucket however the acceleration response of free sand attenuates obviously at the depth of 5 m and 0 m especially the acceleration of c0 rapidly decays to near 0 after 5 s the reason is that the sand of free field c0 will liquefy after 5 s with the accumulation of epwp which will filter and isolate seismic waves due to the constraints and additional loads of the suction bucket the acceleration attenuation of soil under the suction bucket a0 is smaller than that at the free field c0 compared with the free sand the sand in the suction bucket has an enhanced ability to resist liquefaction the transmission law of seismic waves in dense sand and loose sand also shows the obvious difference the depth of influence of the suction bucket in dense sand is small the time history of acceleration in dense sand under the bucket and free dense sand are inconsistent at 5 m above this value is 25 m above in loose sand there is little difference between the acceleration response of loose sand and dense sand in the deep depth the acceleration attenuation of loose sand is faster than that of the dense sand on the seabed surface the different acceleration responses of sand reflect the development of epwp in the earthquake to analyze the dynamic response of the suction bucket under the earthquake the acceleration response coefficient Œª is defined as the ratio of the maximum acceleration of the suction bucket column top to the maximum acceleration of input seismic wave the acceleration response coefficient of the suction bucket in loose sand is 1 37 while that in dense sand is 1 59 the acceleration response of the suction bucket in dense sand is 15 67 higher than that in loose sand the reason is that the loose sand is easier to liquefy than the dense sand and the pore water pressure has a damping effect on the development of acceleration however this is only an example under a specific condition the results are different at distinct input motion s frequency and the tower s natural frequency the parameters of foundation including material properties used in its construction the stiffness of the soil suction bucket aspect ratio and suction bucket mass have an effect on the system natural frequency fundamental frequencies of the foundation shifted to lower frequencies owing to softening associated with the increase of excess pore pressure manandhar et al 2021 besides the rate of generation of excess pore water pressure damping ratio increases with the increase of the frequency and the shear modulus in sand decreases with the increase of the frequency dash and sitharam 2016 in the design of the suction bucket foundation the amplification effect of different foundation soil on acceleration should be considered and checked to avoid overload of the rotor the damping effect caused by the development of epwp of different foundation soils should also be considered to avoid economic waste due to excessive safety factor if necessary the impact of frequency also needs to be evaluated 4 3 displacement and rotation of soil and wind turbine the earthquake and the highly nonlinear of soil will cause a permanent inclination of the wind turbine fig 14 shows the settlement of skirt tip of left l and right r column top d the soil under the suction bucket and soil at the free field in loose sand and dense sand during earthquakes the settlement of the suction bucket in loose sand is larger than that in dense sand the settlement of d a1 and c1 in loose sand is about 6 67 times 6 23 times and 3 49 times of that in dense sand respectively the suction bucket affected by horizontal seismic load shakes left and right and sinks continuously the settlement of the left skirt is less than that of the right skirt uneven settlement causes the overall rotation of owts the angle of the suction bucket can be calculated by the ratio of the settlement difference between the left and right sides of the bucket skirt and the diameter of the suction bucket the rotation angles of the bucket foundation in different simulations are shown in table 4 the angle of the suction bucket in loose sand is larger than that in dense sand under the same earthquake magnitude the difference of the angles of the suction bucket between loose sand and dense sand is significant with the increase of earthquake magnitude the angle of the suction bucket increases with the increase of earthquake magnitude the increasing trend is more obvious in loose sand compared with dense sand this phenomenon is explained by the influence of the larger pore ratio of loose sand and liquefaction the suction bucket appeared an angle of 0 068 in loose sand few people pay attention to the rotor displacement caused by the displacement of the foundation d h kim et al 2014 although this is not catastrophic it tends to reach the service limit at the early stage of the turbine kim et al 2014b owts are usually as high as 180 m even if the foundation has a small angle of 0 068 at the top of the owts the horizontal displacement is close to 0 21 m therefore there are strict requirements for foundation angle in offshore wind power code 0 5 in germany kuo et al 2009 0 25 for thornton bank wind farm in the uk peire et al 2009 and 0 17 in china zhu et al 2014 fig 15 shows the settlement of a1 for loose sand and dense sand under different magnitudes the settlement of loose sand is significantly greater than that of dense sand under the same magnitude the settlement also increases with the increase of earthquake magnitude the influence of the relative density of sand is greater than that of magnitude the sand density has a significant influence on the settlement control of the suction bucket foundation 5 failure mechanisms the variation law of displacement field during an earthquake is shown in fig 16 the failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation after liquefaction is revealed as shown in fig 19 at the beginning of the earthquake the suction bucket moves with the sand the influence on the sand displacement field is not obvious at this time the sliding displacement is smaller than the shaking displacement therefore shaking is the main failure mechanism the different magnitude of positive and negative accelerations of earthquakes produce different inertial forces the plastic deformation and liquefaction of sand will make the inertial force more significant the acceleration is transmitted to the suction bucket through the sand the suction bucket can not keep pace with the soil because of the different materials the suction bucket vibrates and applies horizontal and vertical moment loads on the adjacent sand when liquefaction occurs the degradation of soil strength results in a decrease in its resistance to deformation when the load is greater than the resistance provided by the soil the displacement and rotation will accumulate the entire sand moves asymmetrically and the liquefied sand moves laterally the suction bucket will rotate around the axis at the same time it also forces the sand around it to accumulate and move the soil in the suction bucket is restrained by the bucket skirt its lateral movement and rotation are limited and the soil is forced to settle vertically this displacement mechanism is similar to the flow of fluid around the piston without shear the suction bucket seems to squeeze out the liquefied soil under it and then the soil moves upward a failure mechanism of bearing capacity is triggered during earthquakes the development of the pore water pressure has an important influence on the failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation the earthquake induced shear stress produces the deviatoric strain in soil the volumetric strain caused by pore water pressure gives rise to the settlement of the foundations the water migrates in the seabed foundation and causes a small local volumetric strain during the earthquake with the increase of pore water pressure the soil skeleton is destroyed and the upper soil begins to liquefy the soil strength decreases and the soil particles are redistributed the deviatoric strain plays an important role near the suction bucket the extra static shear stress added by owts aggravates the strength loss of soil and leads to the settlement and inclination of the suction bucket the cyclic shear stress due to earthquakes and the interaction of the soil and the bucket result in the accumulation of settlement the increase of local pore water pressure will accelerate this process the epwpr time history and strain time history of the soil element 1 near the suction bucket tip and the free soil element 2 at the same depth are shown in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively they can reveal the failure mechanisms of the suction bucket foundation the epwpr near the suction bucket tip shows a strong fluctuation than that at the free field the fluctuation of the epwpr exactly corresponds to the uplift and settlement of the suction bucket tip during the earthquake the reason is that the periodic uplift and settlement of the suction bucket in the earthquake cause the disturbance of the soil near the tip the strain of the soil at the suction bucket tip accumulates continuously and is obviously larger than that at the free field compared with the soil in the free field the soil under the suction bucket tip is greatly disturbed due to the lifting and sinking of the suction bucket when the acceleration is in the x direction positive the suction bucket moves to the right and rotates clockwise due to inertia local compression leads to the increase of pore pressure the increased shear force is carried by the soil below the right edge as a result the soil becomes weaker there is no obvious resistance to liquefaction inevitably it moves outward laterally pushing along the fully liquefied soil in the free field forming a passive zone and allowing the suction bucket to settle the local drainage of the rising pore pressure may be the potential reason for the increase of settlement on the right side of the foundation the left edge of the skirt moves up to unload the unsettled area below it and reduce the pore water pressure when the soil in the free field moves to the bucket skirt it will encounter the bucket skirt and the area of increasing effective stress the region was unable to push forward and was forced to move up in this case the periodic shear force exerted by the foundation plays a leading role in driving local soil displacement it can be realized that footing settlements develop due to a newmark type sliding block mechanism rather than densification of the sand when the acceleration is in the negative x direction negative the foundation repeats the opposite motion generally speaking the settlement of the suction bucket is mainly driven by the extensional failure mechanism in each half cycle a large amount of soil under the suction bucket accumulates vertical displacement because of the loss of lateral support of the surrounding soil with this mechanism the local volume strain due to drainage also increases the displacement the uplift of the opposite edge of the foundation disturbed the soil under the foundation it causes the next round of load at this location to cause more settlement this mechanism leads to the accumulated uneven settlement of the suction bucket foundation 6 conclusions the behavior of the suction bucket foundation of owts located in liquefiable sand under earthquakes was studied using three dimensional soil water fully coupling fe fd code an advanced elasto plastic constitutive model was used for sand the dynamic spatial temporal development of epwp acceleration displacement and rotation of the suction bucket foundation under different earthquake magnitude and sand type were investigated the following conclusions were drawn 1 based on the elasto plastic constitutive model which describes the liquefaction of sand and the fe fd method the liquefaction of the seabed around the suction bucket foundation can be accurately described the generation and accumulation of epwp in the seabed determines the tendency of seabed liquefaction which determines the behavior of the suction bucket 2 the distribution of epwpr of the suction bucket foundation shows strong space time characteristics epwp accumulates over time and decreases nonlinearly with depth the epwpr inside the suction bucket is significantly lower than that in the free field at the same height as for the epwpr distribution inside the suction bucket a high pore water pressure appears near the top cap and the skirt tip which reduces the effective stress and affects the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation 3 the development of acceleration under the suction bucket was different from that of free soil due to the influence of epwp the acceleration of free soil gradually attenuates to 0 in the shallow soil while it decayed little under the suction bucket in the design of the suction bucket foundation the amplification effect of different soil on acceleration should be checked the damping effect caused by the development of epwp in different soil should be considered to avoid economic loss caused by an excessive safety factor 4 the failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation after liquefaction was revealed uneven settlement occurred in the earthquake because of the asymmetry of seismic load and plastic accumulation of the soil furthermore liquefaction occurs at the seabed shallow and increased the inclination of the foundation the earthquake can cause the inclination of the suction bucket foundation to reach 40 of the safety threshold seriously affecting the safe operation of owts the actual marine environment is much more complicated than the factors considered in this paper such as geological conditions wind waves and currents however the interaction between factors makes it difficult to distinguish the effects of the factors of concern the results show that the tilt of the wind turbine is likely to occur in earthquakes even without considering other loads there are few seismic design codes for the suction bucket foundation of owts the design standard of the suction bucket should be improved especially in the north sea of europe and the chinese offshore where earthquakes are active and the seabed is prone to liquefaction further research on seismic analysis and safety assessment of the suction bucket foundation must be carried out data availability statement all data models and code generated or used
