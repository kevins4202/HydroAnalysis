3175,groundwater discharge in downstream regions along the river continuum is considered a significant source of water and nutrients however the influence of groundwater discharge on the net export flux of surface water and nutrients from tideless rivers to coastal seas has not been thoroughly assessed we conducted field surveys in the downstream region of six tideless rivers with different watershed properties along the ria coast of wakasa bay in the sea of japan during the summer mass balance models of water salt and 222rn were constructed to determine groundwater fluxes and associated fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus the model revealed that groundwater discharge ranged from 0 08 to 3 89 m d 1 accounting for 1 3 14 8 of the export flux this variability among the rivers correlated with the riverbed slope in each river indicating that the local topographic gradient was a significant factor controlling groundwater surface water exchange in tideless rivers groundwater discharge accounted for 0 8 16 7 of the nitrogen export and 0 9 27 4 of the phosphorus export to coastal seas we concluded that the groundwater inflow driven by the hydrological and geographic properties of the watershed in the downstream region of tideless rivers was nonnegligible for nutrient dynamics and biological production in the coastal seas keywords groundwater river nitrogen phosphorus radon data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface waters such as rivers and creeks are a primary pathway of fresh water and materials inorganic and organic components from land to seas buoyancy driven by freshwater regulates physical conditions such as stratification and vertical mixing in coastal seas horner devine et al 2015 land derived nitrogen and phosphorus delivery through surface water affects nutrient cycles and biological production in coastal seas dagg et al 2004 therefore it is essential to quantify the riverine flux of water and materials from land to coastal seas groundwater discharge to surface waters in downstream regions along the river continuum is considered a significant source of nutrients in surface river water and affects net nutrient export from the surface water to coastal seas adyasari et al 2018 mckenzie et al 2019 sadat noori et al 2016 the quantitative contribution of groundwater to the export of surface water is estimated to be 2 30 in downstream regions david et al 2019 sadat noori et al 2015 schwartz 2003 previous field studies in tidal rivers and estuarine systems have revealed the importance of groundwater surface water exchange gse driven by tidal fluctuations on water and nutrient dynamics in surface waters makings et al 2014 musial et al 2016 peterson et al 2010 a simulation model of terrestrial groundwater dynamics showed that the hydraulic gradient is the primary driver of groundwater discharge along the coastline especially in areas with a steep topography luijendijk et al 2020 michael et al 2013 shuler et al 2020 however in tideless rivers the effects of gse on nutrient dynamics in surface water and subsequent export fluxes of riverine nutrients to coastal seas are still unclear the ria coast in the central part of japan facing the sea of japan wakasa bay fig 1 is a major region of groundwater discharge from the japanese archipelago to surrounding coastal seas ito and marui 2010 the mountainous topography of the watershed and high annual precipitation 2000 mm yr 1 provoke significant direct groundwater discharge into the coastal area of wakasa bay kobayashi et al 2017 sugimoto et al 2016 an upward flux of groundwater into surface river waters occurs in the downstream region of the two watersheds kita and minami rivers obama city 2017 although the tidal range in wakasa bay is small 20 cm nishida 1980 sea level rise driven by the seawater expansion in the summer season provokes seawater intrusion as a salt wedge into several rivers where the river bed gradient is low along the western coast of wakasa bay e g kasai et al 2010 watanabe et al 2014 yatsuya et al 2012 however the quantitative effects of gse on the riverine surface export of water and nutrients have not yet been assessed in a tideless river system we hypothesized that the effects of gse on riverine surface export fluxes of water nitrogen and phosphorus from the downstream region to the tideless coastal sea differ depending on the watershed properties such as mean altitude and riverbed slope we conducted longitudinal surveys in the downstream region of the six rivers with different watershed properties along the coast of wakasa bay a mass balance approach using radon 222 222rn was applied to quantify the effects of gse on surface water fluxes because 222rn is enriched in groundwater relative to surface water burnett et al 2006 unland et al 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions we carried out a field survey in the downstream region 3 5 km from the river mouth of the six rivers shono river mimi river kita river minami river isazu river and ote river flowing into the tideless wakasa bay japan fig 1 the region has a temperate climate with a clear seasonal cycle of air temperatures ranging from 4 c in january to 27 c in august the catchment area of the six rivers ranges from 28 0 to 215 3 km2 and they have similar land use proportions 82 1 93 1 forest land 2 5 10 5 paddy fields and 1 8 6 7 residential area table 1 the maximum length of each river from the headwater to the sea is 32 4 km the riverbed slopes along a longitudinal section varying from 0 1 to 0 7 in the downstream region 2 2 sampling during the summer season in 2020 we collected river water samples at five stations from the river mouth stn 5 to the upstream site stn 1 3 5 km from the river mouth in the six rivers surface water samples were taken for analysis of 222rn nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations we collected bottom water at the same stations where seawater intrusion was prominent salinity 1 surface water samples of all tributaries n 0 for the mimi river and minami river 1 for the ote river and 2 for the shono kita and isazu rivers flowing into the downstream region were also collected water temperature and salinity were measured using a portable salinity meter ysi pro30 xylem rye brook ny usa water velocity temperature and salinity at each site were vertically measured using an electromagnetic current meter aem213 d jfe advantech co ltd tokyo japan attached with a conductivity and temperature logger defi2 ct jfe advantech co ltd at shallower sites 0 7 m we measured the water velocity using a propeller current meter vr 301 kenek tokyo japan water velocity at the upstream sites stn 1 was used to calculate the upstream water flux fig 2 while the velocity of the surface layer 1 m of water depth at other sites stns 2 5 was used to calculate 222rn evasion from the surface water to the atmosphere we estimated the halocline depth based on a vertical salinity profile at stations where seawater intrusion was prominent groundwater and offshore seawater in each river were collected as endmembers groundwater samples in each river n 4 6 were collected from wells springs and riverbeds to collect shallow groundwater under riverbeds we inserted a piezometer to a depth of 80 cm and then purged the water using a peristaltic pump until it replaced the groundwater we collected high salinity 32 offshore seawater using a submersible pump from a boat or seaward extending embankment at each station water samples for 222rn were filled in gas tight bottles 1 5 l for surface river water 500 ml for groundwater and 7 l for seawater which were immediately sealed to avoid gas loss for dissolved inorganic nutrients no2 no3 nh4 and po4 3 total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp water samples were immediately filtered through syringe filters cellulose acetate membrane 0 8 μm pore size jfe advantec co ltd and aliquoted into polypropylene pp bottles unfiltered water was kept in pp bottles for analysis of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp the water samples were stored at 25 c until analysis to evaluate the sedimentary properties of the river bed surface sediment 30 cm was collected using a liner sampler dik 110c daiki rika kogyo co ltd saitama japan ekman dredge or shovel at each station in the six rivers then we measured the grain size of sediment samples by sieve method and evaluated the diameter of the largest 10 of particles on a cumulative grain size distribution curve d10 mm 2 3 chemical analysis nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and phosphate po4 3 concentrations were measured using an autoanalyzer quaatro 2 hr or quaatro39 bran luebbe norderstedt germany the ammonium nh4 concentration was measured fluorometrically using the orthophthaldialdehyde opa method holmes et al 1999 with a trilogy fluorometer turner designs sunnyvale ca usa the tdn and tdp concentrations were measured via wet oxidation with potassium persulfate quaatro 2 hr or quaatro39 bran luebbe we defined the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din as the sum of no2 no3 and nh4 and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip as po4 3 dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop were calculated as the differences between tdn and din and tdp and dip respectively the 222rn activity was immediately analyzed after sampling using an electronic radon detector rad7 durridge inc billerica ma usa at room temperature the 222rn in the bottles was aerated for 1 h through a closed loop connected to the rad7 and 222rn in the equilibrated air was then analyzed at least 10 times at 30 min intervals then we calculated 222rn activity in water based on measurement temperature and salinity using the durridgetm capture software the effect of 222rn activity decay was adjusted for based on the 222rn decay constant λ222 0 181 d 1 and time elapsed between sampling and analysis 2 4 watershed and geomorphological analysis topographic properties catchment area river length mean altitude and slope and land use in each river basin and in the downstream region were determined using a geographic information system

with water and salt in estuaries and coastal seas peterson et al 2009 santos et al 2010 sugimoto et al 2016 to quantify groundwater flux fig 2 the equations for the mass balance models in each river were as follows 1 qup qtri qgw qwb qex 2 qupsup qtristri qgwsgw qwbswb qexsex 3 quprnup qtrirntri qgwrngw qwbrnwb fdiff a 226raλv qexrnex fatm a rnλv where qup qtri qgw and qwb are the inflows of

wakasa bay seawater respectively rnex was averaged value of four downstream stations in the shono and minami river there is a weir within the downstream region because aeration through the weir usually provokes 222rn loss from surface water to the atmosphere we measured 222rn activity in surface river water before and after the weir to adjust for its effects on 222rn activity 226ra is the mean 226ra activity of downstream water bq m 3 fatm is the 222rn evasion flux from the surface water to the atmosphere bq m 2 d 1 fdiff is the diffusive 222rn flux from sediment bq m 2 d 1 a is the surface area m2 and v is the water volume m3 the decay loss of 222rn rnλv is calculated by multiplying the mean 222rn activity decay constant of 222rn λ 0 181 d 1 and v fatm relies on the 222rn

when u 3 6 m s 1 turner et al 1996 in eq 5 we converted the wind velocity of the local meteorological stations fig 1 to that at 10 m height using the following equation amorocho and devries 1980 7 u

surface drag coefficient for wind at 10 m height 1 3 10 3 and k is the von karman constant 0 41 in eq 6 w and d denote the water velocity cm s 1 and water depth m respectively we interpolated the mean water velocity of the surface layer into w following the method used by makings et al 2014 fatm was summed and the 222rn evasion flux driven by wind fatm wind and current fatm current was then used in the 222rn mass balance model this model does not include the diffusive 222rn flux from sediments fdiff a or 222rn inputs through 226ra decay 226raλv the former term is likely minor because surface sediment in each downstream region were majorly gravel table 1 the latter term often has a negligible influence on the 222rn mass balance 1 of 222rn sources as suggested for other estuaries e g jeffrey et al 2016 sadat noori et al 2015 in the mimi river an inflow of seawater was not observed at the most downstream site stn 5 qwb 0 because the water depth at stn 5 was shallow 0 4 m we quantified qex using the water velocity river width and depth 2 6 nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from upstream water tributary water groundwater and the offshore seawater of wakasa bay were calculated by multiplying qup qtri qgw and qwb by the mean concentration respectively the export flux of downstream river water was calculated by multiplying qex by the spatially averaged concentration at the four downstream stations except for the mimi river where the export flux was calculated by multiplying qex by the concentration at the most downstream site stn 5 3 results 3 1 physicochemical propertiesof river water and groundwater the water temperature in the six rivers ranged from 20 3 to 30 4 c fig 3 a the mean temperature of the surface river water was lowest in the mimi river 21 0 0 8 c and highest in the ote river 27 9 2 2 c salinity in the surface waters was lower than 5 0 in all rivers although in bottom waters it ranged from 0 to 32 2 fig 3b the extent of seawater intrusion was 2 km from the river mouth the 222rn activity in surface waters was higher than in bottom waters in all rivers the highest activities were found at the most upstream sites stn 1 in the shono kita and minami rivers while the 222rn activity in the mimi isazu and ote rivers was highest at the most downstream site stn 5 fig 3c the 222rn activity in the minami river showed a particularly prominent increasing trend from 2 0 km upstream to the river mouth fig 3c the tn concentrations in the surface waters were higher than in the bottom waters in all rivers fig 3d the din accounted for 80 of the tn in the surface waters and 38 in the bottom waters the mean tn concentrations in surface water ranged from 17 0 2 3 μmol l 1 in the minami river to 35 6 1 6 μmol l 1 in the mimi river except for the minami river tn concentrations in the surface waters were higher at the lower stations fig 3d the mean tp concentrations in the surface waters ranged from 0 4 0 0 μmol l 1 in the mimi river to 1 7 0 8 μmol l 1 in the isazu river the dip in the isazu river accounted for 39 100 of the tp and was dominant in the tp 70 in other rivers in contrast to the tn the mean tp concentrations in the bottom waters exceeded those in the surface waters in some rivers shono kita minami and ote rivers the spatial variability of tp concentrations in surface waters in the shono mimi and kita rivers was small cv 18 and those in the isazu river and minami river displayed decreasing and increasing trends toward the river mouths respectively in groundwater the mean 222rn activity varied in each river with a minimum of 5508 4159 mean standard deviation bq m 3 in the ote river and a maximum of 27942 23954 bq m 3 in the shono river table s1 these values were 8 fold higher than those in the surface water samples the mean tn and tp concentrations in groundwater samples ranged from 14 9 to 54 5 μmol l 1 and 0 5 to 8 0 μmol l 1 respectively the din and dip concentrations accounted for 87 and 55 of tn and tp respectively 3 2 the 222rn budgets the 222rn budgets of the downstream region in each river are shown in table s2 the major 222rn sources in each river were upstream river water 39 87 and groundwater 6 56 tributaries and offshore seawater supplied 7 of the 222rn export flux was the most significant sink 56 93 of all sinks the 222rn loss by atmospheric evasion was 2 12 by the wind and 13 40 by the current current driven evasion was more significant than wind driven evasion in all rivers the decay of 222rn was negligible in the models of each river 2 3 3 upstream water and export fluxes the inputs of upstream water qup ranged from a minimum of 6 0 104 m3 d 1 in the ote river to a maximum of 93 6 104 m3 d 1 in the mimi river fig 4 the variability in qup among rivers was correlated with the mean altitude of each watershed r 2 0 79 p 0 02 the export fluxes qex to wakasa bay ranged from 19 7 104 m3 d 1 in the ote river to 114 1 104 m3 d 1 in the minami river except for the minami river qex was determined by qup r 2 0 96 p 0 002 in the shono mimi kita and isazu rivers qup to qex were the major contributors 67 while their contribution in the minami and ote rivers was 50 the upstream inputs of tn ranged from 1 1 103 mol d 1 in the ote river to 32 4 103 mol d 1 in the mimi river the exports of tn ranged from 3 3 103 mol d 1 in the ote river to 36 5 103 mol d 1 in the mimi river table 2 the upstream input and export fluxes of tn were mainly composed of din 65 the upstream inputs of tp ranged from 52 4 mol d 1 in the ote river to 571 2 mol d 1 in the isazu river and export fluxes of tp to wakasa bay ranged from 179 4 mol d 1 in the ote river to 873 3 mol d 1 in the minami river the upstream input of tp was mainly dip 79 except for the isazu river 39 3 the export fluxes of tp in the shono mimi and kita rivers were primarily comprised of dip 75 while in the other rivers approximately 50 of the export fluxes were dip 3 4 groundwater fluxes the groundwater fluxes qgw were 3 8 104 m3 d 1 0 45 m d 1 in the shono river 16 3 104 m3 d 1 3 89 m d 1 in the mimi river 0 8 104 m3 d 1 0 08 m d 1 in the kita river 4 6 104 m3 d 1 0 47 m d 1 in the minami river 2 3 104 m3 d 1 0 37 m d 1 in the isazu river and 0 6 104 m3 d 1 0 17 m d 1 in the ote river fig 4 and table s2 site variability normalized groundwater flux divided by the surface area was correlated with the upstream input per catchment area r 2 0 98 p 0 001 regarding the water budgets qgw accounted for 4 7 of the export water flux in the shono river with corresponding values of 14 8 in the mimi river 1 3 in the kita river 4 0 in the minami river 6 6 in the isazu river and 3 1 in the ote river the groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes varied from a minimum of 0 1 103 and 4 0 mol d 1 respectively in the kita river to a maximum of 6 1 103 and 96 3 mol d 1 respectively in the mimi river table 2 the site differences in both fluxes were determined by qgw r 2 0 99 p 0 001 except for tp in the ote river most of the groundwater derived tn 76 and tp 99 fluxes were mainly comprised of no2 no3 and dip except for the ote river no2 no3 43 3 of tn and dip 55 9 of tp table 2 the contribution of the groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes to the export fluxes ranged from 0 8 to 16 7 for tn and 0 9 to 27 4 for tp indicating that groundwater inflow was a nonnegligible nutrient source 3 5 tributary water fluxes the water fluxes from the tributary qtri ranged from 1 3 104 m3 d 1 in the ote river to 21 5 104 m3 d 1 in the shono river and the maximum contribution to export flux was 27 1 in the shono river fig 4 the qtri in each river determined the fluxes of tn and tp from tributary water r 2 0 98 p 0 01 the dominant form of tn 75 was no2 no3 except in the ote river 33 7 while dip accounted for 89 of tp in the shono and isazu rivers and 50 of tp in the kita and ote rivers table 2 3 6 offshore seawater fluxes the contributions of qwb in the shono and mimi rivers were 1 while in the minami and ote rivers the contributions were more than 50 fig 4 the site difference in qwb determined the fluxes of tn and tp from wakasa bay to each river r 2 0 98 p 0 001 the primary form of tn was don in all rivers 46 fig 5 and table 2 while for tp it was dip 42 except in the minami and ote rivers 20 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties in the 222rn mass balance model the parameters used in the 222rn mass balance model introduced uncertainties in the estimation of groundwater flux fig 4 the estimation of 222rn activity in groundwater can be subject to significant uncertainties we used the mean 222rn activity values for various kinds of fresh groundwater including shallow wells springs and riverbeds around each river table s1 based on the coefficient of variation cv the level of uncertainty in the qgw estimate was 86 for the shono river 129 for the mimi river 29 for the kita river 28 for the minami river 85 for the isazu river and 65 for the ote river the 222rn activity in groundwater under the riverbed had a tendency to be lower than that of wells and springs table s1 if the fresh groundwater in the riverbed dominated the groundwater inflows into surface river water the contribution of qgw to the export flux increased by up to 1 4 in the kita river 4 3 in the minami river and 13 3 in the isazu river the 222rn evasion driven by the wind and current accounted for 2 12 and 13 40 of the 222rn budget respectively table s2 although we used the average wind speed measured at meteorological weather stations and the average surface water current measured using current meters in a field survey the cv values were up to 80 for wind and 87 for current the variations of mean qgw in each river resulted in ranges from 3 to 58 for wind and 13 to 356 for current the uncertainty of the qgw was calculated by the propagation of errors technique table s2 the uncertainties of the qgw depending on groundwater end member and 222rn evasion were 87 in the shono river 314 in the kita river 31 in the minami river 104 in the isazu river and 68 in the ote river the uncertainty of the qgw propagated to the estimates of groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes they had large uncertainties of 65 323 for tn and 31 315 for tp the large cv values of 222rn activity collected from various groundwaters i e shallow wells springs and riverbed in each river as well as qgw contributed to the uncertainties of tn and tp fluxes although the assumption of catm 0 bq m 3 for the empirical model of atmospheric evasion also introduced uncertainty the variations of mean qgw in each river were less than 3 even if we adopted the catm value of 4 7 bq m 3 measured in july 2020 near the kita river 4 2 significance of groundwater input the groundwater flux and the contribution thereof to export water flux varied among the rivers fig 4 the positive correlation between groundwater flux and upstream input r 2 0 74 p 0 03 among the rivers suggested that watershed properties such as mean altitude and catchment area might affect the upstream input as well as the magnitude of groundwater flux in each river the different physical properties of the sediment in each river table 1 may also be responsible for the variability of the effects of gse among sites we evaluated the contribution of groundwater according to potential controlling factors such as geomorphological features slope in the longitudinal section and cross section area of the catchment and sediment size denoted by d10 using the multiple linear regression analysis the contribution of groundwater flux to export flux was well explained by the geomorphological features among the rivers r 2 0 99 p 0 001 the most important parameter was the slope in the longitudinal section t 17 64 p 0 036 the sediment size t 7 078 p 0 089 was also important factors while the area of the catchment t 5 059 p 0 12 and the slope in the cross section t 1 624 p 0 35 were minor table s3 this suggested that the topographic gradient was a major factor controlling the gse in tideless rivers the mass balance model revealed that groundwater flux accounted for 1 3 14 8 of the export water flux fig 4 the groundwater flux normalized by the surface area in the six rivers ranged from a minimum of 0 08 to a maximum of 3 89 m d 1 comparable with previous estimates obtained from tidal rivers and estuaries in temperate and tropical coastal regions 0 01 3 90 m d 1 table s4 these estimates were 102 times higher than those of the global coastline 6 3 10 4 m d 1 luijendijk et al 2020 and the japanese archipelago coastline 1 1 10 4 m d 1 ito and marui 2010 especially in the kita and minami rivers the sum of both qgw 5 3 104 m3 d 1 corresponds to 15 of the annual mean of fresh groundwater discharge in obama bay 36 0 104 m3 d 1 sugimoto et al 2016 fig 1b these results suggest that significant groundwater discharge in downstream regions before reaching coastal seas is a non negligible source for coastal ecosystem however the groundwater flux varies with hydrological conditions santos et al 2010 considering the large temporal variability of river discharge in the watersheds kobayashi et al 2017 sugimoto and tsuboi 2017 further study is necessary to understand the impacts of seasonal and flooding on the gse and subsequent export flux to the coastal sea 4 3 importance of groundwater derived nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes from groundwater to surface water accounted for approximately 8 0 8 16 7 of the tn and 10 0 9 27 4 of the tp in the export fluxes to coastal seas respectively table 2 the contributions of groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes to the export flux of each river except the ote river were positively correlated to the groundwater flux normalized by surface area r 2 0 87 p 0 02 this suggests that the greater contribution of groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes to export fluxes was due to the increased potential groundwater flux although groundwater flux in the ote river contributed 3 of the export flux the groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes increased to 10 and 27 respectively fig 4 and table 2 the inconsistency in the contributions of water and materials was due to the enrichment of tn and tp in groundwater under the riverbed because the concentration of groundwater to surface river water ratio was 3 3 for tn and 8 8 for tp moreover the tn mean 54 5 µmol l 1 and tp mean 8 0 µmol l 1 concentrations in the groundwater of the ote river were higher than in other rivers table s1 notably there was a higher proportion of nh4 in the tdn mean 49 in the groundwater in the ote river which has fine sediments and a lower dissolved oxygen do compared to the other rivers tables 1 and s1 these results implied that the accumulation of regenerated nitrogen and phosphorus within the sediments may have been responsible for the large contribution of groundwater to riverine tn and tp export in the ote river nitrogen speciation of tdn in surface river water is a crucial regulator of primary production in coastal seas our observations revealed that 65 of the tdn in surface river water and groundwater was din especially no2 no3 fig 5 and tables 2 s1 the contribution of groundwater derived no2 no3 to the tdn export flux 0 6 18 2 mean 7 1 was more significant than that of nh4 0 0 5 4 mean 1 0 and don 0 0 0 9 mean 0 3 in subtropical tidal estuaries don and nh4 dominate tdn export from the surface water ca 66 98 with no2 no3 making smaller contribution 34 sadat noori et al 2016 santos et al 2013 in general din no2 no3 and nh4 is immediately utilized by the primary producer the dominant input of bioavailable din mainly no2 no3 rather than don through groundwater in tideless rivers would likely stimulate primary productivity in this coastal region the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio of the export flux is also important for controlling primary production and community structure of phytoplankton in coastal seas in this study we observed that mean n p ratios in surface river water 18 and groundwater 29 of each river were higher than the redfield ratios 16 redfield 1963 apart from groundwater in the ote river 7 table s5 considering lower n p ratios 8 14 at offshore seawater in each river the input of n enriched groundwater into surface waters may sustain higher primary production in the coastal region 5 conclusions this study highlighted that groundwater discharge in tideless rivers along a ria coast enhanced the export fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus thus groundwater derived nutrients were a nonnegligible nutrient source for biological production in coastal seas the watershed properties such as mean altitude and catchment area were related to the magnitude of groundwater flux in each river in contrast site variability in the contribution of the groundwater flux to the export flux was due to the riverbed slope in the downstream region indicating that a higher topographic gradient at the local scale increases the relative importance of groundwater for surface riverine export flux from tideless rivers we concluded that the gse in tideless rivers strongly influences the riverine export fluxes of water and nutrients to coastal seas in contrast to tidal rivers nutrients supplied by groundwater through the riverbed near the river mouth might have been overlooked in tideless and steep rivers with mountainous topography along ria coasts and fjords further evaluation at the land ocean boundary area is needed to accurately estimate nutrient fluxes worldwide from the

3175,groundwater discharge in downstream regions along the river continuum is considered a significant source of water and nutrients however the influence of groundwater discharge on the net export flux of surface water and nutrients from tideless rivers to coastal seas has not been thoroughly assessed we conducted field surveys in the downstream region of six tideless rivers with different watershed properties along the ria coast of wakasa bay in the sea of japan during the summer mass balance models of water salt and 222rn were constructed to determine groundwater fluxes and associated fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus the model revealed that groundwater discharge ranged from 0 08 to 3 89 m d 1 accounting for 1 3 14 8 of the export flux this variability among the rivers correlated with the riverbed slope in each river indicating that the local topographic gradient was a significant factor controlling groundwater surface water exchange in tideless rivers groundwater discharge accounted for 0 8 16 7 of the nitrogen export and 0 9 27 4 of the phosphorus export to coastal seas we concluded that the groundwater inflow driven by the hydrological and geographic properties of the watershed in the downstream region of tideless rivers was nonnegligible for nutrient dynamics and biological production in the coastal seas keywords groundwater river nitrogen phosphorus radon data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface waters such as rivers and creeks are a primary pathway of fresh water and materials inorganic and organic components from land to seas buoyancy driven by freshwater regulates physical conditions such as stratification and vertical mixing in coastal seas horner devine et al 2015 land derived nitrogen and phosphorus delivery through surface water affects nutrient cycles and biological production in coastal seas dagg et al 2004 therefore it is essential to quantify the riverine flux of water and materials from land to coastal seas groundwater discharge to surface waters in downstream regions along the river continuum is considered a significant source of nutrients in surface river water and affects net nutrient export from the surface water to coastal seas adyasari et al 2018 mckenzie et al 2019 sadat noori et al 2016 the quantitative contribution of groundwater to the export of surface water is estimated to be 2 30 in downstream regions david et al 2019 sadat noori et al 2015 schwartz 2003 previous field studies in tidal rivers and estuarine systems have revealed the importance of groundwater surface water exchange gse driven by tidal fluctuations on water and nutrient dynamics in surface waters makings et al 2014 musial et al 2016 peterson et al 2010 a simulation model of terrestrial groundwater dynamics showed that the hydraulic gradient is the primary driver of groundwater discharge along the coastline especially in areas with a steep topography luijendijk et al 2020 michael et al 2013 shuler et al 2020 however in tideless rivers the effects of gse on nutrient dynamics in surface water and subsequent export fluxes of riverine nutrients to coastal seas are still unclear the ria coast in the central part of japan facing the sea of japan wakasa bay fig 1 is a major region of groundwater discharge from the japanese archipelago to surrounding coastal seas ito and marui 2010 the mountainous topography of the watershed and high annual precipitation 2000 mm yr 1 provoke significant direct groundwater discharge into the coastal area of wakasa bay kobayashi et al 2017 sugimoto et al 2016 an upward flux of groundwater into surface river waters occurs in the downstream region of the two watersheds kita and minami rivers obama city 2017 although the tidal range in wakasa bay is small 20 cm nishida 1980 sea level rise driven by the seawater expansion in the summer season provokes seawater intrusion as a salt wedge into several rivers where the river bed gradient is low along the western coast of wakasa bay e g kasai et al 2010 watanabe et al 2014 yatsuya et al 2012 however the quantitative effects of gse on the riverine surface export of water and nutrients have not yet been assessed in a tideless river system we hypothesized that the effects of gse on riverine surface export fluxes of water nitrogen and phosphorus from the downstream region to the tideless coastal sea differ depending on the watershed properties such as mean altitude and riverbed slope we conducted longitudinal surveys in the downstream region of the six rivers with different watershed properties along the coast of wakasa bay a mass balance approach using radon 222 222rn was applied to quantify the effects of gse on surface water fluxes because 222rn is enriched in groundwater relative to surface water burnett et al 2006 unland et al 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions we carried out a field survey in the downstream region 3 5 km from the river mouth of the six rivers shono river mimi river kita river minami river isazu river and ote river flowing into the tideless wakasa bay japan fig 1 the region has a temperate climate with a clear seasonal cycle of air temperatures ranging from 4 c in january to 27 c in august the catchment area of the six rivers ranges from 28 0 to 215 3 km2 and they have similar land use proportions 82 1 93 1 forest land 2 5 10 5 paddy fields and 1 8 6 7 residential area table 1 the maximum length of each river from the headwater to the sea is 32 4 km the riverbed slopes along a longitudinal section varying from 0 1 to 0 7 in the downstream region 2 2 sampling during the summer season in 2020 we collected river water samples at five stations from the river mouth stn 5 to the upstream site stn 1 3 5 km from the river mouth in the six rivers surface water samples were taken for analysis of 222rn nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations we collected bottom water at the same stations where seawater intrusion was prominent salinity 1 surface water samples of all tributaries n 0 for the mimi river and minami river 1 for the ote river and 2 for the shono kita and isazu rivers flowing into the downstream region were also collected water temperature and salinity were measured using a portable salinity meter ysi pro30 xylem rye brook ny usa water velocity temperature and salinity at each site were vertically measured using an electromagnetic current meter aem213 d jfe advantech co ltd tokyo japan attached with a conductivity and temperature logger defi2 ct jfe advantech co ltd at shallower sites 0 7 m we measured the water velocity using a propeller current meter vr 301 kenek tokyo japan water velocity at the upstream sites stn 1 was used to calculate the upstream water flux fig 2 while the velocity of the surface layer 1 m of water depth at other sites stns 2 5 was used to calculate 222rn evasion from the surface water to the atmosphere we estimated the halocline depth based on a vertical salinity profile at stations where seawater intrusion was prominent groundwater and offshore seawater in each river were collected as endmembers groundwater samples in each river n 4 6 were collected from wells springs and riverbeds to collect shallow groundwater under riverbeds we inserted a piezometer to a depth of 80 cm and then purged the water using a peristaltic pump until it replaced the groundwater we collected high salinity 32 offshore seawater using a submersible pump from a boat or seaward extending embankment at each station water samples for 222rn were filled in gas tight bottles 1 5 l for surface river water 500 ml for groundwater and 7 l for seawater which were immediately sealed to avoid gas loss for dissolved inorganic nutrients no2 no3 nh4 and po4 3 total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp water samples were immediately filtered through syringe filters cellulose acetate membrane 0 8 μm pore size jfe advantec co ltd and aliquoted into polypropylene pp bottles unfiltered water was kept in pp bottles for analysis of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp the water samples were stored at 25 c until analysis to evaluate the sedimentary properties of the river bed surface sediment 30 cm was collected using a liner sampler dik 110c daiki rika kogyo co ltd saitama japan ekman dredge or shovel at each station in the six rivers then we measured the grain size of sediment samples by sieve method and evaluated the diameter of the largest 10 of particles on a cumulative grain size distribution curve d10 mm 2 3 chemical analysis nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and phosphate po4 3 concentrations were measured using an autoanalyzer quaatro 2 hr or quaatro39 bran luebbe norderstedt germany the ammonium nh4 concentration was measured fluorometrically using the orthophthaldialdehyde opa method holmes et al 1999 with a trilogy fluorometer turner designs sunnyvale ca usa the tdn and tdp concentrations were measured via wet oxidation with potassium persulfate quaatro 2 hr or quaatro39 bran luebbe we defined the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din as the sum of no2 no3 and nh4 and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip as po4 3 dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop were calculated as the differences between tdn and din and tdp and dip respectively the 222rn activity was immediately analyzed after sampling using an electronic radon detector rad7 durridge inc billerica ma usa at room temperature the 222rn in the bottles was aerated for 1 h through a closed loop connected to the rad7 and 222rn in the equilibrated air was then analyzed at least 10 times at 30 min intervals then we calculated 222rn activity in water based on measurement temperature and salinity using the durridgetm capture software the effect of 222rn activity decay was adjusted for based on the 222rn decay constant λ222 0 181 d 1 and time elapsed between sampling and analysis 2 4 watershed and geomorphological

with water and salt in estuaries and coastal seas peterson et al 2009 santos et al 2010 sugimoto et al 2016 to quantify groundwater flux fig 2 the equations for the mass balance models in each river

wakasa bay seawater respectively rnex was averaged value of four downstream stations in the shono and minami river there is a weir within the downstream region because aeration through the weir usually provokes 222rn loss from surface water to the atmosphere we measured 222rn activity in surface river water before and after the weir to adjust for its effects on 222rn activity 226ra is the

water velocity of the surface layer into w following the method used by makings et al 2014 fatm was summed and the 222rn evasion flux driven by wind fatm wind and current fatm current was then used in the 222rn mass balance model this model does not include the diffusive 222rn flux from sediments fdiff a or 222rn inputs through 226ra decay 226raλv the former term is likely minor because surface sediment in each downstream region were majorly gravel table 1 the latter term often has a negligible influence on the 222rn mass balance 1 of 222rn sources as suggested for other estuaries e g jeffrey et al 2016 sadat noori et al 2015 in the mimi river an inflow of seawater was not observed at the most downstream site stn 5 qwb 0 because the water depth at stn 5 was shallow 0 4 m we quantified qex using the water velocity river width and depth 2 6 nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from upstream water tributary water groundwater and the offshore seawater of wakasa bay were calculated by multiplying qup qtri qgw and qwb by the mean concentration respectively the export flux of downstream river water was calculated by multiplying qex by the spatially averaged concentration at the four downstream stations except for the mimi river where the export flux was calculated by multiplying qex by the concentration at the most downstream site stn 5 3 results 3 1 physicochemical propertiesof river water and groundwater the water temperature in the six rivers ranged from 20 3 to 30 4 c fig 3 a the mean temperature of the surface river water was lowest in the mimi river 21 0 0 8 c and highest in the ote river 27 9 2 2 c salinity in the surface waters was lower than 5 0 in all rivers although in bottom waters it ranged from 0 to 32 2 fig 3b the extent of seawater intrusion was 2 km from the river mouth the 222rn activity in surface waters was higher than in bottom waters in all rivers the highest activities were found at the most upstream sites stn 1 in the shono kita and minami rivers while the 222rn activity in the mimi isazu and ote rivers was highest at the most downstream site stn 5 fig 3c the 222rn activity in the minami river showed a particularly prominent increasing trend from 2 0 km upstream to the river mouth fig 3c the tn concentrations in the surface waters were higher than in the bottom waters in all rivers fig 3d the din accounted for 80 of the tn in the surface waters and 38 in the bottom waters the mean tn concentrations in surface water ranged from 17 0 2 3 μmol l 1 in the minami river to 35 6 1 6 μmol l 1 in the mimi river except for the minami river tn concentrations in the surface waters were higher at the lower stations fig 3d the mean tp concentrations in the surface waters ranged from 0 4 0 0 μmol l 1 in the mimi river to 1 7 0 8 μmol l 1 in the isazu river the dip in the isazu river accounted for 39 100 of the tp and was dominant in the tp 70 in other rivers in contrast to the tn the mean tp concentrations in the bottom waters exceeded those in the surface waters in some rivers shono kita minami and ote rivers the spatial variability of tp concentrations in surface waters in the shono mimi and kita rivers was small cv 18 and those in the isazu river and minami river displayed decreasing and increasing trends toward the river mouths respectively in groundwater the mean 222rn activity varied in each river with a minimum of 5508 4159 mean standard deviation bq m 3 in the ote river and a maximum of 27942 23954 bq m 3 in the shono river table s1 these values were 8 fold higher than those in the surface water samples the mean tn and tp concentrations in groundwater samples ranged from 14 9 to 54 5 μmol l 1 and 0 5 to 8 0 μmol l 1 respectively the din and dip concentrations accounted for 87 and 55 of tn and tp respectively 3 2 the 222rn budgets the 222rn budgets of the downstream region in each river are shown in table s2 the major 222rn sources in each river were upstream river water 39 87 and groundwater 6 56 tributaries and offshore seawater supplied 7 of the 222rn export flux was the most significant sink 56 93 of all sinks the 222rn loss by atmospheric evasion was 2 12 by the wind and 13 40 by the current current driven evasion was more significant than wind driven evasion in all rivers the decay of 222rn was negligible in the models of each river 2 3 3 upstream water and export fluxes the inputs of upstream water qup ranged from a minimum of 6 0 104 m3 d 1 in the ote river to a maximum of 93 6 104 m3 d 1 in the mimi river fig 4 the variability in qup among rivers was correlated with the mean altitude of each watershed r 2 0 79 p 0 02 the export fluxes qex to wakasa bay ranged from 19 7 104 m3 d 1 in the ote river to 114 1 104 m3 d 1 in the minami river except for the minami river qex was determined by qup r 2 0 96 p 0 002 in the shono mimi kita and isazu rivers qup to qex were the major contributors 67 while their contribution in the minami and ote rivers was 50 the upstream inputs of tn ranged from 1 1 103 mol d 1 in the ote river to 32 4 103 mol d 1 in the mimi river the exports of tn ranged from 3 3 103 mol d 1 in the ote river to 36 5 103 mol d 1 in the mimi river table 2 the upstream input and export fluxes of tn were mainly composed of din 65 the upstream inputs of tp ranged from 52 4 mol d 1 in the ote river to 571 2 mol d 1 in the isazu river and export fluxes of tp to wakasa bay ranged from 179 4 mol d 1 in the ote river to 873 3 mol d 1 in the minami river the upstream input of tp was mainly dip 79 except for the isazu river 39 3 the export fluxes of tp in the shono mimi and kita rivers were primarily comprised of dip 75 while in the other rivers approximately 50 of the export fluxes were dip 3 4 groundwater fluxes the groundwater fluxes qgw were 3 8 104 m3 d 1 0 45 m d 1 in the shono river 16 3 104 m3 d 1 3 89 m d 1 in the mimi river 0 8 104 m3 d 1 0 08 m d 1 in the kita river 4 6 104 m3 d 1 0 47 m d 1 in the minami river 2 3 104 m3 d 1 0 37 m d 1 in the isazu river and 0 6 104 m3 d 1 0 17 m d 1 in the ote river fig 4 and table s2 site variability normalized groundwater flux divided by the surface area was correlated with the upstream input per catchment area r 2 0 98 p 0 001 regarding the water budgets qgw accounted for 4 7 of the export water flux in the shono river with corresponding values of 14 8 in the mimi river 1 3 in the kita river 4 0 in the minami river 6 6 in the isazu river and 3 1 in the ote river the groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes varied from a minimum of 0 1 103 and 4 0 mol d 1 respectively in the kita river to a maximum of 6 1 103 and 96 3 mol d 1 respectively in the mimi river table 2 the site differences in both fluxes were determined by qgw r 2 0 99 p 0 001 except for tp in the ote river most of the groundwater derived tn 76 and tp 99 fluxes were mainly comprised of no2 no3 and dip except for the ote river no2 no3 43 3 of tn and dip 55 9 of tp table 2 the contribution of the groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes to the export fluxes ranged from 0 8 to 16 7 for tn and 0 9 to 27 4 for tp indicating that groundwater inflow was a nonnegligible nutrient source 3 5 tributary water fluxes the water fluxes from the tributary qtri ranged from 1 3 104 m3 d 1 in the ote river to 21 5 104 m3 d 1 in the shono river and the maximum contribution to export flux was 27 1 in the shono river fig 4 the qtri in each river determined the fluxes of tn and tp from tributary water r 2 0 98 p 0 01 the dominant form of tn 75 was no2 no3 except in the ote river 33 7 while dip accounted for 89 of tp in the shono and isazu rivers and 50 of tp in the kita and ote rivers table 2 3 6 offshore seawater fluxes the contributions of qwb in the shono and mimi rivers were 1 while in the minami and ote rivers the contributions were more than 50 fig 4 the site difference in qwb determined the fluxes of tn and tp from wakasa bay to each river r 2 0 98 p 0 001 the primary form of tn was don in all rivers 46 fig 5 and table 2 while for tp it was dip 42 except in the minami and ote rivers 20 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties in the 222rn mass balance model the parameters used in the 222rn mass balance model introduced uncertainties in the estimation of groundwater flux fig 4 the estimation of 222rn activity in groundwater can be subject to significant uncertainties we used the mean 222rn activity values for various kinds of fresh groundwater including shallow wells springs and riverbeds around each river table s1 based on the coefficient of variation cv the level of uncertainty in the qgw estimate was 86 for the shono river 129 for the mimi river 29 for the kita river 28 for the minami river 85 for the isazu river and 65 for the ote river the 222rn activity in groundwater under the riverbed had a tendency to be lower than that of wells and springs table s1 if the fresh groundwater in the riverbed dominated the groundwater inflows into surface river water the contribution of qgw to the export flux increased by up to 1 4 in the kita river 4 3 in the minami river and 13 3 in the isazu river the 222rn evasion driven by the wind and current accounted for 2 12 and 13 40 of the 222rn budget respectively table s2 although we used the average wind speed measured at meteorological weather stations and the average surface water current measured using current meters in a field survey the cv values were up to 80 for wind and 87 for current the variations of mean qgw in each river resulted in ranges from 3 to 58 for wind and 13 to 356 for current the uncertainty of the qgw was calculated by the propagation of errors technique table s2 the uncertainties of the qgw depending on groundwater end member and 222rn evasion were 87 in the shono river 314 in the kita river 31 in the minami river 104 in the isazu river and 68 in the ote river the uncertainty of the qgw propagated to the estimates of groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes they had large uncertainties of 65 323 for tn and 31 315 for tp the large cv values of 222rn activity collected from various groundwaters i e shallow wells springs and riverbed in each river as well as qgw contributed to the uncertainties of tn and tp fluxes although the assumption of catm 0 bq m 3 for the empirical model of atmospheric evasion also introduced uncertainty the variations of mean qgw in each river were less than 3 even if we adopted the catm value of 4 7 bq m 3 measured in july 2020 near the kita river 4 2 significance of groundwater input the groundwater flux and the contribution thereof to export water flux varied among the rivers fig 4 the positive correlation between groundwater flux and upstream input r 2 0 74 p 0 03 among the rivers suggested that watershed properties such as mean altitude and catchment area might affect the upstream input as well as the magnitude of groundwater flux in each river the different physical properties of the sediment in each river table 1 may also be responsible for the variability of the effects of gse among sites we evaluated the contribution of groundwater according to potential controlling factors such as geomorphological features slope in the longitudinal section and cross section area of the catchment and sediment size denoted by d10 using the multiple linear regression analysis the contribution of groundwater flux to export flux was well explained by the geomorphological features among the rivers r 2 0 99 p 0 001 the most important parameter was the slope in the longitudinal section t 17 64 p 0 036 the sediment size t 7 078 p 0 089 was also important factors while the area of the catchment t 5 059 p 0 12 and the slope in the cross section t 1 624 p 0 35 were minor table s3 this suggested that the topographic gradient was a major factor controlling the gse in tideless rivers the mass balance model revealed that groundwater flux accounted for 1 3 14 8 of the export water flux fig 4 the groundwater flux normalized by the surface area in the six rivers ranged from a minimum of 0 08 to a maximum of 3 89 m d 1 comparable with previous estimates obtained from tidal rivers and estuaries in temperate and tropical coastal regions 0 01 3 90 m d 1 table s4 these estimates were 102 times higher than those of the global coastline 6 3 10 4 m d 1 luijendijk et al 2020 and the japanese archipelago coastline 1 1 10 4 m d 1 ito and marui 2010 especially in the kita and minami rivers the sum of both qgw 5 3 104 m3 d 1 corresponds to 15 of the annual mean of fresh groundwater discharge in obama bay 36 0 104 m3 d 1 sugimoto et al 2016 fig 1b these results suggest that significant groundwater discharge in downstream regions before reaching coastal seas is a non negligible source for coastal ecosystem however the groundwater flux varies with hydrological conditions santos et al 2010 considering the large temporal variability of river discharge in the watersheds kobayashi et al 2017 sugimoto and tsuboi 2017 further study is necessary to understand the impacts of seasonal and flooding on the gse and subsequent export flux to the coastal sea 4 3 importance of groundwater derived nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes from groundwater to surface water accounted for approximately 8 0 8 16 7 of the tn and 10 0 9 27 4 of the tp in the export fluxes to coastal seas respectively table 2 the contributions of groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes to the export flux of each river except the ote river were positively correlated to the groundwater flux normalized by surface area r 2 0 87 p 0 02 this suggests that the greater contribution of groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes to export fluxes was due to the increased potential groundwater flux although groundwater flux in the ote river contributed 3 of the export flux the groundwater derived tn and tp fluxes increased to 10 and 27 respectively fig 4 and table 2 the inconsistency in the contributions of water and materials was due to the enrichment of tn and tp in groundwater under the riverbed because the concentration of groundwater to surface river water ratio was 3 3 for tn and 8 8 for tp moreover the tn mean 54 5 µmol l 1 and tp mean 8 0 µmol l 1 concentrations in the groundwater of the ote river were higher than in other rivers table s1 notably there was a higher proportion of nh4 in the tdn mean 49 in the groundwater in the ote river which has fine sediments and a lower dissolved oxygen do compared to the other rivers tables 1 and s1 these results implied that the accumulation of regenerated nitrogen and phosphorus within the sediments may have been responsible for the large contribution of groundwater to riverine tn and tp export in the ote river nitrogen speciation of tdn in surface river water is a crucial regulator of primary production in coastal seas our observations revealed that 65 of the tdn in surface river water and groundwater was din especially no2 no3 fig 5 and tables 2 s1 the contribution of groundwater derived no2 no3 to the tdn export flux 0 6 18 2 mean 7 1 was more significant than that of nh4 0 0 5 4 mean 1 0 and don 0 0 0 9 mean 0 3 in subtropical tidal estuaries don and nh4 dominate tdn export from the surface water ca 66 98 with no2 no3 making smaller contribution 34 sadat noori et al 2016 santos et al 2013 in general din no2 no3 and nh4 is immediately utilized by the primary producer the dominant input of bioavailable din mainly no2 no3 rather than don through groundwater in tideless rivers would likely stimulate primary productivity in this coastal region the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio of the export flux is also important for controlling primary production and community structure of phytoplankton in coastal seas in this study we observed that mean n p ratios in surface river water 18 and groundwater 29 of each river were higher than the redfield ratios 16 redfield 1963 apart from groundwater in the ote river 7 table s5 considering lower n p ratios 8 14 at offshore seawater in each river the input of n enriched groundwater into surface waters may sustain higher primary production in the coastal region 5 conclusions this study highlighted that groundwater discharge in tideless rivers along a ria coast enhanced the export fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus thus groundwater derived nutrients were a nonnegligible nutrient source for biological production in coastal seas the watershed properties such as mean altitude and catchment area were related to the magnitude of groundwater flux in each river in contrast site variability in the contribution of the groundwater flux to the export flux was due to the riverbed slope in the downstream region indicating that a higher topographic gradient at the local scale increases the relative importance of groundwater for surface riverine export flux from tideless rivers we concluded that the gse in tideless rivers strongly influences the riverine export fluxes of water and nutrients to coastal seas in contrast to tidal rivers nutrients supplied by groundwater through the riverbed near the river mouth might have been overlooked in tideless and steep rivers with mountainous topography along ria coasts and fjords further evaluation at the land ocean boundary area is needed to accurately estimate nutrient fluxes worldwide from the

isotopic composition and their corresponding moisture sources of precipitation are important for understanding water cycles and reconstructing paleoclimate to clarify the isotopic composition and water origins we sampled precipitation diurnally at sapporo northern japan and simulated the isotopic composition and moisture sources by using an isotopic regional spectral model for the 2014 2015 winter period during the period ten intensified extratropical cyclones approached northern japan were classified as sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone according to the cyclone route for precipitation at sapporo the sea of japan cyclone induced higher δ 2h with more moisture from the kuroshio region whereas the pacific cyclone triggered precipitation to sapporo with lower δ 2h and more moisture from the north pacific ocean regarding moisture transport within the extratropical cyclone frontal system for both cyclone types moisture transported by the warm conveyor belt from the kuroshio region mainly condensed in the cold and eastern warm fronts with high δ 2h and d excess resulting from a high sea surface temperature and low humidity during evaporation in contrast vapors transported by the cold conveyor belt from the north pacific ocean precipitated in the western warm front and cyclone center with low δ 2h and d excess arising from a low sea surface temperature and high humidity with respect to the cyclone route effect on the geographical distribution of isotopic characteristics around japan when the sea of japan cyclone occurred condensation in the pacific ocean showed higher δ 2h and d excess with more moisture from the kuroshio via the warm conveyor belt in contrast during passage of the pacific cyclone condensation in the pacific ocean exhibited lower δ 2h and d excess with more vapors from the north pacific ocean via the cold conveyor belt these phenomena observed around japan could be applied in other midlatitude regions and for hydrological biogeochemical and paleoclimate studies keywords stable water isotopes water origins extratropical cyclones isotopic regional spectral model midlatitude regions 1 introduction the isotopic composition of precipitation is essential baseline data for water cycle and paleoclimate studies since the early studies by dansgaard 1953 and craig 1961 stable water isotopes have been widely applied as natural tracers for water cycle studies on groundwater bedaso and wu 2021 gupta et al 2005 takano et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 surface water bhagat et al 2021 gusyev et al 2019 ichiyanagi et al 2003 kendall and coplen 2001 laonamsai et al 2021 morales and oswald 2020 zhu et al 2021a and plant water fan et al 2021 ma et al 2021 sugimoto et al 2002 zhao et al 2020 and for paleo temperature and paleo precipitation reconstruction using ice cores lorius et al 1979 tree rings locosselli et al 2020 welker et al 2005 speleothems dayem et al 2010 and lake sediments sakurai et al 2021 yamamoto et al 2021 yamamoto and seki 2022 the isotopic composition δ 2h and δ 18o of water is basically controlled by the fractionation factor which depends on environmental variables of temperature and humidity during evaporation and condensation processes deuterium excess d excess value was calculated by the equation of d excess δ 2h 8 δ 18o defined by dansgaard 1964 d excess was widely used to reflect the atmospheric humidity condition during the evaporation process in an oceanic moisture source region gat 2000 gat et al 1994 merlivat and jouzel 1979 during the evaporation process on the sea surface the colder sea surface results in lower δ values in evaporated moisture compared with the warmer surface meanwhile the drier sea surface causes higher d excess in vapors than the more humid surface in addition during the condensation process the heavier precipitation in the upstream regions causes lower δ of precipitation in the downstream regions so called rainout effect generally the isotopic composition of precipitation correlates positively with local air temperature and negatively with the local amount of precipitation these are known as the temperature and amount effects respectively araguás araguás et al 1998 dansgaard 1964 heydarizad et al 2021 wright and leavitt 2006 however the temperature and amount effects are not evident in middle latitude regions crawford et al 2013 kurita et al 2015 welker 2012 the isotopic composition of precipitation at mid latitudes could be profoundly affected by other multiple atmospheric processes such as large scale atmospheric circulation gou et al 2022 welker et al 2005 sub cloud rain evaporation graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2021b and so on the effect of large scale atmospheric circulations of the east asian monsoon kurita et al 2015 pacific north american index birks and edwards 2009 and ei nino southern oscillation welker 2012 on the isotopic composition of precipitation has been suggested several studies have suggested that moisture sources influence the isotopic composition of precipitation in middle latitude regions cui and li 2015 guo et al 2021 ren et al 2021 tanoue et al 2017 crawford et al 2013 and kurita et al 2015 debated that moisture from north has lower δ value compared to the moisture from south the lower δ can be explained by the relatively low sea surface temperature during evaporation this is consistent with global isotopic distribution of water vapor and precipitation bowen and wilkinson 2002 risi et al 2012 while some others argued that lower δ values of precipitation was brought by the warm air masses from the south resulting from rainout effect in the upstream regions bedaso and wu 2020 li et al 2017 tang et al 2015 some studies reported spatial isotopic distributions within extratropical cyclone system according to ground based observation and model simulation gambell and friedman 1965 gedzelman and lawrence 1990 pfahl et al 2012 lower δ in the cold sector than in the warm sector has been found in europe aemisegger et al 2015 weng et al 2021 eastern asia li et al 2021 2017 and usa coplen et al 2008 yoshimura et al 2010 li et al 2021 hereafter l2021 investigated one extratropical cyclone migrating over the sea of japan and showed that condensation in the western warm front with lower δ and d excess they proposed that the lower δ and d excess were attributable to moisture transported by the cold conveyor belt from the north pacific ocean in contrast higher δ and d excess of condensation in the cold and eastern warm fronts were due to vapors transported by the warm conveyor belt from the kuroshio region in addition some proposed that cyclone s track influences the isotopic composition of precipitation and water vapor the more seawards and southerly route of cyclone with lower δ of precipitation and water vapor was found in eastern asia kurita et al 2015 li et al 2017 and in eastern usa lawrence et al 1982 however the relationship between isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation and the reason for the effect of cyclonic track on isotopic composition have not been fully understood yet the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of extratropical cyclone s route on variations in the isotopic composition and water origins of precipitation and clarify the underlying processes responsible for these variations for that purpose we sampled precipitation diurnally for isotopic analysis at sapporo in hokkaido northern japan simulated the isotopic composition and moisture sources in the vicinity of japan by using an isotopic regional spectral model and conducted cyclone based analyses for a winter period from november 30 2014 to february 3 2015 during the 66 day observation 10 intensified extratropical cyclones approached northern japan the objectives of this study were a identification of the temporal variations in the isotopic composition and water origins of precipitation at sapporo b investigation of the spatial distribution patterns of the model simulated isotopic composition and moisture sources within the extratropical cyclone system c clarification of the effect of cyclone route on the spatial distribution of the model simulated isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan the rest of the paper is organized

precipitation at sapporo section 3 2 presents the spatial distributions of the isotopic composition and water origins within the extratropical cyclone system and section 3 3 discusses effects of the cyclone track on the spatial distribution of the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan a summary is drawn in section 4 2 methods 2 1 study area the japanese archipelago is located at midlatitudes in the pacific north region along the eastern edge of northeast asia the islands are surrounded by the sea of japan on the west the sea of okhotsk on the north and the pacific ocean on the east fig 1 the islands are occupied by mountain ranges in the central and plain areas on the coast similar to other midlatitude coastal regions the climate of japan is featured by monsoons the precipitation is principally induced by extratropical cyclones in each season in summer extratropical cyclones bring larger amounts of precipitation with warmer temperatures to japan on the other hand in winter extratropical cyclones approach frequently and develop more explosively around japan hirata 2021 tsukijihara et al 2019 tsukijihara and kawamura 2022 2 2 precipitation sampling and isotopic analyses precipitation was sampled diurnally and randomly with higher frequency for heavier precipitation event from november 30 2014 to february 3 2015 fig s1 the sampling site 141 35 e and 43 07 n is located at an open site of campus of hokkaido university in sapporo northern japan fig 1 rain was sampled using a funnel with a polyethylene vessel whereas snow samples were collected in a bucket and melted in a plastic bag indoors collected rain and snow samples were weighed to obtain information on the amount of precipitation and then stored in 6 ml glass bottles during the 66 day observation 145 precipitation samples were collected for stable water isotopic analysis via the co2 h2 h2o equilibration method using a mat253 thermo fisher scientific usa manufactured in germany with a gas bench thermo fisher scientific usa at the faculty of environmental earth science hokkaido university analytical errors root mean square error of the internal standards were 0 72 for δ 2h 0 11 for δ 18o and 1 05 for d excess during the entire procedure table 1 2 3 numerical experiment 2 3 1 model in this study the isotopic composition was simulated by using an isotopic regional spectral model isorsm yoshimura et al 2010 the basic design of the isorsm was the same as that in l2021 and the following text is derived from there with minor modifications the major physics schemes used in the model include longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations chou and suarez 1994 cloud microphysics slingo 1987 the relaxed arakawa schubert deep convection moorthi and suarez 1992 shallow convection tiedtke 1983 the noah land surface model ek et al 2003 a non local vertical diffusion scheme for the planetary boundary layer hong and pan 1998 and the orographic gravity wave drag and mountain blocking parameterization alpert et al 1988 a spectral nudging technique is used in this study to improve the isorsm s simulation kanamaru and kanamitsu 2007 kanamitsu et al 2010 yoshimura and kanamitsu 2009 2008 the model was designed to cover parts of east asia and the northwest pacific ocean 105 82 e 178 43 e 10 13 n 63 41 n where the domain center is located at 142 e and 42 n fig 1 all simulations were performed from 0000 utc on november 24 2014 to 0000 utc on february 4 2015 according to previous studies li et al 2021 sodemann et al 2009 yoshimura et al 2010 the first 6 day of each simulation was regarded as the spinup period to reduce the initial atmospheric water vapor a horizontal resolution of 10 km and 28 vertical sigma levels were used the time step for model integration was 20 s to clarify the moisture sources moisture originating from different prespecified sources is tagged with different tracers water vapor tracers so called water tagging were incorporated into the isorsm to replace the isotopic tracers this water tagging method was developed by yoshimura et al 2004 and is called colored moisture analysis cma eight evaporative source regions are defined for cma according to geographical borders as shown in fig 1 and listed as follows kuroshio region north pacific ocean sea of japan west pacific ocean east china sea tropical pacific ocean indian ocean and east asian continent 2 3 2 data the lateral boundary and initial conditions for the isorsm were taken from the isotopic global spectral model isogsm yoshimura et al 2008 simulation the surface boundary conditions of the sea surface temperature and sea ice distribution for the isorsm and isogsm were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration optimum interpolation sea surface temperature v2 noaa oisst v2 reynolds et al 2002 the initial time for the isogsm was set at 0000 utc on june 1 2014 and the spinup period was about 6 months the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 was used for spectral nudging in the isorsm and isogsm the jra 55 national centers for environmental prediction department of energy reanalysis 2 ncep doe r2 and observed isotopic values of precipitation at sapporo were used to validate the isorsm s simulation the cyclones tracks with corresponding minimum central pressures were extracted from the isorsm and jra 55 for comparison in this study a cyclone with a radius larger than 300 km was tracked over the model domain with a 6 h time interval the nearest cyclones with distance less than 600 km between the centers were considered as one cyclone minimum sea level pressure within the cyclone was identified as cyclone center details of the tracking algorithm are described in iizuka et al 2013 and tsukijihara et al 2019 cyclones traced for longer than 24 h with minimum sea level pressure less than 990 hpa were selected as intensified extratropical cyclones during the observation period ten intensified extratropical cyclones approached northern japan all of them are explosive extratropical cyclones according to the definition in yoshiike and kawamura 2009 these cyclones were classified as sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone according to the routes of the cyclone center that migrated from the sea of japan and from the kuroshio region and north pacific ocean respectively the time series and scatter diagrams of all observed and corresponding model simulated δ 2h δ 18o and d excess in the precipitation at sapporo are shown in fig s1 and s2 respectively due to high correlation and similarity between the δ 2h and δ 18o for both observed and simulated results fig s3 we mainly show δ 2h and d excess results in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variations of the isotopic composition and moisture sources in precipitation at sapporo the time series of observed and model simulated isotopic composition and simulated moisture sources in the precipitation at sapporo are displayed in fig 2 the temporal variations of simulated δ 2h and d excess of precipitation showed similar trends with the observed results fig 2a and b the correlation coefficient is 0 82 for δ 2h and 0 55 for d excess both are statistically significant at the 0 1 level for t statistics and comparable to the results in previous studies ichiyanagi et al 2005 kudo et al 2014 takakura et al 2018 tanoue et al 2017 2016 therefore these results suggest the isorsm shows good reproducibility of the isotopic variations in precipitation and is suitable to identify moisture sources of precipitation around japan the simulated and observed d excess showed a considerable discrepancy and relatively low correlation coefficient error analysis was made to know the reasons for the discrepancy as shown in table 1 root mean square error in d excess is 11 14 the error was mainly contributed from simulated error 11 09 and attributable to underestimation 9 16 in the simulation furthermore most of this underestimation of d excess 7 63 was due to overestimation of δ 18o 0 95 table 1 this probably results from underestimation of kinetic fractionation during evaporation in marine boundary layer as suggested by steen larsen et al 2017 in addition error in δ 2h 23 28 was much larger than error in d excess 11 14 and highly correlated with error in δ 18o the large total error with high correlation between δ 2h and δ 18o mainly arose from the simulated error this was probably attributable to simulated uncertainty on the time evolution intensity track of cyclones and so on for example the error in δ 2h decreased from 23 28 fig s1 to 11 52 fig 2 if 12 hr weighted averaged isotopic data was used instead of the raw data as will be revealed in section 3 2 1 shift of the simulated cyclonic track could also result in simulated errors in both δ 2h and δ 18o with high correlation the temperature effect and amount effect on δ 2h of precipitation at sapporo are shown in table 2 values of δ 2h were positively correlated with air temperature and negatively correlated with the amount of precipitation at the sampling site however the temperature effect and amount effect accounted for only 12 and 9 of the variations in δ 2h respectively table 2 this indicates the isotopic composition of precipitation may be affected by other factors such as moisture source cyclone track cyclone structure and so on to investigate the moisture source in precipitation and its effect on the isotopic composition the contribution of each water origin to the total precipitable water and condensation at sapporo is shown in fig 2c and 2d the total precipitable water at sapporo exhibited intriguing characteristics with a large fluctuation and replacement of water origins fig 2c the temporal variation in the proportion of each water origin of condensation is very similar to that of precipitable water most of the moisture sources of condensation at sapporo originated from the sea of japan the north pacific ocean and the kuroshio region fig 2d during the observation period ten intensified extratropical cyclones approached northern japan including six sea of japan cyclones j1 j2 j3 j4 j5 and j6 and four pacific cyclones p1 p2 p3 and p4 the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone were shown as solid lines and dashed lines in fig 2 respectively the temporal variations of isotopic composition and moisture sources in precipitation at sapporo were affected by the route of the cyclone during the passage of the sea of japan cyclone values of δ 2h of precipitation increased or showed relatively high values with an increase of moisture principally from the sea of japan the kuroshio region and other tropical regions whereas δ 2h decreased or showed relatively low values with an increase of moisture mainly from the sea of japan the kuroshio region and the north pacific ocean during the passage of pacific cyclone fig 2a c d and table 3 the isotopic results are consistent with previous studies showing a more southerly route with lower δ values kurita et al 2015 lawrence et al 1982 li et al 2017 however interpretations on water origins with lower δ values are different among studies kurita et al 2015 suggested the low δ of precipitation in central japan was brought by the cold air mass from the north as indicated by lower air potential temperature during passage of the southern coastal cyclone the southern coastal cyclone is defined as southeast low pressure system in li et al 2017 and pacific cyclone in this study in contrast li et al 2017 argued that the precipitation with low δ values in northern japan was brought by the warm air masses from the south resulting from rainout effect in the upstream regions based on air mass back trajectory analysis therefore the effect of cyclone route on the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation are still not fully understood our results showed that most of the precipitable water and condensation at sapporo was from the sea of japan the north pacific ocean and the kuroshio region fig 2c and d the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation at sapporo were affected by the cyclone routes precipitation induced by the pacific cyclone showed lower δ with more moisture originating from the north pacific ocean whereas the sea of japan cyclone brought precipitation with higher δ and more vapors from the kuroshio region to clarify the reasons for the differences in isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation between the pacific cyclone and sea of japan cyclone the spatial distributions of isotopic composition and major water origins within the cyclone system will be presented in the next subsection 3 2 spatial distribution of the isotopic composition and moisture sources within extratropical cyclone system 3 2 1 tracks and central pressures of the cyclones considering the time evolution during the development of explosive extratropical cyclone time with the maximum deepening rate was selected as the deepening stage according to explosive cyclone with around 24 h of the rapid deepening period kuwano yoshida and asuma 2008 li et al 2021 sanders and gyakum 1980 yoshida and asuma 2004 12 h before and after deepening stage were chosen as the early and mature stages respectively among the 10 intensified explosive extratropical cyclones three sea of japan cyclones j2 j5 and j6 and three pacific cyclones p1 p3 and p4 with the cyclone center closer to japan at deepening and mature stages were selected for cyclone based analyses the selected cyclones tracks with corresponding central pressures from the model were compared with those extracted from the jra 55 dataset fig 3 overall the simulation shows good correspondence with the jra 55 results for the time evolution of route and intensity of the six cyclones for j2 and p1 cyclones the simulated tracks shifted closer to the observation site in the late period as compared with the jra 55 results fig 3a the discrepancies of the tracks were probably caused by the model s resolution and the choice of physics schemes on convection and planetary boundary layer as suggested by previous studies lamraoui et al 2019 sodemann et al 2009 the spatial distributions of the simulated sea level pressure showed a pattern very similar to the reanalysis results from jra 55 fig s4 the simulated δ 2h was lower than the observed results for j2 and p1 previous study showed δ values are the lowest near the cyclone center due to larger rainout effect with higher cloud top gedzelman and lawrence 1990 therefore the lower simulated δ 2h for j2 and p1 can be explained by the simulated centers closer to the observation site regarding development of explosive extratropical cyclones the sea of japan cyclones showed lower maximum deepening rates with higher minimum central pressures especially for j5 and j6 in contrast the pacific cyclones exhibited higher maximum deepening rates with lower minimum central pressures p1 cyclone had the highest maximum deepening rate and lowest minimum central pressure among all cyclones fig 3b this corresponds well with the findings in previous studies kuwano yoshida and asuma 2008 yoshida and asuma 2004 3 2 2 similarity of the stable isotopes and water origins among cyclones with respect to moisture transport within the extratropical cyclone system three main airstreams in the conveyor belt model are responsible for most moisture transport and characterized as below the warm conveyor belt the cold conveyor belt and the dry intrusion carlson 1980 hirata et al 2018 2015 li et al 2021 raveh rubin 2017 the warm conveyor belt is a poleward meridional ascending flow with warm and moist air along the cold front within the warm sector the cold conveyor belt is a low level zonal flow with cold and relatively moist air along the warm front within the poleward cold sector the dry intrusion is a descending airstream from the vicinity of the tropopause with cold and dry air along the cold front in the western cold sector vapors condensing in cold and eastern warm fronts were principally transported by the warm conveyor belt from the warm sector whereas moisture in western warm front and near the cyclone center was mainly transported by the cold conveyor belt from the poleward cold sector in addition vapors of post cold frontal condensation were transported by the dry intrusion from the western warm sector figs 4 and 5 show the spatial distribution of the model simulated moisture sources and isotopic composition of precipitable water and condensation for the selected three sea of japan cyclones j2 j5 and j6 and three pacific cyclones p1 p3 and p4 regarding moisture source and isotopic composition precipitation exhibited similar spatial distribution patterns to the condensation results fig s5 compared with that of condensation slightly higher δ 2h and lower d excess of precipitation were attributable to evaporation of condensate and isotopic exchange between condensate and water vapor in ambient atmosphere kinetic fractionation during evaporation under unsaturated ambient atmosphere increases the δ values and decreases d excess of liquid water and precipitation in addition isotope exchange increases the δ values due to higher δ values of the surrounding vapor compared with the vapor in the cloud when the condensate formed in the higher altitude overall the spatial distribution patterns within the cyclone system are similar between the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone a large amount of total precipitable water with salient moisture flux zone is intimately related to the warm conveyor belt fig 4a and c large amounts of condensation along the west and north edges of the moisture flux zone were observed in the cold and eastern warm fronts for each cyclone fig 5a and c in addition intermediate condensation stretching northwestward from the moisture flux zone to the inner region of cyclone correspond to the western warm front for each cyclone fig 5a and d regarding each water origin with corresponding isotopic composition for both the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone large amounts of moisture from the kuroshio region were transported northward along the warm conveyor belts fig 4c the moisture condensed principally in the cold and eastern warm fronts fig 5c with higher δ 2h and d excess fig 5e and f the high δ 2h and d excess of condensation in the cold and eastern warm fronts were due to moisture from the kuroshio region with high δ 2h 99 86 and d excess 12 22 this resulted from a relatively high sea surface temperature 15 19 and low humidity 70 80 during evaporation on the kuroshio sea surface fig 4e f and table 4 in contrast vapors from the north pacific ocean were transported northwestward into the cyclone center area by the cold conveyor belt in the north side of the moisture flux zone fig 4d the vapors contributed more condensation to the western warm front and the vicinity of the cyclone center fig 5d with lower δ 2h and d excess fig 5e and f the low δ 2h and d excess of condensation were attributable to moisture originating from the north pacific ocean with low δ 2h 165 115 and d excess 9 18 this could arise from a relatively low sea surface temperature 2 5 and high humidity 75 90 during evaporation on the north pacific ocean surface fig 4e f and table 4 compared with the north pacific ocean relatively high sea surface temperature and low humidity were observed in the kuroshio region this is consistent with the global climatology of sea surface temperature and humidity in previous study aemisegger and papritz 2018 the δ 2h of condensation showed a decreasing trend along the cold and warm fronts toward the cyclone center which reflects the upstream rainout effect besides higher sst in the kuroshio region could enhance this rainout effect and reduce δ 2h of condensation along the cold front higher sst enhanced evaporation in the kuroshio region and subsequent larger rainfall along the cold front this is consistent with previous study showing higher sst resulted in lower δ of precipitation lachniet 2009 however the negative sst effect during the rainout process along the cold front is smaller than the positive sst effect during the evaporation process between the kuroshio region and the north pacific ocean because the decrease of δ 2h along the cold front was smaller than the difference of δ 2h between the western warm front and the cold and eastern warm fronts in addition vapors from the sea of japan were transported northeastward by the dry intrusion on the west side of the moisture flux zone fig 4b the vapors then condensed near the cyclone center and west coast of japan fig 5b with decreasing δ 2h and d excess from the south to north fig 5e and f the decreasing δ 2h and d excess were caused by moisture from the sea of japan with decreasing δ 2h and d excess from the south to north fig 4e and f this resulted from the poleward decreasing sea surface temperature and increasing humidity on the sea of japan surface fig 4e and f these spatial distributions of the isotopic composition and moisture sources are consistent with that in l2021 based on one cyclone migrating over the sea of japan our results suggest that the spatial distribution patterns of the isotopic composition and moisture sources within the extratropical cyclone system are not affected by the cyclone track condensation originated from the north pacific ocean had lower δ 2h and d excess than that from the kuroshio region for both the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone the lower δ 2h and d excess were attributable to relatively low sea surface temperature and high relative humidity on the north pacific ocean surface 3 2 3 differences of the stable isotopes and water origins among cyclones there are some differences between the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone regarding moisture source and isotopic composition along warm and cold fronts extent of condensation along the warm front originated from the north pacific ocean for the sea of japan cyclones especially for j5 and j6 was smaller than the pacific cyclones this can be explained by the maximum deepening rate for explosive extratropical cyclones generally explosive cyclones with higher maximum deepening rate showed a stronger warm front among the six explosive cyclones j5 and j6 with lower maximum deepening rate exhibited a much weaker warm front in contrast p1 with the highest maximum deepening rate showed the strongest warm front fig 3b and fig 5d in addition the cold front of the pacific cyclones especially for p3 and p4 showed relatively low δ 2h and d excess fig 5e and f with small amounts of condensation originated from the kuroshio region fig 5c while large amounts of condensation were contributed from the tropical pacific ocean and other remote tropical oceans moisture from the remote tropical oceans could lower the δ 2h and d excess of the cold frontal condensation for the pacific cyclone this was attributable to high humidity on the tropical sea surface during evaporation and subsequent rainout effect in the upstream region with active convection activities during moisture transport therefore low δ 2h of precipitation at sapporo induced by the pacific cyclone was caused by moisture originating from the north pacific ocean with relatively low δ 2h resulting from a lower sea surface temperature in the north pacific ocean during evaporation in contrast high δ 2h of precipitation at sapporo triggered by the sea of japan cyclone was attributable to more moisture from the kuroshio region with relatively high δ 2h arising from a higher sea surface temperature in the kuroshio region here we found there were characteristic spatial distribution patterns of the isotopic composition and moisture sources within the extratropical cyclone system cyclonic track influenced the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation at sapporo to investigate whether the effect of cyclonic track on isotopic composition found at sapporo exists in the vicinity of japan accumulated condensation results for each cyclone will be presented in the next subsection 3 3 effect of cyclone route on the stable isotopes and moisture sources in the vicinity of japan in subsection 3 2 we found intriguing characteristics of isotopic composition and their corresponding water origins within the extratropical cyclone frontal system between the sea of japan and pacific cyclones besides cyclonic track affected the isotopic signal at sapporo through changing the moisture sources however it s unclear whether cyclone routes influence isotopic geographic distributions around japan which are important for hydrological and paleoclimate studies to investigate the effect of cyclone route on isotopic geographic distributions the spatial distributions of the model simulated isotopic composition and moisture sources of 24 h accumulated condensation during the cyclones intensification are shown in fig 6 the model simulated condensation for each cyclone exhibited similar spatial distribution to the precipitation result obtained from the model and from ncep doe r2 especially regarding area and location of heavy precipitation fig 6 fig s6 and s7 large amounts of condensation were observed in the vicinity of japan with characteristic spatial distributions of moisture sources and isotopic composition for both the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone condensation in southern japan and the adjacent kuroshio region exhibited higher δ 2h and d excess fig 6e and f with moisture principally from the kuroshio region fig 6c on the other hand condensation in northern japan and the neighboring north pacific ocean showed lower δ 2h and d excess fig 6e and f with moisture mainly from the north pacific ocean fig 6d besides condensation on the west coast of japan and the adjacent sea of japan had poleward decreasing δ 2h and d excess fig 6e and f with moisture mainly from the sea of japan fig 6b the characteristic isotopic distributions of condensation can be explained by the corresponding moisture sources and evaporation conditions as described in subsection 3 2 with respect to differences in the stable isotopes and water origins among cyclones the sea of japan cyclone showed higher δ 2h and d excess of condensation in the pacific ocean than in the sea of japan fig 6e and f the higher δ 2h and d excess is attributable to moisture originating from the kuroshio region fig 6c with higher δ 2h and d excess fig 5e and f in contrast higher maximum deepening rate and more southerly cyclonic route fig 3a and b with stronger western warm and cold fronts were observed for the pacific cyclones the pacific cyclone exhibited lower δ 2h and d excess of condensation in the pacific ocean than in the sea of japan fig 6e and f the lower δ 2h and d excess is due to more western warm frontal condensation originated from the north pacific ocean fig 6d with low δ 2h and d excess fig 5e and f furthermore more southerly cyclonic route with higher intensity facilitates pacific cyclone to converge more remote tropical oceanic moisture fig s8 with low d excess and δ 2h along the cold front the low d excess and δ 2h is attributable to relative high humidity during the evaporation process in the tropical oceans and subsequent rainout effect during the transport process in the upstream regions the moisture from remote tropical oceans fig s8 also lowers the δ 2h and d excess of condensation in the pacific ocean compared with p3 and p4 cyclones p1 showed larger amounts of condensation with lower δ 2h and d excess in the northern sea of japan this resulted from the influence of the j3 cyclone as the deepening stage of p1 was overlapped with the mature stage of j3 fig 2 among the sea of japan cyclones j6 cyclone had larger amounts of condensation with lower δ 2h and d excess in the southern japan and kuroshio region the lower δ 2h and d excess was caused by a new cyclogenesis along the cold front of j6 at its deepening and mature stages fig 5a e and f li et al 2017 found shift of cyclone track from northwest to southeast of hokkaido resulted in a 5 40 decrease of δ 18o δ 2h tsukijihara and kawamura 2022 suggested tropical climate regime shift around 1998 1999 and wave train patterns along the asian jet affect the track and development of extratropical cyclone around japan using large ensemble simulations furthermore according to the temperature effect and the effect of cyclonic track on the isotopic composition in hokkaido yamamoto et al 2021 inferred the westerly jet position and the north pacific high intensity based on leaf wax δ 2h of lake sediments then they reconstructed the summer climate in northern japan over the past 17 000 years in this study we clarified the underlying processes responsible for the effect of cyclonic route on the spatial and temporal variations in the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan our results showed in the pacific ocean and pacific side of japan the pacific cyclone induced lower δ and d excess compared with the sea of japan cyclone on the other hand we found the isotopic spatial distribution within the frontal system of extratropical cyclone is not affected by the track of cyclone the isotopic signal of water vapor in each region is relatively stable and distinct with each other according to the geographic location and climate condition because extratropical cyclone is a dominant cyclone and the main source of precipitation in midlatitude regions therefore the phenomena in this study could be found in other midlatitude regions cyclonic route may be an important factor affecting temporal and spatial isotopic variations in precipitation observed for hydrological and environmental studies cyclone track is strongly affected by ocean current and atmospheric circulation and reflects climate change in a longer timescale hayasaki et al 2013 showed track of pacific cyclone shifted northward during non meander of kuroshio current compared with the kuroshio large meander in addition the frequency of pacific cyclones increased significantly in the past 40 years tsukijihara et al 2019 tsukijihara and kawamura 2022 the frequency was projected to increase in the future under the rcp8 5 scenario seiler and zwiers 2016 our results showed that increased frequency of pacific cyclones could decrease the δ values in the pacific ocean and on the pacific side of japan the effect of cyclonic track on δ of precipitation should be considered to interpret records of past δ in precipitation hence our results may also contribute to paleoclimate studies based on tree rings miller et al 2006 stalagmites or other paleo archives in midlatitude regions 4 conclusions this study attempts to clarify the effect of cyclone track on the spatial and temporal variations in isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan for that purpose precipitation was sampled diurnally for isotopic analysis at sapporo northern japan the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan were simulated by using an isotopic regional spectral model and cyclone based analyses were conducted for a winter period from november 30 2014 to february 3 2015 the major findings in this study are briefly summarized as follows 1 with respect to the temporal variations in the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation at sapporo the isotopic temporal variations were affected by the route of cyclone precipitation induced by the sea of japan cyclone showed higher δ 2h which is attributable to moisture from the kuroshio region with relatively high δ 2h while precipitation triggered by the pacific cyclone exhibited lower δ 2h which is due to moisture from the north pacific ocean with relatively low δ 2h 2 regarding the spatial distributions of the isotopic composition and moisture sources within the extratropical cyclone system for both the sea of japan cyclone and the pacific cyclone condensation in the cyclone center and western warm front with lower δ 2h and d excess was principally contributed by vapors transported by the cold conveyor belt from the north pacific ocean with low δ 2h and d excess the low δ 2h and d excess resulted from a low sea surface temperature and high humidity during evaporation in the north pacific ocean in contrast condensation in the cold and eastern warm fronts with higher δ 2h and d excess was attributable to moisture transported by the warm conveyor belt from the kuroshio region with high δ 2h and d excess the high δ 2h and d excess resulted from a high sea surface temperature and high humidity during evaporation in the kuroshio region these are consistent with li et al 2021 based on one cyclone analysis 3 compared with the sea of japan cyclone the pacific cyclone showed higher maximum deepening rates and lower minimum central pressures and exhibited larger amounts of condensation in the warm and cold fronts with more moisture from the north pacific ocean and other remote tropical oceans 4 as for the effect of cyclonic track on geographical distribution of isotopic characteristics in the vicinity of japan the spatial distribution showed a different pattern between the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone when the sea of japan cyclone occurred higher δ 2h and d excess values of condensation were observed in the pacific ocean than that in the sea of japan which is caused by moisture from the kuroshio region with relatively high δ 2h and d excess in contrast during the passage of the pacific cyclone condensation in the pacific ocean exhibited lower δ 2h and d excess due to vapors from the north pacific ocean and other remote tropical regions with relatively low δ 2h and d excess herein we found that the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan were characterized by the route of extratropical cyclone based on isotopic observation and numerical simulation furthermore we clarified the underlying processes responsible for the effect of cyclonic route regarding moisture evaporation transportation and condensation processes in association with extratropical cyclone the effect of cyclonic track on δ of precipitation has been found in eastern usa lawrence et al 1982 and in eastern asia kurita et al 2015 li et al 2017 this effect is attributable to isotopic distribution and moisture transport within the frontal system similar isotopic distribution in association with frontal system of extratropical cyclone has been reported in europe aemisegger et al 2015 weng et al 2021 eastern asia li et al 2021 and usa coplen et al 2008 gedzelman and lawrence 1990 pfahl et al 2012 yoshimura et al 2010 due to the dominance of extratropical cyclone in midlatitude regions and sensitivity of the isotopic composition in precipitation to the cyclone route which reflects atmospheric circulation ocean current and climate change hence the phenomenon and underlying processes highlighted in this study are not specific to eastern asia we suggest that they could be applied in other midlatitude regions and for hydrological atmospheric and paleoclimate studies the isotopic composition and moisture sources are sensitive to the cyclonic track the reproducibility of the cyclone s track depends heavily on the model s resolution sodemann et al 2009 and the choice of physics schemes on convection and planetary boundary layer lamraoui et al 2019 moreover the underestimation of d excess was attributable to inadequacies in the parameterization of the kinetic fractionation related to sea surface humidity and wind speed steen larsen et al 2017 therefore higher resolution simulations with further analysis of physical parameterization of marine boundary layer are required to gain a complete understanding of the isotopic composition and moisture sources in association with extratropical cyclone credit authorship contribution statement xiaoyang li formal analysis

isotopic composition and their corresponding moisture sources of precipitation are important for understanding water cycles and reconstructing paleoclimate to clarify the isotopic composition and water origins we sampled precipitation diurnally at sapporo northern japan and simulated the isotopic composition and moisture sources by using an isotopic regional spectral model for the 2014 2015 winter period during the period ten intensified extratropical cyclones approached northern japan were classified as sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone according to the cyclone route for precipitation at sapporo the sea of japan cyclone induced higher δ 2h with more moisture from the kuroshio region whereas the pacific cyclone triggered precipitation to sapporo with lower δ 2h and more moisture from the north pacific ocean regarding moisture transport within the extratropical cyclone frontal system for both cyclone types moisture transported by the warm conveyor belt from the kuroshio region mainly condensed in the cold and eastern warm fronts with high δ 2h and d excess resulting from a high sea surface temperature and low humidity during evaporation in contrast vapors transported by the cold conveyor belt from the north pacific ocean precipitated in the western warm front and cyclone center with low δ 2h and d excess arising from a low sea surface temperature and high humidity with respect to the cyclone route effect on the geographical distribution of isotopic characteristics around japan when the sea of japan cyclone occurred condensation in the pacific ocean showed higher δ 2h and d excess with more moisture from the kuroshio via the warm conveyor belt in contrast during passage of the pacific cyclone condensation in the pacific ocean exhibited lower δ 2h and d excess with more vapors from the north pacific ocean via the cold conveyor belt these phenomena observed around japan could be applied in other midlatitude regions and for hydrological biogeochemical and paleoclimate studies keywords stable water isotopes water origins extratropical cyclones isotopic regional spectral model midlatitude regions 1 introduction the isotopic composition of precipitation is essential baseline data for water cycle and paleoclimate studies since the early studies by dansgaard 1953 and craig 1961 stable water isotopes have been widely applied as natural tracers for water cycle studies on groundwater bedaso and wu 2021 gupta et al 2005 takano et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 surface water bhagat et al 2021 gusyev et al 2019 ichiyanagi et al 2003 kendall and coplen 2001 laonamsai et al 2021 morales and oswald 2020 zhu et al 2021a and plant water fan et al 2021 ma et al 2021 sugimoto et al 2002 zhao et al 2020 and for paleo temperature and paleo precipitation reconstruction using ice cores lorius et al 1979 tree rings locosselli et al 2020 welker et al 2005 speleothems dayem et al 2010 and lake sediments sakurai et al 2021 yamamoto et al 2021 yamamoto and seki 2022 the isotopic composition δ 2h and δ 18o of water is basically controlled by the fractionation factor which depends on environmental variables of temperature and humidity during evaporation and condensation processes deuterium excess d excess value was calculated by the equation of d excess δ 2h 8 δ 18o defined by dansgaard 1964 d excess was widely used to reflect the atmospheric humidity condition during the evaporation process in an oceanic moisture source region gat 2000 gat et al 1994 merlivat and jouzel 1979 during the evaporation process on the sea surface the colder sea surface results in lower δ values in evaporated moisture compared with the warmer surface meanwhile the drier sea surface causes higher d excess in vapors than the more humid surface in addition during the condensation process the heavier precipitation in the upstream regions causes lower δ of precipitation in the downstream regions so called rainout effect generally the isotopic composition of precipitation correlates positively with local air temperature and negatively with the local amount of precipitation these are known as the temperature and amount effects respectively araguás araguás et al 1998 dansgaard 1964 heydarizad et al 2021 wright and leavitt 2006 however the temperature and amount effects are not evident in middle latitude regions crawford et al 2013 kurita et al 2015 welker 2012 the isotopic composition of precipitation at mid latitudes could be profoundly affected by other multiple atmospheric processes such as large scale atmospheric circulation gou et al 2022 welker et al 2005 sub cloud rain evaporation graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2021b and so on the effect of large scale atmospheric circulations of the east asian monsoon kurita et al 2015 pacific north american index birks and edwards 2009 and ei nino southern oscillation welker 2012 on the isotopic composition of precipitation has been suggested several studies have suggested that moisture sources influence the isotopic composition of precipitation in middle latitude regions cui and li 2015 guo et al 2021 ren et al 2021 tanoue et al 2017 crawford et al 2013 and kurita et al 2015 debated that moisture from north has lower δ value compared to the moisture from south the lower δ can be explained by the relatively low sea surface temperature during evaporation this is consistent with global isotopic distribution of water vapor and precipitation bowen and wilkinson 2002 risi et al 2012 while some others argued that lower δ values of precipitation was brought by the warm air masses from the south resulting from rainout effect in the upstream regions bedaso and wu 2020 li et al 2017 tang et al 2015 some studies reported spatial isotopic distributions within extratropical cyclone system according to ground based observation and model simulation gambell and friedman 1965 gedzelman and lawrence 1990 pfahl et al 2012 lower δ in the cold sector than in the warm sector has been found in europe aemisegger et al 2015 weng et al 2021 eastern asia li et al 2021 2017 and usa coplen et al 2008 yoshimura et al 2010 li et al 2021 hereafter l2021 investigated one extratropical cyclone migrating over the sea of japan and showed that condensation in the western warm front with lower δ and d excess they proposed that the lower δ and d excess were attributable to moisture transported by the cold conveyor belt from the north pacific ocean in contrast higher δ and d excess of condensation in the cold and eastern warm fronts were due to vapors transported by the warm conveyor belt from the kuroshio region in addition some proposed that cyclone s track influences the isotopic composition of precipitation and water vapor the more seawards and southerly route of cyclone with lower δ of precipitation and water vapor was found in eastern asia kurita et al 2015 li et al 2017 and in eastern usa lawrence et al 1982 however the relationship between isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation and the reason for the effect of cyclonic track on isotopic composition have not been fully understood yet the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of extratropical cyclone s route on variations in the isotopic composition and water origins of precipitation and clarify the underlying processes responsible for these variations for that purpose we sampled precipitation diurnally for isotopic analysis at sapporo in hokkaido northern japan simulated the isotopic composition and moisture sources in the vicinity of japan by using an isotopic regional spectral model and conducted cyclone based analyses for a winter period from november 30 2014 to february 3 2015 during the 66 day observation 10

precipitation at sapporo b investigation of the spatial distribution patterns of the model simulated isotopic composition and moisture sources within the extratropical cyclone system c clarification

precipitation at sapporo section 3 2 presents the spatial distributions of the isotopic composition and water origins within the extratropical cyclone system and section 3 3 discusses effects of the cyclone track on the spatial distribution of the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan a summary is drawn in section 4 2 methods 2 1 study area the japanese archipelago is located at midlatitudes in the pacific north region along the eastern edge of northeast asia the islands are surrounded by the sea of japan on the west the sea of okhotsk on the north and the pacific ocean on the east fig 1 the islands are occupied by mountain ranges in the central and plain areas on the coast similar to other midlatitude coastal regions the climate of japan is featured by monsoons the precipitation is principally induced by extratropical cyclones in each season in summer extratropical cyclones bring larger amounts of precipitation with warmer temperatures to japan on the other hand in winter extratropical cyclones approach frequently and develop more explosively around japan hirata 2021 tsukijihara et al 2019 tsukijihara and kawamura 2022 2 2 precipitation sampling and isotopic analyses precipitation was sampled diurnally and randomly with higher frequency for heavier precipitation event from november 30 2014 to february 3 2015 fig s1 the sampling site 141 35 e and 43 07 n is located at an open site of campus of hokkaido university in sapporo northern japan fig 1 rain was sampled using a funnel with a polyethylene vessel whereas snow samples were collected in a bucket and melted in a plastic bag indoors collected rain and snow samples were weighed to obtain information on the amount of precipitation and then stored in 6 ml glass bottles during the 66 day observation 145 precipitation samples were collected for stable water isotopic analysis via the co2 h2 h2o equilibration method using a mat253 thermo fisher scientific usa manufactured in germany with a gas bench thermo fisher scientific usa at the faculty of environmental earth science hokkaido university analytical errors root mean square error of the internal standards were 0 72 for δ 2h 0 11 for δ 18o and 1 05 for d excess during the entire procedure table 1 2 3 numerical experiment 2 3 1 model in this study the isotopic composition was simulated by using an isotopic regional spectral model isorsm yoshimura et al 2010 the basic design of the isorsm was the same as that in l2021 and the following text is derived from there with minor modifications the major physics schemes used in the model include longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations chou and suarez 1994 cloud microphysics slingo 1987 the relaxed arakawa schubert deep convection moorthi and suarez 1992 shallow convection tiedtke 1983 the noah land surface model ek et al 2003 a non local vertical diffusion scheme for the planetary boundary layer hong and pan 1998 and the orographic gravity wave drag and mountain blocking parameterization alpert et al 1988 a spectral nudging technique is used in this study to improve the isorsm s simulation kanamaru and kanamitsu 2007 kanamitsu et al 2010 yoshimura and kanamitsu 2009 2008 the model was designed to cover parts of east asia and the northwest pacific ocean 105 82 e 178 43 e 10 13 n 63 41 n where the domain center is located at 142 e and 42 n fig 1 all simulations were performed from 0000 utc on november 24 2014 to 0000 utc on february 4 2015 according to previous studies li et al 2021 sodemann et al 2009 yoshimura et al 2010 the first 6 day of each simulation was regarded as the spinup period to reduce the initial atmospheric water vapor a horizontal resolution of 10 km and 28 vertical sigma levels were used the time step for model integration was 20 s to clarify the moisture sources moisture originating from different prespecified sources is tagged with different tracers water vapor tracers so called water tagging were incorporated into the isorsm to replace the isotopic tracers this water tagging method was developed by yoshimura et al 2004 and is called colored moisture analysis cma eight evaporative source regions are defined for cma according to geographical borders as shown in fig 1 and listed as follows kuroshio region north pacific ocean sea of japan west pacific ocean east china sea tropical pacific ocean indian ocean and east asian continent 2 3 2 data the lateral boundary and initial conditions for the isorsm were taken from the isotopic global spectral model isogsm yoshimura et al 2008 simulation the surface boundary conditions of the sea surface temperature and sea ice distribution for the isorsm and isogsm were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration optimum interpolation sea surface temperature v2 noaa oisst v2 reynolds et al 2002 the initial time for the isogsm was set at 0000 utc on june 1 2014 and the spinup period was about 6 months the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 was used for spectral nudging in the isorsm and isogsm the jra 55 national centers for environmental prediction department of energy reanalysis 2 ncep doe r2 and observed isotopic values of precipitation at sapporo were used to validate the isorsm s simulation the cyclones tracks with corresponding minimum central pressures were extracted from the isorsm and jra 55 for comparison in this study a cyclone with a radius larger than 300 km was tracked over the model domain with a 6 h time interval the nearest cyclones with distance less than 600 km between the centers were considered as one cyclone minimum sea level pressure within the cyclone was identified as cyclone center details of the tracking algorithm are described in iizuka et al 2013 and tsukijihara et al 2019 cyclones traced for longer than 24 h with minimum sea level pressure less than 990 hpa were selected as intensified extratropical cyclones during the observation period ten intensified extratropical cyclones approached northern japan all of them are explosive extratropical cyclones according to the definition in yoshiike and kawamura 2009 these cyclones were classified as sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone according to the routes of the cyclone center that migrated from the sea of japan and from the kuroshio region and north pacific ocean respectively the time series and scatter diagrams of all observed and corresponding model simulated δ 2h δ 18o and d excess in the precipitation at sapporo are shown in fig s1 and s2 respectively due to high correlation and similarity between the δ 2h and δ 18o for both observed and simulated results fig s3 we mainly show δ 2h and d excess results in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variations of the isotopic composition and moisture sources in precipitation at sapporo the time series of observed and model simulated isotopic composition and simulated moisture sources in the precipitation at sapporo are displayed in fig 2 the temporal variations of simulated δ 2h and d excess of precipitation showed similar trends with the observed results fig 2a and b the correlation coefficient is 0 82 for δ 2h and 0 55 for d excess both are statistically significant at the 0 1 level for t statistics and comparable to the results in previous studies ichiyanagi et al 2005 kudo et al 2014 takakura et al 2018 tanoue et al 2017 2016 therefore these results suggest the isorsm shows good reproducibility of the isotopic variations in precipitation and is suitable to identify moisture sources of precipitation around japan the simulated and observed d excess showed a considerable discrepancy and relatively low correlation coefficient error analysis was made to know the reasons for the discrepancy as shown in table 1 root mean square error in d excess is 11 14 the error was mainly contributed from simulated error 11 09 and attributable to underestimation 9 16 in the simulation furthermore most of this underestimation of d excess 7 63 was due to overestimation of δ 18o 0 95 table 1 this probably results from underestimation of kinetic fractionation during evaporation in marine boundary layer as suggested by steen larsen et al 2017 in addition error in δ 2h 23 28 was much larger than error in d excess 11 14 and highly correlated with error in δ 18o the large total error with high correlation between δ 2h and δ 18o mainly arose from the simulated error this was probably attributable to simulated uncertainty on the time evolution intensity track of cyclones and so on for example the error in δ 2h decreased from 23 28 fig s1 to 11 52 fig 2 if 12 hr weighted averaged isotopic data was used instead of the raw data as will be revealed in section 3 2 1 shift of the simulated cyclonic track could also result in simulated errors in both δ 2h and δ 18o with high correlation the temperature effect and amount effect on δ 2h of precipitation at sapporo are shown in table 2 values of δ 2h were positively correlated with air temperature and negatively correlated with the amount of precipitation at the sampling site however the temperature effect and amount effect accounted for only 12 and 9 of the variations in δ 2h respectively table 2 this indicates the isotopic composition of precipitation may be affected by other factors such as moisture source cyclone track cyclone structure and so on to investigate the moisture source in precipitation and its effect on the isotopic composition the contribution of each water origin to the total precipitable water and condensation at sapporo is shown in fig 2c and 2d the total precipitable water at sapporo exhibited intriguing characteristics with a large fluctuation and replacement of water origins fig 2c the temporal variation in the proportion of each water origin of condensation is very similar to that of precipitable water most of the moisture sources of condensation at sapporo originated from the sea of japan the north pacific ocean and the kuroshio region fig 2d during the observation period ten intensified extratropical cyclones approached northern japan including six sea of japan cyclones j1 j2 j3 j4 j5 and j6 and four pacific cyclones p1 p2 p3 and p4 the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone were shown as solid lines and dashed lines in fig 2 respectively the temporal variations of isotopic composition and moisture sources in precipitation at sapporo were affected by the route of the cyclone during the passage of the sea of japan cyclone values of δ 2h of precipitation increased or showed relatively high values with an increase of moisture principally from the sea of japan the kuroshio region and other tropical regions whereas δ 2h decreased or showed relatively low values with an increase of moisture mainly from the sea of japan the kuroshio region and the north pacific ocean during the passage of pacific cyclone fig 2a c d and table 3 the isotopic results are consistent with previous studies showing a more southerly route with lower δ values kurita et al 2015 lawrence et al 1982 li et al 2017 however interpretations on water origins with lower δ values are different among studies kurita et al 2015 suggested the low δ of precipitation in central japan was brought by the cold air mass from the north as indicated by lower air potential temperature during passage of the southern coastal cyclone the southern coastal cyclone is defined as southeast low pressure system in li et al 2017 and pacific cyclone in this study in contrast li et al 2017 argued that the precipitation with low δ values in northern japan was brought by the warm air masses from the south resulting from rainout effect in the upstream regions based on air mass back trajectory analysis therefore the effect of cyclone route on the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation are still not fully understood our results showed that most of the precipitable water and condensation at sapporo was from the sea of japan the north pacific ocean and the kuroshio region fig 2c and d the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation at sapporo were affected by the cyclone routes precipitation induced by the pacific cyclone showed lower δ with more moisture originating from the north pacific ocean whereas the sea of japan cyclone brought precipitation with higher δ and more vapors from the kuroshio region to clarify the reasons for the differences in isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation between the pacific cyclone and sea of japan cyclone the spatial distributions of isotopic composition and major water origins within the cyclone system will be presented in the next subsection 3 2 spatial distribution of the isotopic composition and moisture sources within extratropical cyclone system 3 2 1 tracks and central pressures of the cyclones considering the time evolution during the development of explosive extratropical cyclone time with the maximum deepening rate was selected as the deepening stage according to explosive cyclone with around 24 h of the rapid deepening period kuwano yoshida and asuma 2008 li et al 2021 sanders and gyakum 1980 yoshida and asuma 2004 12 h before and after deepening stage were chosen as the early and mature stages respectively among the 10 intensified explosive extratropical cyclones three sea of japan cyclones j2 j5 and j6 and three pacific cyclones p1 p3 and p4 with the cyclone center closer to japan at deepening and mature stages were selected for cyclone based analyses the selected cyclones tracks with corresponding central pressures from the model were compared with those extracted from the jra 55 dataset fig 3 overall the simulation shows good correspondence with the jra 55 results for the time evolution of route and intensity of the six cyclones for j2 and p1 cyclones the simulated tracks shifted closer to the observation site in the late period as compared with the jra 55 results fig 3a the discrepancies of the tracks were probably caused by the model s resolution and the choice of physics schemes on convection and planetary boundary layer as suggested by previous studies lamraoui et al 2019 sodemann et al 2009 the spatial distributions of the simulated sea level pressure showed a pattern very similar to the reanalysis results from jra 55 fig s4 the simulated δ 2h was lower than the observed results for j2 and p1 previous study showed δ values are the lowest near the cyclone center due to larger rainout effect with higher cloud top gedzelman and lawrence 1990 therefore the lower simulated δ 2h for j2 and p1 can be explained by the simulated centers closer to the observation site regarding development of explosive extratropical cyclones the sea of japan cyclones showed lower maximum deepening rates with higher minimum central pressures especially for j5 and j6 in contrast the pacific cyclones exhibited higher maximum deepening rates with lower minimum central pressures p1 cyclone had the highest maximum deepening rate and lowest minimum central pressure among all cyclones fig 3b this corresponds well with the findings in previous studies kuwano yoshida and asuma 2008 yoshida and asuma 2004 3 2 2 similarity of the stable isotopes and water origins among cyclones with respect to moisture transport within the extratropical cyclone system three main airstreams in the conveyor belt model are responsible for most moisture transport and characterized as below the warm conveyor belt the cold conveyor belt and the dry intrusion carlson 1980 hirata et al 2018 2015 li et al 2021 raveh rubin 2017 the warm conveyor belt is a poleward meridional ascending flow with warm and moist air along the cold front within the warm sector the cold conveyor belt is a low level zonal flow with cold and relatively moist air along the warm front within the poleward cold sector the dry intrusion is a descending airstream from the vicinity of the tropopause with cold and dry air along the cold front in the western cold sector vapors condensing in cold and eastern warm fronts were principally transported by the warm conveyor belt from the warm sector whereas moisture in western warm front and near the cyclone center was mainly transported by the cold conveyor belt from the poleward cold sector in addition vapors of post cold frontal condensation were transported by the dry intrusion from the western warm sector figs 4 and 5 show the spatial distribution of the model simulated moisture sources and isotopic composition of precipitable water and condensation for the selected three sea of japan cyclones j2 j5 and j6 and three pacific cyclones p1 p3 and p4 regarding moisture source and isotopic composition precipitation exhibited similar spatial distribution patterns to the condensation results fig s5 compared with that of condensation slightly higher δ 2h and lower d excess of precipitation were attributable to evaporation of condensate and isotopic exchange between condensate and water vapor in ambient atmosphere kinetic fractionation during evaporation under unsaturated ambient atmosphere increases the δ values and decreases d excess of liquid water and precipitation in addition isotope exchange increases the δ values due to higher δ values of the surrounding vapor compared with the vapor in the cloud when the condensate formed in the higher altitude overall the spatial distribution patterns within the cyclone system are similar between the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone a large amount of total precipitable water with salient moisture flux zone is intimately related to the warm conveyor belt fig 4a and c large amounts of condensation along the west and north edges of the moisture flux zone were observed in the cold and eastern warm fronts for each cyclone fig 5a and c in addition intermediate condensation stretching northwestward from the moisture flux zone to the inner region of cyclone correspond to the western warm front for each cyclone fig 5a and d regarding each water origin with corresponding isotopic composition for both the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone large amounts of moisture from the kuroshio region were transported northward along the warm conveyor belts fig 4c the moisture condensed principally in the cold and eastern warm fronts fig 5c with higher δ 2h and d excess fig 5e and f the high δ 2h and d excess of condensation in the cold and eastern warm fronts were due to moisture from the kuroshio region with high δ 2h 99 86 and d excess 12 22 this resulted from a relatively high sea surface temperature 15 19 and low humidity 70 80 during evaporation on the kuroshio sea surface fig 4e f and table 4 in contrast vapors from the north pacific ocean were transported northwestward into the cyclone center area by the cold conveyor belt in the north side of the moisture flux zone fig 4d the vapors contributed more condensation to the western warm front and the vicinity of the cyclone center fig 5d with lower δ 2h and d excess fig 5e and f the low δ 2h and d excess of condensation were attributable to moisture originating from the north pacific ocean with low δ 2h 165 115 and d excess 9 18 this could arise from a relatively low sea surface temperature 2 5 and high humidity 75 90 during evaporation on the north pacific ocean surface fig 4e f and table 4 compared with the north pacific ocean relatively high sea surface temperature and low humidity were observed in the kuroshio region this is consistent with the global climatology of sea surface temperature and humidity in previous study aemisegger and papritz 2018 the δ 2h of condensation showed a decreasing trend along the cold and warm fronts toward the cyclone center which reflects the upstream rainout effect besides higher sst in the kuroshio region could enhance this rainout effect and reduce δ 2h of condensation along the cold front higher sst enhanced evaporation in the kuroshio region and subsequent larger rainfall along the cold front this is consistent with previous study showing higher sst resulted in lower δ of precipitation lachniet 2009 however the negative sst effect during the rainout process along the cold front is smaller than the positive sst effect during the evaporation process between the kuroshio region and the north pacific ocean because the decrease of δ 2h along the cold front was smaller than the difference of δ 2h between the western warm front and the cold and eastern warm fronts in addition vapors from the sea of japan were transported northeastward by the dry intrusion on the west side of the moisture flux zone fig 4b the vapors then condensed near the cyclone center and west coast of japan fig 5b with decreasing δ 2h and d excess from the south to north fig 5e and f the decreasing δ 2h and d excess were caused by moisture from the sea of japan with decreasing δ 2h and d excess from the south to north fig 4e and f this resulted from the poleward decreasing sea surface temperature and increasing humidity on the sea of japan surface fig 4e and f these spatial distributions of the isotopic composition and moisture sources are consistent with that in l2021 based on one cyclone migrating over the sea of japan our results suggest that the spatial distribution patterns of the isotopic composition and moisture sources within the extratropical cyclone system are not affected by the cyclone track condensation originated from the north pacific ocean had lower δ 2h and d excess than that from the kuroshio region for both the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone the lower δ 2h and d excess were attributable to relatively low sea surface temperature and high relative humidity on the north pacific ocean surface 3 2 3 differences of the stable isotopes and water origins among cyclones there are some differences between the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone regarding moisture source and isotopic composition along warm and cold fronts extent of condensation along the warm front originated from the north pacific ocean for the sea of japan cyclones especially for j5 and j6 was smaller than the pacific cyclones this can be explained by the maximum deepening rate for explosive extratropical cyclones generally explosive cyclones with higher maximum deepening rate showed a stronger warm front among the six explosive cyclones j5 and j6 with lower maximum deepening rate exhibited a much weaker warm front in contrast p1 with the highest maximum deepening rate showed the strongest warm front fig 3b and fig 5d in addition the cold front of the pacific cyclones especially for p3 and p4 showed relatively low δ 2h and d excess fig 5e and f with small amounts of condensation originated from the kuroshio region fig 5c while large amounts of condensation were contributed from the tropical pacific ocean and other remote tropical oceans moisture from the remote tropical oceans could lower the δ 2h and d excess of the cold frontal condensation for the pacific cyclone this was attributable to high humidity on the tropical sea surface during evaporation and subsequent rainout effect in the upstream region with active convection activities during moisture transport therefore low δ 2h of precipitation at sapporo induced by the pacific cyclone was caused by moisture originating from the north pacific ocean with relatively low δ 2h resulting from a lower sea surface temperature in the north pacific ocean during evaporation in contrast high δ 2h of precipitation at sapporo triggered by the sea of japan cyclone was attributable to more moisture from the kuroshio region with relatively high δ 2h arising from a higher sea surface temperature in the kuroshio region here we found there were characteristic spatial distribution patterns of the isotopic composition and moisture sources within the extratropical cyclone system cyclonic track influenced the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation at sapporo to investigate whether the effect of cyclonic track on isotopic composition found at sapporo exists in the vicinity of japan accumulated condensation results for each cyclone will be presented in the next subsection 3 3 effect of cyclone route on the stable isotopes and moisture sources in the vicinity of japan in subsection 3 2 we found intriguing characteristics of isotopic composition and their corresponding water origins within the extratropical cyclone frontal system between the sea of japan and pacific cyclones besides cyclonic track affected the isotopic signal at sapporo through changing the moisture sources however it s unclear whether cyclone routes influence isotopic geographic distributions around japan which are important for hydrological and paleoclimate studies to investigate the effect of cyclone route on isotopic geographic distributions the spatial distributions of the model simulated isotopic composition and moisture sources of 24 h accumulated condensation during the cyclones intensification are shown in fig 6 the model simulated condensation for each cyclone exhibited similar spatial distribution to the precipitation result obtained from the model and from ncep doe r2 especially regarding area and location of heavy precipitation fig 6 fig s6 and s7 large amounts of condensation were observed in the vicinity of japan with characteristic spatial distributions of moisture sources and isotopic composition for both the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone condensation in southern japan and the adjacent kuroshio region exhibited higher δ 2h and d excess fig 6e and f with moisture principally from the kuroshio region fig 6c on the other hand condensation in northern japan and the neighboring north pacific ocean showed lower δ 2h and d excess fig 6e and f with moisture mainly from the north pacific ocean fig 6d besides condensation on the west coast of japan and the adjacent sea of japan had poleward decreasing δ 2h and d excess fig 6e and f with moisture mainly from the sea of japan fig 6b the characteristic isotopic distributions of condensation can be explained by the corresponding moisture sources and evaporation conditions as described in subsection 3 2 with respect to differences in the stable isotopes and water origins among cyclones the sea of japan cyclone showed higher δ 2h and d excess of condensation in the pacific ocean than in the sea of japan fig 6e and f the higher δ 2h and d excess is attributable to moisture originating from the kuroshio region fig 6c with higher δ 2h and d excess fig 5e and f in contrast higher maximum deepening rate and more southerly cyclonic route fig 3a and b with stronger western warm and cold fronts were observed for the pacific cyclones the pacific cyclone exhibited lower δ 2h and d excess of condensation in the pacific ocean than in the sea of japan fig 6e and f the lower δ 2h and d excess is due to more western warm frontal condensation originated from the north pacific ocean fig 6d with low δ 2h and d excess fig 5e and f furthermore more southerly cyclonic route with higher intensity facilitates pacific cyclone to converge more remote tropical oceanic moisture fig s8 with low d excess and δ 2h along the cold front the low d excess and δ 2h is attributable to relative high humidity during the evaporation process in the tropical oceans and subsequent rainout effect during the transport process in the upstream regions the moisture from remote tropical oceans fig s8 also lowers the δ 2h and d excess of condensation in the pacific ocean compared with p3 and p4 cyclones p1 showed larger amounts of condensation with lower δ 2h and d excess in the northern sea of japan this resulted from the influence of the j3 cyclone as the deepening stage of p1 was overlapped with the mature stage of j3 fig 2 among the sea of japan cyclones j6 cyclone had larger amounts of condensation with lower δ 2h and d excess in the southern japan and kuroshio region the lower δ 2h and d excess was caused by a new cyclogenesis along the cold front of j6 at its deepening and mature stages fig 5a e and f li et al 2017 found shift of cyclone track from northwest to southeast of hokkaido resulted in a 5 40 decrease of δ 18o δ 2h tsukijihara and kawamura 2022 suggested tropical climate regime shift around 1998 1999 and wave train patterns along the asian jet affect the track and development of extratropical cyclone around japan using large ensemble simulations furthermore according to the temperature effect and the effect of cyclonic track on the isotopic composition in hokkaido yamamoto et al 2021 inferred the westerly jet position and the north pacific high intensity based on leaf wax δ 2h of lake sediments then they reconstructed the summer climate in northern japan over the past 17 000 years in this study we clarified the underlying processes responsible for the effect of cyclonic route on the spatial and temporal variations in the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan our results showed in the pacific ocean and pacific side of japan the pacific cyclone induced lower δ and d excess compared with the sea of japan cyclone on the other hand we found the isotopic spatial distribution within the frontal system of extratropical cyclone is not affected by the track of cyclone the isotopic signal of water vapor in each region is relatively stable and distinct with each other according to the geographic location and climate condition because extratropical cyclone is a dominant cyclone and the main source of precipitation in midlatitude regions therefore the phenomena in this study could be found in other midlatitude regions cyclonic route may be an important factor affecting temporal and spatial isotopic variations in precipitation observed for hydrological and environmental studies cyclone track is strongly affected by ocean current and atmospheric circulation and reflects climate change in a longer timescale hayasaki et al 2013 showed track of pacific cyclone shifted northward during non meander of kuroshio current compared with the kuroshio large meander in addition the frequency of pacific cyclones increased significantly in the past 40 years tsukijihara et al 2019 tsukijihara and kawamura 2022 the frequency was projected to increase in the future under the rcp8 5 scenario seiler and zwiers 2016 our results showed that increased frequency of pacific cyclones could decrease the δ values in the pacific ocean and on the pacific side of japan the effect of cyclonic track on δ of precipitation should be considered to interpret records of past δ in precipitation hence our results may also contribute to paleoclimate studies based on tree rings miller et al 2006 stalagmites or other paleo archives in midlatitude regions 4 conclusions this study attempts to clarify the effect of cyclone track on the spatial and temporal variations in isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan for that purpose precipitation was sampled diurnally for isotopic analysis at sapporo northern japan the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan were simulated by using an isotopic regional spectral model and cyclone based analyses were conducted for a winter period from november 30 2014 to february 3 2015 the major findings in this study are briefly summarized as follows 1 with respect to the temporal variations in the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation at sapporo the isotopic temporal variations were affected by the route of cyclone precipitation induced by the sea of japan cyclone showed higher δ 2h which is attributable to moisture from the kuroshio region with relatively high δ 2h while precipitation triggered by the pacific cyclone exhibited lower δ 2h which is due to moisture from the north pacific ocean with relatively low δ 2h 2 regarding the spatial distributions of the isotopic composition and moisture sources within the extratropical cyclone system for both the sea of japan cyclone and the pacific cyclone condensation in the cyclone center and western warm front with lower δ 2h and d excess was principally contributed by vapors transported by the cold conveyor belt from the north pacific ocean with low δ 2h and d excess the low δ 2h and d excess resulted from a low sea surface temperature and high humidity during evaporation in the north pacific ocean in contrast condensation in the cold and eastern warm fronts with higher δ 2h and d excess was attributable to moisture transported by the warm conveyor belt from the kuroshio region with high δ 2h and d excess the high δ 2h and d excess resulted from a high sea surface temperature and high humidity during evaporation in the kuroshio region these are consistent with li et al 2021 based on one cyclone analysis 3 compared with the sea of japan cyclone the pacific cyclone showed higher maximum deepening rates and lower minimum central pressures and exhibited larger amounts of condensation in the warm and cold fronts with more moisture from the north pacific ocean and other remote tropical oceans 4 as for the effect of cyclonic track on geographical distribution of isotopic characteristics in the vicinity of japan the spatial distribution showed a different pattern between the sea of japan cyclone and pacific cyclone when the sea of japan cyclone occurred higher δ 2h and d excess values of condensation were observed in the pacific ocean than that in the sea of japan which is caused by moisture from the kuroshio region with relatively high δ 2h and d excess in contrast during the passage of the pacific cyclone condensation in the pacific ocean exhibited lower δ 2h and d excess due to vapors from the north pacific ocean and other remote tropical regions with relatively low δ 2h and d excess herein we found that the isotopic composition and moisture sources of precipitation in the vicinity of japan were characterized by the route of extratropical cyclone based on isotopic observation and numerical simulation furthermore we clarified the underlying processes responsible for the effect of cyclonic route regarding moisture evaporation transportation and condensation processes in association with extratropical cyclone the effect of cyclonic track on δ of precipitation has been found in eastern usa lawrence et al 1982 and in eastern asia kurita et al 2015 li et al 2017 this effect is attributable to isotopic distribution and moisture transport within the frontal system similar isotopic distribution in association with frontal system of extratropical cyclone has been reported in europe aemisegger et al 2015 weng et al 2021 eastern asia li et al 2021 and usa coplen et al 2008 gedzelman and lawrence 1990 pfahl et al 2012 yoshimura et al 2010 due to the dominance of extratropical cyclone in midlatitude regions and sensitivity of the isotopic composition in precipitation to the cyclone route which reflects atmospheric circulation ocean current and climate change hence the phenomenon and underlying processes highlighted in this study are not specific to eastern asia we suggest that they could be applied in other midlatitude regions and for hydrological atmospheric and paleoclimate studies the isotopic composition and moisture sources are sensitive to the cyclonic track the reproducibility of the cyclone s track depends heavily on the model s resolution sodemann et al 2009 and the choice of physics schemes on convection and planetary boundary layer lamraoui et al 2019 moreover the underestimation of d excess was attributable to inadequacies in the parameterization of the kinetic fractionation related to sea surface humidity and wind speed steen larsen et al 2017 therefore higher resolution simulations with further analysis of physical parameterization of marine boundary layer are required to gain a complete understanding of the isotopic composition and moisture sources in association with extratropical cyclone credit authorship contribution statement xiaoyang li formal analysis

3177,although it is well known that precipitation and flood pulses in the langcang mekong river basin lmrb are largely impacted by monsoons it is unclear to what extent flood inundation characteristics i e inundation frequency depth area and timing in the basin respond to different monsoon types and monsoon combined effect i e the indian summer monsoon ism the western north pacific monsoon wnpm and their combined effect iswn in this study flood inundation in the lmrb during 1967 2015 was simulated by a hydrological hydrodynamic model from which the inundation characteristics were extracted and calculated the monsoon impact on inundation characteristics was then quantified using the slope from linear regression model the results show the monsoons and the iswn overall have a positive impact on inundation frequency depth and area while the inundation timing is usually advanced when the wnpm or the iswn strengthens but delayed when the ism strengthens on average a unit change in different monsoons can cause 7 7 14 2 change in inundation frequency 5 3 8 1 change in inundation depth and 4 3 days 5 8 days change in inundation timing for depth which can also lead to 1 0 4 3 change in inundation area and 2 8 days 3 8 days change in inundation timing for area also the relative contributions of different monsoons and spatial distributions of the dominant monsoon were discussed the results indicate different monsoons regulate different inundation characteristics and suggest the coexistence of monsoon impacts if the impact of the iswn is ignored the wnpm will play a more important role than the ism in affecting the inundation keywords inundation characteristics indian summer monsoon western north pacific monsoon monsoon combined effect lancang mekong river basin 1 introduction the lancang mekong river basin lmrb is one of the few flood prone areas in asia with the highest worldwide fatality rates induced by flooding chen et al 2020 a significant increase in basin wide temperature and changes in monsoon patterns have been projected by climate models e g pokhrel et al 2018 and it is expected to cause increases in extreme rainfall which could ultimately drive changes in flood regime of the basin e g lauri et al 2012 wang et al 2017 thus understanding the flood dynamics under climate change in this basin is crucial to its future water resource and flood risk management up to now a series of studies including historical flood evolution e g delgado et al 2010 pokhrel et al 2018 chen et al 2020 and future flood projections e g lauri et al 2012 hoang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 try et al 2020a b have shown signals of increasing floods in the lmrb delgado et al 2010 found the flood frequency increased during the last half century chen et al 2020 also showed both the flood occurrence and maximum magnitude significantly increased during 1985 2018 based on the future climate scenarios try et al 2020a b predicted that the more severe flood magnitudes than under current climate conditions would occur by the end of this century which might cause up to 43 and 55 increases in inundation area and inundation volume respectively with the likelihood of increasing floods in the lmrb it is important to understand how climate change affects the flood regime typically climate change affects flood mainly by rainfall the anomalies in atmospheric general circulation such as monsoon changes can cause regional rainfall change e g yang et al 2019 increasing moisture in the atmosphere due to global warming could also lead to an increase in magnitude and frequency of rainfall e g kunkel et al 2013 in the lmrb fig 1 a a monsoonal climate with distinct wet and dry seasons dominates its hydro climate conditions e g yang et al 2019 over 80 of annual precipitation and 80 90 of discharge occur during may to october which can be attributed to the monsoon costa cabral et al 2008 delgado et al 2012 therefore flood in this basin is mainly dominated by monsoon induced rainfall with other sources being snowmelt from the tibetan plateau and localized tropical storms delgado et al 2012 in general the indian summer monsoon ism and western north pacific monsoon wnpm are two systems regulating the monsoon rainfall in the lmrb e g ding and chan 2005 delgado et al 2012 the rainy season precipitation in the west of lmrb is significantly influenced by the ism while that in the southeastern lmrb is significantly affected by the wnpm yang et al 2019 significant positive correlations between rainfall and the wnpm and ism were found over 29 3 and 12 8 regions in the lmrb respectively fan and luo 2019 more importantly it was found that the interannual variability of the rainy season precipitation in the lmrb is significantly modulated by the combined effect of the ism and wnpm e g yang et al 2019 a positive correlation between rainfall and the combined effect of two monsoons was obtained in the lmrb yang et al 2019 further studies on the monsoon impact on rainfall were also extended to the impact on discharge xue et al 2011 reported the ism impacts on annual mean discharge in the middle to lower reaches of the mekong river a positive relationship between the wnpm and discharge averaged from june to november in the southern lmrb regions was found by delgado et al 2012 similar results were also reported by fan and luo 2019 where they showed the downstream river flow from june to september is modulated by the wnpm in addition to the studies of monsoon impacts on rainfall and discharge the study of monsoon impacts on flood pulse characteristics across the lmrb was caried out by wang et al 2022 it was found that the flood start date was advanced while q 10 and flood volume increased during the strong monsoon years however the flood represented by discharge in wang et al 2022 does not necessarily provide valuable information on the damage caused by flood which is due to the fact that river characteristics such as the river channel passing capacity at different locations can significantly affect the flood damage instead the flood represented by inundation a visual response of water level discharge to heavy storms and critical to the social damage of the flood can provide more information on flood damage nevertheless few studies have assessed the monsoon impact on inundation it is still unclear how monsoons affect inundation in the lmrb which is important to the research of climate related disasters in the basin usually there are several approaches available for assessing the monsoon impact on flood observation in particular is a commonly used method to analyze the monsoon impact on flood delgado et al 2012 and räsänen and kummu 2013 have separately studied the impacts of monsoons and el niño southern oscillation on flood where the in situ flood discharges upstream of the cambodian and vietnamese mekong river floodplains i e the cambodian and vietnamese parts of the lmrb cvm were focused chen et al 2021 also used observed water level in the tonle sap lake tsl to analyze the impacts of el niño southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation and the indian ocean dipole on flood pulse parameters however the analyzes based on observation are hard to extend across the whole river basin due to the limited in situ stations assessment of the impacts of climate variables such as the summer monsoon on flood could also be biased if limited in situ stations were used wang et al 2022 further remote sensing can also be used to analyze the monsoon impact on flood at regional scales but it suffers from data deficiencies due to the issues of the satellite repeat cycle cloud cover and vegetation e g ji et al 2018 boergens et al 2019 shin et al 2020 hydrological models can provide basin wide discharge which can further provide inundation by a discharge rating curve but this is not an ideal tool for flood inundation due to the backwater effect and channel bifurcation in the lower floodplain e g cvm in particular a unique flow reversal between the tsl and the mekong river mainstream is formed during may to september kummu et al 2014 making the hydrological regime more complex a hydrodynamic model considering the backwater effect and channel bifurcation is therefore needed to simulate flood inundation in this basin in view of the research gap identified above i e unclear knowledge of monsoon impacts on flood inundation and approach available i e hydrodynamic modeling this study aims to analyze the monsoon impact on flood inundation i e inundation depth frequency area and timing in the lmrb with a special focus on the cvm regions i e the frequently flooded regions in the basin fig 1b a hydrodynamic model was used to generate flood inundation characteristics with monsoons indices collected and calculated to represent the monsoon strengths then the slope from linear regression was used to quantify the monsoon impact on inundation characteristics the relative contributions of the monsoon to flood inundation and spatial distributions of the dominant monsoon i e the monsoon with the largest contribution to inundation in affecting flood inundation were also discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 model description the catchment based marco scale floodplain model cama flood v3 6 2 yamazaki et al 2013 considering the regional parameterization wang et al 2021 was used to simulate flood inundation depth at 500 m spatial resolution with a variable infiltration capacity vic v4 20d liang et al 1994 liang et al 1996 model providing runoff at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 as the input the meteorological forcing data including precipitation temperature and wind speed during the period from 1961 to 2015 to run the vic model were collected from cn05 1 wu and gao 2013 asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration toward the evaluation of water resource yatagai et al 2009 and princeton hydrological dataset sheffield et al 2006 the spin up period for both models was 1961 1966 while the calibration period was set to 1967 2007 in situ water level and discharge series at nineteen hydrological stations see fig 1 for the gauging station spatial distribution mainly collected from henck et al 2011 mohammed et al 2018 annual hydrological reports of china and mekong river commission were used to calibrate the model parameters further details on model inputs calibration and model settings are given in wang et al 2021 the daily moderate resolution imaging spectrometer based water surface database modis ji et al 2018 from 2001 to 2015 and monthly landsat based global surface water dataset gsw pekel et al 2016 from 1987 to 2015 were also collected as flood inundation validation datasets here since these two remote sensing datasets do not contain inundation depth information floodplain with an inundation depth over 0 1 m and river channel in the model were considered to be inundated to make full comparisons with modis and gsw by following wang et al 2021 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient pearson correlation coefficient and relative error were used to assess the model performance at gauging stations because of the impacts caused by cloud vegetation cover and the satellite repeat cycle e g ji et al 2018 boergens et al 2019 shin et al 2020 only the probability of detection based on wu et al 2014 was calculated to evaluate the model performance in simulating flood inundation during the flood season here the probability of detection was defined as the ratio of the simultaneous inundation occurrence frequency i e the number of inundation days which occurred for both the model and remote sensing dataset modis or gsw to the inundation occurrence frequency that occurred for the remote sensing dataset referring to delgado et al 2012 and triet et al 2020 the flood season was defined as a period from june to november and the non flood season was from december to may 2 2 monsoon index daily monsoon index data based on the definition of wang et al 2001 were collected from the asia pacific data research center the mean value of this index data from june to september each year was then calculated to represent the monsoon intensity for each year a simple sum of the ism and wnpm indices with the same weights developed by yang et al 2019 was also adopted to characterize the monsoon combined effect iswn the abbreviation of ism wnpm assumed to be a monsoon for an easier description hereafter these three monsoon indices were then normalized see fig 2 and used to analyze the monsoon impact on flood inundation 2 3 inundation characteristics the inundation in the flood season was considered in this study a grid for floodplain or river channel with the simulated inundation depth of 0 50 m or greater was thought to be inundated catastrophically and was used for the analyses of monsoon impact in the following this threshold of 0 50 m for flood inundation has also been used by try et al 2018 try et al 2020c and triet et al 2018 triet et al 2020 four inundation characteristics were used frequency depth area and timing for flood peak the first two and the third one were addressed at grid and regional scales respectively while the last one was considered both at grid and regional scales the inundation frequency for a year was defined as the ratio of days with inundation to the whole duration of the flood season the variables for inundation depth are the average inundation depth and maximum inundation depth which were defined as the annual mean and maximum values of inundation depths respectively similarly two variables characterizing the inundation area i e mean inundation area and maximum inundation area were separately defined as the annual mean and maximum values of inundation areas and calculated year after year here the inundation area for a particular day was calculated as the sum of the grid areas for grids that are inundated two inundation timing variables i e depth and area were also considered in this study i e the maximum inundation depth time i e the day of the year that the maximum inundation depth occurs at grid scale and the maximum inundation area time i e the day of the year that the maximum inundation area occurs at regional scale where the inundation timing for area was analyzed in the characteristic of inundation area for convenience 2 4 analysis of monsoon impact the p value calculated from a significance test of the pearson correlation coefficient between the inundation variable and monsoon index two tailed t test was adopted to characterize the monsoon impact on inundation referring to the practice of the definition of monsoon anomaly e g wang et al 2001 li et al 2016 which treats the monsoon as strong or weak when the normalized monsoon index exceeds one standard deviation σ a p value of 0 32 0 146 for pearson correlation coefficient in this paper corresponding to one σ criteria was used as the threshold of the monsoon impact on inundation this option considered the model capacity in modeling the floods where the floods are the high value parts of discharge water level and are always underestimated in modeling practice e g wang et al 2021 when the p value in a given region is no more than 0 32 the impact of monsoon on inundation in this region exists and this region can be treated as a monsoon impact region otherwise the impact is ignored delgado et al 2012 also thought that a station with pearson correlation coefficient less than 0 1 meant the flood in this station was not affected by the monsoon in addition regions with p values no more than 0 05 and 0 10 generally used to indicate significance were also marked to reflect a significant impact of the monsoon on inundation but only the results of p values no more than 0 05 were presented in the results for reference the slope from the linear regression model eq 1 hameed et al 1997 was used to obtain the inundation response to one unit change in the monsoon index 1 y a x b ε where y is the inundation variable e g depth frequency x is the normalized monsoon index a b are the slope and constant respectively ε is the error if the slope is positive or negative then the monsoon impact on inundation is considered positive or negative that is the inundation increases or decreases when the monsoon strengthens i e monsoon index increases to characterize the percentage change of inundation the long term average value was used which was calculated as the average value of the inundation variable for the days with inundation then the slope dividing by the long term average value was taken as the percentage change of flood inundation see eq 2 2 y y avg y avg a y avg x b y avg 1 ε in which yavg is the long term average value a yavg was the percentage change of flood inundation a multi linear regression model eqs 3 4 üneş et al 2020 was also used to characterize the relative contributions of monsoons to inundation and identify the spatial distribution of the dominant monsoon i e the monsoon with largest relative contribution in affecting inundation 3 y i 1 n a i x i a 0 ε 4 r i a i i 1 n a i where ai i 0 1 n is the regression coefficient xi ri i 1 2 3 for this issue are the normalized monsoon index and relative contribution for each xi respectively y is the inundation variable a similar approach has also been applied by wang et al 2020 here if the monsoon impact on inundation does not exist i e p value over 0 32 then this type of monsoon was excluded in the multi linear regression analysis note that the iswn index is a simple sum of the ism and wnpm indices though it was normalized before analysis see section 2 2 suggesting that multicollinearity could exist between the ism or wnpm and the iswn the ridge regression was then applied in the solution procedure of the multi linear regression model and details on this can be seen in hoerl and kennard 1970 3 results 3 1 model validation the simulated and observed long term flood season water levels near or located in the frequently flooded regions are shown in fig 3 the results for simulated and observed water levels show that the water levels are well simulated with relative errors less than 10 and pearson correlation coefficients larger than 0 9 at most stations the daily nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients are all no less than 0 84 at five out seven stations also the simulations of water level variation at stations i e prek kdam and kompong luong on the tonle sap river tsr and tsl indicate the reverse flow into the tsl from the mekong river mainstem could be simulated with satisfactory performance by the hydrodynamic model that considers the backwater effect however the performance of water level at can tho and my thuan stations is poor where these two stations are located near the mekong river estuary there are two main possible explanations for this firstly these two stations are strongly affected by the tide backwater effect peng et al 2020 and secondly river bed mining in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd which can be traced back to 1990s park et al 2020 causes the water level to be reduced fig 3f the lower observed water levels after 1995 than before these two factors were not considered in the model and thus may cause the poor performance it is noted that the water levels at stations such as kompong luong and chau doc show obvious high values in december and the following january this could be attributed to the release of water from the tsl in these months when the water level in the tsl is higher than the vmd kummu et al 2014 wang et al 2021 which therefore maintains the high water levels at these stations the flood season spatial inundation map comparisons with modis and gsw are illustrated in fig 4 the results show that the model can capture the spatial inundation distribution well especially in the tsl and vmd where inundation occurs frequently during the flood season fig 4 on average 84 2 of the inundation occurrence frequency for modis is captured by the model in these regions i e the average probability of detection is 0 842 similar results are also obtained by using monthly gsw it shows 88 8 of the inundation occurrence frequency of gsw is captured note the difference between the gsw and modis in the tsl regions fig 4a 4b i e more flooded regions are derived by gsw potentially indicating the gsw has a better land surface waterbody detection capacity considering the frequently flooded regions are mainly located in the cvm inundation analyses were therefore mainly focused on the cvm in the following sections fig 5 illustrates how the mean flood season water level changes with the monsoon index at the selected stations it is found that the slope between the simulated water level and monsoon index is smaller than that between the observed water level and monsoon index at most stations nevertheless the tendency between the mean water level and monsoon index is well captured by the model suggesting the model can be used to characterize the monsoon impact on inundation also the p value calculated from the simulated water level and monsoon index is generally larger than that calculated from the observed value indicating the threshold of p value to distinguish the monsoon impact on inundation should be higher than 0 05 or 0 10 to contain more grids in which the inundation is truly affected by the monsoon this may prove the reasonability of the p value of 0 32 as the threshold of monsoon impacts on inundation additionally it is worthy to note that though the water levels at can tho and my thuan are poorly simulated the tendency between observed mean water level and monsoon index is reproduced by the model in most cases but with a higher slope and lower p value 3 2 impact on inundation frequency the impacts of monsoons on inundation frequency are shown in fig 6 the results show the inundation frequency mainly increases when the monsoon strengthens i e a positive impact this could be attributed to the long retention time caused by the limited flood carrying capacity usually when the monsoon strengthens then the rainfall and flood volume could be larger delgado et al 2012 yang et al 2019 if given the unchanged flood carrying capacity the water flow out of the river cross section could be limited thus causing longer residence time and subsequently larger inundation frequency for the ism regions showing a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency are mainly in the outer tsl fig 6a while for the wnpm and the iswn regions with a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency are mainly in the middle tsl the inner tsl is the permanent water body northern vmd tsr and the section between the phnom penh i e confluence of the mekong river and tsr and stung treng station hereafter abbreviated as pp st section the difference in spatial distributions might be caused by the different impact areas of the monsoon on rainfall see yang et al 2019 fan and luo 2019 wang et al 2022 further analysis of inundation pixel statistics indicates that 85 9 of the ism impact regions have a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency fig 6a while the percentages for the wnpm and the iswn are 96 5 and 97 3 respectively fig 6b 6c in the regions with a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency a unit increase in any one of the three monsoon indices can lead on average to an increase of 0 03 in inundation frequency i e the average slope between any one monsoon index and the inundation frequency is 0 03 when considering the percentage change of inundation frequency caused by monsoons these increases in inundation frequency are 14 2 for the ism 7 7 for the wnpm and 8 6 for the iswn respectively in addition the proportions of the region significantly affected by the monsoon p value no more than 0 05 to that affected by the monsoon p value no more than 0 32 are 17 3 for the ism 68 8 for the wnpm and 69 0 for the iswn respectively this indicates the inundation frequency for over half of the wnpm and the iswn impact regions is significantly affected by monsoons in the regions significantly affected by the ism 89 6 of the regions show a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency with an average slope of 0 06 21 8 for percentage change for the wnpm 99 5 of significantly affected regions have a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency and the average slope for these regions with a positive monsoon impact is 0 03 6 1 similar results can be found for the iswn 99 6 of the significantly affected regions show a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency and in these significantly affected regions with a positive monsoon impact a unit increase in the iswn index can cause a 0 03 7 2 increase in inundation frequency 3 3 impact on inundation timing fig 7 illustrates the monsoon impact on inundation timing at grid scale i e inundation timing for depth the results reveal that the maximum inundation depth time is mainly delayed when the ism strengthens i e a positive impact in contrast to the ism the wnpm and the iswn mainly show negative impacts on maximum inundation depth time fig 7b 7c the reason for the negative monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time is related to the positive relationship between discharge in the southern lmrb and the wnpm delgado et al 2012 wang et al 2022 that is when the wnpm strengthens the discharge inputting to the cvm system is larger causing a higher water level outside the cvm the maximum inundation depth time could be advanced due to the larger difference in water levels between the outside and inside of the cvm however due to the backwater effect in the lower regions e g vmd during the flood season the flow of water induced by the ism in the cvm may be greatly restricted where discharge affected by the ism in this region is mainly from local rainfall instead of the mekong river mainstream see fan and luo 2019 it therefore causes a positive ism impact on maximum inundation depth time further the superposition of the positive impact of the ism and negative impact of the wnpm can cause the impact of the iswn on maximum inundation depth time to be either similar to the ism or similar to the wnpm or even diminish fig 7c the regions showing a positive ism impact on maximum inundation depth time are mainly distributed in the tsl pp st section and tsr while those showing a negative wnpm impact on maximum inundation depth time are mainly in the tsl tsr northern and southern vmds the regions with a negative iswn impact on maximum inundation depth time are in the southern vmd while those with a positive iswn impact are in the pp st section this spatial distribution of the iswn impact is mainly caused by the trade off between the impacts of the ism and wnpm on maximum inundation depth time 95 7 of the ism impact regions have a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time fig 7a while the proportions for the regions showing a negative monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time are 99 2 for the wnpm and 84 1 for the iswn respectively a unit increase in the ism index in the regions with a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time can lead to on average 4 6 days delay 1 5 change in maximum inundation depth time while the same change in the wnpm index in the regions with a negative monsoon impact can on average advance maximum inundation depth time by 4 3 days 1 5 change the number for the iswn is 5 8 days i e 2 0 change further results show that 71 1 of the ism impact regions are with a significant monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time fig 7d and these values for the wnpm and the iswn are 21 2 and 22 3 respectively for the ism significant impact regions almost all portions are with a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time and a unit increase in ism index can cause on average 4 4 days delay 1 4 change in maximum inundation depth time 3 4 impact on inundation depth fig 8 shows the monsoon impacts on average inundation depth the results show the average inundation depth increases when the monsoon strengthens i e a positive impact this could be attributed to the larger flood volume caused by the rainy season precipitation in the years when the monsoon strengthens the regions with a positive ism impact on average inundation depth are mainly distributed in the outer and middle tsls and tsr fig 8a while the wnpm and the iswn positively affect the average inundation depth in the tsl pp st section and northern vmd fig 8b 8c the regions affected by the ism have a proportion of 94 3 with a positive monsoon impact on average inundation depth while the proportions with positive monsoon impacts for regions affected by the wnpm and the iswn are 88 8 and 94 3 respectively for regions with a positive monsoon impact on average inundation depth a unit increase in the ism index can cause 0 10 m 7 0 increase in average inundation depth while those in the wnpm and the iswn indices can separately cause 0 14 m 5 3 and 0 16 m 6 7 increases in average inundation depth for the ism only 17 9 of the monsoon impact regions are with a significant monsoon impact on average inundation depth while the numbers for the wnpm and the iswn are 62 5 and 72 2 further in the regions significantly affected by the wnpm 98 7 of the regions have a positive monsoon impact on average inundation depth and 0 17 m 4 9 increase in average inundation depth can be caused by a unit increase in the wnpm index for these regions with a positive monsoon impact for the iswn 99 1 of the regions significantly affected by it have a positive impact on average inundation depth and a unit increase in its index for these regions with a positive monsoon impact can lead to 0 18 m 6 3 increase in average inundation depth the monsoon impacts on maximum inundation depth are illustrated in fig 9 similar impacts of the monsoon on average inundation depth can also be found on maximum inundation depth i e the maximum inundation depth increases when the monsoon strengthens a positive impact the ism positively affects the maximum inundation depth in the tsl tsr and northern vmd fig 9a while for the wnpm and the iswn the regions showing a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth include the pp st section besides the tsl tsr and northern vmd fig 9b 9c the proportions for the regions with a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth accounting for the monsoon impact regions are 97 2 for the ism 74 5 for the wnpm and 81 8 for the iswn respectively in these regions with a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth a unit increase in the ism index can lead to 0 16 m 6 8 increase in maximum inundation depth while those in the wnpm and iswn indices can lead to 0 20 m 6 0 and 0 25 m 8 1 increases in maximum inundation depth respectively also only 12 7 of the ism impact regions are with a significant monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth while the numbers for the wnpm and the iswn are 51 2 and 61 9 respectively 98 9 of the regions with a significant iswn impact on maximum inundation depth have a positive monsoon impact and 0 29 m 8 0 increase in maximum inundation depth can be caused by a unit increase in the iswn index for these regions with a positive monsoon impact 3 5 impact on inundation area the monsoon impacts on inundation area are shown in fig 10 which could be regarded as a total response of flood inundation to monsoon impacts at grid scale the results show the wnpm and the iswn have a positive impact on the mean inundation area during the flood season fig 10a 10d 10g and these impacts are significant in the tsl and cvm however the ism has lesser impact on the mean inundation area the reason for the positive impact between the wnpm and mean inundation area could be the high positive correlation between the flood volume and wnpm delgado et al 2012 under the given terrain a higher flood volume can lead to a larger inundation area this might be also applied to the iswn as for the ism the lesser impact might be attributed to the low weight of the significantly affected regions in the regions with the ism impact on average inundation depth fig 8d further a unit increase in the wnpm index can lead to increases in mean inundation area in the tsl vmd and cvm of 3 8 1 0 and 2 5 respectively while that in the iswn index can cause the mean inundation area in the tsl vmd and cvm to increase by 4 3 1 1 and 2 7 respectively except for the lesser impact of the wnpm on maximum inundation area in the vmd almost all monsoons have a positive impact on maximum inundation area in the three considered regions for the ism a unit increase in monsoon index can separately lead to 1 9 1 2 and 1 6 increases in maximum inundation area in the tsl vmd and cvm while for the wnpm it can cause 2 8 and 1 9 increases in the tsl and cvm respectively further 3 7 1 4 and 2 7 increases in maximum inundation area in the tsl vmd and cvm can be separately caused by the iswn when its index increases one unit similar to the results of fig 7 the ism has a positive impact on maximum inundation area time in the three analyzed regions while the wnpm has a negative impact on it fig 10c 10f 10i the iswn almost has no impact on maximum inundation area time for the ism a unit increase in the monsoon index can delay the maximum inundation area times in the tsl vmd and cvm by 3 7 days 1 3 3 8 days 1 3 3 2 days 1 1 respectively however a unit increase in the wnpm index can separately lead to the maximum inundation area times in the tsl vmd and cvm being advanced by 3 2 days 1 2 3 6 days 1 3 and 2 8 days 1 0 4 discussion 4 1 dominant monsoon distribution the spatial distributions of the dominant monsoon in affecting the inundation are shown in fig 11 the results reveal that both the wnpm and the iswn have a larger spatial extent than the ism in affecting inundation frequency fig 11a where they control 38 9 and 41 6 of the monsoon impact regions respectively the regions with a dominant iswn impact on inundation frequency are mainly distributed in the outer and middle tsls and pp st section while for the wnpm the regions are mainly in the middle tsl the ism has the largest impact extent in affecting maximum inundation depth time fig 11b by which about 58 8 of the monsoon impact regions e g tsl tsr pp st section are mainly regulated for inundation depth the iswn has the largest spatial impact extent 70 0 of the regions with a monsoon impact on average inundation depth are mainly affected by the iswn while this number on maximum inundation depth is 63 7 the regions dominated by the iswn for the two depths are mainly in the tsl tsr pp ct section and northern vmd fig 11c 11d these indicate the iswn can have a critical role in affecting inundation but it cannot completely replace the ism or the wnpm which means no monsoon can dominate the inundation alone suggesting the spatial coexistence of three monsoons in affecting inundation further decomposition of the iswn impact on inundation i e ignoring the iswn impact shows that the wnpm has a larger spatial impact extent in affecting inundation frequency fig 11e and depth fig 11g 11h whereas the ism has a much larger spatial impact extent in regulating the inundation timing fig 11f the regions with the wnpm impact on inundation frequency average inundation depth and maximum inundation depth account for 72 3 71 0 and 74 0 of the monsoon impact regions respectively this number for regions with the ism impact on maximum inundation depth time is 60 0 in addition the comparisons of the dominant monsoon spatial distributions before and after the iswn decomposition show the iswn dominant region covers most of regions that are dominated by wnpm after decomposition e g fig 11d 11h this could indicate many overlap regions of the iswn and the wnpm in affecting the flood pulses and even rainfall and can be found in wang et al 2022 4 2 monsoon contribution to inundation the relative contributions of three monsoons to inundation are shown in fig 12 the results show the iswn and the wnpm contribute similarly to inundation frequency which are 38 8 and 39 5 respectively for maximum inundation depth time the contribution of the ism is 43 4 while the number for the wnpm is 42 1 which are also similar in the contribution value the iswn contributes most to inundation depth fig 12k 12l where its relative contributions to average inundation depth and maximum inundation depth are 43 1 and 37 2 respectively the contribution difference between the wnpm and the iswn is relatively large for average inundation depth while it is relatively small for maximum inundation depth further analyses of the monsoon contribution to inundation area indicate that the iswn contributes most to the average and maximum inundation areas in the three considered regions while the ism contributes most to the inundation timing for area see fig 10 for reference the iswn was further decomposed into the ism and wnpm and the relative contributions of the monsoon to inundation are shown in fig 13 the results show the contribution of the wnpm to inundation frequency and depth is larger than that of the ism on average the wnpm contributes 70 7 62 0 58 5 to inundation frequency average inundation depth and maximum inundation depth respectively for the maximum inundation depth time the wnpm contributes 54 5 while the number for the ism is 45 5 in addition the wnpm contributes more than the ism to inundation area in most cases for the three considered regions nevertheless the ism contributes more to inundation timing for area i e the day of the year that the maximum inundation area occurs see fig 10 for reference moreover similar results to the dominant monsoon distribution are found by comparison of the monsoon relative contributions before and after decomposition of the iswn where the regions with the iswn contributing to inundation cover most of those with the wnpm contributing to inundation after the decomposition of the iswn this means the decomposition of the iswn changes the monsoon contributions to inundation where the wnpm contributes more to inundation suggesting the wnpm has a larger impact than the ism on inundation 4 3 uncertainty and limitation precipitation is the most crucial uncertainty source for the model which affects the flood volume and thus may have some effects on the analyses of the monsoon impact on inundation nevertheless the precipitation datasets used in this study were carefully selected and one of these datasets has been proven to be one of the best datasets for hydrological modeling in the lmrb e g lauri et al 2014 try et al 2020c moreover the best efforts have been made to decrease the impact caused by precipitation uncertainty through model calibration the simulated results perform well when compared with the observed values the digital elevation map which plays an important role in determining the inundation of a grid is also an important source of uncertainty for the reported results to reduce the impact caused by this uncertainty the inundation that can be simulated by the model i e within the model capacity was considered which could cover a large part of the real inundation nevertheless a high accuracy digital elevation map is still needed to improve the quality of analyses but this may have less influence on the results due to its invariance during the whole simulation period and the relative change of inundation being considered in this paper the threshold for the monsoon impact on inundation is the p value of 0 32 changing the threshold can also have some impacts on the results especially for the quantification of the monsoon impact on flood inundation however this will hardly change the tendency of monsoon impact on inundation this research only provides an initial assessment for the monsoon impact on flood inundation the threshold for the monsoon impact on inundation i e p value is worthy to be further studied where the degree of monsoon impact can be usually underestimated by simulation i e the impact exists in the observation but does not exist in the simulation fig 5 here a lower threshold e g a p value of 0 05 might cause the monsoon impact regions to decrease dramatically thus leading to the loss of much useful information e g the analyses of the spatial distribution of the dominant monsoon since the tidal effect was not considered in the model the inundation dynamics induced by monsoon rainfall in the southern vmd did not reproduce the observations well fig 3f 3g this is also worthy of a further study to assess the inundation separately caused by monsoon rainfall and ocean tide it is noted that the monsoon combined effect iswn was characterized by a simple linear combination of the ism and the wnpm indices following yang et al 2019 a nonlinear superposition or linear superposition with different weights for the iswn could have a higher correlation with precipitation and flood characteristics and is worthy to be studied in future in addition the current study period covers 1967 to 2015 i e 49 years in total extending the analytical period is also of great interest which can provide more robust analyses 5 conclusions this research used the vic and the improved cama flood model to investigate the impacts of the ism the wnpm and their combined effect iswn on flood season inundation over 1967 2015 in the lmrb inundation characteristics including frequency timing depth and area were selected and calculated with the slope from a linear regression model reflecting the impact of the monsoon the spatial distribution of the dominant monsoon and monsoon relative contributions to inundation were also discussed by using a multi linear regression model the water levels in the flood season at most stations were well simulated by the model at five out seven stations the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients were no less than 0 84 and pearson correlation coefficients were larger than 0 90 on average 80 90 of inundation occurrences were captured within the model capacity further results characterizing the flood season water level varying with the monsoon index indicated that the slope from the model was generally underestimated but with the same tendency the ism wnpm and the iswn positively affected inundation frequency depth and area at least 74 5 of the regions had positive monsoon impacts on frequency and depth further the inundation timing for depth or area was delayed when the ism strengthened while it was advanced when the wnpm or the iswn strengthened at least 84 1 of the regions affected by the monsoon showed delayed inundation timing for depth when the ism strengthened and advanced inundation timing for depth when the wnpm or the iswn strengthened respectively for the regions with a positive monsoon impact on inundation a unit increase in different monsoon indices could lead on average to a 7 7 14 2 increase in inundation frequency and 5 3 8 1 increase in inundation depth respectively a unit increase in different monsoon indices could also cause a 1 0 4 3 increase in inundation area moreover a unit increase in different monsoon indices could make the inundation timing for area change by 2 8 days 3 8 days in three considered study regions and made the inundation timing for depth on average change by 4 3 days 5 8 days the wnpm and the iswn dominated the inundation frequency in over 80 of the monsoon impact regions while the ism dominated the inundation timing for depth in over 58 of the monsoon impact regions over 63 of the regions with a monsoon impact on inundation depth were mainly regulated by the iswn similar contributions of the wnpm and the iswn were detected for inundation frequency for inundation timing for depth the ism and wnpm shared similar contributions but the monsoon with the most contribution to inundation timing for area was the ism moreover the iswn contributed most to inundation depth and area further decomposition of the iswn changed the results of the impacts on inundation frequency and depth as well as area where the wnpm contributed more to the inundation and regulated more monsoon impact regions credit authorship contribution statement jie wang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft qiuhong tang conceptualization

3177,although it is well known that precipitation and flood pulses in the langcang mekong river basin lmrb are largely impacted by monsoons it is unclear to what extent flood inundation characteristics i e inundation frequency depth area and timing in the basin respond to different monsoon types and monsoon combined effect i e the indian summer monsoon ism the western north pacific monsoon wnpm and their combined effect iswn in this study flood inundation in the lmrb during 1967 2015 was simulated by a hydrological hydrodynamic model from which the inundation characteristics were extracted and calculated the monsoon impact on inundation characteristics was then quantified using the slope from linear regression model the results show the monsoons and the iswn overall have a positive impact on inundation frequency depth and area while the inundation timing is usually advanced when the wnpm or the iswn strengthens but delayed when the ism strengthens on average a unit change in different monsoons can cause 7 7 14 2 change in inundation frequency 5 3 8 1 change in inundation depth and 4 3 days 5 8 days change in inundation timing for depth which can also lead to 1 0 4 3 change in inundation area and 2 8 days 3 8 days change in inundation timing for area also the relative contributions of different monsoons and spatial distributions of the dominant monsoon were discussed the results indicate different monsoons regulate different inundation characteristics and suggest the coexistence of monsoon impacts if the impact of the iswn is ignored the wnpm will play a more important role than the ism in affecting the inundation keywords inundation characteristics indian summer monsoon western north pacific monsoon monsoon combined effect lancang mekong river basin 1 introduction the lancang mekong river basin lmrb is one of the few flood prone areas in asia with the highest worldwide fatality rates induced by flooding chen et al 2020 a significant increase in basin wide temperature and changes in monsoon patterns have been projected by climate models e g pokhrel et al 2018 and it is expected to cause increases in extreme rainfall which could ultimately drive changes in flood regime of the basin e g lauri et al 2012 wang et al 2017 thus understanding the flood dynamics under climate change in this basin is crucial to its future water resource and flood risk management up to now a series of studies including historical flood evolution e g delgado et al 2010 pokhrel et al 2018 chen et al 2020 and future flood projections e g lauri et al 2012 hoang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 try et al 2020a b have shown signals of increasing floods in the lmrb delgado et al 2010 found the flood frequency increased during the last half century chen et al 2020 also showed both the flood occurrence and maximum magnitude significantly increased during 1985 2018 based on the future climate scenarios try et al 2020a b predicted that the more severe flood magnitudes than under current climate conditions would occur by the end of this century which might cause up to 43 and 55 increases in inundation area and inundation volume respectively with the likelihood of increasing floods in the lmrb it is important to understand how climate change affects the flood regime typically climate change affects flood mainly by rainfall the anomalies in atmospheric general circulation such as monsoon changes can cause regional rainfall change e g yang et al 2019 increasing moisture in the atmosphere due to global warming could also lead to an increase in magnitude and frequency of rainfall e g kunkel et al 2013 in the lmrb fig 1 a a monsoonal climate with distinct wet and dry seasons dominates its hydro climate conditions e g yang et al 2019 over 80 of annual precipitation and 80 90 of discharge occur during may to october which can be attributed to the monsoon costa cabral et al 2008 delgado et al 2012 therefore flood in this basin is mainly dominated by monsoon induced rainfall with other sources being snowmelt from the tibetan plateau and localized tropical storms delgado et al 2012 in general the indian summer monsoon ism and western north pacific monsoon wnpm are two systems regulating the monsoon rainfall in the lmrb e g ding and chan 2005 delgado et al 2012 the rainy season precipitation in the west of lmrb is significantly influenced by the ism while that in the southeastern lmrb is significantly affected by the wnpm yang et al 2019 significant positive correlations between rainfall and the wnpm and ism were found over 29 3 and 12 8 regions in the lmrb respectively fan and luo 2019 more importantly it was found that the interannual variability of the rainy season precipitation in the lmrb is significantly modulated by the combined effect of the ism and wnpm e g yang et al 2019 a positive correlation between rainfall and the combined effect of two monsoons was obtained in the lmrb yang et al 2019 further studies on the monsoon impact on rainfall were also extended to the impact on discharge xue et al 2011 reported the ism impacts on annual mean discharge in the middle to lower reaches of the mekong river a positive relationship between the wnpm and discharge averaged from june to november in the southern lmrb regions was found by delgado et al 2012 similar results were also reported by fan and luo 2019 where they showed the downstream river flow from june to september is modulated by the wnpm in addition to the studies of monsoon impacts on rainfall and discharge the study of monsoon impacts on flood pulse characteristics across the lmrb was caried out by wang et al 2022 it was found that the flood start date was advanced while q 10 and flood volume increased during the strong monsoon years however the flood represented by discharge in wang et al 2022 does not necessarily provide valuable information on the damage caused by flood which is due to the fact that river characteristics such as the river channel passing capacity at different locations can significantly affect the flood damage instead the flood represented by inundation a visual response of water level discharge to heavy storms and critical to the social damage of the flood can provide more information on flood damage nevertheless few studies have assessed the monsoon impact on inundation it is still unclear how monsoons affect inundation in the lmrb which is important to the research of climate related disasters in the basin usually there are several approaches available for assessing the monsoon impact on flood observation in particular is a commonly used method to analyze the monsoon impact on flood delgado et al 2012 and räsänen and kummu 2013 have separately studied the impacts of monsoons and el niño southern oscillation on flood where the in situ flood discharges upstream of the cambodian and vietnamese mekong river floodplains i e the cambodian and vietnamese parts of the lmrb cvm were focused chen et al 2021 also used observed water level in the tonle sap lake tsl to analyze the impacts of el niño southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation and the indian ocean dipole on flood pulse parameters however the analyzes based on observation are hard to extend across the whole river basin due to the limited in situ stations assessment of the impacts of climate variables such as the summer monsoon on flood could also be biased if limited in situ stations were used wang et al 2022 further remote sensing can also be used to analyze the monsoon impact on flood at regional scales but it suffers from data deficiencies due to the issues of the satellite repeat cycle cloud cover and vegetation e g ji et al 2018 boergens et al 2019 shin et al 2020 hydrological models can provide basin wide discharge which can further provide inundation by a discharge rating curve but this is not an ideal tool for flood inundation due to the backwater effect and channel bifurcation in the lower floodplain e g cvm in particular a unique flow reversal between the tsl and the mekong river mainstream is formed during may to september kummu et al 2014 making the hydrological regime more complex a hydrodynamic model considering the backwater effect and channel bifurcation is therefore needed to simulate flood inundation in this basin in view of the research gap identified above i e unclear knowledge of monsoon impacts on flood inundation and approach available i e hydrodynamic modeling this study aims to analyze the monsoon impact on flood inundation i e inundation depth frequency area and timing in the lmrb with a special focus on the cvm regions i e the frequently flooded regions in the basin fig 1b a hydrodynamic model was used to generate flood inundation characteristics with monsoons indices collected and calculated to represent the monsoon strengths then the slope from linear regression was used to quantify the monsoon impact on inundation characteristics the relative contributions of the monsoon to flood inundation and spatial distributions of the dominant monsoon i e the monsoon with the largest contribution to inundation in affecting flood inundation were also discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 model description the catchment based marco scale floodplain model cama flood v3 6 2 yamazaki et al 2013 considering the regional parameterization wang et al 2021 was used to simulate flood inundation depth at 500 m spatial resolution with a variable infiltration capacity vic v4 20d liang et al 1994 liang et al 1996 model providing runoff at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 as the input the meteorological forcing data including precipitation temperature and wind speed during the period from 1961 to 2015 to run the vic model were collected from cn05 1 wu and gao 2013 asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration toward the evaluation of water resource yatagai et al 2009 and princeton hydrological dataset sheffield et al 2006 the spin up period for both models was 1961 1966 while the calibration period was set to 1967 2007 in situ water level and discharge series at nineteen hydrological stations see fig 1 for the gauging station spatial distribution mainly collected from henck et al 2011 mohammed et al 2018 annual hydrological reports of china and mekong river commission were used to calibrate the model parameters further details on model inputs calibration and model settings are given in wang et al 2021 the daily moderate resolution imaging spectrometer based water surface database modis ji et al 2018 from 2001 to 2015 and monthly landsat based global surface water dataset gsw pekel et al 2016 from 1987 to 2015 were also collected as flood inundation validation datasets here since these two remote sensing datasets do not contain inundation depth information floodplain with an inundation depth over 0 1 m and river channel in the model were considered to be inundated to make full comparisons with modis and gsw by following wang et al 2021 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient pearson correlation coefficient and relative error were used to assess the model performance at gauging stations because of the impacts caused by cloud vegetation cover and the satellite repeat cycle e g ji et al 2018 boergens et al 2019 shin et al 2020 only the probability of detection based on wu et al 2014 was calculated to evaluate the model performance in simulating flood inundation during the flood season here the probability of detection was defined as the ratio of the simultaneous inundation occurrence frequency i e the number of inundation days which occurred for both the model and remote sensing dataset modis or gsw to the inundation occurrence frequency that occurred for the remote sensing dataset referring to delgado et al 2012 and triet et al 2020 the flood season was defined as a period from june to november and the non flood season was from december to may 2 2 monsoon index daily monsoon index data based on the definition of wang et al 2001 were collected from the asia pacific data research center the mean value of this index data from june to september each year was then calculated to represent the monsoon intensity for each year a simple sum of the ism and wnpm indices with the same weights developed by yang et al 2019 was also adopted to characterize the monsoon combined effect iswn the abbreviation of ism wnpm assumed to be a monsoon for an easier description hereafter these three monsoon indices were then normalized see fig 2 and used to analyze the monsoon impact on flood inundation 2 3 inundation characteristics the inundation in the flood season was considered in this study a grid for floodplain or river channel with the simulated inundation depth of 0 50 m or greater was thought to be inundated catastrophically and was used for the analyses of monsoon impact in the following this threshold of 0 50 m for flood inundation has also been used by try et al 2018 try et al 2020c and triet et al 2018 triet et al 2020 four inundation characteristics were used frequency depth area and timing for flood peak the first two and the third one were addressed at grid and regional scales respectively while the last one was considered both at grid and regional scales the inundation frequency for a year was defined as the ratio of days with inundation to the whole duration of the flood season the variables for inundation depth are the average inundation depth and maximum inundation depth which were defined as the annual mean and maximum values of inundation depths respectively similarly two variables characterizing the inundation area i e mean inundation area and maximum inundation area were separately defined as the annual mean and maximum values of inundation areas and calculated year after year here the inundation area for a particular day was calculated as the sum of the grid areas for grids that are inundated two inundation timing variables i e depth and area were also considered in this study i e the maximum inundation depth time i e the day of the year that the maximum inundation depth occurs at grid scale and the maximum inundation area time i e the day of the year that the maximum inundation area occurs at regional scale where the inundation timing for area was analyzed in the characteristic of inundation area for convenience 2 4 analysis of monsoon impact the p value calculated from a significance test of the pearson correlation coefficient between the inundation variable and monsoon index two tailed t test was adopted to characterize the monsoon impact on inundation referring to the practice of the definition of monsoon anomaly e g wang et al 2001 li et al 2016 which treats the monsoon as strong or weak when the normalized monsoon index exceeds one standard deviation σ a p value of 0 32 0 146 for pearson correlation coefficient in this paper corresponding to one σ criteria was used as the threshold of the monsoon impact on inundation this option considered the model capacity in modeling the floods where the floods are the high value parts of discharge water level and are always underestimated in modeling practice e g wang et al 2021 when the p value in a given region is no more than 0 32 the impact of monsoon on inundation in this region exists and this region can be treated as a monsoon impact region otherwise the impact is ignored delgado et al 2012 also thought that a station with pearson correlation coefficient less than 0 1 meant the flood in this station was not affected by the monsoon in addition regions with p values no more than 0 05 and 0 10 generally used to indicate significance were also marked to reflect a significant impact of the monsoon on inundation but only the results of p values no more than 0 05 were presented in the results for reference the slope from the linear regression model eq 1 hameed et al 1997 was used to obtain the inundation response to one unit change in the monsoon index 1 y a x b ε where y is the inundation variable e g depth frequency x is the normalized monsoon index a b are the slope and constant respectively ε is the error if the slope is positive or negative then the monsoon impact on inundation is considered positive or negative that is the inundation increases or decreases when the monsoon strengthens i e monsoon index increases to characterize the percentage change of inundation the long term average value was used which was calculated as the average value of the inundation variable for the days with inundation then the slope dividing by the long term average value was taken as the percentage change of flood inundation see eq 2 2 y y avg y avg a y avg x b y avg 1 ε in which yavg is the long term average value a yavg was the percentage change of flood inundation a multi linear regression model eqs 3 4 üneş et al 2020 was also used to characterize the relative contributions of monsoons to inundation and identify the spatial distribution of the dominant monsoon i e the monsoon with largest relative contribution in affecting inundation 3 y i 1 n a i x i a 0 ε 4 r i a i i 1 n a i where ai i 0 1 n is the regression coefficient xi ri i 1 2 3 for this issue are the normalized monsoon index and relative contribution for each xi respectively y is the inundation variable a similar approach has also been applied by wang et al 2020 here if the monsoon impact on inundation does not exist i e p value over 0 32 then this type of monsoon was excluded in the multi linear regression analysis note that the iswn index is a simple sum of the ism and wnpm indices though it was normalized before analysis see section 2 2 suggesting that multicollinearity could exist between the ism or wnpm and the iswn the ridge regression was then applied in the solution procedure of the multi linear regression model and details on this can be seen in hoerl and kennard 1970 3 results 3 1 model validation the simulated and observed long term flood season water levels near or located in the frequently flooded regions are shown in fig 3 the results for simulated and observed water levels show that the water levels are well simulated with relative errors less than 10 and pearson correlation coefficients larger than 0 9 at most stations the daily nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients are all no less than 0 84 at five out seven stations also the simulations of water level variation at stations i e prek kdam and kompong luong on the tonle sap river tsr and tsl indicate the reverse flow into the tsl from the mekong river mainstem could be simulated with satisfactory performance by the hydrodynamic model that considers the backwater effect however the performance of water level at can tho and my thuan stations is poor where these two stations are located near the mekong river estuary there are two main possible explanations for this firstly these two stations are strongly affected by the tide backwater effect peng et al 2020 and secondly river bed mining in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd which can be traced back to 1990s park et al 2020 causes the water level to be reduced fig 3f the lower observed water levels after 1995 than before these two factors were not considered in the model and thus may cause the poor performance it is noted that the water levels at stations such as kompong luong and chau doc show obvious high values in december and the following january this could be attributed to the release of water from the tsl in these months when the water level in the tsl is higher than the vmd kummu et al 2014 wang et al 2021 which therefore maintains the high water levels at these stations the flood season spatial inundation map comparisons with modis and gsw are illustrated in fig 4 the results show that the model can capture the spatial inundation distribution well especially in the tsl and vmd where inundation occurs frequently during the flood season fig 4 on average 84 2 of the inundation occurrence frequency for modis is captured by the model in these regions i e the average probability of detection is 0 842 similar results are also obtained by using monthly gsw it shows 88 8 of the inundation occurrence frequency of gsw is captured note the difference between the gsw and modis in the tsl regions fig 4a 4b i e more flooded regions are derived by gsw potentially indicating the gsw has a better land surface waterbody detection capacity considering the frequently flooded regions are mainly located in the cvm inundation analyses were therefore mainly focused on the cvm in the following sections fig 5 illustrates how the mean flood season water level changes with the monsoon index at the selected stations it is found that the slope between the simulated water level and monsoon index is smaller than that between the observed water level and monsoon index at most stations nevertheless the tendency between the mean water level and monsoon index is well captured by the model suggesting the model can be used to characterize the monsoon impact on inundation also the p value calculated from the simulated water level and monsoon index is generally larger than that calculated from the observed value indicating the threshold of p value to distinguish the monsoon impact on inundation should be higher than 0 05 or 0 10 to contain more grids in which the inundation is truly affected by the monsoon this may prove the reasonability of the p value of 0 32 as the threshold of monsoon impacts on inundation additionally it is worthy to note that though the water levels at can tho and my thuan are poorly simulated the tendency between observed mean water level and monsoon index is reproduced by the model in most cases but with a higher slope and lower p value 3 2 impact on inundation frequency the impacts of monsoons on inundation frequency are shown in fig 6 the results show the inundation frequency mainly increases when the monsoon strengthens i e a positive impact this could be attributed to the long retention time caused by the limited flood carrying capacity usually when the monsoon strengthens then the rainfall and flood volume could be larger delgado et al 2012 yang et al 2019 if given the unchanged flood carrying capacity the water flow out of the river cross section could be limited thus causing longer residence time and subsequently larger inundation frequency for the ism regions showing a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency are mainly in the outer tsl fig 6a while for the wnpm and the iswn regions with a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency are mainly in the middle tsl the inner tsl is the permanent water body northern vmd tsr and the section between the phnom penh i e confluence of the mekong river and tsr and stung treng station hereafter abbreviated as pp st section the difference in spatial distributions might be caused by the different impact areas of the monsoon on rainfall see yang et al 2019 fan and luo 2019 wang et al 2022 further analysis of inundation pixel statistics indicates that 85 9 of the ism impact regions have a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency fig 6a while the percentages for the wnpm and the iswn are 96 5 and 97 3 respectively fig 6b 6c in the regions with a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency a unit increase in any one of the three monsoon indices can lead on average to an increase of 0 03 in inundation frequency i e the average slope between any one monsoon index and the inundation frequency is 0 03 when considering the percentage change of inundation frequency caused by monsoons these increases in inundation frequency are 14 2 for the ism 7 7 for the wnpm and 8 6 for the iswn respectively in addition the proportions of the region significantly affected by the monsoon p value no more than 0 05 to that affected by the monsoon p value no more than 0 32 are 17 3 for the ism 68 8 for the wnpm and 69 0 for the iswn respectively this indicates the inundation frequency for over half of the wnpm and the iswn impact regions is significantly affected by monsoons in the regions significantly affected by the ism 89 6 of the regions show a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency with an average slope of 0 06 21 8 for percentage change for the wnpm 99 5 of significantly affected regions have a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency and the average slope for these regions with a positive monsoon impact is 0 03 6 1 similar results can be found for the iswn 99 6 of the significantly affected regions show a positive monsoon impact on inundation frequency and in these significantly affected regions with a positive monsoon impact a unit increase in the iswn index can cause a 0 03 7 2 increase in inundation frequency 3 3 impact on inundation timing fig 7 illustrates the monsoon impact on inundation timing at grid scale i e inundation timing for depth the results reveal that the maximum inundation depth time is mainly delayed when the ism strengthens i e a positive impact in contrast to the ism the wnpm and the iswn mainly show negative impacts on maximum inundation depth time fig 7b 7c the reason for the negative monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time is related to the positive relationship between discharge in the southern lmrb and the wnpm delgado et al 2012 wang et al 2022 that is when the wnpm strengthens the discharge inputting to the cvm system is larger causing a higher water level outside the cvm the maximum inundation depth time could be advanced due to the larger difference in water levels between the outside and inside of the cvm however due to the backwater effect in the lower regions e g vmd during the flood season the flow of water induced by the ism in the cvm may be greatly restricted where discharge affected by the ism in this region is mainly from local rainfall instead of the mekong river mainstream see fan and luo 2019 it therefore causes a positive ism impact on maximum inundation depth time further the superposition of the positive impact of the ism and negative impact of the wnpm can cause the impact of the iswn on maximum inundation depth time to be either similar to the ism or similar to the wnpm or even diminish fig 7c the regions showing a positive ism impact on maximum inundation depth time are mainly distributed in the tsl pp st section and tsr while those showing a negative wnpm impact on maximum inundation depth time are mainly in the tsl tsr northern and southern vmds the regions with a negative iswn impact on maximum inundation depth time are in the southern vmd while those with a positive iswn impact are in the pp st section this spatial distribution of the iswn impact is mainly caused by the trade off between the impacts of the ism and wnpm on maximum inundation depth time 95 7 of the ism impact regions have a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time fig 7a while the proportions for the regions showing a negative monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time are 99 2 for the wnpm and 84 1 for the iswn respectively a unit increase in the ism index in the regions with a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time can lead to on average 4 6 days delay 1 5 change in maximum inundation depth time while the same change in the wnpm index in the regions with a negative monsoon impact can on average advance maximum inundation depth time by 4 3 days 1 5 change the number for the iswn is 5 8 days i e 2 0 change further results show that 71 1 of the ism impact regions are with a significant monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time fig 7d and these values for the wnpm and the iswn are 21 2 and 22 3 respectively for the ism significant impact regions almost all portions are with a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth time and a unit increase in ism index can cause on average 4 4 days delay 1 4 change in maximum inundation depth time 3 4 impact on inundation depth fig 8 shows the monsoon impacts on average inundation depth the results show the average inundation depth increases when the monsoon strengthens i e a positive impact this could be attributed to the larger flood volume caused by the rainy season precipitation in the years when the monsoon strengthens the regions with a positive ism impact on average inundation depth are mainly distributed in the outer and middle tsls and tsr fig 8a while the wnpm and the iswn positively affect the average inundation depth in the tsl pp st section and northern vmd fig 8b 8c the regions affected by the ism have a proportion of 94 3 with a positive monsoon impact on average inundation depth while the proportions with positive monsoon impacts for regions affected by the wnpm and the iswn are 88 8 and 94 3 respectively for regions with a positive monsoon impact on average inundation depth a unit increase in the ism index can cause 0 10 m 7 0 increase in average inundation depth while those in the wnpm and the iswn indices can separately cause 0 14 m 5 3 and 0 16 m 6 7 increases in average inundation depth for the ism only 17 9 of the monsoon impact regions are with a significant monsoon impact on average inundation depth while the numbers for the wnpm and the iswn are 62 5 and 72 2 further in the regions significantly affected by the wnpm 98 7 of the regions have a positive monsoon impact on average inundation depth and 0 17 m 4 9 increase in average inundation depth can be caused by a unit increase in the wnpm index for these regions with a positive monsoon impact for the iswn 99 1 of the regions significantly affected by it have a positive impact on average inundation depth and a unit increase in its index for these regions with a positive monsoon impact can lead to 0 18 m 6 3 increase in average inundation depth the monsoon impacts on maximum inundation depth are illustrated in fig 9 similar impacts of the monsoon on average inundation depth can also be found on maximum inundation depth i e the maximum inundation depth increases when the monsoon strengthens a positive impact the ism positively affects the maximum inundation depth in the tsl tsr and northern vmd fig 9a while for the wnpm and the iswn the regions showing a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth include the pp st section besides the tsl tsr and northern vmd fig 9b 9c the proportions for the regions with a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth accounting for the monsoon impact regions are 97 2 for the ism 74 5 for the wnpm and 81 8 for the iswn respectively in these regions with a positive monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth a unit increase in the ism index can lead to 0 16 m 6 8 increase in maximum inundation depth while those in the wnpm and iswn indices can lead to 0 20 m 6 0 and 0 25 m 8 1 increases in maximum inundation depth respectively also only 12 7 of the ism impact regions are with a significant monsoon impact on maximum inundation depth while the numbers for the wnpm and the iswn are 51 2 and 61 9 respectively 98 9 of the regions with a significant iswn impact on maximum inundation depth have a positive monsoon impact and 0 29 m 8 0 increase in maximum inundation depth can be caused by a unit increase in the iswn index for these regions with a positive monsoon impact 3 5 impact on inundation area the monsoon impacts on inundation area are shown in fig 10 which could be regarded as a total response of flood inundation to monsoon impacts at grid scale the results show the wnpm and the iswn have a positive impact on the mean inundation area during the flood season fig 10a 10d 10g and these impacts are significant in the tsl and cvm however the ism has lesser impact on the mean inundation area the reason for the positive impact between the wnpm and mean inundation area could be the high positive correlation between the flood volume and wnpm delgado et al 2012 under the given terrain a higher flood volume can lead to a larger inundation area this might be also applied to the iswn as for the ism the lesser impact might be attributed to the low weight of the significantly affected regions in the regions with the ism impact on average inundation depth fig 8d further a unit increase in the wnpm index can lead to increases in mean inundation area in the tsl vmd and cvm of 3 8 1 0 and 2 5 respectively while that in the iswn index can cause the mean inundation area in the tsl vmd and cvm to increase by 4 3 1 1 and 2 7 respectively except for the lesser impact of the wnpm on maximum inundation area in the vmd almost all monsoons have a positive impact on maximum inundation area in the three considered regions for the ism a unit increase in monsoon index can separately lead to 1 9 1 2 and 1 6 increases in maximum inundation area in the tsl vmd and cvm while for the wnpm it can cause 2 8 and 1 9 increases in the tsl and cvm respectively further 3 7 1 4 and 2 7 increases in maximum inundation area in the tsl vmd and cvm can be separately caused by the iswn when its index increases one unit similar to the results of fig 7 the ism has a positive impact on maximum inundation area time in the three analyzed regions while the wnpm has a negative impact on it fig 10c 10f 10i the iswn almost has no impact on maximum inundation area time for the ism a unit increase in the monsoon index can delay the maximum inundation area times in the tsl vmd and cvm by 3 7 days 1 3 3 8 days 1 3 3 2 days 1 1 respectively however a unit increase in the wnpm index can separately lead to the maximum inundation area times in the tsl vmd and cvm being advanced by 3 2 days 1 2 3 6 days 1 3 and 2 8 days 1 0 4 discussion 4 1 dominant monsoon distribution the spatial distributions of the dominant monsoon in affecting the inundation are shown in fig 11 the results reveal that both the wnpm and the iswn have a larger spatial extent than the ism in affecting inundation frequency fig 11a where they control 38 9 and 41 6 of the monsoon impact regions respectively the regions with a dominant iswn impact on inundation frequency are mainly distributed in the outer and middle tsls and pp st section while for the wnpm the regions are mainly in the middle tsl the ism has the largest impact extent in affecting maximum inundation depth time fig 11b by which about 58 8 of the monsoon impact regions e g tsl tsr pp st section are mainly regulated for inundation depth the iswn has the largest spatial impact extent 70 0 of the regions with a monsoon impact on average inundation depth are mainly affected by the iswn while this number on maximum inundation depth is 63 7 the regions dominated by the iswn for the two depths are mainly in the tsl tsr pp ct section and northern vmd fig 11c 11d these indicate the iswn can have a critical role in affecting inundation but it cannot completely replace the ism or the wnpm which means no monsoon can dominate the inundation alone suggesting the spatial coexistence of three monsoons in affecting inundation further decomposition of the iswn impact on inundation i e ignoring the iswn impact shows that the wnpm has a larger spatial impact extent in affecting inundation frequency fig 11e and depth fig 11g 11h whereas the ism has a much larger spatial impact extent in regulating the inundation timing fig 11f the regions with the wnpm impact on inundation frequency average inundation depth and maximum inundation depth account for 72 3 71 0 and 74 0 of the monsoon impact regions respectively this number for regions with the ism impact on maximum inundation depth time is 60 0 in addition the comparisons of the dominant monsoon spatial distributions before and after the iswn decomposition show the iswn dominant region covers most of regions that are dominated by wnpm after decomposition e g fig 11d 11h this could indicate many overlap regions of the iswn and the wnpm in affecting the flood pulses and even rainfall and can be found in wang et al 2022 4 2 monsoon contribution to inundation the relative contributions of three monsoons to inundation are shown in fig 12 the results show the iswn and the wnpm contribute similarly to inundation frequency which are 38 8 and 39 5 respectively for maximum inundation depth time the contribution of the ism is 43 4 while the number for the wnpm is 42 1 which are also similar in the contribution value the iswn contributes most to inundation depth fig 12k 12l where its relative contributions to average inundation depth and maximum inundation depth are 43 1 and 37 2 respectively the contribution difference between the wnpm and the iswn is relatively large for average inundation depth while it is relatively small for maximum inundation depth further analyses of the monsoon contribution to inundation area indicate that the iswn contributes most to the average and maximum inundation areas in the three considered regions while the ism contributes most to the inundation timing for area see fig 10 for reference the iswn was further decomposed into the ism and wnpm and the relative contributions of the monsoon to inundation are shown in fig 13 the results show the contribution of the wnpm to inundation frequency and depth is larger than that of the ism on average the wnpm contributes 70 7 62 0 58 5 to inundation frequency average inundation depth and maximum inundation depth respectively for the maximum inundation depth time the wnpm contributes 54 5 while the number for the ism is 45 5 in addition the wnpm contributes more than the ism to inundation area in most cases for the three considered regions nevertheless the ism contributes more to inundation timing for area i e the day of the year that the maximum inundation area occurs see fig 10 for reference moreover similar results to the dominant monsoon distribution are found by comparison of the monsoon relative contributions before and after decomposition of the iswn where the regions with the iswn contributing to inundation cover most of those with the wnpm contributing to inundation after the decomposition of the iswn this means the decomposition of the iswn changes the monsoon contributions to inundation where the wnpm contributes more to inundation suggesting the wnpm has a larger impact than the ism on inundation 4 3 uncertainty and limitation precipitation is the most crucial uncertainty source for the model which affects the flood volume and thus may have some effects on the analyses of the monsoon impact on inundation nevertheless the precipitation datasets used in this study were carefully selected and one of these datasets has been proven to be one of the best datasets for hydrological modeling in the lmrb e g lauri et al 2014 try et al 2020c moreover the best efforts have been made to decrease the impact caused by precipitation uncertainty through model calibration the simulated results perform well when compared with the observed values the digital elevation map which plays an important role in determining the inundation of a grid is also an important source of uncertainty for the reported results to reduce the impact caused by this uncertainty the inundation that can be simulated by the model i e within the model capacity was considered which could cover a large part of the real inundation nevertheless a high accuracy digital elevation map is still needed to improve the quality of analyses but this may have less influence on the results due to its invariance during the whole simulation period and the relative change of inundation being considered in this paper the threshold for the monsoon impact on inundation is the p value of 0 32 changing the threshold can also have some impacts on the results especially for the quantification of the monsoon impact on flood inundation however this will hardly change the tendency of monsoon impact on inundation this research only provides an initial assessment for the monsoon impact on flood inundation the threshold for the monsoon impact on inundation i e p value is worthy to be further studied where the degree of monsoon impact can be usually underestimated by simulation i e the impact exists in the observation but does not exist in the simulation fig 5 here a lower threshold e g a p value of 0 05 might cause the monsoon impact regions to decrease dramatically thus leading to the loss of much useful information e g the analyses of the spatial distribution of the dominant monsoon since the tidal effect was not considered in the model the inundation dynamics induced by monsoon rainfall in the southern vmd did not reproduce the observations well fig 3f 3g this is also worthy of a further study to assess the inundation separately caused by monsoon rainfall and ocean tide it is noted that the monsoon combined effect iswn was characterized by a simple linear combination of the ism and the wnpm indices following yang et al 2019 a nonlinear superposition or linear superposition with different weights for the iswn could have a higher correlation with precipitation and flood characteristics and is worthy to be studied in future in addition the current study period covers 1967 to 2015 i e 49 years in total extending the analytical period is also of great interest which can provide more robust analyses 5 conclusions this research used the vic and the improved cama flood model to investigate the impacts of the ism the wnpm and their combined effect iswn on flood season inundation over 1967 2015 in the lmrb inundation characteristics including frequency timing depth and area were selected and calculated with the slope from a linear regression model reflecting the impact of the monsoon the spatial distribution of the dominant monsoon and monsoon relative contributions to inundation were also discussed by using a multi linear regression model the water levels in the flood season at most stations were well simulated by the model at five out seven stations the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients were no less than 0 84 and pearson correlation coefficients were larger than 0 90 on average 80 90 of inundation occurrences were captured within the model capacity further results characterizing the flood season water level varying with the monsoon index indicated that the slope from the model was generally underestimated but with the same tendency the ism wnpm and the iswn positively affected inundation frequency depth and area at least 74 5 of the regions had positive monsoon impacts on frequency and depth further the inundation timing for depth or area was delayed when the ism strengthened while it was advanced when the wnpm or the iswn strengthened at least 84 1 of the regions affected by the monsoon showed delayed inundation timing for depth when the ism strengthened and advanced inundation timing for depth when the wnpm or the iswn strengthened respectively for the regions with a positive monsoon impact on inundation a unit increase in different monsoon indices could lead on average to a 7 7 14 2 increase in inundation frequency and 5 3 8 1 increase in inundation depth respectively a unit increase in different monsoon indices could also cause a 1 0 4 3 increase in inundation area moreover a unit increase in different monsoon indices could make the inundation timing for area change by 2 8 days 3 8 days in three considered study regions and made the inundation timing for depth on average change by 4 3 days 5 8 days the wnpm and the iswn dominated the inundation frequency in over 80 of the monsoon impact regions while the ism dominated the inundation timing for depth in over 58 of the monsoon impact regions over 63 of the regions with a monsoon impact on inundation depth were mainly regulated by the iswn similar contributions of the wnpm and the iswn were detected for inundation frequency for inundation timing for depth the ism and wnpm shared similar contributions but the monsoon with the most contribution to inundation timing for area was the ism moreover the iswn contributed most to inundation depth and area further decomposition of the iswn changed the results of the impacts on inundation frequency and depth as well as area where the wnpm contributed more to the inundation and regulated more monsoon impact regions credit authorship contribution statement jie wang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft qiuhong tang conceptualization

3178,the traditional description of a hydrological system with a deterministic conceptual model and a lumped output error term does not explicitly consider the main mechanisms of uncertainty generation due to approximate process representation unobserved variability in processes and influence factors and input uncertainty in this study we test the description of such intrinsic uncertainty in conceptual models by making process rates stochastic through stochastic time dependent rate parameters we analyze the advantages and challenges of this approach by using bayesian inference to jointly estimate model parameters parameters of the stochastic processes and the time series of the stochastic parameters numerically we use a particle filter to infer the stochastic time series and to approximate the marginal likelihood for markov chain sampling of the constant parameters compared to the lumped error formulation we achieve a more realistic description of uncertainty as we obtain larger errors in intrinsic states larger uncertainty during prediction than calibration periods a feature missing for simple lumped error models and autocorrelated model outputs however the additional degrees of freedom introduced with stochastic parameters can lead to an unintentional compensation for model deficits or input errors this problem is symptomatic of model structure inadequacy or poor selection of the parameters that are made stochastic and can be diagnosed through cross validation and careful posterior analysis the proposed approach is computationally more demanding and its implementation more challenging than the traditional description of hydrological systems using a deterministic model with a lumped error term however its advantages both in providing a more realistic representation of uncertainties and in diagnosing model deficiencies suggest its adoption and further development in future studies keywords stochastic parameters uncertainty quantification conceptual models bayesian inference particle filter cross validation 1 introduction process based catchment models are traditionally deterministic and their uncertainty is accounted for by separated lumped error terms which are applied to their output e g mcinerney et al 2017 such lumped error models describe the effect of all sources of uncertainty including input model structure intrinsic and externally caused randomness and observation error on modelled output e g schoups and vrugt 2010 reichert and schuwirth 2012 evin et al 2013 evin et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 ammann et al 2019 this approach leads to an efficient inference procedure at the cost of the need for an empirical error model parameterization and of the underestimation of the uncertainty of all internal model states reichert et al 2021 to mitigate these problems it has been argued in favor of modeling the uncertainty where it supposedly arises rather than grouping all contributions in a single error term on the output of the model this can be done by making the hydrological process model stochastic e g moradkhani et al 2005 kuczera et al 2006 liu and gupta 2007 reichert and mieleitner 2009 reichert et al 2021 the first arguments for the need of stochastic models in hydrology were introduced more than 50 years ago by mandelbrot and wallis 1968 more recently they consider general reasoning on the lack of suitability of deterministic models to describe hydrological features kuczera et al 2006 the intrinsically variable nature of hydrological parameters liu and gupta 2007 the characterization of structural model deficits leisenring and moradkhani 2011 and the opportunities for their identification wagener et al 2003 reichert et al 2021 within the domain of stochastic approaches to hydrology stochastic time dependent std parameters have been suggested as a tool to describe the effects of intrinsic uncertainty on model states and output and to possibly identify structural model deficits reichert and mieleitner 2009 reichert et al 2021 indeed by representing variability within the model structure they appear particularly suited to account for our uncertain knowledge of the system at hand a clear benefit of modeling uncertainty with std parameters is the consequential natural propagation of it through the model structure to the output in fact autocorrelation effects can be induced by the stochastic processes and are also directed and amplified by the propagation of stochasticity throughout the model additionally making process rate parameters stochastic is consistent with the fulfillment of mass balance equations which might not be granted with other specific modeling strategies indeed for example if it is the level of the water in the reservoirs that is treated as a stochastic variable moradkhani et al 2005 vrugt et al 2013 then mass balance equations are not exactly fulfilled importantly std parameters pose no theoretical limitations to the concurrent use of other complementary ways to treat uncertain knowledge observational error models on input and or output including models for systematic bias sikorska and renard 2017 as well as stochastic model states can all be used concurrently with std parameters despite these appealing features std parameters are seldom applied to demanding modeling scenarios this is mainly because of the intricacy of the algorithms needed to cope with the calibration of stochastic models because of the computational resources required to achieve converged results and possibly also because more complex and or informative outcomes can be more challenging to mine and interpret hence the overarching goal of this contribution is to comprehensively test and discuss the feasibility of using std parameters for a non linear multi reservoir conceptual hydrological model applied to real world data and to show the ensuing implications on uncertainty quantification by doing so we advance previous studies by considering a more complex model and by using up to 3 std parameters at once we also resort to a novel parallel framework šukys and bacci 2021 which allows us to benefit from available high performance computing hpc infrastructure and to use the particle filter pf method coupled with a markov chain monte carlo approach to bayesian inference pmcmc e g doucet and johansen 2009 andrieu et al 2010 fearnhead and künsch 2018 van leeuwen et al 2019 although not pursued here this could in principle be used to extend our work to non linear stochastic processes differently from what is possible with other methods such as conditional ornstein uhlenbeck sampling buser 2003 tomassini et al 2009 reichert and mieleitner 2009 reichert et al 2021 on the other hand the calibration of stochastic models with the pmcmc method is usually more computationally expensive and hence also likely to require expertise in parallel programming or at least familiarity with and access to hpc resources thus an additional goal of this contribution is to report on the algorithmic and computational aspects implicit in this more universal and wider ranging approach to stochastic modeling in hydrology ultimately the main motivation for the present and possible future endeavors of this type comes from the fact that approaches like this one can allow the modeler to improve the characterization of uncertainty by improving the partition of the variability into the different sources and can help identify and correct possible model deficits reichert et al 2021 thus we also list among our objectives the discussion of these aspects for our case study with this aim in mind we consider and discuss in particular the possible misuse of stochastic parameters which occurs when the posterior dynamics of the stochastic parameters systematically adjusts for model deficits such a misuse can only occur however when the data are known and used to inform the dynamical behavior of the model as in calibration data assimilation procedures in contrast compensation of model deficits simply cannot take place during prediction as observations are not used to inform the response of the model this inevitably reduces the predictive power of those models for which misuse of stochastic parameters occurred in calibration and this can be detected and quantified with cross validation further steps such as the explicit modeling of input uncertainty and the consideration of data sets with higher e g hourly time resolution are all challenges that we suggest should be tackled in forthcoming studies in summary the aims of this study are to explore characterize and discuss the application of std parameters to a conceptual hydrological model structure by using the pmcmc method within a parallel computational framework efforts are specifically directed to determine the ensuing implications for uncertainty quantification and to assess possible modeling limitations of the proposed approach and of the underlying hydrological model which the proposed approach can help to detect in order to meet and communicate all the mentioned goals the following design is taken first we select and describe our hydrological case study including the observational data in section 2 1 and the hydrological model that we use for its description in section 2 2 then we go into more details regarding std parameters inference and pf method see sections 2 3 2 4 2 5 2 6 we close the methodological part with an overview on prior and post processing which hinges on the need to quantify and compare the results of the simulated models both for calibration and cross validation sections 2 7 and 2 8 results are presented and interpreted in section 3 and further discussed in 4 the contribution ends with laying down our conclusions in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data we apply our approach for inference and cross validation to the murg catchment a small 80 km2 pre alpine foothill catchment in northeastern switzerland which is sometimes addressed to as wängi catchment from the name of the village where the gauging station is located this catchment belongs to the larger thur river basin and has been object of several previous studies e g dal molin et al 2020 ammann et al 2019 schirmer et al 2014 to which we address the reader for further specific hydro geological information here it suffices to say that the murg area is characterized by steep slopes that can make the streamflow peaks quite sharp by draining directly into the river ammann et al 2019 and that only 5 of precipitation is falling as snow which implies that snowfall is not a prominent influencing factor of the streamflow dal molin et al 2020 additionally there are no natural or artificial reservoirs in the study area all these notions are used to inform the building up of the hydrological model in section 2 2 the data used in this study consist of daily precipitation potential evaporation and streamflow for a 6 years period ranging from 01 09 1993 to 31 12 1999 as in previous works dal molin et al 2020 ammann et al 2019 streamflow values come from the swiss federal office for the environment foen while precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from meteoswiss 2018 all data are pre processed as described by dal molin et al 2020 the selection of a daily temporal resolution is justified by a previous study dal molin et al 2020 and by the necessity to keep the computational time and budget within reasonable limits while still exploring multiple hydrological hypotheses we use the observations from 01 09 1993 to 31 08 1997 for calibration with a warm up period to let the initial condition equilibrate equal to 365 days the data from 01 09 1997 to 31 12 1999 serve for cross validation 2 2 hydrological model and experiments the lumped model structure used in this study is schematically shown in fig 1 and in terms of complexity and processes representation is broadly reflective of typical conceptual rainfall runoff models such as hbv lindström et al 1997 gr4j perrin et al 2003 or hymod wagener et al 2001 more specifically the model follows the classic three elements setup outlined by jakeman and hornberger 1993 composed by an upstream element connected in series to two downstream units working in parallel the upstream element is an unsaturated reservoir ur u subscript and it exchanges directly with the environment through precipitation and evapotranspiration terms the balance between these two determines the amount of water stored in ur which controls through a nonlinear term and a splitting unit the flow to the two downstream elements these last two units are both linear reservoirs a fast reservoir fr f subscript intended to represent the hydrograph peaks and a slow reservoir sr s subscript intended to represent baseflow the model structure is built by using the superflex modeling framework fenicia et al 2011 we do not consider a lag function as in other models such as hbv as deemed unnecessary based on preliminary simulations supported by precipitation data see section 2 1 we also do not implement a snow component in order to limit the number of model calibration parameters similarly to what done in some other conceptual models such as gr4j some model parameters are fixed in particular we use β 5 unless otherwise stated which approximates a smooth threshold behavior for discharge generation and is justified by preliminary simulations see section 3 1 we also use m 0 01 as in previous works fenicia et al 2013 fenicia et al 2018 which implies that actual evaporation is approximately equal to the potential evaporation unless the reservoir is close to empty the dynamics of a model with structure as in fig 1 is controlled by eqs 1 1 ds u dt p t q q e u p t p t s u s umax β c e e p s u s umax 1 m s u s umax m ds f dt p f q f 1 d q q k f s f 1 d p t s u s umax β k f s f ds s dt p s q s dq q k s s s dp t s u s umax β k s s s q m q f q s k f s f k s s s from eq 1 s umax controls the maximum water level in ur anything above that level is spilled out to the downstream units in a single time step as in a truly on off model c e is the scaling coefficient for the evapotranspiration term d is the split parameter that controls how the water from ur is partitioned between the two downstream reservoirs the larger d the larger the flux to the slow reservoir and k f and k s are the coefficients that control the linear storage discharge relationship in the corresponding reservoir fr and sr respectively in the following case studies parameters k f k s and or d can be either deterministic meaning constant in time or stochastic meaning represented by a suited time dependent stochastic process see section 2 3 in particular we investigate a fully deterministic model and 4 stochastic models with different selections of std parameters the 5 experiments and the associated model calibration parameters are schematically shown in table 1 the deterministic model det does not include any stochastic process hence it only numbers 5 fitted parameters that we summarize in vector θ m s umax c e d k f k s in model sto k f the std parameter is k f in sto k s it is k s and in sto d is d finally in sto kkd we make all of them concurrently stochastic in the stochastic models the temporal dynamics of the std parameters is inferred jointly with both the parameters of the processes that model them and with the other model parameters the choice of making k f k s and or d stochastic rests on both theoretical and practical aspects indeed by limiting stochastic modeling to process rates mass balance equations formulated in the deterministic model remain valid this would be more difficult for capacity parameters such as maximum reservoir levels the three parameters mentioned above are the key process rate parameters 2 3 std parameters by denoting a general std parameter with θ s we model the evolution of a suited transformation of that parameter f θ s with a linear time continuous autoregressive stochastic process χ f θ s ou called ornstein uhlenbeck ou process uhlenbeck and ornstein 1930 this formally writes as f θ s t χ f θ s ou t t practically this means that given the value of the transformed std parameter θ s at time t 0 f θ s t 0 then the probability distribution of its subsequent value f θ s t 1 at time t 1 t 0 is given by the normal distribution 2 f θ s t 1 f θ s t 0 n μ f θ s ou f θ s t 0 μ f θ s ou exp t 1 t 0 τ f θ s ou σ f θ s ou 1 exp 2 t 1 t 0 τ f θ s ou from eq 2 the parameters of the ou process are its asymptotic mean μ f θ s ou its asymptotic standard deviation σ f θ s ou and its autocorrelation time τ f θ s ou we summarize these parameters in the parameter vector θ ou μ f θ s ou σ f θ s ou τ f θ s ou and we keep the notation θ ou also for the cases with multiple stochastic parameters where this parameter vector contains the means standard deviations and correlation times of all the std parameters while an ou process has unbounded codomain model parameters might not exceed a given range of values this is the reason why we generally need the transformation f on θ s such a transformation allows us to map the usually limited support of the modeled parameter onto the values that the ou process can take χ f θ s ou t r in this study we make model parameters k f k s and d stochastic since k f and k s are constrained to r we need a transformation f k f r r to this aim we simply choose the natural logarithm as in previous works reichert et al 2021 reichert and mieleitner 2009 this means that what we describe with the ou process is not k f or k s but it is their natural logarithms e g ln k f t χ ln k f ou t the equation for k s is analogous for the split parameter the transformation that we choose is the logit function this is because d 0 1 and the logit function is a possible way to map this interval to r logit d t ln d t 1 d t χ logit d ou t in summary when a parameter is modeled by an ou process we have to infer the value of the asymptotic mean of the process μ f θ s ou its asymptotic standard deviation σ f θ s ou and its autocorrelation time τ f θ s ou jointly with the posterior of its actual time course to simplify the notation and to highlight the fact that we always refer to the back transformed parameters θ s we use the symbol θ s to indicate the time mean of f 1 χ f θ s ou t where appropriate in section 3 we now proceed by considering the error model that we use to then be able to discuss our inference framework 2 4 observational and lumped error models in our setup the output error term applies to the discharge of the hydrological model in the same way regardless of the type of process model deterministic or stochastic the parameterization that we choose is also the same these choices are supported by simplicity by the willingness to be able to perform direct comparisons and by the flexibility of the selected error parameterization however we should notice that the error term on the output has in principle a different meaning for the deterministic or stochastic models in the first case the error lumps together all sources of uncertainty while for stochastic models it ideally just represents the observation error as parametric model structure uncertainty and intrinsic stochasticity are considered by the std parameters in the remainder of the text for simplicity we call the output error model observational likelihood even when for the deterministic hydrological model it represents the distribution of observations resulting from intrinsic uncertainty in addition to observation error to model the lumped or observational error for the streamflow q obs we opt for a widespread approach as it is well known the precision of the measurement depends on the magnitude of the streamflow itself a possible way to deal with such a heteroscedastic error term is to transform the data and the model output via a box cox bc transformation box and cox 1964 and to then apply a homoscedastic gaussian error model in the transformed space mcinerney et al 2017 3 bc q obs bc q m bc bc n 0 σ bc bc q obs n bc q m σ bc where bc q q λ 1 λ q m is the streamflow output by the hydrological model q obs is the observed discharge and the last expression in 3 provides the expected distribution of the observed data given the model output in other words it provides the basic and actionable definition of the observational likelihood given data and model output definition that is required to calibrate the deterministic model in a bayesian setting see section 2 5 we note that the observational error model 3 adds 2 parameters per hydrological model to the ones in table 1 the standard deviation of the normal distribution in bc space σ bc and the parameter λ of the transformation as it is commonplace we inferr σ bc while fixing λ to 0 5 as recommended in previous work mcinerney et al 2017 our parameter vector for the error model thus consists of a single element θ y σ bc we also note that we use the back transformed error q obs q m bc 1 bc q m bc q m to expose the relevant results in section 3 in order not to also have to resolve identifiability problems between input and intrinsic uncertainties we do not consider input uncertainty explicitly but analyse potential implicit effects of input uncertainty in our results we also note that input uncertainty could be considered in the used framework for example by modelling precipitation as a transformed stochastic process and using the observations to condition it del giudice et al 2016 all our models namely the hydrological model see eqs 1 and also table 1 and the observational or lumped error model eq 3 have parameters which are grouped in the vectors θ m and θ y respectively these parameters are inferred based on the available data as detailed in the following section 2 5 inference the parameters of the deterministic hydrological model given by eq 1 and the lumped error model given by eq 3 are inferred from the data using bayes equation 4 p θ q obs p q obs θ p q obs l q obs θ π θ e q obs l q obs θ π θ here θ θ m θ y are the parameters of both the hydrological and error models the joint probability density of data and parameters p q obs θ is made explicit as the customary product between likelihood l q obs θ and prior π θ and the the unconditional probability density of the observations p q obs is simply renamed evidence e q obs as it is commonplace the likelihood function of the model l q obs θ is the probability density of the observed data q obs given the parameters θ and used as a function of the parameters by substituting the actual observations for the corresponding argument π θ summarizes previous knowledge about plausible parameters values and the evidence results from the joint distribution through marginalization over the parameters e q obs l q obs θ π θ d θ hence it is constant for a given model although the prior is an important component of bayesian inference see section 2 7 the core prior element are the modeling choices reflected by the likelihood the error model in eq 3 which assumes independence between model residuals implies the following likelihood 5 l q obs θ l t 1 t n q obs t 1 t n θ k 1 n p t

t k q m t k θ m θ y is the probability that we measure q obs t k at time t k given the output of the model q m t k at that time with ρ n μ σ x the probability density of a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ evaluated at x this expression is substituted into eq 4 to complete our definition of the posterior for the deterministic model if one or multiple parameters of the model are chosen to be stochastic however we get a hierarchical model in this case we denote the stochastic parameter s a subset of the parameters θ m of the hydrological model by θ s m and the remaining constant parameters by θ s θ s m θ y θ ou where θ s m are the constant parameters of the hydrological model θ y are the parameters of the error model and θ ou μ f θ s ou σ f θ s ou τ f θ s ou are the parameters of the ornstein uhlenbeck process es see section 2 3 we then have to modify eq 4 to 7 p θ s θ s m q obs l t 1 t n q obs t 1 t n θ s θ s m p θ s m θ ou π θ s e q obs l t 1 t n q

single stochastic parameter this joint density is given as the product of an unconditional normal distribution for the initial point multiplied by the product of the conditional distributions of the next point given the previous one see eq 2 and multiplied by the correction factor for back transformation 8 p θ s m θ ou ρ n μ f θ s m ou σ f θ s m ou f θ s m t 1 k 2 n ρ n μ k σ k f θ s m t k k 1 n

a product of expressions of the form given by eq 8 note also that we use the same notation for the time steps in eq 8 as in the observation likelihood 5 since this is the implementation used in this paper however this is not a requirement of this technique the time discretization of the stochastic process is required only to integrate the differential equations of the hydrological model hence it is completely independent of the observation time spacing in eq 7 π θ s is the joint prior of the constant parameters and will usually be assumed to be the product of independent distributions of the three categories of parameters π θ s π θ s m π θ y π θ s ou independence assumptions are often taken also between the parameters within these three categories and e q obs is now given by l q obs θ s θ s m p θ s m θ s ou π θ s d θ s m d θ s since the parameterization of the error model is the same for all process models we note that 5 and 6 with θ s m θ s m for θ m and θ s θ s m for θ are still valid for l t 1 t n q obs t 1 t n θ s θ s m in 7 once q m is available at each time step t k by simple time integration of the hydrological model and of the respective stochastic process es the propagation of which in time evaluates 8 from 7 we get the marginal posterior of the constant parameters by integrating out the stochastic dynamics θ s m 9 p θ s q obs t 1 t n l t 1 t n q obs t 1 t n

that the last expression in eq 9 is again of the form of 4 however the marginal likelihood is now the very high dimensional integral 10 which implies the need to infer the time series of θ s m this makes inference for a stochastic model a much harder problem than inference for a deterministic one 2 6 numerical approach for the deterministic model we use a markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach to sample from the posterior given by eq 4 with the likelihood defined by eqs 5 and 6 and choose the affine invariant markov chain monte carlo ensemble emcee sampler by foreman mackey et al 2013 to achieve fast convergence when using stochastic parameter s we apply the particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc scheme described in andrieu et al 2010 this approach consists of combining a particle filter pf e g doucet and johansen 2012 fearnhead and künsch 2018 van leeuwen et al 2019 to sample the posterior marginals of the stochastic parameter s at each time point conditional on the constant parameters and on past to present observations and using these conditional samples to approximate the marginal likelihood 10 the approximate marginal likelihood is then used within an mcmc scheme to sample the constant parameters including the parameters of the stochastic process according to eq 9 again for this last step we use the emcee sampler cited above we provide some more details on this pmcmc approach in the next paragraph fig 2 provides an overview of the pmcmc scheme to the joint inference of constant and stochastic parameters pmcmc andrieu et al 2010 starts with sampling posterior marginal states of the stochastic parameter θ s m at each time point for given constant parameters by the pf as illustrated in fig 2 this is done by sampling values θ s m t i at a given time point from samples of points particles at the previous time point t i 1 integrating the hydrological model for each of these trajectories within the interval from time t i 1 to time t i and then calculating importance weights proportional to the observation likelihood at the new time point the values particles are then resampled according to the weights observational likelihoods and the weights are used to calculate the approximate marginal likelihood to derive this approximate marginal likelihood we first write the marginal likelihood 10 as a product of an unconditional distribution for the first observed discharge multiplied by conditional distributions for discharge at subsequent time points 11 l t 1 t n marg q obs t 1 t n θ s p q obs t 1 θ s k 2 n p q obs t k q obs t 1 t k 1 θ s where n is the number of observations this equation allows us to calculate approximate marginal likelihoods l based on samples θ s i m t k i 1 n p of the marginal distributions at all time points from the particle filter 12 l t 1 t n marg q obs t 1 t n θ s k 1 n 1 n p i 1 n p p t k q q obs t k q m t k θ s m θ s i m t 1 t k θ y where n p is the number of particles and p t k q is given by 6 in this work there are two main reasons why this expression is approximate first the samples of the time series of θ s m are replaced by the samples from the marginals at each time point that are only conditioned on the data up to this time point this is a property of the filtering approach and second with finite samples distributional properties can only be calculated approximately in an outer loop the approximation given by eq 12 can be used in 9 to sample from the marginal posterior of the constant parameters θ s using the emcee sampler all calculations are carried out using the spux framework by šukys and bacci 2021 in each simulation if not differently stated we use 24 particles and 40 markov chains propagated in parallel as a trade off between accuracy and computational load and time 2 7 prior table 2 collects the prior marginal distributions for all the parameters that we infer the joint prior is constructed by assuming independence as it is often the case with the exception of parameter d and of the parameters that characterize the ou process and the error model we sample in log space this means in practice that prior log normal distributions are transformed into the corresponding normal distributions in the numerical implementation to start the markov chains we draw from gaussian distributions centered at the mean of the marginal priors and with standard deviation equal to 10 the value of the mean as a general note we use quite lenient priors in terms of support albeit with clear preferences for those specific values that expert knowledge suggests regarding the initial states as mentioned in section 2 1 we use a 1 year long warm up phase at the beginning of each model execution to allow the level of the water in the initially empty reservoirs to adapt 2 8 analysis of results we distinguish three main steps for the analysis of results 1 analysis of convergence of the markov chains section 3 1 2 model deficit analysis section 3 2 3 posterior analysis and prediction section 3 3 the first step is a prerequisite for any interpretation of the results in case of poor convergence we would have to improve the sampling procedure or extend the markov chains the second step is intended to establish whether the additional degrees of freedom of the stochastic parameters are misused during calibration to compensate for model deficits if this is the case the statistical properties of the inferred parameter time series are not valid and either the model would have to be improved or the parameters leading to these problems would have to be kept constant we check this by cross validation and by analyzing the inferred parameter time series finally after these checks have been passed we can move on to the third step of interpretation of the results and prediction we discuss the methodologies applied in these three steps in the following three subsections 2 8 1 convergence analysis in most cases visual analysis of the markov chains provide sufficient information of convergence deficits due to extended burn in periods weak mixing or long residence time in secondary modes visual inspection also provides insights that can be useful in resolving the convergence issue on the other hand quantitative convergence measures such as the estimation of the effective sample size and standard mcmc convergence tests can be very useful for getting indications on which chains need a more detailed inspection although we make use of both approaches in section 3 1 the most satisfactory corroboration of convergence comes from diagnostic runs where we change the models slightly and achieve marginal posteriors that are very similar to the original ones we obtain this while testing the influence of the number of particles on model sto k f section 3 1 and of the prior for τ ln k s ou on model sto k s section 3 2 3 2 8 2 model deficit analysis the strongest methodology to identify misuse of the degrees of stochasticity to compensate for model deficits is cross validation which means that the model is run with the calibrated parameters without assimilating the available output data which are used exclusively to asses the model s predictive power this check is particularly important for stochastic models where during calibration the time course of the time dependent parameters is inferred in such a case the difference in model performance between calibration and cross validation can be indicative of the extent to which the time dependent parameters compensate for model deficits if during inference the time dependence of a stochastic parameter is used to compensate for systematic model deficits a good performance will not be reproducible in cross validation due to the uninformed random evolution of the stochastic process for this reason predictions will be poor and cross validation will make the problem if present identifiable as shown in section 3 2 1 aside from visual inspections to assess cross validation results we use four summary metrics similarly to previous work reichert et al 2021 those are the relative spread σ rel the distribution of the values that q obs attains within the cumulative distribution function relevant to the model outputs q m which we simply refer to as cdf the well known nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the flashiness index fi baker et al 2004 fenicia et al 2018 the relative spread is a diagnostic metric that aims to inform on the width of the distribution of the model output q m it does so by taking the average of the ratio between the standard deviation sd of the model predictions at a given time and the value of the corresponding observation for a stochastic model we can in principle partition the data by grouping according to particles parameters or both namely at any observational time t i we can compute the sd across parameters keeping the particles separated across particles keeping the parameters separated eq 13b or across all the data eq 13a 13 σ rel q m q obs 1 n i 1 n sd q m t i parameters particles q obs t i a 1 n i 1 n sd q m t i particles q obs t i b note that with eq 13a we obtain one single scalar while with 13b we get as many σ rel values as there are parameters samples hence we can display a distribution of values in general we find that grouping the data by the parameters does not add much to the description obtained by eq 13a and so we do not include those results for brevity we examine the cdf eq 14 to complement and extend the analysis by σ rel as this is another metric that reports on the match and span of the simulation data with respect to the observations indeed if the observations are drawn from the model realizations then the respective cdf values should delineate an uniform distribution any deviation hints to specific issues an excessive weight on any of the tail would point to coverage problems as such a shape would manifest that observations are too often outside the range of model s predictions in contrast distributions peaked around the center would suggest that either overparameterization is at play especially if the respective value of σ rel is small or that there might be an excess of uncertainty especially if the corresponding σ rel is large for simplicity for this metric we just group all the data together as the metric itself amounts to a distribution 14 cdf q m q obs f q m t i parameters particles q obs t i the nse is likely the most used metric in hydrology and is defined by eq 15a where e is the expected value operator 15 nse q m q obs e 1 i 1 n

acceptable model performance customarily implies values 0 5 in principle each model trajectory each of which is generated by a specific combination of particles and parameters has its own nse value in section 3 2 1 we present the distribution for all those values eq 15b and their expected value 15a the fi provides a measure of the fluctuation of models predictions eq 16a 16 fi q m e 1 n obs 1 i 2 n

what we plot in the relevant distributions in section 3 2 1 together with the average value 16a for all the metrics we never resort to smoothing of trajectories in post processing this means that the state of the model for a model s trajectory is always the one that emerges from the resampling scheme set by the pf up to the relevant observational time point see section s1 and table s1 in the supplementary material if the quantitative assessment of cross validation results points to misuse of the std parameter s to determine the cause of the problem an analysis of the posterior time series of the stochastic parameter s is very useful see section 3 2 2 this can lead to the identification of dependencies of the std parameter s on external influence factors or internal model states section 3 2 2 and or can help formulating additional hypotheses section 3 2 3 for our case study to perform cross validation tests we draw 400 parameters samples from the joint parameters posterior distribution select the associated model state at the end of inference and continue the simulation for a couple of years time for stochastic models we still run as many executions per sample as we do for inference viz we run 24 cross validation simulations per parameter sample 2 8 3 posterior analysis and prediction once convergence is established and the stochastic model is either improved to avoid misuse of the std parameters during calibration to compensate for model deficits or those parameters are kept constant or there are not such problems the model can be used for conventional posterior analysis such as assessing marginal posteriors 3 3 1 3 3 2 and prediction time series section 3 3 3 due to the explicit consideration of intrinsic uncertainty by the stochastic approach we expect a more realistic description of the uncertainty in internal model states than for a lumped error model that only adds the uncertainty to the final outcome we also expect a much more realistic distinction of smaller uncertainty during the calibration period when we condition the model to the observations compared to larger uncertainty for prediction when we do not have observed information about the model state although this limitation of the deterministic approach could be alleviated by resorting to a more complex formulation of the lumped error model reichert and schuwirth 2012 2 8 4 post processing tools all the routines used for post processing are coded within a specialized branch of the software spux šukys and bacci 2021 and partly rely on the r scripting language r core team 2020 3 results and interpretation according to the methodology recommended by reichert et al 2021 we first check convergence of the posterior sampling process section 3 1 then analyze potential problems of misuse of stochastic degrees of freedom to compensate for model structure deficits and interpret these deficits section 3 2 and finally analyze and discuss selected results to emphasize our findings section 3 3 3 1 convergence of sampling procedure for bayesian inference convergence for deterministic models is achieved easily even when we infer the exponent β of the storage discharge relationship which we do in a preliminary diagnostic run see fig s1 in that case a strong positive correlation is apparent between β and s umax see fig s2 which is confirmed for model sto d fig s3 for this model a secondary posterior mode for small values of β and s umax and large values of c e exacerbates convergence issues fig s4 hence correlation problems and small secondary modes both appearing when inferring std parameters and β concurrently let us lean towards fixing β 5 this value roughly corresponds to the marginal posterior mode of model det fig s1 figs s5 s9 show the evolution of the markov chains for all the models when β is set to 5 our core results are based on these models although we have also performed additional control simulations with β fixed to 1 or 2 which we do not find to substantially alter the overall picture that we describe below with β 5 we notice that secondary modes are eliminated when a large initial portion of the data is discarded see in particular figs s5b s9b in some cases for instance for parameters d and c e in model sto k s see fig s7 or parameters μ logit d ou k s and σ logit d ou in model sto d fig s8 it is clear that at least 2500 parameters batches are required for burn in not to surely falsify convergence these correspond to 100 k parameters samples as we propagate 40 chains in parallel hence if not differently specified our results are based on the last 450 batches 18 k parameters samples the achieved slow convergence underscores the heavy computational load and wall clock time required by this type of investigations overall to conduct the numerical experiments we use about 75 k node hours on the swiss national supercomputing centre s flagship machine piz daint using on average 180 parallel processes per stochastic model roughly partitioned 3 1 between the parallel propagation of the markov chains and the parallel propagation of the hydrological and stochastic models memory limitations bound the maximum number of samples that we can analyze to 20 k tackling this limitation is dealt with in a newer version of our software šukys and bacci 2021 despite this large sampling effort in the worst case scenarios sto k f and sto k s we can not obtain more than a few hundred independent samples see table s2 figs s10 s14 quantify the overlap among markov chains this is done by comparing one another the 2 5 97 5 percentiles spanned by the markov chains in parameters space see figs s10a b s14a b for the most critical cases we also provide the evolution of the chains with the smallest overlaps for specific parameters figs 10c d s14c d taking these results together we deem the overlap among chains acceptable although we cannot fully dispel concerns regarding possible within mode mixing barriers for a few parameters it is well known that the pf method can degenerate due to high levels of stochasticity high dimensionality of the state space and or extreme observations filter degeneracy usually implies a poor estimate of the marginal likelihood which in turn can hamper the estimation of the posterior density to consider this aspect we monitor the number of independent particles present in the filter at each resampling step as shown in figs s15 s16 there are some cases when the filter collapses onto just one or two particles these episodes are mainly limited to specific observational times however at those critical time points up to about 50 of the observational likelihood evaluations for models sto k f or model sto kkd can result from collapsed filters despite these unsound cases account for only a very small fraction of the total number of observational likelihood evaluations we also consider a diagnostic run for model sto k f where we double the number of particles from 24 to 48 this inference produces results that are very similar to the ones relevant to 24 particles see marginal posteriors in fig s17 although this is not enough to completely rule out possible detrimental effects owed to filter collapse it is a clear indication that the confined collapses of the filter that we experience are unlikely to seriously hinder our results however it is also clear that filter collapses can in general be critical for this type of applications attempts to use during a preliminary inference phase a number of particles that varies according to a measure of quality on the estimate of the marginal likelihood is a recent addition to our software framework incidentally but importantly the results in fig s17 provide us with a strong and positive assessment of convergence 3 2 deficit analysis 3 2 1 cross validation visual assessments visual inspection indicates a clear difference between the selected models regarding predictions of q see fig 3 models det sto k f and sto d appear to generate a similar extent of total predictive uncertainty in calibration and cross validation in the sense that there is a seamless transition between these two periods on the contrary model sto k s seems to produce larger uncertainty bands as soon as the filter is switched off that is as soon as cross validation starts a similar but less dramatic behavior is visible for model sto kkd as well which also suggests overconfidence during calibration when compared to all other cases in terms of relative contribution of parametric and residual uncertainty to model predictions as apparent when comparing the modeled output data with and without the contribution of the error term see figs 3 and s18 respectively the models show distinct behaviors based on their type deterministic or stochastic the predictive uncertainty of model det is almost exclusively ascribable to the lumped error model in contrast the quota of uncertainty due to the observational noise is much diminished for all the stochastic models we expect that these visual differences be mirrored in and quantified by those metrics that summarize the performance of a model this comes next quantitative assessments the perceptions illustrated above are quantified by first considering the relative spread eq 13 as mentioned in section 3 2 we explore different possible aggregations of the data and decide to plot in fig 4 the values of the spread when aggregating by particles eq 13b and the single scalar from aggregating all data per time eq 13a as aggregation by parameters gives very similar results to aggregating parameters and particles concurrently tight distributions close to the scalar value fig 4 shows that for model det the spread of model predictions attributable to parametric uncertainty alone is the smallest both during calibration and cross validation left column in fig 4 for this model predictive uncertainty is accounted for almost entirely by the residual error term right column in fig 4 for the stochastic models three observations are plain first the spreads of model predictions attributable to parametric uncertainty are much larger than for model det and accounts for a substantial part of the total predictive uncertainty roughly half when comparing the left and right columns of fig 4 second spreads are smaller in inference than in prediction in contrast to model det both results are evident indications of an improved partitioning of uncertainty by the stochastic models which better reflects the different knowledge status about the system during calibration more certain as conditioned on the observations and cross validation more uncertain as the observations during the cross validation period are not used to derive prediction uncertainty third models sto k s and sto kdd have an even much wider uncertainty during cross validation than in calibration compared to the models sto k f and sto d indicating a potential misuse of the stochasticity of model parameters during inference this does not seem to be the case for sto k f and sto d as their σ rel is slightly lower than the one of model det in prediction fig 4d additionally overconfidence for model sto kkd in calibration is manifest in the relevant distribution of σ rel in fig 4b fig 5 shows the evaluations of the cumulative distribution function cdf of the model predictions at the observational data points see eq 14 if our predictions would be perfect the obtained cdf values of q obs should be uniformly distributed in inference the cdf metric spans all scenarios from peaked tails for models det and sto d fig 5a to excessive data fidelity for sto k s and sto kkd figs 5a b see also figs 4a b to indeed assess that the respective σ rel is small in these cases the more ideal scenarios seem to pertain to model sto k f without observational noise and to model det with output error however when we consider cross validation with errors fig 5d all models perform comparably well overall the cdf data underscore under a different corner the crucial role of the error model for model det as opposed to the very small role of parametric uncertainty while stochastic models seem confirmed to better partition the uncertainty into the different sources providing adequate scenarios under most circumstances especially in prediction figs 5c d besides considering spread and cdf values we are interested in assessing model performance through customary hydrological metrics fig 6 reports the values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as described in section 2 8 these metrics are computed trajectory by trajectory and reported using the full distributions and the associated expected values the nse decreases from inference to cross validation top vs bottom row of fig 6 this drop is larger for the stochastic models than for the deterministic one because of the better fit during calibration and the higher uncertainty in prediction that also deteriorates the mean for the same reason nse also generally decreases when adding the lumped or observational uncertainty left vs right column of fig 6 in this case it is the stochastic models that minimize the degradation in performance this result is a consequence of the observational noise playing a less important role in the stochastic models than the lumped error in the deterministic model among the stochastic models sto kkd and sto k s are the ones performing worst during cross validation in particular while sto kkd excels in calibration it is also the model that shows the smallest nse values in cross validation these results bring into question the assumptions of these models such as an inappropriate selection of time dependent parameters note that it is not easy to distinguish a decrease in nse during cross validation due to model overparameterization or misuse of the stochastic degrees of freedom which we try to avoid from the decrease due to increased prediction uncertainty which should be a natural feature of uncertainty quantification the distributions of the nse shown in fig 6 provide here an important insight fig 6d shows that the right tails of the nse distributions of models sto k f and sto d extend to the largest values even larger than those of the deterministic model despite the mean nse is smaller lending this way additional confidence on the adequacy of models sto k f and sto d on the other hand this is not true for models sto k s and sto kkd which is another indication of their inappropriateness fig 7 shows the assessment of model performance in terms of the flashiness index fi it is striking to see the influence of the lumped error on the fi for the det model with values that roughly double moving from substantially below to substantially above the observed value the stochastic models show an improved ability to match this signature for those models the fi does not dramatically increase due to the contribution of the observational error and in any case the fi of the stochastic models matches the observed value more closely than model det additionally fi values remain comparable across inference and cross validation similarly to what happens with model det taken together these results indicate an improved partitioning of the uncertainty for the stochastic models sto k f and sto d with respect to the deterministic case both of these models show the expected increase in uncertainty for prediction compared to calibration an aspect that is missing for the deterministic model with a simple lumped error term the nearly perfect fit of models sto k s and sto kkd during calibration and worse performance than any other model during validation indicate an issue with overparameterization or misuse of the stochastic degrees of freedom to compensate for model deficits during calibration which cannot be replicated during cross validation we inspect the cause for these problems by analyzing the time series of the std parameters and potential correlation with states and external influence factors in the next section 3 2 2 analysis of posterior parameter time series when using stochastic models it is important to ensure that the stochastic processes are not compensating for substantial structural model errors as in that case statistical assumptions would be violated as concluded in the previous section we expect such problems in particular for models sto k s and sto kkd to scan for those we first look at 2d projections that relate model inputs and states to the dynamics of the std parameters see figs s21 s26 by visual inspection we do not detect any strong trend between an std parameter and a model s input or state variable this is an indication that the dynamics of the std parameters are not systematically compensating in an obvious way for a trivial and strong but missing in the model formulation deterministic relationship however given the results of the calibration we also consider specific plots for better discerning to what extent the stochastic dynamics of k s in model sto k s drives the discharge especially the larger values of the q s component of q see also fig s27 while we do perceive a weak trend from a zero correlation scenario indicating a possible role of k s in driving larger q s this trend is also present in the projection against s s as it is also confirmed by looking at time series fig 8 compares the times series for q s s s f and the respective std parameter for models sto k f and sto k s while keeping the deterministic model as a baseline for a specific and interesting phase of the calibration see fig s28 for the whole time series fig 8 let us identify two issues first the parameter k f increases in at least two of the recession phases this indicates that a nonlinear release relationship of the fast reservoir may reduce deficits of the deterministic model the time series of k s let us identify the problem of model sto k s it becomes evident that a fast systematic variation of this parameter considerably contributes to the generation of the fourth discharge peak it is a general danger of adding stochasticity to a release parameter of a slow reservoir that during calibration the variation of this parameter can be misused to generate any desired outflow as this reservoir will hardly ever be empty the reason why this seems to happen for just the fourth discharge peak in the selected calibration period can be seen from the deterministic simulation in fig 8g the deterministic model underestimates this peak a possible cause is thus that for this event the input was underestimated probably because the storm only partly hit the rain gauge however the fact that the misuse of k s occurs interspersed by increases in the water level s s which also drives q s higher see figs s27 s28 makes this problem hardly identifiable from the simple scatter plots discussed above indeed q s can be large also when k s is comparably small hence a 3d analysis of q s k s and s s would be optimal in this case albeit difficult to visualize and anticipate this demonstrates the importance of the cross validation analysis done in section 3 2 1 to identify this kind of problems the poor behavior of the model sto kkd just results as a consequence that it also contains the std parameter k s as we expect stochastic variables of a release coefficient of a slow reservoir to be also slow the question remains whether it would have been possible to avoid this behavior by a stronger prior for the correlation time of the std parameter k s this will be investigated in the next subsection 3 2 3 control simulation for model sto k s in an attempt to establish if the apparent misuse of parameter k s is actually just due to a lack of convergence owed to unfavorable starting conditions and or naive prior belief for parameter τ ln k s ou we perform an extra simulation where we increase the mean of the prior of the correlation time from 12 to 60 days results appear well converged as for τ ln k s ou 12 see fig s29 the log posterior values depicted in fig s30 are comparable suggesting a lack of clear preference for one of the two cases which confirms the notion that the parameters of the ou process are notoriously difficult to identify this is also supported by fig s31 which makes the point that different marginal posteriors for the parameters of the ou process do not necessarily imply fundamentally different marginal posteriors for the other parameters however it also provides us with a strong positive assessment on convergence of calibration for all the other parameters unfortunately due to a correlation between τ ln k s ou and σ ln k s ou which was already present in the original simulations see fig s32 by favoring larger values of τ ln k s ou we also favor larger fluctuations in the dynamics of k s these impede an improvement of the metrics with respect to what already shown in section 3 2 1 see figs s33 s36 highlighting this way a non trivial balance between overparameterization and improved description of our state of knowledge when using k s as std parameter which might be difficult to control and optimize indeed it appears that the misuse is also not corrected by the obtained larger values of the autocorrelation time as from fig s37 we evince the striking similarity of the results irrespective of the different prior means that we use 3 2 4 summary of deficit analysis in summary from our deficit analysis we conclude that we would have to exclude the models with the std parameter k s from posterior analysis and prediction this decision could only be revised if we would either be able to provide better input data or include a dynamic input uncertainty model such as the one used by del giudice et al 2016 3 3 posterior analysis as presented in section 3 2 models sto kkd and sto k s are performing poorly compared to the other models and should be discarded however we keep them in the following analysis to didactically point out some additional features that the misuse of a stochastic parameter can cause 3 3 1 parameters marginal posteriors fig 9 shows the marginal posterior distributions of the parameters of the various models the most striking differences are apparent for parameters c e and s umax models det sto k f and sto d behave similarly by showing peaked distributions for c e and corresponding large uncertain values for s umax models sto k s and sto kkd show the opposite behavior with wide distributions for c e shifted to very large values and peaked small values for s umax see figs 9a b which are likely just another footprint of the misuse of std parameters incidentally the obtained values of the evaporation parameter c e for the models with stochastic k s clearly point to problems as they are much larger than expert knowledge would suggest additionally models sto k s and sto kkd show a correlation between c e and s umax which is not present in any other model see fig s19 this difference in behavior can be interpreted considering that models sto k s and sto kkd have much smaller values of s umax than models sto k f and sto d the values of s umax for models sto k s and sto kkd may even approach zero meaning that the reservoir can run empty and cannot evaporate the closure of the water balance in these models is then achieved by increasing the evaporation to unrealistically high values i e c e values much larger than one when water is available in the reservoir for what concerns the splitting parameter d models can be visually and approximately separated into three groups see fig 9c in model sto k f parameter d tends to be smaller than 0 5 which favors routing the precipitation to the fast reservoir in contrast inference for sto k s and sto kkd results in d 0 5 models sto d and det do not seem to favor the routing of the rainfall to a specific reservoir this result indicates that a stochastic dynamics of a release coefficient tends to foster higher fluxes of water to the corresponding reservoir minimizing the flux to the others in our study this has particularly detrimental consequences when the reservoir in question is the slow one see section 3 2 1 another aspect of marginal posteriors that is worth to point out is relevant to parameters τ ln k f ou and τ ln k s ou the difference in these time scales is limited to just about a factor of 3 32 vs 11 days at mode values despite we expect a larger value for the correlation time of the ou process for k s than the one for k f the obtained difference is not enough as we see in section 3 2 2 to avoid response of the slow reservoir to quite fast outflow events for models sto k s and sto kkd unfortunately we also establish in section 3 2 3 that it is difficult to correct this behavior straightforwardly as it is not enough to just impose a lager prior value for τ ln k s ou as parameters posterior distributions differ only for τ ln k s ou and σ ln k s ou while caveats persist although τ ln k f ou is also not small enough to completely avoid that the fast reservoir contributes to the recession leg it is clear that this could be corrected by a non linear relationship and that this problem is much less severe as it does not undermine the model s performances appreciably see section 3 2 1 3 3 2 states marginal posteriors in fig s20 we group together the values of some of the variables that compose the state of the models as resulting from calibration simulations those include the outflow q m the fluxes within the model q f and q s the level of the water in the reservoirs s u s f and s s and the value of the std parameters if present the differences in the marginal posteriors of the parameters in fig 9 are mirrored in the marginal posterior of the states models sto k s and sto kkd differ from the other models especially in the distribution of s u which is depleted of the bulk values resulting in an often almost empty unsaturated reservoir the distribution of s f also appears thinner hence evaporation and the level of water in the slow reservoir have to compensate this is just one extra confirmation that when k s is made stochastic inference can promote a model where the slow response leads not only the baseflow but also part of the fast dynamics and this reciprocates with large values of c e and small values of s umax the distribution of q s also contains the footprint of the reaction of the slow reservoir to fast dynamics necessarily this reduces the number of peak flows from the fast reservoir which is a consequence visible in the distribution of q f for model sto k s see fig s20c a diminished role of the fast reservoir is also indirectly noticeable in the distribution of d in model sto kkd when compared to the same distribution in model sto d see fig s20d e other repercussions of the different underlying model behavior when a release coefficient is made stochastic are apparent when we compare the distribution of k f in model sto k f with the one of the other models an increased role of the fast reservoir is strongly suggested by the distribution in fig s20b importantly these considerations are much easier in hindsight after cross validation see sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 3 3 3 posterior predictions fig 10 illustrates the dynamics of the std parameters and of the level of water in the reservoirs in the deterministic and stochastic models for the final part of the calibration period and for the whole validation period these results complement and extend the analysis of the outflow q already shown in fig 3 by focusing primarily on the cross validation period and on the internal variables overall models det sto k f and sto d produce similar dynamics throughout both in terms of trends and values of the state variables of the process model however we should notice that there are specific differences within the det sto k f sto d group in the trends for the level of water especially for s s and s f while s u shows the smaller variability it is hence interesting to point out that s u looks completely different when k s is stochastic compare figs 10e n that s s from model sto d appears gaining a long term dynamics more similar to sto k s and sto kdd see figs 10f o and that the dynamics of s f for sto k f gains momentum at specific time points well above what happens for the det and sto d models 4 discussion after having shown and interpreted the results of our case study here we discuss potentially generalizable new results it is appropriate to remark that our contribution centers on investigating and discussing the improvements that we can obtain in characterizing our uncertain knowledge about a hydrological system when we resort to using stochastic time dependent parameters hence we do not necessarily search with our approach improvements to hydrological peak perfomance quantified by goodness of fit metrics such as the nse in fact the deterministic model that we employ already possesses satisfactory skills in reproducing the data according to this metric rather it is its ability in partitioning the different sources of uncertainty and in describing the status of knowledge which clearly differs from calibration to validation that we want to improve upon by doing so we are also able to conceive data driven suggestions for the improvement of the process representation in the det hydrological model for future assessments which could allow maximizing peak performance while still including a stochastic representation of internal intrinsic variability for its aptly partitioning between the different sources in addition to improvements in the description of variability describing uncertainties in hydrological models intrinsically rather than imposing their overall effect on observed output at the end of the cascade of processes transforming input into output is also more appealing conceptually as previously discussed and demonstrated with didactical models reichert et al 2021 compared to these previous examples our more realistic conceptual model applications confirm the appropriateness of the proposed method in improving the partition of variability and lead to additional insights on how different modeling choices may affect the performance of the stochastic models occasionally leading to an unintended behavior but also possibly exposing routes to model improvement from our results we expect an improved description of uncertainty of the model with std parameters compared with the model with constant parameters and a lumped error term if we are able to choose stochastic parameters that do not lead to a systematic correction of deficits of the deterministic model during calibration recommendations on suitable diagnostic and data mining approaches as well as on suitable modeling choices are discussed next a key difference in behavior between intrinsically stochastic models and deterministic models with a lumped error term is represented by their predictive performance in calibration and cross validation stochastic models during calibration can have low predictive uncertainty and achieve an excellent fit to the observations due to the calibrated time courses of the time dependent parameters during validation the uninformed due to lack of data awareness stochastic variability tend to lead to larger predictive uncertainties than in calibration and in case of misuse of the stochastic degrees of freedom in calibration even to a critical degradation of performances deterministic models with a simple lumped error term in contrast due to their fixed parameters do not tend to show a significant difference in predictive uncertainty between calibration and cross validation the fact that stochastic models lead to a higher uncertainty in prediction than in calibration is arguably an appealing feature of these models as it reflects that during calibration the data are known whereas during prediction the knowledge description by the posterior probability distribution is based on the data during the calibration period the absence of this behavior in deterministic models with a simple lumped error term can be interpreted as a symptom of unrealistic behavior and in particular of their inability to distinguish between the conditions of whether the data are known however when dealing with stochastic models it is important to assess when such an increase in uncertainty in model predictions from calibration to cross validation is desirable or at least unavoidable from when it is excessive and symptomatic of overfitting during calibration in order to distinguish between these two cases a careful analysis of model performance during cross validation is essential therefore cross validation plays a crucial role in the evaluation of stochastic models much more than for deterministic models where the performance during calibration and cross validation can be very similar our analyses indicate that in order to operate this distinction it may be useful to inspect the posterior distributions of the nse during cross validation the mean nse will drop in the prediction phase compared to the calibration phase due to the increased uncertainty that also allows for smaller values this is similar to overfitting with the mechanistic model however a comparison of the right tail of the posterior nse distribution could indicate which stochastic models produce better nse values than the deterministic approach and which do not in our case study this diagnostic leads to a clear separation of the problematic from the realistic stochastic parameters to discover the possible cause s of misuse of std parameters we find it important to analyze the time series of the parameters themselves and of the other variables that describe the internal state of the model this can also allow realizing opportunities for model improvements in a data driven fashion especially for the realistic settings as in our case it would be natural to propose an improved hydrological model where the water release from the fast reservoir is controlled by the water level through a non linear relationship however more experience is certainly needed to confirm the value of these analyses and to identify more indicators to support a good selection of stochastic parameters the differences between different stochastic models regarding producing a desirable behavior in prediction raise the question of whether more general recommendations can be given on which model parameters are good candidates to reflect model intrinsic uncertainty in our examples bad performing models are associated with the choice of making release coefficients of slowly reacting reservoirs stochastic this result suggests that this choice should be avoided slowly reacting reservoirs typically model groundwater and are of primary importance for modeling base flow consequently such reservoirs are hardly ever empty for this reason with time variation of its release coefficient nearly any dynamic discharge pattern can be produced this is dangerous because if the hydrologic model is unable to produce some observed pattern either due to input or model structural errors during model calibration this release coefficient can be misused to produce this pattern we have shown that because of the amount of hydrological data even a strong prior in favor of a long correlation time of such a release coefficient cannot avoid this problem this is certainly an issue that would occur in other applications as well it can be resolved by not making this coefficient stochastic even if some stochasticity due to varying releases from different water bodies with different release behavior would make a slow and hard to predict temporal variation realistic in our case study the choice of making the release coefficient of the slow reservoir stochastic has a detrimental effect also on other parameters it leads in fact to higher water demand for the slow reservoir which is achieved by modifying the water division coefficient and other model parameters this results in unrealistic values of multiple constant model parameters of other model components this is a phenomenon that would probably occur also in other applications the conclusion is that unrealistic in low probability domains of the prior posterior parameter values can be an additional indication of problems with stochastic parameters and need careful analysis in summary our results indicate that some general instruments can be used to distinguish the expected higher uncertainty during prediction periods as in cross validation from excess uncertainty i the analysis of the distribution of predicted nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse during cross validation and ii the shift of constant model parameters beyond their prior high probability range as a general recommendation regarding the choice of time dependent parameters we highlight the particular danger of making release coefficients of slowly reacting reservoirs stochastic additionally we also highlight the opportunity inherent to the analysis of the time course of the std parameters and related internal variables to act as a possible data driven source for model improvement a final new aspect of our study is the application of a different numerical approach indeed we apply a particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc approach as in andrieu et al 2010 to numerically sample from the posterior instead of conditional ornstein uhlenbeck sampling as in earlier studies reichert and mieleitner 2009 reichert et al 2021 this is a general approach for sampling from stochastic state space models it combines a particle filtering pf process for sampling dynamic states in our case stochastic parameters and calculating an approximate marginal likelihood for use in an outer markov chain monte carlo mcmc procedure for sampling the constant parameters the advantages of this approach are that the monte carlo algorithm can easily be parallelized and that the pf does not require neither linearity in the process it samples from differently from conditional ornstein uhlenbeck sampling nor normality in the distribution of the sampled space differently from the ensemble kalman filter evensen 2009 however as any other approach to states estimation it can suffer from all the caveats inherent to the sampling of high dimensional spaces e g verleysen and françois 2005 which are primarily manifest in filter collapses see section 3 1 additionally the particle resampling step poses challenges to the scalability of numerical codes all these algorithms that we use are implemented in the recently developed framework spux šukys and bacci 2021 5 conclusions conceptual hydrological models are very successful in describing key features of observed discharge time series on the other hand they are highly simplified representations of streamflow generating processes which leads to intrinsic model uncertainty that is propagated to the output the traditional description of a hydrological system with a deterministic conceptual model and a lumped output error model does not explicitly consider the main mechanisms of intrinsic uncertainty generation making mass fluxes between reservoirs stochastic by stochastic time dependent parameters is a means of describing such intrinsically generated uncertainty the uncertainty in the states is then a consequence of the uncertainty in the mass fluxes this is a conceptually more convincing concept than making mass balance equations stochastic because it is a closer description of the underlying mechanisms and maintains mass balances exactly on the other hand statistical inference for stochastic models is methodologically and computationally much more challenging than for deterministic models with a lumped error term this study proposes a new implementation of stochastic time dependent parameters for bayesian inference using a particle filter pf method coupled with a markov chain monte carlo approach the method is tested on a real case study using a multi reservoir hydrological model in particular we compare 4 stochastic hydrological model variants with different selections of time dependent parameters to a deterministic model variant all variants include an observational error which in the case of the deterministic model is intended to account for all sources of uncertainty our main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the combined particle filter markov chain monte carlo method provides a feasible alternative to previous implementations with the advantages of a potentially more efficient inference procedure and of a more general range of applications as it does not mandate linearity and or gaussian assumptions new inference frameworks such as the spux framework tested in this paper are meant to facilitate the application of the method and shorten the execution time by parallelization albeit scalability is difficult to achieve 2 the stochastic models have the potential to provide a more realistic description of uncertainty than the deterministic model in particular two out of the four stochastic models namely sto k f which makes the water release rate parameter of the fast reservoir stochastic and sto d which makes the split parameter from the unsaturated to the fast and slow reservoirs stochastic achieve a better description of our uncertain knowledge than the deterministic model with a lumped error term this assessment is based on the following results i although the deterministic and the stochastic models have similar predictive uncertainty bands the portion of this uncertainty attributable to parametric uncertainty is much larger for the stochastic than for the deterministic model compare figs 3 to s18 and the left to the right column of fig 4 this appears more realistic especially for the characterization of the states ii differently from the deterministic model the uncertainty of model output is smaller during the calibration than during the prediction period for the stochastic models which should be a natural result as it reflects our posterior knowledge of discharge given the observations during the calibration period compare the top row of fig 4 with the bottom row iii the stochastic models generate autocorrelated errors in output naturally either through the stochastic process e g in the case of the water release rate parameter or even combined with autocorrelation produced by downstream reservoirs e g in the case of the split parameter the effect of this behavior is manifested in the ability of the stochastic models to improve the match to hydrological signatures sensitive to autocorrelation such as the flashiness index shown in fig 7 these appealing features of improved characterization of uncertainty and more faithful adherence of the flashiness index to the observed value do not mar the other hydrological metrics for those stochastic models devoid of overparameterization effects indeed we find that the nse for models sto k f and sto d while showing a larger variability during validation in compliance with the notion that the data are unknown is not necessarily lower than the one of model det see fig 6 in particular the right tail of the distributions similarly the cdf metric does not seem impaired for those two stochastic models see fig 5 and this despite a small reduction in the relative spread with respect to the det model as in fig 4 all these observations taken together are an indication that a stochastic model can allow reducing the uncertainty in prediction for a similar value of consistency between the model output and the data in the validation set while also improving the partition of the variability between the different sources and the modeling of the correlation effects 3 stochasticity can be misused to compensate for model or input deficits this effect is shown by the other two stochastic models namely sto k s which makes the water release rate parameter of the slow reservoir stochastic and sto kkd which makes all three considered parameters stochastic these models have a significantly poorer performance during cross validation than the other models such as much larger uncertainty bands and smaller nse values we attribute this effect to a misuse of time dependent parameters to compensate for model or input deficits for example model sto k s reproduces a discharge peak that could not be reproduced by the deterministic model through the time variation of the water release rate parameter of the slow reservoir this is hardly a realistic description of the underlying system such a behavior is difficult to avoid because time dependence of the water release rate parameter of a reservoir that usually has sufficient water content as it is typical for a slow reservoir such as a reservoir representing groundwater can produce any dynamic output 4 our work indicates that model results can suggest additional modeling choices in this context looking at our results as a whole clearly suggests that making parameters d and k f concurrently stochastic should appear as a natural choice for a future set of additional investigations similarly diagnostic analyses for model sto k f turn into a data driven discovery of a small model deficit that could be simply overcome by establishing a non linear relationship for the dynamics of the fast reservoir this could prove beneficial both for improving hydrological performance and for the description of parameteric and intrinsic variability the varying performance of stochastic models suggest that the choice of which model parameters are made time dependent is important in this study we find that it is challenging to add stochasticity to a slowly reacting reservoir while we find more encouraging results for parameters linked to faster components of the model however insufficient experience is currently available to provide recommendations on which model parameters should be made stochastic our work underscores many potential areas for future exploration consider the possible strategies for model improvement as identified through data mining of the stochastic dynamics and of the influencing influenced variables explicitly consider input error and higher time resolution in input data conduct more in depth sensitivity analyses on both prior and pf hyper parameters especially number of particles to avoid collapses completely perform more simulations on different case studies to improve our understanding about overparameterization dependence effects on the individual parameters elucidate the dependence on influence of the chosen stochastic process on the results investigate the sensitivity to the error model bc vs other approaches regarding the suggested outlook we would like to reiterate that investigating the effect of different input features such as time resolution and or of an input error model are beyond the scope of this paper this is due to the need to maintain computational time and budget as well as data footprint within available resources and due to our decision to focus on analyzing the implications of choosing std parameters among the ones of the hydrological process model however research relevant to the effects owed to the explicit modeling of the input error is currently in focus in our department albeit we test the effect of doubling the number of particles additional assessments on the consequences owed to filter collapses are hampered by the large scale investigations that we carry out indeed here we focus on comparing multiple std parameters while we suggest that further diagnostic work shall focus on one specific case due to the computational load implied by changing the number of particles systematically finally further exploration of the effects of other modeling choices is of interest as well at variance with conditional ornstein uhlenbeck sampling pmcmc would allow extension of our work to non linear stochastic processes this can be interesting for further research as it seems plausible that the ou process can pose some limitations owed to correlations between σ f θ s ou and τ f θ s ou as it is demonstrated by the diagnostic run where we change the prior of τ ln k s ou with the aim to mitigate misuse similarly different output error models can be object of further investigations too as we find that by using a box cox approach we are able to overcome identifiability issues relevant to the width of the error distribution reichert et al 2021 credit authorship contribution statement marco bacci software validation formal

3178,the traditional description of a hydrological system with a deterministic conceptual model and a lumped output error term does not explicitly consider the main mechanisms of uncertainty generation due to approximate process representation unobserved variability in processes and influence factors and input uncertainty in this study we test the description of such intrinsic uncertainty in conceptual models by making process rates stochastic through stochastic time dependent rate parameters we analyze the advantages and challenges of this approach by using bayesian inference to jointly estimate model parameters parameters of the stochastic processes and the time series of the stochastic parameters numerically we use a particle filter to infer the stochastic time series and to approximate the marginal likelihood for markov chain sampling of the constant parameters compared to the lumped error formulation we achieve a more realistic description of uncertainty as we obtain larger errors in intrinsic states larger uncertainty during prediction than calibration periods a feature missing for simple lumped error models and autocorrelated model outputs however the additional degrees of freedom introduced with stochastic parameters can lead to an unintentional compensation for model deficits or input errors this problem is symptomatic of model structure inadequacy or poor selection of the parameters that are made stochastic and can be diagnosed through cross validation and careful posterior analysis the proposed approach is computationally more demanding and its implementation more challenging than the traditional description of hydrological systems using a deterministic model with a lumped error term however its advantages both in providing a more realistic representation of uncertainties and in diagnosing model deficiencies suggest its adoption and further development in future studies keywords stochastic parameters uncertainty quantification conceptual models bayesian inference particle filter cross validation 1 introduction process based catchment models are traditionally deterministic and their uncertainty is accounted for by separated lumped error terms which are applied to their output e g mcinerney et al 2017 such lumped error models describe the effect of all sources of uncertainty including input model structure intrinsic and externally caused randomness and observation error on modelled output e g schoups and vrugt 2010 reichert and schuwirth 2012 evin et al 2013 evin et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 ammann et al 2019 this approach leads to an efficient inference procedure at the cost of the need for an empirical error model parameterization and of the underestimation of the uncertainty of all internal model states reichert et al 2021 to mitigate these problems it has been argued in favor of modeling the uncertainty where it supposedly arises rather than grouping all contributions in a single error term on the output of the model this can be done by making the hydrological process model stochastic e g moradkhani et al 2005 kuczera et al 2006 liu and gupta 2007 reichert and mieleitner 2009 reichert et al 2021 the first arguments for the need of stochastic models in hydrology were introduced more than 50 years ago by mandelbrot and wallis 1968 more recently they consider general reasoning on the lack of suitability of deterministic models to describe hydrological features kuczera et al 2006 the intrinsically variable nature of hydrological parameters liu and gupta 2007 the characterization of structural model deficits leisenring and moradkhani 2011 and the opportunities for their identification wagener et al 2003 reichert et al 2021 within the domain of stochastic approaches to hydrology stochastic time dependent std parameters have been suggested as a tool to describe the effects of intrinsic uncertainty on model states and output and to possibly identify structural model deficits reichert and mieleitner 2009 reichert et al 2021 indeed by representing variability within the model structure they appear particularly suited to account for our uncertain knowledge of the system at hand a clear benefit of modeling uncertainty with std parameters is the consequential natural propagation of it through the model structure to the output in fact autocorrelation effects can be induced by the stochastic processes and are also directed and amplified by the propagation of stochasticity throughout the model additionally making process rate parameters stochastic is consistent with the fulfillment of mass balance equations which might not be granted with other specific modeling strategies indeed for example if it is the level of the water in the reservoirs that is treated as a stochastic variable moradkhani et al 2005 vrugt et al 2013 then mass balance equations are not exactly fulfilled importantly std parameters pose no theoretical limitations to the concurrent use of other complementary ways to treat uncertain knowledge observational error models on input and or output including models for systematic bias sikorska and renard 2017 as well as stochastic model states can all be used concurrently with std parameters despite these appealing features std parameters are seldom applied to demanding modeling scenarios this is mainly because of the intricacy of the algorithms needed to cope with the calibration of stochastic models because of the computational resources required to achieve converged results and possibly also because more complex and or informative outcomes can be more challenging to mine and interpret hence the overarching goal of this contribution is to comprehensively test and discuss the feasibility of using std parameters for a non linear multi reservoir conceptual hydrological model applied to real world data and to show the ensuing implications on uncertainty quantification by doing so we advance previous studies by considering a more complex model and by using up to 3 std parameters at once we also resort to a novel parallel framework šukys and bacci 2021 which allows us to benefit from available high performance computing hpc infrastructure and to use the particle filter pf method coupled with a markov chain monte carlo approach to bayesian inference pmcmc e g doucet and johansen 2009 andrieu et al 2010 fearnhead and künsch 2018 van leeuwen et al 2019 although not pursued here this could in principle be used to extend our work to non linear stochastic processes differently from what is possible with other methods such as conditional ornstein uhlenbeck sampling buser 2003 tomassini et al 2009 reichert and mieleitner 2009 reichert et al 2021 on the other hand the calibration of stochastic models with the pmcmc method is usually more computationally expensive and hence also likely to require expertise in parallel programming or at least familiarity with and access to hpc resources thus an additional goal of this contribution is to report on the algorithmic and computational aspects implicit in this more universal and wider ranging approach to stochastic modeling in hydrology ultimately the main motivation for the present and possible future endeavors of this type comes from the fact that approaches like this one can allow the modeler to improve the characterization of uncertainty by improving the partition of the variability into the different sources and can help identify and correct possible model deficits reichert et al 2021 thus we also list among our objectives the discussion of these aspects for our case study with this aim in mind we consider and discuss in particular the possible misuse of stochastic parameters which occurs when the posterior dynamics of the stochastic parameters systematically adjusts for model deficits such a misuse can only occur however when the data are known and used to inform the dynamical behavior of the model as in calibration data assimilation procedures in contrast compensation of model deficits simply cannot take place during prediction as observations are not used to inform the response of the model this inevitably reduces the predictive power of those models for which misuse of stochastic parameters occurred in calibration and this can be detected and quantified with cross validation further steps such as the explicit modeling of input uncertainty and the consideration of data sets with higher e g hourly time resolution are all challenges that we suggest should be tackled in forthcoming studies in summary the aims of this study are to explore characterize and discuss the application of std parameters to a conceptual hydrological model structure by using the pmcmc method within a parallel computational framework efforts are specifically directed to determine the ensuing implications for uncertainty quantification and to assess possible modeling limitations of the proposed approach and of the underlying hydrological model which the proposed approach can help to detect in order to meet and communicate all the mentioned goals the following design is taken first we select and describe our hydrological case study including the observational data in section 2 1 and the hydrological model that we use for its description in section 2 2 then we go into more details regarding std parameters inference and pf method see sections 2 3 2 4 2 5 2 6 we close the methodological part with an overview on prior and post processing which hinges on the need to quantify and compare the results of the simulated models both for calibration and cross validation sections 2 7 and 2 8 results are presented and interpreted in section 3 and further discussed in 4 the contribution ends with laying down our conclusions in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data we apply our approach for inference and cross validation to the murg catchment a small 80 km2 pre alpine foothill catchment in northeastern switzerland which is sometimes addressed to as wängi catchment from the name of the village where the gauging station is located this catchment belongs to the larger thur river basin and has been object of several previous studies e g dal molin et al 2020 ammann et al 2019 schirmer et al 2014 to which we address the reader for further specific hydro geological information here it suffices to say that the murg area is characterized by steep slopes that can make the streamflow peaks quite sharp by draining directly into the river ammann et al 2019 and that only 5 of precipitation is falling as snow which implies that snowfall is not a prominent influencing factor of the streamflow dal molin et al 2020 additionally there are no natural or artificial reservoirs in the study area all these notions are used to inform the building up of the hydrological model in section 2 2 the data used in this study consist of daily precipitation potential evaporation and streamflow for a 6 years period ranging from 01 09 1993 to 31 12 1999 as in previous works dal molin et al 2020 ammann et al 2019 streamflow values come from the swiss federal office for the environment foen while precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from meteoswiss 2018 all data are pre processed as described by dal molin et al 2020 the selection of a daily temporal resolution is justified by a previous study dal molin et al 2020 and by the necessity to keep the computational time and budget within reasonable limits while still exploring multiple hydrological hypotheses we use the observations from 01 09 1993 to 31 08 1997 for calibration with a warm up period to let the initial condition equilibrate equal to 365 days the data from 01 09 1997 to 31 12 1999 serve for cross validation 2 2 hydrological model and experiments the lumped model structure used in this study is schematically shown in fig 1 and in terms of complexity and processes representation is broadly reflective of typical conceptual rainfall runoff models such as hbv lindström et al 1997 gr4j perrin et al 2003 or hymod wagener et al 2001 more specifically the model follows the classic three elements setup outlined by jakeman and hornberger 1993 composed by an upstream element connected in series to two downstream units working in parallel the upstream element is an unsaturated reservoir ur u subscript and it exchanges directly with the environment through precipitation and evapotranspiration terms the balance between these two determines the amount of water stored in ur which controls through a nonlinear term and a splitting unit the flow to the two downstream elements these last two units are both linear reservoirs a fast reservoir fr f subscript intended to represent the hydrograph peaks and a slow reservoir sr s subscript intended to represent baseflow the model structure is built by using the superflex modeling framework fenicia et al 2011 we do not consider a lag function as in other models such as hbv as deemed unnecessary based on preliminary simulations supported by precipitation data see section 2 1 we also do not implement a snow component in order to limit the number of model calibration parameters similarly to what done in some other conceptual models such as gr4j some model parameters are fixed in particular we use β 5 unless otherwise stated which approximates a smooth threshold behavior for discharge generation and is justified by preliminary simulations see section 3 1 we also use m 0 01 as in previous works fenicia et al 2013 fenicia et al 2018 which implies that actual evaporation is approximately equal to the potential evaporation unless the reservoir is close to empty the dynamics of a model with structure as in fig 1 is controlled by eqs 1 1 ds u dt p t q q e u p t p t s u s umax β c e e p s u s umax 1 m s u s umax m ds f dt p f q f 1 d q q k f s f 1 d p t s u s umax β k f s f ds s dt p s q s dq q k s s s dp t s u s umax β k s s s q m q f q s k f s f k s s s from eq 1 s umax controls the maximum water level in ur anything above that level is spilled out to the downstream units in a single time step as in a truly on off model c e is the scaling coefficient for the evapotranspiration term d is the split parameter that controls how the water from ur is partitioned between the two downstream reservoirs the larger d the larger the flux to the slow reservoir and k f and k s are the coefficients that control the linear storage discharge relationship in the corresponding reservoir fr and sr respectively in the following case studies parameters k f k s and or d can be either deterministic meaning constant in time or stochastic meaning represented by a suited time dependent stochastic process see section 2 3 in particular we investigate a fully deterministic model and 4 stochastic models with different selections of std parameters the 5 experiments and the associated model calibration parameters are schematically shown in table 1 the deterministic model det does not include any stochastic process hence it only numbers 5 fitted parameters that we summarize in vector θ m s umax c e d k f k s in model sto k f the std parameter is k f in sto k s it is k s and in sto d is d finally in sto kkd we make all of them concurrently stochastic in the stochastic models the temporal dynamics of the std parameters is inferred jointly with both the parameters of the processes that model them and with the other model parameters the choice of making k f k s and or d stochastic rests on both theoretical and practical aspects indeed by limiting stochastic modeling to process rates mass balance equations formulated in the deterministic model remain valid this would be more difficult for capacity parameters such as maximum reservoir levels the three parameters mentioned above are the key process rate parameters 2 3 std parameters by denoting a general std parameter with θ s we model the evolution of a suited transformation of that parameter f θ s with a linear time continuous autoregressive stochastic process χ f θ s ou called ornstein uhlenbeck ou process uhlenbeck and ornstein 1930 this formally writes as f θ s t χ f θ s ou t t practically this means that given the value of the transformed std parameter θ s at time t 0 f θ s t 0 then the probability distribution of its subsequent value f θ s t 1 at time t 1 t 0 is given by the normal distribution 2 f θ s t 1 f θ s t 0 n μ f θ s ou f θ s t 0 μ f θ s ou exp t 1 t 0 τ f θ s ou σ f θ s ou 1 exp 2 t 1 t 0 τ f θ s ou from eq 2 the parameters of the ou process are its asymptotic mean μ f θ s ou its asymptotic standard deviation σ f θ s ou and its autocorrelation time τ f θ s ou we summarize these parameters in the parameter vector θ ou μ f θ s ou σ f θ s ou τ f θ s ou and we keep the notation θ ou also for the cases with multiple stochastic parameters where this parameter vector contains the means standard deviations and correlation times of all the std parameters while an ou process has unbounded codomain model parameters might not exceed a given range of values this is the reason why we generally need the transformation f on θ s such a transformation allows us to map the usually limited support of the modeled parameter onto the values that the ou process can take χ f θ s ou t r in this study we make model parameters k f k s and d stochastic since k f and k s are constrained to r we need a transformation f k f r r to this aim we simply choose the natural logarithm as in previous works reichert et al 2021 reichert and mieleitner 2009 this means that what we describe with the ou process is not k f or k s but it is their natural logarithms e g ln k f t χ ln k f ou t the equation for k s is analogous for the split parameter the transformation that we choose is the logit function this is because d 0 1 and the logit function is a possible way to map this interval to r logit d t ln d t 1 d t χ logit d ou t in summary when a parameter is modeled by an ou process we have to infer the value of the asymptotic mean of the process μ f θ s ou its asymptotic standard deviation σ f θ s ou and its autocorrelation time τ f θ s ou jointly with the posterior of its actual time course to simplify the notation and to highlight the fact that we always refer to the back transformed parameters θ s we use the symbol θ s to indicate the time mean of f 1 χ f θ s ou t where appropriate in section 3 we now proceed by considering the error model that we use to then be able to discuss our inference framework 2 4 observational and lumped error models in our setup the output error term applies to the discharge of the hydrological model in the same way regardless of the type of process model deterministic or stochastic the parameterization that we choose is also the same these choices are supported by simplicity by the willingness to be able to perform direct comparisons and by the flexibility of the selected error parameterization however we should notice that the error term on the output has in principle a different meaning for the deterministic or stochastic models in the first case the error lumps together all sources of uncertainty while for stochastic models it ideally just represents the observation error as parametric model structure uncertainty and intrinsic stochasticity are considered by the std parameters in the remainder of the text for simplicity we call the output error model observational likelihood even when for the deterministic hydrological model it represents the distribution of observations resulting from intrinsic uncertainty in addition to observation error to model the lumped or observational error for the streamflow q obs we opt for a widespread approach as it is well known the precision of the measurement depends on the magnitude of the streamflow itself a possible way to deal with such a heteroscedastic error term is to transform the data and the model output via a box cox bc transformation box and cox 1964 and to then apply a homoscedastic gaussian error model in the transformed space mcinerney et al 2017 3 bc q obs bc q m bc bc n 0 σ bc bc q obs n bc q m σ bc where bc q q λ 1 λ q m is the streamflow output by the hydrological model q obs is the observed discharge and the last expression in 3 provides the expected distribution of the observed data given the model output in other words it provides the basic and actionable definition of the observational likelihood given data and model output definition that is required to calibrate the deterministic model in a bayesian setting see section 2 5 we note that the observational error model 3 adds 2 parameters per hydrological model to the ones in table 1 the standard deviation of the normal distribution in bc space σ bc and the parameter λ of the transformation as it is commonplace we inferr σ bc while fixing λ to 0 5 as recommended in previous work mcinerney et al 2017 our parameter vector for the error model thus consists of a single element θ y σ bc we also note that we use the back transformed error q obs q m bc 1 bc q m bc q m to expose the relevant results in section 3 in order not to also have to resolve identifiability problems between input and intrinsic uncertainties we do not consider input uncertainty explicitly but analyse potential implicit effects of input uncertainty in our results we also note that input uncertainty could be considered in the used framework for example by modelling precipitation as a transformed stochastic process and using the observations to condition it del giudice et al 2016 all our models namely the hydrological model see eqs 1 and also table 1 and the observational or lumped error model eq 3 have parameters which are grouped in the vectors θ m and θ y respectively these parameters are inferred based on the available data as detailed in the following section 2 5 inference the parameters of the deterministic hydrological model given by eq 1 and the lumped error model given by eq 3 are inferred from the data using bayes equation 4 p θ q

made explicit as the customary product between likelihood l q obs θ and prior π θ and the the unconditional probability density of the observations p q obs is simply renamed evidence e q obs as it is commonplace the likelihood function of the model l q obs θ is the probability density of the observed data q obs given the parameters θ and used as a function of the parameters by substituting the

mean μ and standard deviation σ evaluated at x this expression is substituted into eq 4 to complete our definition of the posterior for the deterministic model if one or multiple parameters of the model are chosen to be stochastic however we get a hierarchical model in this case we denote the stochastic parameter s a subset of the parameters θ m of the hydrological model by θ s m and the remaining constant parameters by θ s θ s m θ y θ ou where θ s m are the constant parameters of the hydrological model θ y are the parameters of the error model and θ ou μ f θ s ou σ f θ s ou τ f θ s

single stochastic parameter this joint density is given as the product of an unconditional normal distribution for the initial point multiplied by the product of the conditional distributions of the next point given the previous one see eq 2 and multiplied by the correction factor for back transformation 8 p θ s m θ ou ρ n μ f θ s m ou σ f θ s m ou f θ s m t 1 k 2 n ρ n μ k σ k f θ s m t k k 1 n

a product of expressions of the form given by eq 8 note also that we use the same notation for the time steps in eq 8 as in the observation likelihood 5 since this is the implementation used in this paper however this is not a requirement of this technique the time discretization of the stochastic process is required only to integrate the differential equations of the hydrological model hence it is completely independent of the observation time spacing in eq 7 π θ s is the joint prior of the constant parameters and will usually be assumed to be the product of independent distributions of the three categories of parameters π θ s π θ s m π θ y π θ s ou independence assumptions are often taken also between the parameters within these three categories and e q obs is now given by l q obs θ s θ s m p θ s m θ s ou π θ s d θ s m d θ s since the parameterization of the error model is the same for all process models we note that 5 and 6 with θ s m θ s m for θ m and θ s θ s m for θ are still valid for l t 1 t n q obs t 1 t n θ s θ s m in 7 once q m is available at each time step t k by simple time integration of the hydrological model and of the respective stochastic process es the

that the last expression in eq 9 is again of the form of 4 however the marginal likelihood is now the very high dimensional integral 10 which implies the need to infer the time series of θ s m this makes inference for a stochastic model a much harder problem than inference for a deterministic one 2 6 numerical approach for the deterministic model we use a markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach to sample from the posterior given by eq 4 with the likelihood defined by eqs 5 and 6 and choose the affine invariant markov chain monte carlo ensemble emcee sampler by foreman mackey et al 2013 to achieve fast convergence when using stochastic parameter s we apply the particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc scheme described in andrieu et al 2010 this approach consists of combining a particle filter pf e g doucet and johansen 2012 fearnhead and künsch 2018 van leeuwen et al 2019 to sample the posterior marginals of the stochastic parameter s at each time point conditional on the constant parameters and on past to present observations and using these conditional samples to approximate the marginal likelihood 10 the approximate marginal likelihood is then used within an mcmc scheme to sample the constant parameters including the parameters of the stochastic process according to eq 9 again for this last step we use the emcee sampler cited above we provide some more details on this pmcmc approach in the next paragraph fig 2 provides an overview of the pmcmc scheme to the joint inference of constant and stochastic parameters pmcmc andrieu et al 2010 starts with sampling posterior marginal states of the stochastic parameter θ s m at each time point for given constant parameters by the pf as illustrated in fig 2 this is done by sampling values θ s m t i at a given time point from samples of points particles at the previous time point t i 1 integrating the hydrological model for each of these trajectories within the interval from time t i 1 to time t i and then calculating importance weights proportional to the observation likelihood at the new time point the values particles are then resampled according to the weights observational likelihoods and the weights are used to calculate the approximate marginal likelihood to derive this approximate marginal likelihood we first write the marginal likelihood 10 as a product of an unconditional distribution for the first observed discharge multiplied by conditional distributions for discharge at subsequent time points 11 l t 1 t n marg q obs t 1 t n θ s p q obs t 1 θ s k 2 n p q obs t k q obs t 1 t k 1 θ s where n is the number of observations this equation allows us to calculate approximate marginal likelihoods l based on samples θ s i m t k i 1 n p of the marginal distributions at all time points from the particle filter 12 l t 1 t n marg q obs t 1 t n θ s k 1 n 1 n p i 1 n p p t k q q obs t k q m t k θ s m θ s i m t 1 t k θ y where n p is the number of particles and p t k q is given by 6 in this work there are two main reasons why this expression is approximate first the samples of the time series of θ s m are replaced by the samples from the marginals at each time point that are only conditioned on the data up to this time point this is a property of the filtering approach and second with finite samples distributional properties can only be calculated approximately in an outer loop the approximation given by eq 12 can be used in 9 to sample from the marginal posterior of the constant parameters θ s using the emcee sampler all calculations are carried out using the spux framework by šukys and bacci 2021 in each simulation if not differently stated we use 24 particles and 40 markov chains propagated in parallel as a trade off between accuracy and computational load and time 2 7 prior table 2 collects the prior marginal distributions for all the parameters that we infer the joint prior is constructed by assuming independence as it is often the case with the exception of parameter d and of the parameters that characterize the ou process and the error model we sample in log space this means in practice that prior log normal distributions are transformed into the corresponding normal distributions in the numerical implementation to start the markov chains we draw from gaussian distributions centered at the mean of the marginal priors and with standard deviation equal to 10 the value of the mean as a general note we use quite lenient priors in terms of support albeit with clear preferences for those specific values that expert knowledge suggests regarding the initial states as mentioned in section 2 1 we use a 1 year long warm up phase at the beginning of each model execution to allow the level of the water in the initially empty reservoirs to adapt 2 8 analysis of results we distinguish three main steps for the analysis of results 1 analysis of convergence of the markov chains section 3 1 2 model deficit analysis section 3 2 3 posterior analysis and prediction section 3 3 the first step is a prerequisite for any interpretation of the results in case of poor convergence we would have to improve the sampling procedure or extend the markov chains the second step is intended to establish whether the additional degrees of freedom of the stochastic parameters are misused during calibration to compensate for model deficits if this is the case the statistical properties of the inferred parameter time series are not valid and either the model would have to be improved or the parameters leading to these problems would have to be kept constant we check this by cross validation and by analyzing the inferred parameter time series finally after these checks have been passed we can move on to the third step of interpretation of the results and prediction we discuss the methodologies applied in these three steps in the following three subsections 2 8 1 convergence analysis in most cases visual analysis of the markov chains provide sufficient information of convergence deficits due to extended burn in periods weak mixing or long residence time in secondary modes visual inspection also provides insights that can be useful in resolving the convergence issue on the other hand quantitative convergence measures such as the estimation of the effective sample size and standard mcmc convergence tests can be very useful for getting indications on which chains need a more detailed inspection although we make use of both approaches in section 3 1 the most satisfactory corroboration of convergence comes from diagnostic runs where we change the models slightly and achieve marginal posteriors that are very similar to the original ones we obtain this while testing the influence of the number of particles on model sto k f section 3 1 and of the prior for τ ln k s ou on model sto k s section 3 2 3 2 8 2 model deficit analysis the strongest methodology to identify misuse of the degrees of stochasticity to compensate for model deficits is cross validation which means that the model is run with the calibrated parameters without assimilating the available output data which are used exclusively to asses the model s predictive power this check is particularly important for stochastic models where during calibration the time course of the time dependent parameters is inferred in such a case the difference in model performance between calibration and cross validation can be indicative of the extent to which the time dependent parameters compensate for model deficits if during inference the time dependence of a stochastic parameter is used to compensate for systematic model deficits a good performance will not be reproducible in cross validation due to the uninformed random evolution of the stochastic process for this reason predictions will be poor and cross validation will make the problem if present identifiable as shown in section 3 2 1 aside from visual inspections to assess cross validation results we use four summary metrics similarly to previous work reichert et al 2021 those are the relative spread σ rel the distribution of the values that q obs attains within the cumulative distribution function relevant to the model outputs q m which we simply refer to as cdf the well known nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the flashiness index fi baker et al 2004 fenicia et al 2018 the relative spread is a diagnostic metric that aims to inform on the width of the distribution of the model output q m it does so by taking the average of the ratio between the standard deviation sd of the model predictions at a given time and the value of the corresponding observation for a stochastic model we can in principle partition the data by grouping according to particles parameters or both namely at any observational time t i we can compute the sd across parameters keeping the particles separated across particles keeping the parameters separated eq 13b or across all the data eq 13a 13 σ rel q m q obs 1 n i 1 n sd q m t i parameters particles q obs t i a 1 n i 1 n sd q m t i particles q obs t i b note that with eq 13a we obtain one single scalar while with 13b we get as many σ rel values as there are parameters samples hence we can display a distribution of values in general we find that grouping the data by the parameters does not add much to the description obtained by eq 13a and so we do not include those results for brevity we examine the cdf eq 14 to complement and extend the analysis by σ rel as this is another metric that reports on the match and span of the simulation data with respect to the observations indeed if the observations are drawn from the model realizations then the respective cdf values should delineate an uniform distribution any deviation hints to specific issues an excessive weight on any of the tail would point to coverage problems as such a shape would manifest that observations are too often outside the range of model s predictions in contrast distributions peaked around the center would suggest that either overparameterization is at play especially if the respective value of σ rel is small or that there might be an excess of uncertainty especially if the corresponding σ rel is large for simplicity for this metric we just group all the data together as the metric itself amounts to a distribution 14 cdf q m q obs f q m t i parameters particles q obs t i the nse is likely the most used metric in hydrology and is defined by eq 15a where e is the expected value operator 15 nse q m q obs e 1 i 1 n obs q m t i q obs t i 2 n obs i 1 q obs t i e q obs 2 a 1 i 1 n obs q m t i q obs t i 2 n obs i 1 q obs t i e q obs 2 b essentially the nse is a measure of fit of the predictions to the data acceptable model performance customarily implies values 0 5 in principle each model trajectory each of which is generated by a specific combination of particles and parameters has its own nse value in section 3 2 1 we present the distribution for all those values eq 15b and their expected value 15a the fi provides a measure of the fluctuation of models predictions eq 16a 16 fi q m e 1 n obs 1 i 2 n obs q m t i q m t i 1 i 1 n obs q m t i a 1 n obs 1 i 2 n obs q m t i q m t i 1 i 1 n obs q m t i b similarly to the nse each model trajectory has in principle its own scalar fi value 16b and this is what we plot in the relevant distributions in section 3 2 1 together with the average value 16a for all the metrics we never resort to smoothing of trajectories in post processing this means that the state of the model for a model s trajectory is always the one that emerges from the resampling scheme set by the pf up to the relevant observational time point see section s1 and table s1 in the supplementary material if the quantitative assessment of cross validation results points to misuse of the std parameter s to determine the cause of the problem an analysis of the posterior time series of the stochastic parameter s is very useful see section 3 2 2 this can lead to the identification of dependencies of the std parameter s on external influence factors or internal model states section 3 2 2 and or can help formulating additional hypotheses section 3 2 3 for our case study to perform cross validation tests we draw 400 parameters samples from the joint parameters posterior distribution select the associated model state at the end of inference and continue the simulation for a couple of years time for stochastic models we still run as many executions per sample as we do for inference viz we run 24 cross validation simulations per parameter sample 2 8 3 posterior analysis and prediction once convergence is established and the stochastic model is either improved to avoid misuse of the std parameters during calibration to compensate for model deficits or those parameters are kept constant or there are not such problems the model can be used for conventional posterior analysis such as assessing marginal posteriors 3 3 1 3 3 2 and prediction time series section 3 3 3 due to the explicit consideration of intrinsic uncertainty by the stochastic approach we expect a more realistic description of the uncertainty in internal model states than for a lumped error model that only adds the uncertainty to the final outcome we also expect a much more realistic distinction of smaller uncertainty during the calibration period when we condition the model to the observations compared to larger uncertainty for prediction when we do not have observed information about the model state although this limitation of the deterministic approach could be alleviated by resorting to a more complex formulation of the lumped error model reichert and schuwirth 2012 2 8 4 post processing tools all the routines used for post processing are coded within a specialized branch of the software spux šukys and bacci 2021 and partly rely on the r scripting language r core team 2020 3 results and interpretation according to the methodology recommended by reichert et al 2021 we first check convergence of the posterior sampling process section 3 1 then analyze potential problems of misuse of stochastic degrees of freedom to compensate for model structure deficits and interpret these deficits section 3 2 and finally analyze and discuss selected results to emphasize our findings section 3 3 3 1 convergence of sampling procedure for bayesian inference convergence for deterministic models is achieved easily even when we infer the exponent β of the storage discharge relationship which we do in a preliminary diagnostic run see fig s1 in that case a strong positive correlation is apparent between β and s umax see fig s2 which is confirmed for model sto d fig s3 for this model a secondary posterior mode for small values of β and s umax and large values of c e exacerbates convergence issues fig s4 hence correlation problems and small secondary modes both appearing when inferring std parameters and β concurrently let us lean towards fixing β 5 this value roughly corresponds to the marginal posterior mode of model det fig s1 figs s5 s9 show the evolution of the markov chains for all the models when β is set to 5 our core results are based on these models although we have also performed additional control simulations with β fixed to 1 or 2 which we do not find to substantially alter the overall picture that we describe below with β 5 we notice that secondary modes are eliminated when a large initial portion of the data is discarded see in particular figs s5b s9b in some cases for instance for parameters d and c e in model sto k s see fig s7 or parameters μ logit d ou k s and σ logit d ou in model sto d fig s8 it is clear that at least 2500 parameters batches are required for burn in not to surely falsify convergence these correspond to 100 k parameters samples as we propagate 40 chains in parallel hence if not differently specified our results are based on the last 450 batches 18 k parameters samples the achieved slow convergence underscores the heavy computational load and wall clock time required by this type of investigations overall to conduct the numerical experiments we use about 75 k node hours on the swiss national supercomputing centre s flagship machine piz daint using on average 180 parallel processes per stochastic model roughly partitioned 3 1 between the parallel propagation of the markov chains and the parallel propagation of the hydrological and stochastic models memory limitations bound the maximum number of samples that we can analyze to 20 k tackling this limitation is dealt with in a newer version of our software šukys and bacci 2021 despite this large sampling effort in the worst case scenarios sto k f and sto k s we can not obtain more than a few hundred independent samples see table s2 figs s10 s14 quantify the overlap among markov chains this is done by comparing one another the 2 5 97 5 percentiles spanned by the markov chains in parameters space see figs s10a b s14a b for the most critical cases we also provide the evolution of the chains with the smallest overlaps for specific parameters figs 10c d s14c d taking these results together we deem the overlap among chains acceptable although we cannot fully dispel concerns regarding possible within mode mixing barriers for a few parameters it is well known that the pf method can degenerate due to high levels of stochasticity high dimensionality of the state space and or extreme observations filter degeneracy usually implies a poor estimate of the marginal likelihood which in turn can hamper the estimation of the posterior density to consider this aspect we monitor the number of independent particles present in the filter at each resampling step as shown in figs s15 s16 there are some cases when the filter collapses onto just one or two particles these episodes are mainly limited to specific observational times however at those critical time points up to about 50 of the observational likelihood evaluations for models sto k f or model sto kkd can result from collapsed filters despite these unsound cases account for only a very small fraction of the total number of observational likelihood evaluations we also consider a diagnostic run for model sto k f where we double the number of particles from 24 to 48 this inference produces results that are very similar to the ones relevant to 24 particles see marginal posteriors in fig s17 although this is not enough to completely rule out possible detrimental effects owed to filter collapse it is a clear indication that the confined collapses of the filter that we experience are unlikely to seriously hinder our results however it is also clear that filter collapses can in general be critical for this type of applications attempts to use during a preliminary inference phase a number of particles that varies according to a measure of quality on the estimate of the marginal likelihood is a recent addition to our software framework incidentally but importantly the results in fig s17 provide us with a strong and positive assessment of convergence 3 2 deficit analysis 3 2 1 cross validation visual assessments visual inspection indicates a clear difference between the selected models regarding predictions of q see fig 3 models det sto k f and sto d appear to generate a similar extent of total predictive uncertainty in calibration and cross validation in the sense that there is a seamless transition between these two periods on the contrary model sto k s seems to produce larger uncertainty bands as soon as the filter is switched off that is as soon as cross validation starts a similar but less dramatic behavior is visible for model sto kkd as well which also suggests overconfidence during calibration when compared to all other cases in terms of relative contribution of parametric and residual uncertainty to model predictions as apparent when comparing the modeled output data with and without the contribution of the error term see figs 3 and s18 respectively the models show distinct behaviors based on their type deterministic or stochastic the predictive uncertainty of model det is almost exclusively ascribable to the lumped error model in contrast the quota of uncertainty due to the observational noise is much diminished for all the stochastic models we expect that these visual differences be mirrored in and quantified by those metrics that summarize the performance of a model this comes next quantitative assessments the perceptions illustrated above are quantified by first considering the relative spread eq 13 as mentioned in section 3 2 we explore different possible aggregations of the data and decide to plot in fig 4 the values of the spread when aggregating by particles eq 13b and the single scalar from aggregating all data per time eq 13a as aggregation by parameters gives very similar results to aggregating parameters and particles concurrently tight distributions close to the scalar value fig 4 shows that for model det the spread of model predictions attributable to parametric uncertainty alone is the smallest both during calibration and cross validation left column in fig 4 for this model predictive uncertainty is accounted for almost entirely by the residual error term right column in fig 4 for the stochastic models three observations are plain first the spreads of model predictions attributable to parametric uncertainty are much larger than for model det and accounts for a substantial part of the total predictive uncertainty roughly half when comparing the left and right columns of fig 4 second spreads are smaller in inference than in prediction in contrast to model det both results are evident indications of an improved partitioning of uncertainty by the stochastic models which better reflects the different knowledge status about the system during calibration more certain as conditioned on the observations and cross validation more uncertain as the observations during the cross validation period are not used to derive prediction uncertainty third models sto k s and sto kdd have an even much wider uncertainty during cross validation than in calibration compared to the models sto k f and sto d indicating a potential misuse of the stochasticity of model parameters during inference this does not seem to be the case for sto k f and sto d as their σ rel is slightly lower than the one of model det in prediction fig 4d additionally overconfidence for model sto kkd in calibration is manifest in the relevant distribution of σ rel in fig 4b fig 5 shows the evaluations of the cumulative distribution function cdf of the model predictions at the observational data points see eq 14 if our predictions would be perfect the obtained cdf values of q obs should be uniformly distributed in inference the cdf metric spans all scenarios from peaked tails for models det and sto d fig 5a to excessive data fidelity for sto k s and sto kkd figs 5a b see also figs 4a b to indeed assess that the respective σ rel is small in these cases the more ideal scenarios seem to pertain to model sto k f without observational noise and to model det with output error however when we consider cross validation with errors fig 5d all models perform comparably well overall the cdf data underscore under a different corner the crucial role of the error model for model det as opposed to the very small role of parametric uncertainty while stochastic models seem confirmed to better partition the uncertainty into the different sources providing adequate scenarios under most circumstances especially in prediction figs 5c d besides considering spread and cdf values we are interested in assessing model performance through customary hydrological metrics fig 6 reports the values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as described in section 2 8 these metrics are computed trajectory by trajectory and reported using the full distributions and the associated expected values the nse decreases from inference to cross validation top vs bottom row of fig 6 this drop is larger for the stochastic models than for the deterministic one because of the better fit during calibration and the higher uncertainty in prediction that also deteriorates the mean for the same reason nse also generally decreases when adding the lumped or observational uncertainty left vs right column of fig 6 in this case it is the stochastic models that minimize the degradation in performance this result is a consequence of the observational noise playing a less important role in the stochastic models than the lumped error in the deterministic model among the stochastic models sto kkd and sto k s are the ones performing worst during cross validation in particular while sto kkd excels in calibration it is also the model that shows the smallest nse values in cross validation these results bring into question the assumptions of these models such as an inappropriate selection of time dependent parameters note that it is not easy to distinguish a decrease in nse during cross validation due to model overparameterization or misuse of the stochastic degrees of freedom which we try to avoid from the decrease due to increased prediction uncertainty which should be a natural feature of uncertainty quantification the distributions of the nse shown in fig 6 provide here an important insight fig 6d shows that the right tails of the nse distributions of models sto k f and sto d extend to the largest values even larger than those of the deterministic model despite the mean nse is smaller lending this way additional confidence on the adequacy of models sto k f and sto d on the other hand this is not true for models sto k s and sto kkd which is another indication of their inappropriateness fig 7 shows the assessment of model performance in terms of the flashiness index fi it is striking to see the influence of the lumped error on the fi for the det model with values that roughly double moving from substantially below to substantially above the observed value the stochastic models show an improved ability to match this signature for those models the fi does not dramatically increase due to the contribution of the observational error and in any case the fi of the stochastic models matches the observed value more closely than model det additionally fi values remain comparable across inference and cross validation similarly to what happens with model det taken together these results indicate an improved partitioning of the uncertainty for the stochastic models sto k f and sto d with respect to the deterministic case both of these models show the expected increase in uncertainty for prediction compared to calibration an aspect that is missing for the deterministic model with a simple lumped error term the nearly perfect fit of models sto k s and sto kkd during calibration and worse performance than any other model during validation indicate an issue with overparameterization or misuse of the stochastic degrees of freedom to compensate for model deficits during calibration which cannot be replicated during cross validation we inspect the cause for these problems by analyzing the time series of the std parameters and potential correlation with states and external influence factors in the next section 3 2 2 analysis of posterior parameter time series when using stochastic models it is important to ensure that the stochastic processes are not compensating for substantial structural model errors as in that case statistical assumptions would be violated as concluded in the previous section we expect such problems in particular for models sto k s and sto kkd to scan for those we first look at 2d projections that relate model inputs and states to the dynamics of the std parameters see figs s21 s26 by visual inspection we do not detect any strong trend between an std parameter and a model s input or state variable this is an indication that the dynamics of the std parameters are not systematically compensating in an obvious way for a trivial and strong but missing in the model formulation deterministic relationship however given the results of the calibration we also consider specific plots for better discerning to what extent the stochastic dynamics of k s in model sto k s drives the discharge especially the larger values of the q s component of q see also fig s27 while we do perceive a weak trend from a zero correlation scenario indicating a possible role of k s in driving larger q s this trend is also present in the projection against s s as it is also confirmed by looking at time series fig 8 compares the times series for q s s s f and the respective std parameter for models sto k f and sto k s while keeping the deterministic model as a baseline for a specific and interesting phase of the calibration see fig s28 for the whole time series fig 8 let us identify two issues first the parameter k f increases in at least two of the recession phases this indicates that a nonlinear release relationship of the fast reservoir may reduce deficits of the deterministic model the time series of k s let us identify the problem of model sto k s it becomes evident that a fast systematic variation of this parameter considerably contributes to the generation of the fourth discharge peak it is a general danger of adding stochasticity to a release parameter of a slow reservoir that during calibration the variation of this parameter can be misused to generate any desired outflow as this reservoir will hardly ever be empty the reason why this seems to happen for just the fourth discharge peak in the selected calibration period can be seen from the deterministic simulation in fig 8g the deterministic model underestimates this peak a possible cause is thus that for this event the input was underestimated probably because the storm only partly hit the rain gauge however the fact that the misuse of k s occurs interspersed by increases in the water level s s which also drives q s higher see figs s27 s28 makes this problem hardly identifiable from the simple scatter plots discussed above indeed q s can be large also when k s is comparably small hence a 3d analysis of q s k s and s s would be optimal in this case albeit difficult to visualize and anticipate this demonstrates the importance of the cross validation analysis done in section 3 2 1 to identify this kind of problems the poor behavior of the model sto kkd just results as a consequence that it also contains the std parameter k s as we expect stochastic variables of a release coefficient of a slow reservoir to be also slow the question remains whether it would have been possible to avoid this behavior by a stronger prior for the correlation time of the std parameter k s this will be investigated in the next subsection 3 2 3 control simulation for model sto k s in an attempt to establish if the apparent misuse of parameter k s is actually just due to a lack of convergence owed to unfavorable starting conditions and or naive prior belief for parameter τ ln k s ou we perform an extra simulation where we increase the mean of the prior of the correlation time from 12 to 60 days results appear well converged as for τ ln k s ou 12 see fig s29 the log posterior values depicted in fig s30 are comparable suggesting a lack of clear preference for one of the two cases which confirms the notion that the parameters of the ou process are notoriously difficult to identify this is also supported by fig s31 which makes the point that different marginal posteriors for the parameters of the ou process do not necessarily imply fundamentally different marginal posteriors for the other parameters however it also provides us with a strong positive assessment on convergence of calibration for all the other parameters unfortunately due to a correlation between τ ln k s ou and σ ln k s ou which was already present in the original simulations see fig s32 by favoring larger values of τ ln k s ou we also favor larger fluctuations in the dynamics of k s these impede an improvement of the metrics with respect to what already shown in section 3 2 1 see figs s33 s36 highlighting this way a non trivial balance between overparameterization and improved description of our state of knowledge when using k s as std parameter which might be difficult to control and optimize indeed it appears that the misuse is also not corrected by the obtained larger values of the autocorrelation time as from fig s37 we evince the striking similarity of the results irrespective of the different prior means that we use 3 2 4 summary of deficit analysis in summary from our deficit analysis we conclude that we would have to exclude the models with the std parameter k s from posterior analysis and prediction this decision could only be revised if we would either be able to provide better input data or include a dynamic input uncertainty model such as the one used by del giudice et al 2016 3 3 posterior analysis as presented in section 3 2 models sto kkd and sto k s are performing poorly compared to the other models and should be discarded however we keep them in the following analysis to didactically point out some additional features that the misuse of a stochastic parameter can cause 3 3 1 parameters marginal posteriors fig 9 shows the marginal posterior distributions of the parameters of the various models the most striking differences are apparent for parameters c e and s umax models det sto k f and sto d behave similarly by showing peaked distributions for c e and corresponding large uncertain values for s umax models sto k s and sto kkd show the opposite behavior with wide distributions for c e shifted to very large values and peaked small values for s umax see figs 9a b which are likely just another footprint of the misuse of std parameters incidentally the obtained values of the evaporation parameter c e for the models with stochastic k s clearly point to problems as they are much larger than expert knowledge would suggest additionally models sto k s and sto kkd show a correlation between c e and s umax which is not present in any other model see fig s19 this difference in behavior can be interpreted considering that models sto k s and sto kkd have much smaller values of s umax than models sto k f and sto d the values of s umax for models sto k s and sto kkd may even approach zero meaning that the reservoir can run empty and cannot evaporate the closure of the water balance in these models is then achieved by increasing the evaporation to unrealistically high values i e c e values much larger than one when water is available in the reservoir for what concerns the splitting parameter d models can be visually and approximately separated into three groups see fig 9c in model sto k f parameter d tends to be smaller than 0 5 which favors routing the precipitation to the fast reservoir in contrast inference for sto k s and sto kkd results in d 0 5 models sto d and det do not seem to favor the routing of the rainfall to a specific reservoir this result indicates that a stochastic dynamics of a release coefficient tends to foster higher fluxes of water to the corresponding reservoir minimizing the flux to the others in our study this has particularly detrimental consequences when the reservoir in question is the slow one see section 3 2 1 another aspect of marginal posteriors that is worth to point out is relevant to parameters τ ln k f ou and τ ln k s ou the difference in these time scales is limited to just about a factor of 3 32 vs 11 days at mode values despite we expect a larger value for the correlation time of the ou process for k s than the one for k f the obtained difference is not enough as we see in section 3 2 2 to avoid response of the slow reservoir to quite fast outflow events for models sto k s and sto kkd unfortunately we also establish in section 3 2 3 that it is difficult to correct this behavior straightforwardly as it is not enough to just impose a lager prior value for τ ln k s ou as parameters posterior distributions differ only for τ ln k s ou and σ ln k s ou while caveats persist although τ ln k f ou is also not small enough to completely avoid that the fast reservoir contributes to the recession leg it is clear that this could be corrected by a non linear relationship and that this problem is much less severe as it does not undermine the model s performances appreciably see section 3 2 1 3 3 2 states marginal posteriors in fig s20 we group together the values of some of the variables that compose the state of the models as resulting from calibration simulations those include the outflow q m the fluxes within the model q f and q s the level of the water in the reservoirs s u s f and s s and the value of the std parameters if present the differences in the marginal posteriors of the parameters in fig 9 are mirrored in the marginal posterior of the states models sto k s and sto kkd differ from the other models especially in the distribution of s u which is depleted of the bulk values resulting in an often almost empty unsaturated reservoir the distribution of s f also appears thinner hence evaporation and the level of water in the slow reservoir have to compensate this is just one extra confirmation that when k s is made stochastic inference can promote a model where the slow response leads not only the baseflow but also part of the fast dynamics and this reciprocates with large values of c e and small values of s umax the distribution of q s also contains the footprint of the reaction of the slow reservoir to fast dynamics necessarily this reduces the number of peak flows from the fast reservoir which is a consequence visible in the distribution of q f for model sto k s see fig s20c a diminished role of the fast reservoir is also indirectly noticeable in the distribution of d in model sto kkd when compared to the same distribution in model sto d see fig s20d e other repercussions of the different underlying model behavior when a release coefficient is made stochastic are apparent when we compare the distribution of k f in model sto k f with the one of the other models an increased role of the fast reservoir is strongly suggested by the distribution in fig s20b importantly these considerations are much easier in hindsight after cross validation see sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 3 3 3 posterior predictions fig 10 illustrates the dynamics of the std parameters and of the level of water in the reservoirs in the deterministic and stochastic models for the final part of the calibration period and for the whole validation period these results complement and extend the analysis of the outflow q already shown in fig 3 by focusing primarily on the cross validation period and on the internal variables overall models det sto k f and sto d produce similar dynamics throughout both in terms of trends and values of the state variables of the process model however we should notice that there are specific differences within the det sto k f sto d group in the trends for the level of water especially for s s and s f while s u shows the smaller variability it is hence interesting to point out that s u looks completely different when k s is stochastic compare figs 10e n that s s from model sto d appears gaining a long term dynamics more similar to sto k s and sto kdd see figs 10f o and that the dynamics of s f for sto k f gains momentum at specific time points well above what happens for the det and sto d models 4 discussion after having shown and interpreted the results of our case study here we discuss potentially generalizable new results it is appropriate to remark that our contribution centers on investigating and discussing the improvements that we can obtain in characterizing our uncertain knowledge about a hydrological system when we resort to using stochastic time dependent parameters hence we do not necessarily search with our approach improvements to hydrological peak perfomance quantified by goodness of fit metrics such as the nse in fact the deterministic model that we employ already possesses satisfactory skills in reproducing the data according to this metric rather it is its ability in partitioning the different sources of uncertainty and in describing the status of knowledge which clearly differs from calibration to validation that we want to improve upon by doing so we are also able to conceive data driven suggestions for the improvement of the process representation in the det hydrological model for future assessments which could allow maximizing peak performance while still including a stochastic representation of internal intrinsic variability for its aptly partitioning between the different sources in addition to improvements in the description of variability describing uncertainties in hydrological models intrinsically rather than imposing their overall effect on observed output at the end of the cascade of processes transforming input into output is also more appealing conceptually as previously discussed and demonstrated with didactical models reichert et al 2021 compared to these previous examples our more realistic conceptual model applications confirm the appropriateness of the proposed method in improving the partition of variability and lead to additional insights on how different modeling choices may affect the performance of the stochastic models occasionally leading to an unintended behavior but also possibly exposing routes to model improvement from our results we expect an improved description of uncertainty of the model with std parameters compared with the model with constant parameters and a lumped error term if we are able to choose stochastic parameters that do not lead to a systematic correction of deficits of the deterministic model during calibration recommendations on suitable diagnostic and data mining approaches as well as on suitable modeling choices are discussed next a key difference in behavior between intrinsically stochastic models and deterministic models with a lumped error term is represented by their predictive performance in calibration and cross validation stochastic models during calibration can have low predictive uncertainty and achieve an excellent fit to the observations due to the calibrated time courses of the time dependent parameters during validation the uninformed due to lack of data awareness stochastic variability tend to lead to larger predictive uncertainties than in calibration and in case of misuse of the stochastic degrees of freedom in calibration even to a critical degradation of performances deterministic models with a simple lumped error term in contrast due to their fixed parameters do not tend to show a significant difference in predictive uncertainty between calibration and cross validation the fact that stochastic models lead to a higher uncertainty in prediction than in calibration is arguably an appealing feature of these models as it reflects that during calibration the data are known whereas during prediction the knowledge description by the posterior probability distribution is based on the data during the calibration period the absence of this behavior in deterministic models with a simple lumped error term can be interpreted as a symptom of unrealistic behavior and in particular of their inability to distinguish between the conditions of whether the data are known however when dealing with stochastic models it is important to assess when such an increase in uncertainty in model predictions from calibration to cross validation is desirable or at least unavoidable from when it is excessive and symptomatic of overfitting during calibration in order to distinguish between these two cases a careful analysis of model performance during cross validation is essential therefore cross validation plays a crucial role in the evaluation of stochastic models much more than for deterministic models where the performance during calibration and cross validation can be very similar our analyses indicate that in order to operate this distinction it may be useful to inspect the posterior distributions of the nse during cross validation the mean nse will drop in the prediction phase compared to the calibration phase due to the increased uncertainty that also allows for smaller values this is similar to overfitting with the mechanistic model however a comparison of the right tail of the posterior nse distribution could indicate which stochastic models produce better nse values than the deterministic approach and which do not in our case study this diagnostic leads to a clear separation of the problematic from the realistic stochastic parameters to discover the possible cause s of misuse of std parameters we find it important to analyze the time series of the parameters themselves and of the other variables that describe the internal state of the model this can also allow realizing opportunities for model improvements in a data driven fashion especially for the realistic settings as in our case it would be natural to propose an improved hydrological model where the water release from the fast reservoir is controlled by the water level through a non linear relationship however more experience is certainly needed to confirm the value of these analyses and to identify more indicators to support a good selection of stochastic parameters the differences between different stochastic models regarding producing a desirable behavior in prediction raise the question of whether more general recommendations can be given on which model parameters are good candidates to reflect model intrinsic uncertainty in our examples bad performing models are associated with the choice of making release coefficients of slowly reacting reservoirs stochastic this result suggests that this choice should be avoided slowly reacting reservoirs typically model groundwater and are of primary importance for modeling base flow consequently such reservoirs are hardly ever empty for this reason with time variation of its release coefficient nearly any dynamic discharge pattern can be produced this is dangerous because if the hydrologic model is unable to produce some observed pattern either due to input or model structural errors during model calibration this release coefficient can be misused to produce this pattern we have shown that because of the amount of hydrological data even a strong prior in favor of a long correlation time of such a release coefficient cannot avoid this problem this is certainly an issue that would occur in other applications as well it can be resolved by not making this coefficient stochastic even if some stochasticity due to varying releases from different water bodies with different release behavior would make a slow and hard to predict temporal variation realistic in our case study the choice of making the release coefficient of the slow reservoir stochastic has a detrimental effect also on other parameters it leads in fact to higher water demand for the slow reservoir which is achieved by modifying the water division coefficient and other model parameters this results in unrealistic values of multiple constant model parameters of other model components this is a phenomenon that would probably occur also in other applications the conclusion is that unrealistic in low probability domains of the prior posterior parameter values can be an additional indication of problems with stochastic parameters and need careful analysis in summary our results indicate that some general instruments can be used to distinguish the expected higher uncertainty during prediction periods as in cross validation from excess uncertainty i the analysis of the distribution of predicted nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse during cross validation and ii the shift of constant model parameters beyond their prior high probability range as a general recommendation regarding the choice of time dependent parameters we highlight the particular danger of making release coefficients of slowly reacting reservoirs stochastic additionally we also highlight the opportunity inherent to the analysis of the time course of the std parameters and related internal variables to act as a possible data driven source for model improvement a final new aspect of our study is the application of a different numerical approach indeed we apply a particle markov chain monte carlo pmcmc approach as in andrieu et al 2010 to numerically sample from the posterior instead of conditional ornstein uhlenbeck sampling as in earlier studies reichert and mieleitner 2009 reichert et al 2021 this is a general approach for sampling from stochastic state space models it combines a particle filtering pf process for sampling dynamic states in our case stochastic parameters and calculating an approximate marginal likelihood for use in an outer markov chain monte carlo mcmc procedure for sampling the constant parameters the advantages of this approach are that the monte carlo algorithm can easily be parallelized and that the pf does not require neither linearity in the process it samples from differently from conditional ornstein uhlenbeck sampling nor normality in the distribution of the sampled space differently from the ensemble kalman filter evensen 2009 however as any other approach to states estimation it can suffer from all the caveats inherent to the sampling of high dimensional spaces e g verleysen and françois 2005 which are primarily manifest in filter collapses see section 3 1 additionally the particle resampling step poses challenges to the scalability of numerical codes all these algorithms that we use are implemented in the recently developed framework spux šukys and bacci 2021 5 conclusions conceptual hydrological models are very successful in describing key features of observed discharge time series on the other hand they are highly simplified representations of streamflow generating processes which leads to intrinsic model uncertainty that is propagated to the output the traditional description of a hydrological system with a deterministic conceptual model and a lumped output error model does not explicitly consider the main mechanisms of intrinsic uncertainty generation making mass fluxes between reservoirs stochastic by stochastic time dependent parameters is a means of describing such intrinsically generated uncertainty the uncertainty in the states is then a consequence of the uncertainty in the mass fluxes this is a conceptually more convincing concept than making mass balance equations stochastic because it is a closer description of the underlying mechanisms and maintains mass balances exactly on the other hand statistical inference for stochastic models is methodologically and computationally much more challenging than for deterministic models with a lumped error term this study proposes a new implementation of stochastic time dependent parameters for bayesian inference using a particle filter pf method coupled with a markov chain monte carlo approach the method is tested on a real case study using a multi reservoir hydrological model in particular we compare 4 stochastic hydrological model variants with different selections of time dependent parameters to a deterministic model variant all variants include an observational error which in the case of the deterministic model is intended to account for all sources of uncertainty our main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the combined particle filter markov chain monte carlo method provides a feasible alternative to previous implementations with the advantages of a potentially more efficient inference procedure and of a more general range of applications as it does not mandate linearity and or gaussian assumptions new inference frameworks such as the spux framework tested in this paper are meant to facilitate the application of the method and shorten the execution time by parallelization albeit scalability is difficult to achieve 2 the stochastic models have the potential to provide a more realistic description of uncertainty than the deterministic model in particular two out of the four stochastic models namely sto k f which makes the water release rate parameter of the fast reservoir stochastic and sto d which makes the split parameter from the unsaturated to the fast and slow reservoirs stochastic achieve a better description of our uncertain knowledge than the deterministic model with a lumped error term this assessment is based on the following results i although the deterministic and the stochastic models have similar predictive uncertainty bands the portion of this uncertainty attributable to parametric uncertainty is much larger for the stochastic than for the deterministic model compare figs 3 to s18 and the left to the right column of fig 4 this appears more realistic especially for the characterization of the states ii differently from the deterministic model the uncertainty of model output is smaller during the calibration than during the prediction period for the stochastic models which should be a natural result as it reflects our posterior knowledge of discharge given the observations during the calibration period compare the top row of fig 4 with the bottom row iii the stochastic models generate autocorrelated errors in output naturally either through the stochastic process e g in the case of the water release rate parameter or even combined with autocorrelation produced by downstream reservoirs e g in the case of the split parameter the effect of this behavior is manifested in the ability of the stochastic models to improve the match to hydrological signatures sensitive to autocorrelation such as the flashiness index shown in fig 7 these appealing features of improved characterization of uncertainty and more faithful adherence of the flashiness index to the observed value do not mar the other hydrological metrics for those stochastic models devoid of overparameterization effects indeed we find that the nse for models sto k f and sto d while showing a larger variability during validation in compliance with the notion that the data are unknown is not necessarily lower than the one of model det see fig 6 in particular the right tail of the distributions similarly the cdf metric does not seem impaired for those two stochastic models see fig 5 and this despite a small reduction in the relative spread with respect to the det model as in fig 4 all these observations taken together are an indication that a stochastic model can allow reducing the uncertainty in prediction for a similar value of consistency between the model output and the data in the validation set while also improving the partition of the variability between the different sources and the modeling of the correlation effects 3 stochasticity can be misused to compensate for model or input deficits this effect is shown by the other two stochastic models namely sto k s which makes the water release rate parameter of the slow reservoir stochastic and sto kkd which makes all three considered parameters stochastic these models have a significantly poorer performance during cross validation than the other models such as much larger uncertainty bands and smaller nse values we attribute this effect to a misuse of time dependent parameters to compensate for model or input deficits for example model sto k s reproduces a discharge peak that could not be reproduced by the deterministic model through the time variation of the water release rate parameter of the slow reservoir this is hardly a realistic description of the underlying system such a behavior is difficult to avoid because time dependence of the water release rate parameter of a reservoir that usually has sufficient water content as it is typical for a slow reservoir such as a reservoir representing groundwater can produce any dynamic output 4 our work indicates that model results can suggest additional modeling choices in this context looking at our results as a whole clearly suggests that making parameters d and k f concurrently stochastic should appear as a natural choice for a future set of additional investigations similarly diagnostic analyses for model sto k f turn into a data driven discovery of a small model deficit that could be simply overcome by establishing a non linear relationship for the dynamics of the fast reservoir this could prove beneficial both for improving hydrological performance and for the description of parameteric and intrinsic variability the varying performance of stochastic models suggest that the choice of which model parameters are made time dependent is important in this study we find that it is challenging to add stochasticity to a slowly reacting reservoir while we find more encouraging results for parameters linked to faster components of the model however insufficient experience is currently available to provide recommendations on which model parameters should be made stochastic our work underscores many potential areas for future exploration consider the possible strategies for model improvement as identified through data mining of the stochastic dynamics and of the influencing influenced variables explicitly consider input error and higher time resolution in input data conduct more in depth sensitivity analyses on both prior and pf hyper parameters especially number of particles to avoid collapses completely perform more simulations on different case studies to improve our understanding about overparameterization dependence effects on the individual parameters elucidate the dependence on influence of the chosen stochastic process on the results investigate the sensitivity to the error model bc vs other approaches regarding the suggested outlook we would like to reiterate that investigating the effect of different input features such as time resolution and or of an input error model are beyond the scope of this paper this is due to the need to maintain computational time and budget as well as data footprint within available resources and due to our decision to focus on analyzing the implications of choosing std parameters among the ones of the hydrological process model however research relevant to the effects owed to the explicit modeling of the input error is currently in focus in our department albeit we test the effect of doubling the number of particles additional assessments on the consequences owed to filter collapses are hampered by the large scale investigations that we carry out indeed here we focus on comparing multiple std parameters while we suggest that further diagnostic work shall focus on one specific case due to the computational load implied by changing the number of particles systematically finally further exploration of the effects of other modeling choices is of interest as well at variance with conditional ornstein uhlenbeck sampling pmcmc would allow extension of our work to non linear stochastic processes this can be interesting for further research as it seems plausible that the ou process can pose some limitations owed to correlations between σ f θ s ou and τ f θ s ou as it is demonstrated by the diagnostic run where we change the prior of τ ln k s ou with the aim to mitigate misuse similarly different output error models can be object of further investigations too as we find that by using a box cox approach we are able to overcome identifiability issues relevant to the width of the error distribution reichert et al 2021 credit authorship contribution statement marco bacci software validation formal

3179,locating the free surface in steady state seepage flow through a homogeneous isotropic rectangular dam is a well posed free boundary problem it has often been used as a benchmark problem to validate sophisticated numerical schemes developed for solving more complex seepage problems encountered in groundwater hydrology this problem has been solved analytically using the hodograph method and the conformal mapping technique however very few explicit results are available on free surface profiles primarily owing to mathematical complexities and computational implementation difficulties to ameliorate this situation and enhance the practical value of the analytical solution to the benchmark problem this paper presents charts for determining the free surface profiles in rectangular dams the charts are created based on the celebrated polubarinova kochina analytical solution which consists of a set of parametric equations involving elliptic integrals with two unknown parameters namely α and β that characterize the relative positions of boundary singular points in the hodograph plane an efficient random search algorithm is developed and used to find the values of these two parameters and hence locate the free surface profiles for a wide range of dam widths and headwater and tailwater levels these results are well organized and plotted in charts for ease of use the accuracies of the proposed algorithm and chart for the two parameters are verified by comparing the computed results of the total outflow rates with those calculated using an exact closed form formula the algorithm and charts proposed for the free surface profiles are validated with the results available in the literature moreover the angle between the line tangent to the free surface and the horizontal direction is shown to change abruptly at its entry and exit points this finding offers an explanation of the paradox between the theoretically expected and graphically observed values of the entry or exit angle of the free surface keywords unconfined seepage analytical solution random search free surface profile entry and exit angles nomenclature α β parameters characterizing the

unconfined seepage flow in the absence of capillarity bear 1972 pages 252 253 it represents the upper boundary of the seepage flow domain determination of the free surface location plays an important role in analyzing the unconfined groundwater flow behaviors and their influences on the stability and safety of slopes landfills earth and tailings dams and embankments it belongs to the broad class of free boundary problems crank 1984 in which a part of the boundary of the computational domain of the governing equation is unknown although the associated boundary conditions are known a priori deriving exact analytical solutions to such problems is a formidable challenge as exemplified by a seemingly simple problem such as the two dimensional steady state seepage flow through a homogeneous isotropic rectangular dam in the absence of capillarity evaporation and infiltration as depicted in fig 1 although three exact analytical solutions to the rectangular dam through seepage problem shown in fig 1 were rigorously derived in the 1930s they are very daunting to academic researchers with limited expertise in conformal transformation and the analytic theory of ordinary differential equations with regular singular points although many numerical schemes developed for solving complex seepage problems were tested on the rectangular dam through seepage problem the analytical solutions have seldom been used this situation may be ascribed to the limited availability of the free surface profiles obtained from the analytical solutions for this reason this paper develops ready for use solution charts for determining the free surface profiles in rectangular dams under given boundary conditions 2 background for the rectangular dam through seepage problem shown in fig 1 the governing equation based on darcy s law and mass conservation is given by the well known laplace equation in terms of piezometric head ϕ the base of the dam of width l is assumed to be impervious and the submerged discharge face denoted de is assumed to be pervious the seepage face denoted ae of height h 0 is the segment of the downstream vertical boundary above the tailwater level and below the free surface exit point a it is assumed to be a pervious boundary exposed to the atmosphere the free surface denoted ab behaves as an impervious boundary because in the absence of capillarity evaporation and infiltration the free surface is also the sharp interface between water and air in the void spaces of the porous media between the saturated and dry zones of the dam the boundary conditions are expressed as presented in fig 1 in terms of ϕ according to the specified xy coordinate system headwater level h and tailwater level h exact analytical solutions to this problem were derived by hamel 1934 davison 1936 and polubarinova kochina 1938 1940 using the pioneering hodograph method for details refer to bear 1972 crank 1984 harr 1962 kovács 1981 or strack 1989 these pioneers devised different conformal mapping techniques to transform the governing equation and boundary conditions from the physical plane to the hodograph plane both hamel s and davison s solutions are quite complex and cumbersome hamel and günther 1935 proposed an algorithm for hamel s solution and plotted the computed free surface for a particular case of the problem this case was reanalyzed using a different algorithm by muskat 1935 1937 who also plotted the computed free surface and additionally computed the inflow rate through the upstream vertical boundary the seepage velocity distributions along the dam boundaries and the pressure distribution along the dam base wyckoff and reed 1935 utilized these results to verify an electrical analogy test model to study seepage problems five other cases in four of which the tailwater heads were assumed to be zero i e h 0 were also analyzed by muskat 1935 1937 but their free surfaces were not computed following muskat 1935 1937 chapman 1957a computed the positions h 0 of the free surface exit points for a range of dam widths l tailwater levels h and headwater levels h these results were presented in normalized form h 0 h l h and h h in a single chart hollingsworth and meyer 1958 proposed another algorithm for hamel s solution and computed the free surfaces for sixteen cases of no tailwater four of which were studied by muskat 1935 1937 they tabulated the coordinates of 11 points on each free surface to the authors knowledge no other results relating to hamel s solution have been published worse yet no computational results related to davison s solution have been found in the literature polubarinova kochina s 1940 solution was explicitly expressed as a set of parametric equations and thus it is less complex and more tractable in computation than hamel s and davison s solutions nevertheless numerical evaluation of this solution remains lengthy and tedious this is because in the case where h h and l are specified two out of three unknown parameters that is α and β see eqs 1 through 9 are involved in elliptic integrals and they must be solved from the nonlinear parametric equations these two parameters were used by polubarinova kochina 1940 to characterize the relative positions between neighboring singular points a b c d and e as shown in fig 1 in the hodograph plane polubarinova kochina 1940 again analyzed the case studied by hamel and günther 1935 she computed the free surface the inflow rate through the upstream vertical boundary q see fig 1 and the outflow rates through the seepage face qh 0 and through the submerged discharge face qh the coordinates of 6 points on the free surface were tabulated and the free surface curve was plotted comprehensive graphical charts of the computed results of h 0 h q kh qh 0 kh and qh kh where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium for a range of l h and h h values were published in polubarinova kochina 1952 classic monograph which was translated from russian into chinese and english in 1957 and 1962 respectively these results were obtained by inputting various values of α and β into the parametric equations by using polubarinova kochina s solution lo 1971 computed the values of h 0 h and q kh in the absence of tailwater namely h 0 for a range of l h values wider than that considered by polubarinova kochina 1952 these results were also presented in graphical form cryer 1976 computed h h 0 α and β for three cases including the one studied by hamel and günther 1935 elliott and ockendon 1982 page 126 and crank 1984 page 311 tabulated the coordinates of 16 points on the free surface for each of these three cases and for one of them respectively hornung and krueger 1985 computed the free surfaces for another two cases and tabulated the coordinates of 10 points on each free surface leontiev and huacasi 2001 tabulated the coordinates of 10 points on the free surface for the case of α 0 3 and β 0 9 by setting the h value to 100 and prescribing various values of α and β gobeil 2005 computed the corresponding free surfaces and values of l h h 0 and q k kacimov and obnosov 2016 plotted the free surfaces for three cases of no tailwater one of which was studied by hornung and krueger 1985 fukuchi 2016 appendix proposed an algorithm for polubarinova kochina s solution and analyzed a case that was studied by cryer 1976 elliott and ockendon 1982 and crank 1984 for this case the values of the three unknown parameters α β and c were obtained and presented and the coordinates of 16 points on the free surface were tabulated fukuchi 2018 plotted the computed free surface for a case that was investigated by kacimov and obnosov 2016 the above review shows that for the cases where the values of h l and h are specified only a very limited number of computed results of the free surfaces have been obtained from polubarinova kochina s solution for an arbitrarily specified set of h l and h values determination of the parameters α and β and hence the free surface from this exact analytical solution remains a challenging task based on the dupuit forchheimer assumption dewiest 1965 of the horizontal seepage velocity component invariant with depth several approximate analytical solutions were developed for determining the free surfaces through rectangular dams castro orgaz 2011 castro orgaz and dey 2014 castro orgaz and giráldez 2012 di nucci 2018 youngs 1990 however their accuracies were only verified against the available limited results of polubarinova kochina s solution over the past decades various numerical methods and associated sophisticated numerical schemes have been developed for solving practical problems of unconfined seepage generally an iterative solution process is necessary to locate the free surface and ultimately determine the flow field behavior cividini and gioda 1989 fenton and griffiths 1997 lópez querol et al 2011 sharma et al 2021 the rectangular dam through seepage problem has often been used as a benchmark problem to test the performance of iterative algorithms and numerical schemes some researchers have utilized the available free surface results of polubarinova kochina s solution as references to verify the accuracy of their numerical simulations aharmouch and amaziane 2012 ahmadi 2021 billstein et al 1999 bresciani et al 2012 cabral and wrobel 1991 chaiyo et al 2011 fukuchi 2016 2018 larabi and de smedt 1997 lee and leap 1997 leontiev and huacasi 2001 wang et al 2020 yuan and zhong 2016 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 many others however have performed verification by comparing the computed free surfaces with those obtained from other numerical simulations approximate analytical solutions and or laboratory experiments aitchison 1972 ayvaz and karahan 2007 bardet and tobita 2002 bathe and khoshgoftaar 1979 bazyar and graili 2012 borja and kishnani 1991 cheng and tsui 1993 cividini and gioda 1984 1989

2005 lacy and prevost 1987 lópez querol et al 2011 navas et al 2016 oden and kikuchi 1980 perera et al 2019 shahrokhabadi et al 2016 sharma et al 2021 wei et al 2021 westbrook 1985 wu et al 1996 xiao et al 2017 ye et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 therefore for stringent verification of numerical simulations and approximate analytical solutions there is a need for more comprehensive availability of the free surface profiles obtained from polubarinova kochina s solution 3 parametric equations of polubarinova kochina s solution note that in polubarinova kochina 1940 1952 and polubarinova kochina and falkovich 1947 there are some scattered misprints typos and errors some of which have been pointed out by cryer 1976 and kacimov and obnosov 2016 such mistakes have also occurred in a few papers that cited polubarinova kochina s solution such as leontiev and huacasi 2001 and shahrokhabadi et al 2016 fortunately all the mistakes that appeared in the parametric equations of polubarinova kochina s solution were corrected in the second edition of her monograph polubarinova kochina 1977 which however was not translated into english polubarinova kochina s solution was expressed in parametric form using the same notations as those in polubarinova kochina 1977 the following equations constitute a complete set of expressions of polubarinova kochina s solution including the expressions of the headwater level h tailwater level h dam width l height of the seepage face above the tailwater h 0 coordinates of the free surface x y slope of the free

where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium and k denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind as given by 11 k ζ 0 π 2 d φ 1 ζ sin 2 φ 0 ζ 1 eqs 7 and 8 were presented by polubarinova kochina and kochina 1998 and polubarinova kochina 1940 respectively the remaining equations were presented by polubarinova kochina 1977 the variable ψ in eqs 5 through 7 is in the range of 0 ψ π 2 with ψ π 2 and 0 corresponding to the entry point b and exit point a respectively of the free surface shown in fig 1 the parameter c with dimensions of length was defined as a scale for measuring the geometric dimensions of the flow domain boundaries the parameters α and β were defined to characterize the relative positions between neighboring singular points a b c d and e as shown in fig 1 in the hodograph plane according to the definitions of α and β given by polubarinova kochina 1940 1952 1977 both α and β are dimensionless in the range of 0 to 1 and α must be no greater than β if β 1 then it follows from eqs 1 and 3 that h and l respectively because the numerator in eq 1 becomes k 1 abramowitz and stegun 1972 and the denominator in eq 3 is zero at the upper limit of the integral if α β then it follows from eqs 1 and 2 that h and h because the denominators in eqs 1 and 2 are zero at the lower and upper limits of the integrals respectively therefore excluding these extreme cases the practical values of α and β should be in the range of 0 α β 1 as suggested by hornung and krueger 1985 when α 0 it follows from eq 2 that h 0 which indicates no presence of tailwater 4 random search algorithm for determining the parameters α and β there are three unknowns α β and c that need to be solved for the problem of seepage through a rectangular dam with a specified set of h l and h values once α and β are determined c can be directly determined with either eq 1 2 or 3 these equations show that h h and l h are functions of only α and β therefore both α and β can be solved from the following simultaneous equations 12 e h h h α 0 π 2 k α sin 2 χ sin χ 1 α sin 2 χ β α sin 2 χ d χ 0 π 2 k β 1 β sin 2 χ β α 1 β sin 2 χ d χ 0 13 e l l h 0 π 2 k α β α sin 2 χ 1 α β α sin 2 χ d χ 0 π 2 k β 1 β sin 2 χ β α 1 β sin 2 χ d χ 0 the values of α and β satisfying both eqs 12 and 13 can be found by performing a brute force search also called an exhaustive search over the parameter range this problem solving approach although straightforward is extremely time consuming and prohibitively costly from a computational point of view when a large number of values of α and β for various combinations of h h and l h values need to be solved to overcome this issue this study proposes a random search algorithm to find all the values of α and β satisfying eq 12 for certain values of h h eq 13 for certain values of l h and both eqs 12 and 13 for combinations of h h and l h values these data are then used to create a look up chart of parameters α and β for various values of h h and l h for ease of practical use the random search algorithm involves repeatedly assigning values to parameters α and β and evaluating the objective function eh in eq 12 or el in eq 13 the algorithm simply selects a starting vector of parameters α 0 and β 0 evaluates eh or el randomly generates a series of vectors of parameters αr and βr evaluates their corresponding results of eh or el and finds the values of α and β whose eh or el reaches a prescribed tolerance value this process is repeated until the range of parameters α and β is fully covered the random vector of parameters is generated as follows 14 α r β r α 0 β 0 r s where r is a random vector with random numbers ranging between 1 and 1 and s is the step length in a random walk which is set to 0 01 thus at each step of the random walk the values of αr and βr are generated within a square domain centered at α 0 β 0 with a side length of 0 02 fig 2 shows a flowchart of the abovementioned random search algorithm the algorithm was implemented in matlab mathworks 2022 using a doubly nested loop to ensure that the range of 0 α β 1 was covered in the outer loop α 0 was increased from 0 01 to 0 99 in increments of 0 02 in the inner loop β 0 was increased from α 0 to 0 99 in increments of 0 02 the random values of αr and βr were generated using eq 14 the built in functions ellipke and integral in matlab were used to return the values of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind k and the integrals expressed in eqs 12 and 13 respectively objective functions eh and el were evaluated for certain values of h h and l h respectively the maximum number of pairs of random values was set to 2000 the tolerance values of eh and el used to identify the values of α and β satisfying eqs 12 and 13 were set to 0 00001 all pairs of identified values of α and β were recorded and outputted fig 3 graphically shows the output values of α and β for various values of h h ranging from 0 0 to 0 6 and l h ranging from 0 4 to 1 3 all datasets are presented in the supplementary materials the solid curves represent the values of α and β for certain values of h h and the dashed curves represent the values of α and β for certain values of l h the values of α and β at the intersections of these curves are the solutions to both eqs 12 and 13 for various combinations of the considered values of h h and l h 5 charts for determining the free surfaces the α and β values for given h h and l h values satisfying both eqs 12 and 13 can also be directly identified by simply using a conditional statement in the inner loop of the random search algorithm these values are outputted and used to compute the free surfaces based on eqs 1 through 6 the following equations can be readily derived 15 x ψ l 1 0 ψ k sin 2 χ

sin χ cos χ 1 1 α sin 2 χ 1 1 β sin 2 χ d χ 0 ψ k cos 2 χ sin χ 1 α sin 2 χ 1 β sin 2 χ d χ thus the nondimensional free surface profiles for given values of h h and l h can be computed by importing their corresponding values of α and β into eqs 15 and 16 fig 4 shows 6 graphical charts of the computed nondimensional free surface profiles for various values of h h ranging from 0 0 to 0 5 and l h ranging from 0 4 to 1 3 6 verification and validation to verify the accuracies of the proposed algorithm and charts the total outflow rates computed using the algorithm or using the values of α and β read from the chart in fig 3 are compared with those calculated using a closed form formula it has been rigorously proven that the total outflow rate per unit length through the downstream vertical boundary of a rectangular dam is given exactly by the dupuit discharge formula charny 1951 chapman 1957b dewiest 1963 youngs 1966 bear 1972 pages 366 367 17 q k h 2 h 2 2 l three cases of different values of h h and l are analyzed as shown in the first column of table 1 their corresponding values of α β and c are shown in the third to fifth columns wherein the bracketed values are reproduced from cryer 1976 and fukuchi 2016 which are cited in the second column in the present study two sets of α and β values are obtained one using the proposed algorithm and the other using the proposed chart in fig 3 with the aid of webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2021 which is open source digitizing software by doing so the accuracy of the readings from the proposed chart can be checked against the precise values obtained from the proposed algorithm the values of c are computed using eq 1 by assuming k 10 7 m s the total outflow rates are computed using eq 8 and calculated using eq 17 as shown in the sixth and seventh columns respectively the differences between the computed and calculated total outflow rates q q are shown in the last column of table 1 for the three cases considered the absolute values of q q obtained from the proposed algorithm are less than those obtained from the values of α and β reproduced from cryer 1976 and fukuchi 2016 this implies that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than the accuracies of the algorithms developed by the two investigators for the first two cases the absolute values of q q obtained from the proposed chart are also less than those obtained from the values of α and β reproduced from cryer 1976 and fukuchi 2016 for the third case however the absolute value of q q obtained from the proposed chart is greater than that obtained from the values of α and β reproduced from cryer 1976 although the readings from the proposed chart is not very accurate the difference between the total outflow rates calculated from the curve readings and the precise values with the proposed algorithm is small the differences q q obtained from the proposed algorithm and chart are less than 0 000005 and 0 006 respectively indicating that the accuracies of the proposed algorithm and chart are high enough for practical use the accuracy of the computed free surface profile can be taken as a measure of the validity of the algorithm and charts proposed in this paper five cases of different values of h h and l are analyzed as shown in fig 5 the solid curves represent the free surface profiles either computed using the proposed algorithm or digitized by importing the charts in fig 4 into webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2021 and obtainning data from the corresponding curves the symbols represent the coordinates of data points on the free surfaces reproduced from elliott and ockendon 1982 crank 1984 and hornung and krueger 1985 excellent agreement is obtained 7 intersection angle paradox of the free surface it has been proven that the free surface must cross the upstream boundary at a right angle at its entry point and it must be tangent to the seepage face at its exit point bear 1972 pages 250 262 this means that for the rectangular dam problem shown in fig 1 the angles between the line tangent to the free surface and the horizontal direction must be 0 and 90 at points b and a respectively polubarinova kochina and kochina 1998 proved that polubarinova kochina s solution satisfies these two conditions since according to eq 7 dy dx 0 when ψ π 2 at x 0 and dy dx when ψ 0 at x l however the computed free surface profiles shown in figs 4 and 5 have apparently poor entry and exit angles leading to a paradox this paradox was also observed and noted by kazemzadeh parsi and daneshmand 2012 toufigh 2016 and zhao et al 2022 but no explanation was provided according to eq 7 the angle between the line tangent to the free surface and the horizontal direction can be computed using the following equation 18 θ ψ arctan d y d x ψ arctan k cos 2 ψ k sin 2 ψ for example the angle θ and the corresponding x coordinate of the free surface shown in fig 5 a are computed by inputting various values of ψ ranging from 0 to π 2 into eqs 18 and 5 respectively the values of α β and c shown in the fifth row of table 1 are adopted in the computation fig 6 shows the computed results of θ versus x the angle θ at the entry point b where x 0 and that at the exit point a where x 16 m are exactly 0 and 90 respectively nevertheless the angle θ increases abruptly from 0 to 13 and from approximately 60 to 90 within microscopic distances from points b and a respectively therefore the abrupt change in the angles of the tangent lines of the free surface at the entry and exit points makes the expected entry and exit angles i e θ 0 and 90 almost completely invisible to the naked eye 8 summary and conclusions this paper presents a state of the art review of polubarinova kochina s analytical solution to the steady state seepage flow problem through a homogeneous isotropic rectangular dam a complete set of parametric equations of polubarinova kochina s solution is presented a random search algorithm is proposed and used to find the two unknown parameters involved in the elliptic integrals in the parametric equations comprehensive results of these two parameters and hence the free surface profiles are obtained for a wide range of dam widths and headwater and tailwater levels these results are presented in nondimensional graphical charts these charts enable a straightforward and rapid determination of the free surface profiles the proposed algorithm and charts are validated with the free surface data points available in the literature excellent agreement is obtained their accuracies are verified against an exact closed form formula for the total outflow rate per unit length of the dam the accuracies obtained are high and therefore considered acceptable for numerical modelers to use the proposed charts as a benchmark to calibrate their schemes and models the angles between the lines tangent to the computed free surface and the horizontal direction are exactly 0 and 90 at the entry and exit points respectively however in graphs of the free surface profiles these angles can barely be observed with the naked eye leading to a paradox this paradox is explained by the angles changing

3179,locating the free surface in steady state seepage flow through a homogeneous isotropic rectangular dam is a well posed free boundary problem it has often been used as a benchmark problem to validate sophisticated numerical schemes developed for solving more complex seepage problems encountered in groundwater hydrology this problem has been solved analytically using the hodograph method and the conformal mapping technique however very few explicit results are available on free surface profiles primarily owing to mathematical complexities and computational implementation difficulties to ameliorate this situation and enhance the practical value of the analytical solution to the benchmark problem this paper presents charts for determining the free surface profiles in rectangular dams the charts are created based on the celebrated polubarinova kochina analytical solution which consists of a set of parametric equations involving elliptic integrals with two unknown parameters namely α and β that characterize the relative positions of boundary singular points in the hodograph plane an efficient random search algorithm is developed and used to find the values of these two parameters and hence locate the free surface profiles for a wide range of dam widths and headwater and tailwater levels these results are well organized and plotted in charts for ease of use the accuracies of the proposed algorithm and chart for the two parameters are verified by comparing the computed results of the total outflow rates with those calculated using an exact closed form formula the algorithm and charts proposed for the free surface profiles are validated with the results available in the literature moreover the angle between the line tangent to the free surface and the horizontal direction is shown to change abruptly at its entry and exit points this finding offers an explanation of the paradox between the theoretically expected and graphically observed values of

unconfined seepage flow in the absence of capillarity bear 1972 pages 252 253 it represents the upper boundary of the seepage flow domain determination of the free surface location plays an important role in analyzing the unconfined groundwater flow behaviors and their influences on the stability and safety of slopes landfills earth and tailings dams and embankments it belongs to the broad class of free boundary problems crank 1984 in which a part of the boundary of the computational domain of the governing equation is unknown although the associated boundary conditions are known a priori deriving exact analytical solutions to such problems is a formidable challenge as exemplified by a seemingly simple problem such as the two dimensional steady state seepage flow through a homogeneous isotropic rectangular dam in the absence of capillarity evaporation and infiltration as depicted in fig 1 although three exact analytical solutions to the rectangular dam through seepage problem shown in fig 1 were rigorously derived in the 1930s they are very daunting to academic researchers with limited expertise in conformal transformation and the analytic theory of ordinary differential equations with regular singular points although many numerical schemes developed for solving complex seepage problems were tested on the rectangular dam through seepage problem the analytical solutions have seldom been used this situation may be ascribed to the limited availability of the free surface profiles obtained from the analytical solutions for this reason this paper develops ready for use solution charts for determining the free surface profiles in rectangular dams under given boundary conditions 2 background for the rectangular dam through seepage problem shown in fig 1 the governing equation based on darcy s law and mass conservation is given by the well known laplace equation in terms of piezometric head ϕ the base of the dam of width l is assumed to be impervious and the submerged discharge face denoted de is assumed to be pervious the seepage face denoted ae of height h 0 is the segment of the downstream vertical boundary above the tailwater level and below the free surface exit point a it is assumed to be a pervious boundary exposed to the atmosphere the free surface denoted ab behaves as an impervious boundary because in the absence of capillarity evaporation and infiltration the free surface is also the sharp interface between water and air in the void spaces of the porous media between the saturated and dry zones of the dam the boundary conditions are expressed as presented in fig 1 in terms of ϕ according to the specified xy coordinate system headwater level h and tailwater level h exact analytical solutions to this problem were derived by hamel 1934 davison 1936 and polubarinova kochina 1938 1940 using the pioneering hodograph method for details refer to bear 1972 crank 1984 harr 1962 kovács 1981 or strack 1989 these pioneers devised different conformal mapping techniques to transform the governing equation and boundary conditions from the physical plane to the hodograph plane both hamel s and davison s solutions are quite complex and cumbersome hamel and günther 1935 proposed an algorithm for hamel s solution and plotted the computed free surface for a particular case of the problem this case was reanalyzed using a different algorithm by muskat 1935 1937 who also plotted the computed free surface and additionally computed the inflow rate through the upstream vertical boundary the seepage velocity distributions along the dam boundaries and the pressure distribution along the dam base wyckoff and reed 1935 utilized these results to verify an electrical analogy test model to study seepage problems five other cases in four of which the tailwater heads were assumed to be zero i e h 0 were also analyzed by muskat 1935 1937 but their free surfaces were not computed following muskat 1935 1937 chapman 1957a computed the positions h 0 of the free surface exit points for a range of dam widths l tailwater levels h and headwater levels h these results were presented in normalized form h 0 h l h and h h in a single chart hollingsworth and meyer 1958 proposed another algorithm for hamel s solution and computed the free surfaces for sixteen cases of no tailwater four of which were studied by muskat 1935 1937 they tabulated the coordinates of 11 points on each free surface to the authors knowledge no other results relating to hamel s solution have been published worse yet no computational results related to davison s solution have been found in the literature polubarinova kochina s 1940 solution was explicitly expressed as a set of parametric equations and thus it is less complex and more tractable in computation than hamel s and davison s solutions nevertheless numerical evaluation of this solution remains lengthy and tedious this is because in the case where h h and l are specified two out of three unknown parameters that is α and β see eqs 1 through 9 are involved in elliptic integrals and they must be solved from the nonlinear parametric equations these two parameters were used by polubarinova kochina 1940 to characterize the relative positions between neighboring singular points a b c d and e as shown in fig 1 in the hodograph plane polubarinova kochina 1940 again analyzed the case studied by hamel and günther 1935 she computed the free surface the inflow rate through the upstream vertical boundary q see fig 1 and the outflow rates through the seepage face qh 0 and through the submerged discharge face qh the coordinates of 6 points on the free surface were tabulated and the free surface curve was plotted comprehensive graphical charts of the computed results of h 0 h q kh qh 0 kh and qh kh where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium for a range of l h and h h values were published in polubarinova kochina 1952 classic monograph which was translated from russian into chinese and english in 1957 and 1962 respectively these results were obtained by inputting various values of α and β into the parametric equations by using polubarinova kochina s solution lo 1971 computed the values of h 0 h and q kh in the absence of tailwater namely h 0 for a range of l h values wider than that considered by polubarinova kochina 1952 these results were also presented in graphical form cryer 1976 computed h h 0 α and β for three cases including the one studied by hamel and günther 1935 elliott and ockendon 1982 page 126 and crank 1984 page 311 tabulated the coordinates of 16 points on the free surface for each of these three cases and for one of them respectively hornung and krueger 1985 computed the free surfaces for another two cases and tabulated the coordinates of 10 points on each free surface leontiev and huacasi 2001 tabulated the coordinates of 10 points on the free surface for the case of α 0 3 and β 0 9 by setting the h value to 100 and prescribing various values of α and β gobeil 2005 computed the corresponding free surfaces and values of l h h 0 and q k kacimov and obnosov 2016 plotted the free surfaces for three cases of no tailwater one of which was studied by hornung and krueger 1985 fukuchi 2016 appendix proposed an algorithm for polubarinova kochina s solution and analyzed a case that was studied by cryer 1976 elliott and ockendon 1982 and crank 1984 for this case the values of the three unknown parameters α β and c were obtained and presented and the coordinates of 16 points on the free surface were tabulated fukuchi 2018 plotted the computed free surface for a case that was investigated by kacimov and obnosov 2016 the above review shows that for the cases where the values of h l and h are specified only a very limited number of computed results of the free surfaces have been obtained from polubarinova kochina s solution for an arbitrarily specified set of h l and h values determination of the parameters α and β and hence the free surface from this exact analytical solution remains a challenging task based on the dupuit forchheimer assumption dewiest 1965 of the horizontal seepage velocity component invariant with depth several approximate analytical solutions were developed for determining the free surfaces through rectangular dams castro orgaz 2011 castro orgaz and dey 2014 castro orgaz and giráldez 2012 di nucci 2018 youngs 1990 however their accuracies were only verified against the available limited results of polubarinova kochina s solution over the past decades various numerical methods and associated sophisticated numerical schemes have been developed for solving practical problems of unconfined seepage generally an iterative solution process is necessary to locate the free surface and ultimately determine the flow field behavior cividini and gioda 1989 fenton and griffiths 1997 lópez querol et al 2011 sharma et al 2021 the rectangular dam through seepage problem has often been used as a benchmark problem to test the performance of iterative algorithms and numerical schemes some researchers have utilized the available free surface results of polubarinova kochina s solution as references to verify the accuracy of their numerical simulations aharmouch and amaziane 2012 ahmadi 2021 billstein et al 1999 bresciani et al 2012 cabral and wrobel 1991 chaiyo et al 2011 fukuchi 2016 2018 larabi and de smedt 1997 lee and leap 1997 leontiev and huacasi 2001 wang et al 2020 yuan and zhong 2016 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 many others however have performed verification by comparing the computed free surfaces with those obtained from other numerical simulations approximate analytical solutions and or laboratory experiments aitchison 1972 ayvaz and karahan 2007 bardet and tobita 2002 bathe and khoshgoftaar 1979 bazyar and graili 2012 borja and kishnani 1991 cheng and tsui 1993 cividini and gioda 1984 1989 crank and ozis 1980 darbandi et al 2007 desai and baseghi 1988 france et al 1971 ji et al 2005 jiang et al 2013 2014 jie et al 2013 karchewski et al 2016 kazemzadeh parsi and daneshmand 2012 knight 2005 lacy and prevost 1987 lópez querol et al 2011 navas et al 2016 oden and kikuchi 1980 perera et al 2019 shahrokhabadi et al 2016 sharma et al 2021 wei et al 2021 westbrook 1985 wu et al 1996 xiao et al 2017 ye et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 therefore for stringent verification of numerical simulations and approximate analytical solutions there is a need for more comprehensive availability of the free surface profiles obtained from polubarinova kochina s solution 3 parametric equations of polubarinova kochina s solution note that in polubarinova kochina 1940 1952 and polubarinova kochina and falkovich 1947 there are some scattered misprints typos and errors some of which have been pointed out by cryer 1976 and kacimov and obnosov 2016 such mistakes have also occurred in a few papers that cited polubarinova kochina s solution such as leontiev and huacasi 2001 and shahrokhabadi et al 2016 fortunately all the mistakes that appeared in the parametric equations of polubarinova kochina s solution were corrected in the second edition of her monograph polubarinova kochina 1977 which however was not translated into english polubarinova kochina s solution was expressed in parametric form using the same notations as those in polubarinova kochina 1977 the following equations constitute a complete set of expressions of polubarinova kochina s solution including the expressions of the headwater level h tailwater level h dam width l height of the seepage face above the tailwater h 0 coordinates of the free surface x y slope of the free

where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium and k denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind as given by 11 k ζ 0 π 2 d φ 1 ζ sin 2 φ 0 ζ 1 eqs 7 and 8 were presented by polubarinova kochina and kochina 1998 and polubarinova kochina 1940 respectively the remaining equations were presented by polubarinova kochina 1977 the variable ψ in eqs 5 through 7 is in the range of 0 ψ π 2 with ψ π 2 and 0 corresponding to the entry point b and exit point a respectively of the free surface shown in fig 1 the parameter c with dimensions of length was defined as a scale for measuring the geometric dimensions of the flow domain boundaries the parameters α and β were defined to characterize the relative positions between neighboring singular points a b c d and e as shown in fig 1 in the hodograph plane according to the definitions of α and β given by polubarinova kochina 1940 1952 1977 both α and β are dimensionless in the range of 0 to 1 and α must be no greater than β if β 1 then it follows from eqs 1 and 3 that h and l respectively because the numerator in eq 1 becomes k 1 abramowitz and stegun 1972 and the denominator in eq 3 is zero at the upper limit of the integral if α β then it follows from eqs 1 and 2 that h and h because the denominators in eqs 1 and 2 are zero at the lower and upper limits of the integrals respectively therefore excluding these extreme cases the practical values of α and β should be in the range of 0 α β 1 as suggested by hornung and krueger 1985 when α 0 it follows from eq 2 that h 0 which indicates no presence of tailwater 4 random search algorithm for determining the parameters α and β there are three unknowns α β and c that need to be solved for the problem of seepage through a rectangular dam with a specified set of h l and h values once α and β are determined c can be directly determined with either eq 1 2 or 3 these equations show that h h and l h are functions of only α and β therefore both α and β can be solved from the following simultaneous equations 12 e h h h α 0 π 2 k α sin 2 χ sin χ 1 α sin 2 χ β α sin 2 χ d χ 0 π 2 k β 1 β sin 2 χ β α 1 β sin 2 χ d χ 0 13 e l l h 0 π 2 k α β α sin 2 χ 1 α β α sin 2 χ d χ 0 π 2 k β 1 β sin 2 χ β α 1 β sin 2 χ d χ 0 the values of α and β satisfying both eqs 12 and 13 can be found by performing a brute force search also called an exhaustive search over the parameter range this problem solving approach although straightforward is extremely time consuming and prohibitively costly from a computational point of view when a large number of values of α and β for various combinations of h h and l h values need to be solved to overcome this issue this study proposes a random search algorithm to find all the values of α and β satisfying eq 12 for certain values of h h eq 13 for certain values of l h and both eqs 12 and 13 for combinations of h h and l h values these data are then used to create a look up chart of parameters α and β for various values of h h and l h for ease of practical use the random search algorithm involves repeatedly assigning values to parameters α and β and evaluating the objective function eh in eq 12 or el in eq 13 the algorithm simply selects a starting vector of parameters α 0 and β 0 evaluates eh or el randomly generates a series of vectors of parameters αr and βr evaluates their corresponding results of eh or el and finds the values of α and β whose eh or el reaches a prescribed tolerance value this process is repeated until the range of parameters α and β is fully covered the random vector of parameters is generated as follows 14 α r β r α 0 β 0 r s where r is a random vector with random numbers ranging between 1 and 1 and s is the step length in a random walk which is set to 0 01 thus at each step of the random walk the values of αr and βr are generated within a square domain centered at α 0 β 0 with a side length of 0 02 fig 2 shows a flowchart of the abovementioned random search algorithm the algorithm was implemented in matlab mathworks 2022 using a doubly nested loop to ensure that the range of 0 α β 1 was covered in the outer loop α 0 was increased from 0 01 to 0 99 in increments of 0 02 in the inner loop β 0 was increased from α 0 to 0 99 in increments of 0 02 the random values of αr and βr were generated using eq 14 the built in functions ellipke and integral in matlab were used to return the values of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind k and the integrals expressed in eqs 12 and 13 respectively objective functions eh and el were evaluated for certain values of h h and l h respectively the maximum number of pairs of random values was set to 2000 the tolerance values of eh and el used to identify the values of α and β satisfying eqs 12 and 13 were set to 0 00001 all pairs of identified values of α and β were recorded and outputted fig 3 graphically shows the output values of α and β for various values of h h ranging from 0 0 to 0 6 and l h ranging from 0 4 to 1 3 all datasets are presented in the supplementary materials the solid curves represent the values of α and β for certain values of h h and the dashed curves represent the values of α and β for certain values of l h the values of α and β at the intersections of these curves are the solutions to both eqs 12 and 13 for various combinations of the considered values of h h and l h 5 charts for determining the free surfaces the α and β values for given h h and l h values satisfying both eqs 12 and 13 can also be directly identified by simply using a conditional statement in the inner loop of the random search algorithm these values are outputted and used to compute the free surfaces based on eqs 1 through 6 the following equations can be readily derived 15 x ψ l 1 0 ψ k sin 2 χ

ranging from 0 4 to 1 3 6 verification and validation to verify the accuracies of the proposed algorithm and charts the total outflow rates computed using the algorithm or using the values of α and β read from the chart in fig 3 are compared with those calculated using a closed form formula it has been rigorously proven that the total outflow rate per unit length through the downstream vertical boundary of a rectangular dam is given exactly by the dupuit discharge formula charny 1951 chapman 1957b dewiest 1963 youngs 1966 bear 1972 pages 366 367 17 q k h 2 h 2 2 l three cases of different values of h h and l are analyzed as shown in the first column of table 1 their corresponding values of α β and c are shown in the third to fifth columns wherein the bracketed values are reproduced from cryer 1976 and fukuchi 2016 which are cited in the second column in the present study two sets of α and β values are obtained one using the proposed algorithm and the other using the proposed chart in fig 3 with the aid of webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2021 which is open source digitizing software by doing so the accuracy of the readings from the proposed chart can be checked against the precise values obtained from the proposed algorithm the values of c are computed using eq 1 by assuming k 10 7 m s the total outflow rates are computed using eq 8 and calculated using eq 17 as shown in the sixth and seventh columns respectively the differences between the computed and calculated total outflow rates q q are shown in the last column of table 1 for the three cases considered the absolute values of q q obtained from the proposed algorithm are less than those obtained from the values of α and β reproduced from cryer 1976 and fukuchi 2016 this implies that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than the accuracies of the algorithms developed by the two investigators for the first two cases the absolute values of q q obtained from the proposed chart are also less than those obtained from the values of α and β reproduced from cryer 1976 and fukuchi 2016 for the third case however the absolute value of q q obtained from the proposed chart is greater than that obtained from the values of α and β reproduced from cryer 1976 although the readings from the proposed chart is not very accurate the difference between the total outflow rates calculated from the curve readings and the precise values with the proposed algorithm is small the differences q q obtained from the proposed algorithm and chart are less than 0 000005 and 0 006 respectively indicating that the accuracies of the proposed algorithm and chart are high enough for practical use the accuracy of the computed free surface profile can be taken as a measure of the validity of the algorithm and charts proposed in this paper five cases of different values of h h and l are analyzed as shown in fig 5 the solid curves represent the free surface profiles either computed using the proposed algorithm or digitized by importing the charts in fig 4 into webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2021 and obtainning data from the corresponding curves the symbols represent the coordinates of data points on the free surfaces reproduced from elliott and ockendon 1982 crank 1984 and hornung and krueger 1985 excellent agreement is obtained 7 intersection angle paradox of the free surface it has been proven that the free surface must cross the upstream boundary at a right angle at its entry point and it must be tangent to the seepage face at its exit point bear 1972 pages 250 262 this means that for the rectangular dam problem shown in fig 1 the angles between the line tangent to the free surface and the horizontal direction must be 0 and 90 at points b and a respectively polubarinova kochina and kochina 1998 proved that polubarinova kochina s solution satisfies these two conditions since according to eq 7 dy dx 0 when ψ π 2 at x 0 and dy dx when ψ 0 at x l however the computed free surface profiles shown in figs 4 and 5 have apparently poor entry and exit angles leading to a paradox this paradox was also observed and noted by kazemzadeh parsi and daneshmand 2012 toufigh 2016 and zhao et al 2022 but no explanation was provided according to eq 7 the angle between the line tangent to the free surface and the horizontal direction can be computed using the following equation 18 θ ψ arctan d y d x ψ arctan k cos 2 ψ k sin 2 ψ for example the angle θ and the corresponding x coordinate of the free surface shown in fig 5 a are computed by inputting various values of ψ ranging from 0 to π 2 into eqs 18 and 5 respectively the values of α β and c shown in the fifth row of table 1 are adopted in the computation fig 6 shows the computed results of θ versus x the angle θ at the entry point b where x 0 and that at the exit point a where x 16 m are exactly 0 and 90 respectively nevertheless the angle θ increases abruptly from 0 to 13 and from approximately 60 to 90 within microscopic distances from points b and a respectively therefore the abrupt change in the angles of the tangent lines of the free surface at the entry and exit points makes the expected entry and exit angles i e θ 0 and 90 almost completely invisible to the naked eye 8 summary and conclusions this paper presents a state of the art review of polubarinova kochina s analytical solution to the steady state seepage flow problem through a homogeneous isotropic rectangular dam a complete set of parametric equations of polubarinova kochina s solution is presented a random search algorithm is proposed and used to find the two unknown parameters involved in the elliptic integrals in the parametric equations comprehensive results of these two parameters and hence the free surface profiles are obtained for a wide range of dam widths and headwater and tailwater levels these results are presented in nondimensional graphical charts these charts enable a straightforward and rapid determination of the free surface profiles the proposed algorithm and charts are validated with the free surface data points available in the literature excellent agreement is obtained their accuracies are verified against an exact closed form formula for the total outflow rate per unit length of the dam the accuracies obtained are high and therefore considered acceptable for numerical modelers to use the proposed charts as a benchmark to calibrate their schemes and models the angles between the lines tangent to the computed free surface and the horizontal direction are exactly 0 and 90 at the entry and exit points respectively however in graphs of the free surface profiles these angles can barely be observed with the naked eye leading to a paradox this paradox is explained by the angles changing abruptly at the entry and exit points of the free surfaces credit authorship contribution statement fang xue liu data curation formal analysis funding acquisition investigation methodology software
