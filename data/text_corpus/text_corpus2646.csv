13230,this work studies a promising waste valorization approach involving recovery of fresh water from protein rich waste water from the meat processing and rendering industry via membrane distillation md blood stick water samples from an industrial plant have been treated in batch and continuous tests with two different ptfe membranes native hydrophobic and hydrophilic coated treated water coming from md permeate was evaluated using various parameters including sodium for salinity total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn overall md was shown to yield concentrated high strength stick water up to a concentration factor of 20 for potential re use and recover clean water rejecting 99 salinity and toc and 95 of tn compared to conventional native hydrophobic ptfe the hydrophilic coated membrane showed higher constant rejection in continuous experiments but performed with less total flux uniquely for the first time in md studies the transfer of volatile fatty acids through the membrane into the permeate was explored showing concentrations of 30 160 mg l in the permeate appearing more related to hydrophobic surface diffusion than volatile diffusion while md for valorization of meat industry wastewater appears viable with correct conditions and membranes the value of recovered water due to fatty acid presence and other practical considerations such as membrane cleaning need to be considered graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane distillation industry wastewater treatment wetting fouling organic carbon meat industry 1 introduction industrial waste water with high organic concentration could be a viable source for high value products in particular organic compounds present as proteins and fats are potentially recoverable while at the same time clean water is generated such re purposing of waste water would be a significant step forward towards simultaneously combating the resource depletion and waste generation issues our society is facing the current waste water treatment processes typically prevent reuse of the organics as valuable proteins and fats by contaminating them with chemicals to flocculate and separate i e dissolved air flotation or digesting them to produce biogas or carbon dioxide therefore a separation system that does not rely on chemical additions or biological treatment would enable the reuse of organic matter present as fats and proteins membrane separations are suitable for this purpose membrane distillation md is an emerging thermal separation technology that allows evaporation of water through a porous hydrophobic membrane mainly made from polypropylene pp polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polytetrafluorethylene ptfe or pp ptfe 1 driven by the difference in vapour pressure the process allows evaporation to take place at ambient pressure and lower temperatures than conventional free surface evaporation approaches as clear permeate evaporates through the membrane non volatile organic and inorganic compounds are left behind leading to a highly concentrated solution of significantly reduced total volume while md pilot trials have so far been widely documented for sea water and brackish water desalination other applications have been studied by researchers but process detail and pilot trials are lacking based on recent reviews of md available in literature 1 5 pilot trials have been recently conducted in industry wastes and industry applications have been identified as a need and growth interest area with some showing economic potential the valorization of waste water from the meat processing and rendering industry is a new application for md mustafa et al 6 successfully showed the potential to treat a waste stream known as stick water from meat and fish processing with a hydrophilic coated membrane there are several reasons to further research the use of md as potential valorization technique in this sector firstly the highly loaded organic waste water requires treatment on site to meet discharge regulations but still accounts for high disposal costs due to the remaining organics and high salinity second there is a large potential for integrating into the site s rendering operations to harness low grade heat making a thermal separation technology a worthy choice to re valorize any currently exhausted heat and finally even if optimized during the production processes still valuable components such as proteins find their way into the waste water and the assessment of their recovery potential is interesting for the industry a certain type of stick water called blood stick water bdstw is of specific interest as candidate for valorization it is the waste stream of the blood meal process discharged at a temperature of roughly 70 c despite the rendering facility s high efficiency capture of valuable organics from a waste water treatment perspective it is still rich in organics having a high protein content which leads to high discharge costs if blood stick water could be re concentrated to total solids ts values higher than 10 the stream could potentially be re circulated to the process this work considers this unique industry opportunity by the innovative application of md to concentrate blood stick water for product recovery and generate clean organic free desalinated water at the same time however to undertake such a study membrane fouling must also be investigated since organic biomolecules tend to foul membranes quickly this leads to loss of permeate quality and or flux due to the complex interaction of the organic molecules in solution with the membranes i e fouling fouling phenomena is a common issue limiting all membrane processes but requires specific consideration for md due to the vapour diffusion mechanism and hydrophobic membrane chemistry which are unique 7 8 membrane wetting creates another negative performance effect for md membranes which occurs when the hydrophobic property of the membrane is compromised typically by oils fats or surfactants allowing feed liquid to penetrate the membrane and contaminate the permeate product 9 while a lot of studies have been completed for fouling and wetting for water desalination with relatively low organic concentrations 10 12 biomolecule fouling and wetting from highly organic loaded waste water streams is much less studied several researchers have tackled this issue studying synthetic protein and fat solutions at different ph conditions and with various coated membrane materials 13 19 however not many studies deal with real organic industrial waste water recent studies have highlighted the effect of temperature 16 because of the different denaturation mechanisms of feed and proteins at different temperatures and the importance of electrostatic repulsions for biomolecular adhesion phenomena on membrane surfaces 8 16 20 a detailed organic fouling behaviour study on ptfe membranes in membrane distillation was published by liu and co workers 13 the researchers studied the effects of the differently charged foulants blood serum albumin bsa sodium alginate sa and lysozyme lys as single and combined foulants under different temperatures feed concentrations were quite low however in this study with 150 mg l combined analysis of ftir results contact angle measurements and sem images lead to the conclusions that sa and bsa lead to a gel layer on the membrane surface that can be easily cleaned off for bsa but bonds more strongly to the ptfe surface with presence of sa most severe fouling was observed with lys associated with the different charge of the lysozyme molecules other authors reported as well that feed solutions containing compounds with opposite charge properties tend to create stable fouling layers for bsa on the other hand the electrostatic repulsion of bsa seems to lead to a loosely bound fouling layer which is also more porous therefore leading to less flux decline at higher ph electrostatic repulsion of bsa is reported to be even higher 19 which also explains less fouling on ro membranes 20 similarly researchers working on protein adsorption report that the electrostatic exclusion effect decreases with decreasing aqueous phase ph due to the decrease of the net negative charges of the protein bsa 21 gel layers that uniformly coat the membrane seem to protect the membrane from wetting which was also shown for combined feed solutions of different organics with colloidal silica colloidal silica penetrates the membrane pores leading to wetting in case colloidal silica adsorbs the organics this effect remains only when colloidal silica is trapped by gelation of other biomolecules the gel layer prevents wetting 17 in accordance with these findings tow et al show that alginate as the only foulant performs much better than the combined effect of organic and inorganic foulants on pvdf membranes 8 in this study by tow and co workers the comparison between foulant behaviour on md ro and fo is discussed showing as expected a much better performance of md towards organic fouling this is attributed to the limited influence of the hydraulic pressure difference of the gel layer to the vapour pressure difference and partly to the higher diffusion coefficient of alginate at higher temperature 8 this is why md is seen as a promising technology for the treatment of industrial organic waste water such as stick water to evaluate the possibility to concentrate bdstw two set of tests were performed one set concentration mode to concentrate to the aimed concentration factors and a second continuous mode to check the continuous performance at the desired concentration factor as noted by mostafa et al 6 during md treatment of stick water from rendering processes volatile substances suggested to be volatile fatty acids vfas which can easily pass through the membrane in vapour form appeared in the permeate therefore this investigation into the technical viability of bdstw for md processing includes a novel work involving analysis of the vfas in the permeate this is a critical feature of the study to identify practicalities of md where appropriate use of the produced clean water containing a small amount of vfas would need to be considered the outcomes also suit md research more broadly where dealing with volatile transport into the permeate is an issue 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane properties and feed solution characterization two different membranes were used a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe that is natively highly hydrophobic with nominal 0 5 μm pore size supported on a polypropylene pp scrim support ningbo chanqi china and a hydrophilic polyurethane pu coated ptfe australian textile mills 21 22 two blood stick water samples were supplied from an australian rendering company as waste water streams from the blood meal process depending on the processed material and process conditions at the plant sample quality varied from blood stick water bdstw i to hemoglobin stick water bdstw ii to eliminate potential biological risks from handling these wastes in general laboratory facilities both samples were sterilised on arrival by autoclaving the 5 l samples at 120 c bdstw i was the primary focus in this work for exploring md performance while bdstw ii was tested once at the best conditions and membrane to compare against bdstw i performance table 1 summarizes the feed properties of bdstw i and bdstw ii as measured using the techniques described later in this section as expected the feed was very high in chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn as well as minerals indicated by electrical conductivity ec and na the ph value was slightly high for bdstw i or neutral for bdstw ii compared to the other components ammonia nh3 n was relatively minor although present the solution was rich in solids as indicated by total solids ts and there is a mild quantity of fats compared to rendering stick water cod was lower 6 potentially due to the lower fats present in blood stick water compared to rendering stick water being 0 1 wt and 1 wt respectively in terms of ec being an indicator of dissolved solids bdstw was similar to rendering stick water e g 12 2 22 4 ms cm vs 13 20 ms cm 6 therefore our samples compare to previously characterized stick waters with variations as expected for our bdstw i and ii samples source processed material 2 2 md set up and test parameters a bench scale md apparatus with a membrane area of 0 01694 m2 0 13 m 0 13 m membrane dimensions was used to treat and concentrate the stick waters and the simplified schematic of the setup is shown in fig 1 electrical conductivity ec of feed and permeate were constantly monitored throughout the experiments as was feed and permeate temperatures feed and permeate weight was monitored throughout the experiment and calculated to volume the test conditions matrix is summarized in table 2 in the first set of tests in concentration mode the feed solution was recirculated through the membrane module as part of the feed cycle to reach the target concentration factors cf eq 4 for potential concentrate recovery into the blood meal process three different feed permeate cycle temperature configurations were applied stated as feed temperature permeate temperature 60 c 20 c 55 c 15 c and 50 c 10 c feed permeate cycle flow was synchronized and cross flow velocities cfv varied from 0 075 to 0 112 m s in the second set of experiments in continuous mode a timer was set to pump out concentrate of the concentrate tank and top it up with fresh feed to keep a constant cf target of 9 varying during actual experiments between 8 and 10 in this set of experiments cfv was kept at 0 095 m s 15 permeate quality was monitored over time by sampling every 1 h in short term runs and every 12 h in longer runs over several days co and counter current configuration was tested to evaluate the influence of temperature profile along the membrane on the membrane distillation performance 2 3 md performance analysis quality of feed concentrate and permeate were measured in terms of tn toc using a shimadzu toc v analyser with a tn detector cod was determined using the dichromate oxidation method using prepared reagents from hach instruments ts was measured gravimetrically while ph and ec were measured by hand held laboratory meters for elementary analysis a shimadzu icpe 9000 was used and volatile fatty acids vfas permeating through the membrane were analysed with shimadzu gc2010 using a bp20 column contact angle measurements krüss dsa25 and ftir measurements perkin elmer frontier were performed to analyse impacts to surface property as a result of deposits on the membrane area to compare the performance of the experiments several parameters were calculated transmembrane flux j l m2 h is the volume flow of permeate through the membrane area over time 1 j v p a t where v p is the volume l of permeate product produced over the measurement time period t h and a is the active membrane area m2 this was determined from the equipment using a balance located under the permeate tank shown in fig 1 that recorded weight translated to volume gain over time to compare flux performance of different test runs in more detail independent of the driving force the mass transfer coefficient c m l m2 h bar is calculated as flux j divided by the partial pressure difference δp partial pressures were calculated according to the antoine equation based on the temperatures measurements of feed permeate flow at inlets and outlets to the membrane 2 c m j p the single pass recovery r rec states the proportion of permeate flux to the feed volume flow v f l h circulating over the membrane 3 r rec j a v f 100 concentration factor cf was used to represent the extent of volume reduction by md concentrating effect as follows 4 cf v f init v f cf where v f init and v f cf l are the initial volume and volume for the reported cf value respectively the separation performance was analysed via samples of original feed and the feed and permeate after a certain concentration period the rejection values r rej i indicate how well the quality parameter i was retained in the concentrate 5 r rej i 1 c i p c i f 100 for evaluating the permeation of vfas the permeate concentration ratio r c i signifies the amount of fatty acid i detected in the permeate as a proportion of the concentration of the feed side based on eq 5 in the continuous process set up the feed side c i f is replaced with the final concentrate product c i c and calculated by 6 r c i 100 r rej i the thermal performance of the experiments is evaluated based on the specific thermal energy consumption value stec kwh m3 which has previously been used by dow et al 23 with q f kw specifying the required thermal energy demand to heat the feed stream during the test run q f was calculated based on the feed flow and the measured feed temperatures at the inlet t f in and outlet t f out of the md test cell 7 stec q f j a 1000 v f ρ c p t f out t f in j a 1000 3600 where c p is the specific heat of water 4 18 kj kg k assuming similar properties of stick water to pure water for heat analyses purposes ρ is the density of stick water assumed to be 1 0 kg l the results were utilized to assist with the identification of the diffusion mechanisms of the vfas through the membrane the two mechanisms considered were vapour phase diffusion attributed previously for petroleum volatile semivolatile organic molecules 35 and hydrophobic surface diffusion attributed to some wastewater trace organic compounds 36 and non volatile humic acid 34 the vfas were ordered in terms of r c i being equivalent for indicative purposes to the equilibrium ratio proposed by 35 to rank organics against volatile driving force being henry s constant for volatile diffusion but also using logd for hydrophobic diffusion 36 to conduct the evaluation several parameters were sourced and others calculated pure component vfa properties of mwi g mol pka logd i ph 8 molar volume cm3 mol and p vap i pa were taken from scifinder database https scifinder n cas org values were only available at 25 c or 20 c molar volume which are lower than the md feed temperatures but suitable for evaluating relative vfa behaviors and identifying mechanisms the activity coefficient at infinite dilution γi for the simple vfa water system relevant to our relatively low concentrations in the feed and permeate vfa water ratio 1 was calculated by the linear relationship between vfa carbon number and rtlog γi 37 then corrected to represent the vfa water nacl model system using the salting out setschenow constant linear relationship with organic molecule molar volume including for organic acids 38 the nacl concentration was derived from the na analysis result in table 1 using the nacl corrected γi and p vap i henry s constants h i pa l mol were then calculated following the same method reported previously 35 3 results and discussion 3 1 part i water quality indicators and flux behaviour 3 1 1 evaluation of md performance at increasing cf as summarized in table 2 five experiments were performed concentrating blood stick water bdstw i with the md apparatus set up in concentration mode using the ptfe membrane conc ptfe 1 to conc ptfe 5 to analyse the suitability of md to operate at high concentration factors table 3 shows the flux and permeate ec results of these experiments compared at the cf value of 3 5 the results consistently show a higher ec increase in permeate at higher temperatures of 60 c 20 c 771 963 μs cm than in the runs at 55 c 15 c 189 217 μs cm indicating greater transfer of ionic species from the feed into the permeate when operating at higher temperature conditions fig 2 shows the ec of the permeate and feed graphed as a function of cf for experiments conc ptfe 1 and conc ptfe 5 in both experiment 1 and 5 ec is seen to rise as cf rises until the last cf value of 4 feed ec rises proportionally with cf indicating the md is working to concentrate the majority of the feed components looking more closely with fig 2 we see permeate ec rises linearly with cf at higher temperature conc ptfe 1 while the lower temperature condition conc ptfe 5 shows a plateau despite the feed ec rising linearly these results indicate the suitability of low temperature operation to minimize transfer of ionic species and allow for stable md performance the studied blood stick water is high in blood serum albumin bsa for which temperature influence of protein denaturation has been shown 16 as samples have been autoclaved in this study however protein denaturation cannot be the major cause of this effect however most probable the hydrolysed protein compounds such as peptides and amino acids that remain in the feed water after autoclaving accelerate hydrophobic interactions with the membrane surface at higher temperature only by looking at ec increase it is not conclusive whether the higher transfer of ionic species at higher temperature is due to higher transfer of vfas or simply due to wetting our analysis of vfas below shows minor influence of temperature on vfa transfer indicating that minor wetting occurred at higher temperature probably due to increased protein and fats intrusion into the pores fig 3 shows ec results for cf higher than 4 for experiment conc ptfe 1 given as an example for operation performance at higher cf typically after reaching cf 4 the experiment was stopped overnight and continued the following day for all experiments the ongoing ec rise in the permeate at the 2nd day of operation was clearly visible knowing that blood proteins and presumably also its autoclaved hydrolysed compounds tend to form a gel foulant layer during md operation 16 a disruption of this gel foulant layer during the overnight process stop can be concluded leading to membrane wetting this is in line with tow s conclusion that in membrane distillation the hydraulic pressure difference does not influence the stable fouling gel layer however the overnight stop obviously leads to hydraulic pressure pulses during the emptying and starting phase of the process with negative influence on the gel layer stability ec measurements are influenced by ionic volatile species such as volatile fatty acids and ammonia so intact membranes may still see permeate ec rises and not have become wetted to verify the suspected partial wetting occurring after process disruptions the toc and tn in the permeate together with non volatile cl rejection were analysed and presented in fig 4 for conc ptfe 4 same test temperature conditions to conc ptfe 5 but slightly higher cfv toc and tn both representing potentially volatile species initially increased then became stable until the experiment was stopped but started to rise again after resuming the test cl rejection also started to drop from consistently 99 9 on the first day to 99 5 on the 2nd day of these parameters cl is not likely to have any volatile proportion at the test ph range and so its transfer into the permeate is indicative of the ptfe membrane wetting after the overnight stop feed and permeate cfv had negligible influence at the tested ranges between 0 084 and 0 112 m s indicating that a higher cfv than 0 09 m s would not further enhance process performance within same temperature conditions tests at higher cfv showed slightly higher ec in the permeate however similar salt retention with permeate variations were influenced by varying feed ec variations of flux and final permeate ec values seem to be more influenced by slight variations of the waste water samples rather than by cfv 3 1 2 performance of md at high cf in continuous mode to mimic steady operation at high cf md experiments have been performed in continuous mode see fig 1 table 3 shows the flux at various intervals of continuous mode operation together with relative flux decline proportion configuration and single pass recovery r rc four experiments were performed with the ptfe membrane cont ptfe 8 to cont ptfe 11 with bdstw i while two experiments were completed with the pu laminated ptfe membrane cont pu ptfe 12 with bdstw i and cont pu ptfe 13 with bdstw ii bdstw ii consisted of hemoglobin stick water with less blood plasma it could not be treated by the bare ptfe membrane as it lead to immediate wetting whether this is due to the higher isoelectric point of hemoglobin with less electrostatic repulsions to the hydrophobic membrane surface and therefore hindering a stable gel foulant layer as with bsa needs to be researched further looking at the ptfe membrane experiments fluxes are lower than at corresponding temperature conditions in the concentration mode experiments shown in the previous section as the feed water in these tests was concentrated bdstw at a cf 9 from the beginning replicating a real operation at the target 10 ts concentration target with significantly higher cod toc and tn concentrations the flux behaviour of experiment cont ptfe 9 with the lowest operating temperature 50 c 10 c showed least fouling indicated by the smallest flux decline this was followed by cont ptfe 8 at 55 c 15 c and then cont ptfe 11 featuring a co current experimental run with temperatures 60 c 20 c temperature of operation therefore has a critical role in the determination of the membrane fouling and may be key to selecting sustainable operating conditions for an md process fig 5 shows transmembrane fluxes in the experiments over the logarithmic temperature difference across the membrane δtlog which is in linear dependence with the transmembrane vapour pressure difference of water δt vap regardless of higher initial fluxes when using higher temperature over the longer term lower temperatures led to higher flux operation since higher temperatures lead to accelerated hydrophobic interactions of proteins or hydrolysed protein compounds respectively in terms of co current vs counter current operation counter current appeared to be the better mode in terms of operation since despite similar fluxes after 10 h counter current led to higher starting fluxes meaning it processed more permeate in the same 10 h period the hydrophilic pu coated membrane was used in experiments cont pu ptfe 12 and cont pu ptfe 13 in an attempt to mitigate the effect of fouling including partial wetting compared to the bare ptfe the coated membrane showed low fluxes as expected from former work with rendering stick water 6 after 10 h of md with the pu coated membrane flux was 23 31 lower than the initial flux table 4 shows the real temperature profiles as average value during the experiment with slight deviation to their set temperature due to the temperature regulation installed at the lab set up stec and c m values determined for all experiments performed in continuous mode the md run with the lowest temperature condition cont ptfe 9 50 c 10 c gave the highest initial stec value while cont ptfe 8 at the middle temperature 55 c 15 c gave the lowest initial value by more than half even more than the highest temperature condition tests of conc ptfe 10 and conc ptfe 11 60 c 20 c after 10 h all displayed increased stec and conc ptfe 8 was still lowest while now conc ptfe 10 and conc ptfe 11 had the worst highest stec values higher stec values are associated with lower operating temperatures since the vapour pressure driving force function is exponential with temperature while conductive heat losses are linear therefore creating a higher proportion of heat transfer lost via conduction through the membrane compared to vapour transport flux 23 meanwhile the results in table 4 show that despite the higher initial stec value when operating at lower temperature the reduced fouling after 10 h led to lower stec values ultimately in comparison to poorer stec values at higher temperature this greatly impacts the process thermal energy demand these stec values are still very high in comparison to the initial values obtained after the first 30 min and are likely to translate to impractically high thermal energy demands in a scaled up system even with heat recovery systems implemented into the process design to minimize a plant s total energy consumption per m3 fresh water produced 24 maintaining acceptably low stec values over long term operation may be achievable with regular membrane cleaning for example daily or at the end of an operating shift which is often utilized in membrane food processes the mass transfer coefficient c m shown in table 5 shows that cont ptfe 8 operating at 55 c 15 c showed highest initial value indicating the best flux for a given driving force after 10 h cont ptfe 9 showed the best c m further supporting the conclusion that its mass transfer performance was less impacted due to reduced fouling at lower temperature conditions in comparison the use of the pu coated ptfe membrane in cont ptfe pu 12 and cont ptfe pu 13 showed high stec values and low cm values because of the low absolute flux reached in these experiments this would likely be due to higher mass transfer resistance of the membrane from the additional small pore size pu layer 6 fig 6 analyses these results as function of δtlog clearly the performance value c m is influenced by δtlog for md with bare ptfe membrane while co and countercurrent operation deviate for initial c m values they are identical after 10 h of operation with a significant decline from their initial values for pu ptfe the temperature effect has not been studied but c m is significantly lower 31 36 l m2 h bar than for the ptfe membrane 66 l m2 h bar at similar δtlog as discussed above the c m values do not change significantly over time due to no significant fouling for the pu coated membrane fig 7 shows the flux trend of experiments cont ptfe 8 and cont pu ptfe 12 both at 55 15 c while cont ptfe 9 at 50 10 c is represented in fig 8 both show testing carried out over 17 h where no cleaning procedure was used fig 9 shows the respective rejection performance of toc tn and na after 17 h as well as after 24 h of experiment it becomes obvious from fig 7 in comparing the two different membranes that flux performance also reflected in the stec and cm values given above and in fig 6 is better for the bare ptfe membrane however rejection performance of toc tn and sodium over longer term shown in fig 9 shows very high rejections for the pu coated ptfe membrane cont pu ptfe 12 right up to 23 h of continuous testing while the bare ptfe membrane showed possible decline in non volatile sodium rejection when process disruption occurred fig 8 shows cont ptfe 9 as best performing experiment in terms of stec and c m values the low temperature condition was favourable to mitigate fouling and to reach high rejection performance after 17 h of operation however this experiment clearly shows the fragility of the fouling layer towards operational disturbances in phase ii of this experiment the pump refilling the feed tank with fresh bdstw failed and cf started to rise quickly as the feed tank drained to empty phase iii air was pumped through the module similar to the effects shown earlier when discussing rejection deterioration at process stops see also fig 4 the higher pressure pulses on the membrane resulted in wetting visible in fast ec rise of the permeate and in the declining rejection performance after 23 h differences in ptfe and pu ptfe membranes can be associated with their different material properties while both membranes have a porous ptfe structure 0 5 μm for ptfe and up to 1 μm for pu coated ptfe the pu coating is very dense with non detectable pores 50 nm 6 this hydrophilic dense pu coating adds an additional mass transfer resistance leading to lower fluxes but better rejection performance the hydrophilic coating also reduces fouling propensity of protein compounds by preventing buildup of hydrophobic compounds that cannot be easily detached by the crossflow the extended 3 day operation on the pu coated ptfe membranes is shown in fig 10 cont ptfe pu 13 while flux is very low compared to the ptfe membrane rejection performance was outstanding as permeate conductivity plateaued at 1200 μs indicating minor transport even at very harsh feed conditions high cod tn toc concentrations high feed conductivity at 90 ms cm water flushes were shown to remove solid accumulation on the membrane effectively it becomes clear that the pu coated ptfe membrane shows similar md performance for bdstw i and bdstwii indicating that the hydrophilic layer minimizes interactions with proteins and hydrolysed protein compounds and therefore water composition has no influence on md performance in this case 3 1 3 analysis of membrane fouling analysis of the water contact angles of membrane surfaces before and after fouling are shown in table 6 the original bare ptfe membrane showed high hydrophobicity as indicated by the high contact angle 139 being well above 90 similar to reported literature values 25 26 post run membranes including conc ptfe 2 taken out of the apparatus and immediately rinsed with tap water pressure showed recovered high contact angle of 131 this recovered high contact angle value after cleaning the membranes show how well the fouling layer was removed during the applied cleaning procedure returning the exposed hydrophobicity of the membrane surface depending on the intensity of water rinse the fouling layer could be removed and the hydrophobicity of the membrane remained rinsing the membrane within the module at lower water cross flows of 500 ml min did not remove the fouling layer effectively no matter how long this rinse lasted this is shown in table 6 for experiments cont ptfe 8 cont ptfe 11 in tests where membranes were only rinsed for 0 5 h in the module the performed contact angle measurements clearly show the hydrophilicity of the fouling layer reaching a water ca of only 20 3 the fouling layers on the membrane surfaces were analysed by ftir and shown in fig 11 the peaks at 1206 1 cm and 1148 1 cm relate to the cf2 vibrations of the ptfe material 6 and peaks observed in around this wavenumber for bare unfouled ptfe membranes used in md 27 29 the results for all fouled membranes show that proteins where the main foulants based on the present primary mainly co vibration and secondary mainly nh vibration amide bands as well as amide a bands 30 32 the latter being visible as a broad band at wavenumber 3000 3500 1 cm the same bands are visible in any cont ptfe tests disregarding whether wetting occurred shown for cont ptfe 9 wetted because of dry out cont ptfe 10 and cont ptfe 11 so despite similar interactions of components with the membrane surface in all analysed samples the wetting occurred due to the extent of the interaction with the membrane which cannot be identified by the ftir results alone 3 2 part ii analysis of vfa diffusion through md membranes fig 12 shows the concentration of toc and the detected vfas measured in the concentrate and permeate samples during cont ptfe 8 55 15 c the presence of 9 vfas were identified in the feed waters namely acetic acid propanoic acid iso butyric acid butyric acid iso valeric acid valeric acid isocaproic acid hexanoic acid and n heptanoic acid all 9 vfas were found in the permeate although the latter two in very low concentrations below the detection limit for quantification the analysis therefore focuses on the 7 detectable vfas all of these vfas were measured in the concentrate at higher concentrations than the permeate and so were not permeating greater than water generally acetic acid was present at highest concentrations in the feed followed by propanoic acid and butyric acid while concentrate toc slightly increased in the feed a slight increasing tendency is also detected for the vfa concentration of the concentrate samples with strongest increase in acetic acid acetic acid is also present at highest concentrations of 13 000 18 000 mg l the increasing rather than decreasing trend for the major vfas indicates minor mass loss via the membrane into the permeate looking at the permeate samples the major vfas from the concentrate such as acetic and propanoic are still dominant but the other vfas that were less dominant in the concentrate are higher in relative proportion this will be analysed next using the permeate concentration ratio vfa permeate concentration ratios r c i are shown in fig 13 for the bare ptfe membrane tests and for the hydrophilic coated ptfe membrane pu ptfe all being 13 the highest ratios specific to any vfa i for both membrane were detected for isocaproic acid up to 12 9 iso butyric up to 5 7 and iso valeric acid up to 5 5 it should be noted here that the feed and permeate cycles were open to the air suggesting the most volatile vfas such as acetic propanoic and butyric acids may have preferentially left the solutions over time leading to measurements underrepresenting their presence especially over the least volatile isocaproic however measurement of vfa concentration at 2 5 h and 20 h in the continuous run cont ptfe 8 with continuous operation show an increase of vfa concentrations in the feed see table 7 it is therefore still conclusive that the acetic acid diffused relatively less into the permeate over other less volatile vfas as it would have shown higher concentrations in the permeate considering its stronger presence in the feed table 7 also includes vfa concentration ratios r c i over time of the experiment cont ptfe 8 showing a decreasing trend of vfa permeation after 24 h in the continuous run this decrease might be due to a build up of fouling layer over time to minimize this impact values at 2 5 h have been taken into account for more detailed analysis given below the properties of the molecules need to be considered as part of further analysis of the vfa diffusion behaviour from feed to permeate fig 13 shows that the hydrophilic coated ptfe membrane with much smaller pore size of the outer layer 22 33 permeated less vfas than the ptfe membrane the pu ptfe membrane gave very low permeate ratios below 3 for most vfas isocaproic acid on the other hand was similar to the ptfe membrane highest ratios of 7 8 maybe slightly overestimated as the acid was present in very low concentration in this run in the feed and permeate concentration was measured at the detection limit of 30 mg l the relative order from lowest ratio to highest ratio was similar between bare ptfe and pu coated ptfe the influence of temperature conditions on the vfa permeate ratio visible in the comparison between experiments cont ptfe 8 to cont ptfe 11 is also shown in fig 13 there was no consistent trend with the feed or permeate temperatures to vfa behaviour so it appears that temperature conditions for these tests don t have a noticeable impact to the permeate concentration ratio in order to determine the vfa diffusion mode fig 14 shows the vfas in order of permeate ratio r c i for the cont ptfe 8 test together with their various properties and calculated parameters as r c i was low for all vfas 13 the feed values without considering permeate concentrations serve as a good indicator to the overall vfa driving force following the mass transfer model developed by 35 r c i increased with mw except for isobutyric acid in terms of volatility p vap generally decreased with r c i but h i shows a general increasing trend with r c i implying volatility in the dilute non ideal system could be the reason for increasing mass transfer indicated by r c i this is in line with the findings of winglee et al 35 who similarly observed this increasing h i trend with equilibrium ratio similar to our r c i in analyzing permeation of volatile petroleum hydrocarbons during md overall isocaproic acid had the highest r c i followed by isobutyric acid the much lighter higher p vap acetic acid showed the lowest r c i likewise for propanoic acid therefore the intuitive conclusion that increasing pure component vapour pressure would lead to higher specific vfa driving force and its permeation is clearly contradicted by the application of γi that corrects for non ideal solute behaviour increasing with mw of the organic acid 37 and instead provides increasing h i however the determination of h i accounts only for the vfa water nacl system where published vfa values for γi would have likely been measured under unadjusted acidic conditions ph not reported 37 our complex feed was closer to ph 8 being much greater than all pka values of all vfas 4 76 4 85 using the henderson hasselbalch equation the undissociated free acid proportion is 0 01 therefore the vfas are essentially all dissociated suggesting negligible free molecules that can readily vaporize and diffuse as vapour through the porous ptfe membrane vapour phase diffusion is thus unlikely to be responsible for vfa to transport from the feed to the permeate hydrophobic diffusion may instead explain the vfa transport logd is the distribution coefficient between lipophilic and hydrophilic phases and has been used to explain diffusion of hydrophobic organics previously in md 36 looking at logd i ph 8 presented in fig 14 there appears to be a correlation with the increasing r c i suggesting hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic ptfe membrane may explain the vfa diffusion although 36 declared that logd 3 classified the organic as hydrophobic even the negative values for the organic acids in our work lead to appreciable proportions vfa molecules in a hydrophobic state the antilog gives d values lipophilic hydrophilic ratio of 0 04 0 12 0 37 1 26 0 87 0 31 and 2 88 for acetic propanoic butyric valeric iso valeric isobutyric and isocaproic acids respectively these values appear high enough to explain the low but measureable proportions of vfas in the permeate relative to the feed particularly for the least lipophilic proportion acetic acid vs the most liphohilic proportion isocaproic acid on the basis that the lipophilic vfa species have an affinity for the hydrophobic ptfe membrane and can diffuse through its pores and desorb into the cooler permeate solution it may also suggest that molecules with higher lipophilic proportions could outcompete the others on the hydrophobic ptfe membrane surface in summary the analysis of volatile and hydrophobic properties is indicating a hydrophobic diffusion mode of vfas through the ptfe membranes fig 14 also includes comparison between feed and concentrate activity coefficients at infinite dilution γi feed and γi conc respectively for the model water acid nacl system the salt correction follows 35 and specifically in our case our nacl concentrations of 7900 mg l and 71 500 mg l for feed and concentrate respectively estimated from na in table 1 using cf 9 and 100 na rejection having a major effect to increase vfa water activity coefficients following the setschenow equation 38 as can be seen by the relevant activity coefficients in fig 14 this proportionately increases with the heavier molecules due to its correlation to molar volume according to 38 this can be interpreted to both increased volatility and hydrophobicity of organic solutes due to salting out effect this would suggest the higher mw vfas are driven more to diffuse through the membrane over lighter vfas due to the increasing salinity as a result of concentration by md considering the conclusions made earlier towards a more likely effect of hydrophobic diffusion of vfas this further aligns with the trend of increasing r c i but also with mw by molar volume during the md process a final interesting observation is that throughout the discussions iso valeric and isobutyric acids are not following the trend of r c i with increasing logd ph 8 hydrophobicity or activity coefficients volatility including isocaproic acid these are the vfas with the highest r c i values and coincidently all have methyl pendant groups the straight chain isomers valeric and butyric acids have very similar h i and logd values yet have relatively lower r c i the methyl branching of the vfa appears to have assisted with the diffusion from the feed to the permeate more than molecules with equivalent properties while this has no clear explanation from the properties it may be considered that the hydrophobic methyl pendant groups assist in the attachment and diffusion through the ptfe structure based on the discussion above it seems more likely that the vfa diffusion into the permeate was hydrophobic surface diffusion which has indeed been confirmed in studies on non volatile humic acid 34 the same pu ptfe membranes were studied in this prior work and yielded similar humic acid diffusion as through bare ptfe while in our case the vfas also diffused but to a lesser extent from our results it is clear that hydrophobic surface diffusion is playing a significant role in determining the vfa permeate water quality however a dedicated work on organic acid diffusion through md membranes is needed to confirm out findings a future test to observe the contribution from vapour diffusion could involve measuring vapour phase concentrations of vfas above controlled synthetic test solutions at various ph temperatures and salinities adsorption of vfas on to ptfe membranes and also testing with an omniphobic membrane where previously non volatile humic acid diffusing by hydrophobic interactions was reduced 34 4 conclusions in this work we studied md for valorisation of organic waste water effluents on hydrophobic ptfe and pu coated ptfe membranes lower temperature conditions feed temperature 55 c permeate temperature 15 c are favourable for higher permeate quality and constant flux behaviour in md experiments with ptfe membranes of this highly proteinaceous water most probably due to lower hydrophobic interaction of protein compounds with the ptfe membrane surface clearly the logarithmic temperature difference δtlog across the membrane significantly influences fouling behaviour with best performance values after 10 h of operation for lowest δtlog the protein compounds formed an outwardly hydrophilic layer on the hydrophobic membrane surface of ptfe leading to significant loss of flux at high concentrations tn 20 40 g l still at 30 over 10 h experimental time for the lowest temperature condition 50 c 10 c however the gel foulant layer does not lead to wetting phenomena in continuous md treatment of effluents with high loading of proteins with ptfe membranes at low temperatures 55 c for 24 h unless process disruptions occurred partial wetting occurs in the laboratory test apparatus after any process interruption presumably by the hydraulic pressure of the incoming feed or when air is driven through the system thus an optimum md module set up has to be found that allows smooth and effective cleaning procedures to gently remove the protein layer hydrophilic polyurethane membrane coating avoids fouling and shows very stable rejection performance but the added coating is believed to be responsible for very low total flux in comparison with bare ptfe membranes due to added mass transfer resistance ptfe membranes are therefore favourable vs pu coated ptfe in terms of stec and c m but a gentle removal of the fouling layer built up on the ptfe membrane is a key to maintain stable md performance and requires further research vfas diffusing through the membrane into the permeate was more positively correlated to hydrophobic surface diffusion than as vapour through the membrane for both ptfe and pu coated ptfe membranes in md we could successfully show a correlation of logd distribution coefficient with the concentration ratio of vfas the model vfa water nacl based henry s law constants also give a good trend with vfa permeation however pka values are much lower than the feed ph thus leaving almost no free acid molecules to leave as vapour suggesting a higher probability for hydrophobic surface diffusion over volatile transport in ptfe and pu membranes 0 7 13 3 of the vfa s found in the concentrate could be detected in the permeate in general the proportion of vfa diffused into the permeate was not significantly higher for the higher operation temperature conditions the re concentration of stick waters to 10 ts target concentrations for process re use therefore seems promising at low temperature conditions available by waste heat given that a membrane cleaning procedure can be identified that does not lead to decreases in membrane performance clean water recovery needs to take into account low vfa presence declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13230,this work studies a promising waste valorization approach involving recovery of fresh water from protein rich waste water from the meat processing and rendering industry via membrane distillation md blood stick water samples from an industrial plant have been treated in batch and continuous tests with two different ptfe membranes native hydrophobic and hydrophilic coated treated water coming from md permeate was evaluated using various parameters including sodium for salinity total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn overall md was shown to yield concentrated high strength stick water up to a concentration factor of 20 for potential re use and recover clean water rejecting 99 salinity and toc and 95 of tn compared to conventional native hydrophobic ptfe the hydrophilic coated membrane showed higher constant rejection in continuous experiments but performed with less total flux uniquely for the first time in md studies the transfer of volatile fatty acids through the membrane into the permeate was explored showing concentrations of 30 160 mg l in the permeate appearing more related to hydrophobic surface diffusion than volatile diffusion while md for valorization of meat industry wastewater appears viable with correct conditions and membranes the value of recovered water due to fatty acid presence and other practical considerations such as membrane cleaning need to be considered graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane distillation industry wastewater treatment wetting fouling organic carbon meat industry 1 introduction industrial waste water with high organic concentration could be a viable source for high value products in particular organic compounds present as proteins and fats are potentially recoverable while at the same time clean water is generated such re purposing of waste water would be a significant step forward towards simultaneously combating the resource depletion and waste generation issues our society is facing the current waste water treatment processes typically prevent reuse of the organics as valuable proteins and fats by contaminating them with chemicals to flocculate and separate i e dissolved air flotation or digesting them to produce biogas or carbon dioxide therefore a separation system that does not rely on chemical additions or biological treatment would enable the reuse of organic matter present as fats and proteins membrane separations are suitable for this purpose membrane distillation md is an emerging thermal separation technology that allows evaporation of water through a porous hydrophobic membrane mainly made from polypropylene pp polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polytetrafluorethylene ptfe or pp ptfe 1 driven by the difference in vapour pressure the process allows evaporation to take place at ambient pressure and lower temperatures than conventional free surface evaporation approaches as clear permeate evaporates through the membrane non volatile organic and inorganic compounds are left behind leading to a highly concentrated solution of significantly reduced total volume while md pilot trials have so far been widely documented for sea water and brackish water desalination other applications have been studied by researchers but process detail and pilot trials are lacking based on recent reviews of md available in literature 1 5 pilot trials have been recently conducted in industry wastes and industry applications have been identified as a need and growth interest area with some showing economic potential the valorization of waste water from the meat processing and rendering industry is a new application for md mustafa et al 6 successfully showed the potential to treat a waste stream known as stick water from meat and fish processing with a hydrophilic coated membrane there are several reasons to further research the use of md as potential valorization technique in this sector firstly the highly loaded organic waste water requires treatment on site to meet discharge regulations but still accounts for high disposal costs due to the remaining organics and high salinity second there is a large potential for integrating into the site s rendering operations to harness low grade heat making a thermal separation technology a worthy choice to re valorize any currently exhausted heat and finally even if optimized during the production processes still valuable components such as proteins find their way into the waste water and the assessment of their recovery potential is interesting for the industry a certain type of stick water called blood stick water bdstw is of specific interest as candidate for valorization it is the waste stream of the blood meal process discharged at a temperature of roughly 70 c despite the rendering facility s high efficiency capture of valuable organics from a waste water treatment perspective it is still rich in organics having a high protein content which leads to high discharge costs if blood stick water could be re concentrated to total solids ts values higher than 10 the stream could potentially be re circulated to the process this work considers this unique industry opportunity by the innovative application of md to concentrate blood stick water for product recovery and generate clean organic free desalinated water at the same time however to undertake such a study membrane fouling must also be investigated since organic biomolecules tend to foul membranes quickly this leads to loss of permeate quality and or flux due to the complex interaction of the organic molecules in solution with the membranes i e fouling fouling phenomena is a common issue limiting all membrane processes but requires specific consideration for md due to the vapour diffusion mechanism and hydrophobic membrane chemistry which are unique 7 8 membrane wetting creates another negative performance effect for md membranes which occurs when the hydrophobic property of the membrane is compromised typically by oils fats or surfactants allowing feed liquid to penetrate the membrane and contaminate the permeate product 9 while a lot of studies have been completed for fouling and wetting for water desalination with relatively low organic concentrations 10 12 biomolecule fouling and wetting from highly organic loaded waste water streams is much less studied several researchers have tackled this issue studying synthetic protein and fat solutions at different ph conditions and with various coated membrane materials 13 19 however not many studies deal with real organic industrial waste water recent studies have highlighted the effect of temperature 16 because of the different denaturation mechanisms of feed and proteins at different temperatures and the importance of electrostatic repulsions for biomolecular adhesion phenomena on membrane surfaces 8 16 20 a detailed organic fouling behaviour study on ptfe membranes in membrane distillation was published by liu and co workers 13 the researchers studied the effects of the differently charged foulants blood serum albumin bsa sodium alginate sa and lysozyme lys as single and combined foulants under different temperatures feed concentrations were quite low however in this study with 150 mg l combined analysis of ftir results contact angle measurements and sem images lead to the conclusions that sa and bsa lead to a gel layer on the membrane surface that can be easily cleaned off for bsa but bonds more strongly to the ptfe surface with presence of sa most severe fouling was observed with lys associated with the different charge of the lysozyme molecules other authors reported as well that feed solutions containing compounds with opposite charge properties tend to create stable fouling layers for bsa on the other hand the electrostatic repulsion of bsa seems to lead to a loosely bound fouling layer which is also more porous therefore leading to less flux decline at higher ph electrostatic repulsion of bsa is reported to be even higher 19 which also explains less fouling on ro membranes 20 similarly researchers working on protein adsorption report that the electrostatic exclusion effect decreases with decreasing aqueous phase ph due to the decrease of the net negative charges of the protein bsa 21 gel layers that uniformly coat the membrane seem to protect the membrane from wetting which was also shown for combined feed solutions of different organics with colloidal silica colloidal silica penetrates the membrane pores leading to wetting in case colloidal silica adsorbs the organics this effect remains only when colloidal silica is trapped by gelation of other biomolecules the gel layer prevents wetting 17 in accordance with these findings tow et al show that alginate as the only foulant performs much better than the combined effect of organic and inorganic foulants on pvdf membranes 8 in this study by tow and co workers the comparison between foulant behaviour on md ro and fo is discussed showing as expected a much better performance of md towards organic fouling this is attributed to the limited influence of the hydraulic pressure difference of the gel layer to the vapour pressure difference and partly to the higher diffusion coefficient of alginate at higher temperature 8 this is why md is seen as a promising technology for the treatment of industrial organic waste water such as stick water to evaluate the possibility to concentrate bdstw two set of tests were performed one set concentration mode to concentrate to the aimed concentration factors and a second continuous mode to check the continuous performance at the desired concentration factor as noted by mostafa et al 6 during md treatment of stick water from rendering processes volatile substances suggested to be volatile fatty acids vfas which can easily pass through the membrane in vapour form appeared in the permeate therefore this investigation into the technical viability of bdstw for md processing includes a novel work involving analysis of the vfas in the permeate this is a critical feature of the study to identify practicalities of md where appropriate use of the produced clean water containing a small amount of vfas would need to be considered the outcomes also suit md research more broadly where dealing with volatile transport into the permeate is an issue 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane properties and feed solution characterization two different membranes were used a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe that is natively highly hydrophobic with nominal 0 5 μm pore size supported on a polypropylene pp scrim support ningbo chanqi china and a hydrophilic polyurethane pu coated ptfe australian textile mills 21 22 two blood stick water samples were supplied from an australian rendering company as waste water streams from the blood meal process depending on the processed material and process conditions at the plant sample quality varied from blood stick water bdstw i to hemoglobin stick water bdstw ii to eliminate potential biological risks from handling these wastes in general laboratory facilities both samples were sterilised on arrival by autoclaving the 5 l samples at 120 c bdstw i was the primary focus in this work for exploring md performance while bdstw ii was tested once at the best conditions and membrane to compare against bdstw i performance table 1 summarizes the feed properties of bdstw i and bdstw ii as measured using the techniques described later in this section as expected the feed was very high in chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn as well as minerals indicated by electrical conductivity ec and na the ph value was slightly high for bdstw i or neutral for bdstw ii compared to the other components ammonia nh3 n was relatively minor although present the solution was rich in solids as indicated by total solids ts and there is a mild quantity of fats compared to rendering stick water cod was lower 6 potentially due to the lower fats present in blood stick water compared to rendering stick water being 0 1 wt and 1 wt respectively in terms of ec being an indicator of dissolved solids bdstw was similar to rendering stick water e g 12 2 22 4 ms cm vs 13 20 ms cm 6 therefore our samples compare to previously characterized stick waters with variations as expected for our bdstw i and ii samples source processed material 2 2 md set up and test parameters a bench scale md apparatus with a membrane area of 0 01694 m2 0 13 m 0 13 m membrane dimensions was used to treat and concentrate the stick waters and the simplified schematic of the setup is shown in fig 1 electrical conductivity ec of feed and permeate were constantly monitored throughout the experiments as was feed and permeate temperatures feed and permeate weight was monitored throughout the experiment and calculated to volume the test conditions matrix is summarized in table 2 in the first set of tests in concentration mode the feed solution was recirculated through the membrane module as part of the feed cycle to reach the target concentration factors cf eq 4 for potential concentrate recovery into the blood meal process three different feed permeate cycle temperature configurations were applied stated as feed temperature permeate temperature 60 c 20 c 55 c 15 c and 50 c 10 c feed permeate cycle flow was synchronized and cross flow velocities cfv varied from 0 075 to 0 112 m s in the second set of experiments in continuous mode a timer was set to pump out concentrate of the concentrate tank and top it up with fresh feed to keep a constant cf target of 9 varying during actual experiments between 8 and 10 in this set of experiments cfv was kept at 0 095 m s 15 permeate quality was monitored over time by sampling every 1 h in short term runs and every 12 h in longer runs over several days co and counter current configuration was tested to evaluate the influence of temperature profile along the membrane on the membrane distillation performance 2 3 md performance analysis quality of feed concentrate and permeate were measured in terms of tn toc using a shimadzu toc v analyser with a tn detector cod was determined using the dichromate oxidation method using prepared reagents from hach instruments ts was measured gravimetrically while ph and ec were measured by hand held laboratory meters for elementary analysis a shimadzu icpe 9000 was used and volatile fatty acids vfas permeating through the membrane were analysed with shimadzu gc2010 using a bp20 column contact angle measurements krüss dsa25 and ftir measurements perkin elmer frontier were performed to analyse impacts to surface property as a result of deposits on the membrane area to compare the performance of the experiments several parameters were calculated transmembrane flux j l m2 h is the volume flow of permeate through the membrane area over time 1 j v p a t where v p is the volume l of permeate product produced over the measurement time period t h and a is the active membrane area m2 this was determined from the equipment using a balance located under the permeate tank shown in fig 1 that recorded weight translated to volume gain over time to compare flux performance of different test runs in more detail independent of the driving force the mass transfer coefficient c m l m2 h bar is calculated as flux j divided by the partial pressure difference δp partial pressures were calculated according to the antoine equation based on the temperatures measurements of feed permeate flow at inlets and outlets to the membrane 2 c m j p the single pass recovery r rec states the proportion of permeate flux to the feed volume flow v f l h circulating over the membrane 3 r rec j a v f 100 concentration factor cf was used to represent the extent of volume reduction by md concentrating effect as follows 4 cf v f init v f cf where v f init and v f cf l are the initial volume and volume for the reported cf value respectively the separation performance was analysed via samples of original feed and the feed and permeate after a certain concentration period the rejection values r rej i indicate how well the quality parameter i was retained in the concentrate 5 r rej i 1 c i p c i f 100 for evaluating the permeation of vfas the permeate concentration ratio r c i signifies the amount of fatty acid i detected in the permeate as a proportion of the concentration of the feed side based on eq 5 in the continuous process set up the feed

consumption value stec kwh m3 which has previously been used by dow et al 23 with q f kw specifying the required thermal energy demand to heat the feed stream during the test run q f was calculated based on the feed flow and the measured feed temperatures at the inlet t f in and outlet t f out of the md test cell 7 stec q f j a 1000 v f ρ c p t f out t f in j a 1000 3600 where c p is the specific heat of water 4 18 kj kg k assuming similar properties of stick water to pure water for heat analyses purposes ρ is the density of stick water assumed to be 1 0 kg l the results were utilized to assist with the identification of the diffusion mechanisms of the vfas through the membrane the two mechanisms considered were vapour phase diffusion attributed previously for petroleum volatile semivolatile organic molecules 35 and hydrophobic surface diffusion attributed to some wastewater trace organic compounds 36 and non volatile humic acid 34 the vfas were ordered in terms of r c i being equivalent for indicative purposes to the equilibrium ratio proposed by 35 to rank organics against volatile driving force being henry s constant for volatile diffusion but also using logd for hydrophobic diffusion 36 to conduct the evaluation several parameters were sourced and others calculated pure component vfa properties of mwi g mol pka logd i ph 8 molar volume cm3 mol and p vap i pa were taken from scifinder database https scifinder n cas org values were only available at 25 c or 20 c molar volume which are lower than the md feed temperatures but suitable for evaluating relative vfa behaviors and identifying mechanisms the activity coefficient at infinite dilution γi for the simple vfa water system relevant to our relatively low concentrations in the feed and permeate vfa water ratio 1 was calculated by the linear relationship between vfa carbon number and rtlog γi 37 then corrected to represent the vfa water nacl model system using the salting out setschenow constant linear relationship with organic molecule molar volume including for organic acids 38 the nacl concentration was derived from the na analysis result in table 1 using the nacl corrected γi and p vap i henry s constants h i pa l mol were then calculated following the same method reported previously 35 3 results and discussion 3 1 part i water quality indicators and flux behaviour 3 1 1 evaluation of md performance at increasing cf as summarized in table 2 five experiments were performed concentrating blood stick water bdstw i with the md apparatus set up in concentration mode using the ptfe membrane conc ptfe 1 to conc ptfe 5 to analyse the suitability of md to operate at high concentration factors table 3 shows the flux and permeate ec results of these experiments compared at the cf value of 3 5 the results consistently show a higher ec increase in permeate at higher temperatures of 60 c 20 c 771 963 μs cm than in the runs at 55 c 15 c 189 217 μs cm indicating greater transfer of ionic species from the feed into the permeate when operating at higher temperature conditions fig 2 shows the ec of the permeate and feed graphed as a function of cf for experiments conc ptfe 1 and conc ptfe 5 in both experiment 1 and 5 ec is seen to rise as cf rises until the last cf value of 4 feed ec rises proportionally with cf indicating the md is working to concentrate the majority of the feed components looking more closely with fig 2 we see permeate ec rises linearly with cf at higher temperature conc ptfe 1 while the lower temperature condition conc ptfe 5 shows a plateau despite the feed ec rising linearly these results indicate the suitability of low temperature operation to minimize transfer of ionic species and allow for stable md performance the studied blood stick water is high in blood serum albumin bsa for which temperature influence of protein denaturation has been shown 16 as samples have been autoclaved in this study however protein denaturation cannot be the major cause of this effect however most probable the hydrolysed protein compounds such as peptides and amino acids that remain in the feed water after autoclaving accelerate hydrophobic interactions with the membrane surface at higher temperature only by looking at ec increase it is not conclusive whether the higher transfer of ionic species at higher temperature is due to higher transfer of vfas or simply due to wetting our analysis of vfas below shows minor influence of temperature on vfa transfer indicating that minor wetting occurred at higher temperature probably due to increased protein and fats intrusion into the pores fig 3 shows ec results for cf higher than 4 for experiment conc ptfe 1 given as an example for operation performance at higher cf typically after reaching cf 4 the experiment was stopped overnight and continued the following day for all experiments the ongoing ec rise in the permeate at the 2nd day of operation was clearly visible knowing that blood proteins and presumably also its autoclaved hydrolysed compounds tend to form a gel foulant layer during md operation 16 a disruption of this gel foulant layer during the overnight process stop can be concluded leading to membrane wetting this is in line with tow s conclusion that in membrane distillation the hydraulic pressure difference does not influence the stable fouling gel layer however the overnight stop obviously leads to hydraulic pressure pulses during the emptying and starting phase of the process with negative influence on the gel layer stability ec measurements are influenced by ionic volatile species such as volatile fatty acids and ammonia so intact membranes may still see permeate ec rises and not have become wetted to verify the suspected partial wetting occurring after process disruptions the toc and tn in the permeate together with non volatile cl rejection were analysed and presented in fig 4 for conc ptfe 4 same test temperature conditions to conc ptfe 5 but slightly higher cfv toc and tn both representing potentially volatile species initially increased then became stable until the experiment was stopped but started to rise again after resuming the test cl rejection also started to drop from consistently 99 9 on the first day to 99 5 on the 2nd day of these parameters cl is not likely to have any volatile proportion at the test ph range and so its transfer into the permeate is indicative of the ptfe membrane wetting after the overnight stop feed and permeate cfv had negligible influence at the tested ranges between 0 084 and 0 112 m s indicating that a higher cfv than 0 09 m s would not further enhance process performance within same temperature conditions tests at higher cfv showed slightly higher ec in the permeate however similar salt retention with permeate variations were influenced by varying feed ec variations of flux and final permeate ec values seem to be more influenced by slight variations of the waste water samples rather than by cfv 3 1 2 performance of md at high cf in continuous mode to mimic steady operation at high cf md experiments have been performed in continuous mode see fig 1 table 3 shows the flux at various intervals of continuous mode operation together with relative flux decline proportion configuration and single pass recovery r rc four experiments were performed with the ptfe membrane cont ptfe 8 to cont ptfe 11 with bdstw i while two experiments were completed with the pu laminated ptfe membrane cont pu ptfe 12 with bdstw i and cont pu ptfe 13 with bdstw ii bdstw ii consisted of hemoglobin stick water with less blood plasma it could not be treated by the bare ptfe membrane as it lead to immediate wetting whether this is due to the higher isoelectric point of hemoglobin with less electrostatic repulsions to the hydrophobic membrane surface and therefore hindering a stable gel foulant layer as with bsa needs to be researched further looking at the ptfe membrane experiments fluxes are lower than at corresponding temperature conditions in the concentration mode experiments shown in the previous section as the feed water in these tests was concentrated bdstw at a cf 9 from the beginning replicating a real operation at the target 10 ts concentration target with significantly higher cod toc and tn concentrations the flux behaviour of experiment cont ptfe 9 with the lowest operating temperature 50 c 10 c showed least fouling indicated by the smallest flux decline this was followed by cont ptfe 8 at 55 c 15 c and then cont ptfe 11 featuring a co current experimental run with temperatures 60 c 20 c temperature of operation therefore has a critical role in the determination of the membrane fouling and may be key to selecting sustainable operating conditions for an md process fig 5 shows transmembrane fluxes in the experiments over the logarithmic temperature difference across the membrane δtlog which is in linear dependence with the transmembrane vapour pressure difference of water δt vap regardless of higher initial fluxes when using higher temperature over the longer term lower temperatures led to higher flux operation since higher temperatures lead to accelerated hydrophobic interactions of proteins or hydrolysed protein compounds respectively in terms of co current vs counter current operation counter current appeared to be the better mode in terms of operation since despite similar fluxes after 10 h counter current led to higher starting fluxes meaning it processed more permeate in the same 10 h period the hydrophilic pu coated membrane was used in experiments cont pu ptfe 12 and cont pu ptfe 13 in an attempt to mitigate the effect of fouling including partial wetting compared to the bare ptfe the coated membrane showed low fluxes as expected from former work with rendering stick water 6 after 10 h of md with the pu coated membrane flux was 23 31 lower than the initial flux table 4 shows the real temperature profiles as average value during the experiment with slight deviation to their set temperature due to the temperature regulation installed at the lab set up stec and c m values determined for all experiments performed in continuous mode the md run with the lowest temperature condition cont ptfe 9 50 c 10 c gave the highest initial stec value while cont ptfe 8 at the middle temperature 55 c 15 c gave the lowest initial value by more than half even more than the highest temperature condition tests of conc ptfe 10 and conc ptfe 11 60 c 20 c after 10 h all displayed increased stec and conc ptfe 8 was still lowest while now conc ptfe 10 and conc ptfe 11 had the worst highest stec values higher stec values are associated with lower operating temperatures since the vapour pressure driving force function is exponential with temperature while conductive heat losses are linear therefore creating a higher proportion of heat transfer lost via conduction through the membrane compared to vapour transport flux 23 meanwhile the results in table 4 show that despite the higher initial stec value when operating at lower temperature the reduced fouling after 10 h led to lower stec values ultimately in comparison to poorer stec values at higher temperature this greatly impacts the process thermal energy demand these stec values are still very high in comparison to the initial values obtained after the first 30 min and are likely to translate to impractically high thermal energy demands in a scaled up system even with heat recovery systems implemented into the process design to minimize a plant s total energy consumption per m3 fresh water produced 24 maintaining acceptably low stec values over long term operation may be achievable with regular membrane cleaning for example daily or at the end of an operating shift which is often utilized in membrane food processes the mass transfer coefficient c m shown in table 5 shows that cont ptfe 8 operating at 55 c 15 c showed highest initial value indicating the best flux for a given driving force after 10 h cont ptfe 9 showed the best c m further supporting the conclusion that its mass transfer performance was less impacted due to reduced fouling at lower temperature conditions in comparison the use of the pu coated ptfe membrane in cont ptfe pu 12 and cont ptfe pu 13 showed high stec values and low cm values because of the low absolute flux reached in these experiments this would likely be due to higher mass transfer resistance of the membrane from the additional small pore size pu layer 6 fig 6 analyses these results as function of δtlog clearly the performance value c m is influenced by δtlog for md with bare ptfe membrane while co and countercurrent operation deviate for initial c m values they are identical after 10 h of operation with a significant decline from their initial values for pu ptfe the temperature effect has not been studied but c m is significantly lower 31 36 l m2 h bar than for the ptfe membrane 66 l m2 h bar at similar δtlog as discussed above the c m values do not change significantly over time due to no significant fouling for the pu coated membrane fig 7 shows the flux trend of experiments cont ptfe 8 and cont pu ptfe 12 both at 55 15 c while cont ptfe 9 at 50 10 c is represented in fig 8 both show testing carried out over 17 h where no cleaning procedure was used fig 9 shows the respective rejection performance of toc tn and na after 17 h as well as after 24 h of experiment it becomes obvious from fig 7 in comparing the two different membranes that flux performance also reflected in the stec and cm values given above and in fig 6 is better for the bare ptfe membrane however rejection performance of toc tn and sodium over longer term shown in fig 9 shows very high rejections for the pu coated ptfe membrane cont pu ptfe 12 right up to 23 h of continuous testing while the bare ptfe membrane showed possible decline in non volatile sodium rejection when process disruption occurred fig 8 shows cont ptfe 9 as best performing experiment in terms of stec and c m values the low temperature condition was favourable to mitigate fouling and to reach high rejection performance after 17 h of operation however this experiment clearly shows the fragility of the fouling layer towards operational disturbances in phase ii of this experiment the pump refilling the feed tank with fresh bdstw failed and cf started to rise quickly as the feed tank drained to empty phase iii air was pumped through the module similar to the effects shown earlier when discussing rejection deterioration at process stops see also fig 4 the higher pressure pulses on the membrane resulted in wetting visible in fast ec rise of the permeate and in the declining rejection performance after 23 h differences in ptfe and pu ptfe membranes can be associated with their different material properties while both membranes have a porous ptfe structure 0 5 μm for ptfe and up to 1 μm for pu coated ptfe the pu coating is very dense with non detectable pores 50 nm 6 this hydrophilic dense pu coating adds an additional mass transfer resistance leading to lower fluxes but better rejection performance the hydrophilic coating also reduces fouling propensity of protein compounds by preventing buildup of hydrophobic compounds that cannot be easily detached by the crossflow the extended 3 day operation on the pu coated ptfe membranes is shown in fig 10 cont ptfe pu 13 while flux is very low compared to the ptfe membrane rejection performance was outstanding as permeate conductivity plateaued at 1200 μs indicating minor transport even at very harsh feed conditions high cod tn toc concentrations high feed conductivity at 90 ms cm water flushes were shown to remove solid accumulation on the membrane effectively it becomes clear that the pu coated ptfe membrane shows similar md performance for bdstw i and bdstwii indicating that the hydrophilic layer minimizes interactions with proteins and hydrolysed protein compounds and therefore water composition has no influence on md performance in this case 3 1 3 analysis of membrane fouling analysis of the water contact angles of membrane surfaces before and after fouling are shown in table 6 the original bare ptfe membrane showed high hydrophobicity as indicated by the high contact angle 139 being well above 90 similar to reported literature values 25 26 post run membranes including conc ptfe 2 taken out of the apparatus and immediately rinsed with tap water pressure showed recovered high contact angle of 131 this recovered high contact angle value after cleaning the membranes show how well the fouling layer was removed during the applied cleaning procedure returning the exposed hydrophobicity of the membrane surface depending on the intensity of water rinse the fouling layer could be removed and the hydrophobicity of the membrane remained rinsing the membrane within the module at lower water cross flows of 500 ml min did not remove the fouling layer effectively no matter how long this rinse lasted this is shown in table 6 for experiments cont ptfe 8 cont ptfe 11 in tests where membranes were only rinsed for 0 5 h in the module the performed contact angle measurements clearly show the hydrophilicity of the fouling layer reaching a water ca of only 20 3 the fouling layers on the membrane surfaces were analysed by ftir and shown in fig 11 the peaks at 1206 1 cm and 1148 1 cm relate to the cf2 vibrations of the ptfe material 6 and peaks observed in around this wavenumber for bare unfouled ptfe membranes used in md 27 29 the results for all fouled membranes show that proteins where the main foulants based on the present primary mainly co vibration and secondary mainly nh vibration amide bands as well as amide a bands 30 32 the latter being visible as a broad band at wavenumber 3000 3500 1 cm the same bands are visible in any cont ptfe tests disregarding whether wetting occurred shown for cont ptfe 9 wetted because of dry out cont ptfe 10 and cont ptfe 11 so despite similar interactions of components with the membrane surface in all analysed samples the wetting occurred due to the extent of the interaction with the membrane which cannot be identified by the ftir results alone 3 2 part ii analysis of vfa diffusion through md membranes fig 12 shows the concentration of toc and the detected vfas measured in the concentrate and permeate samples during cont ptfe 8 55 15 c the presence of 9 vfas were identified in the feed waters namely acetic acid propanoic acid iso butyric acid butyric acid iso valeric acid valeric acid isocaproic acid hexanoic acid and n heptanoic acid all 9 vfas were found in the permeate although the latter two in very low concentrations below the detection limit for quantification the analysis therefore focuses on the 7 detectable vfas all of these vfas were measured in the concentrate at higher concentrations than the permeate and so were not permeating greater than water generally acetic acid was present at highest concentrations in the feed followed by propanoic acid and butyric acid while concentrate toc slightly increased in the feed a slight increasing tendency is also detected for the vfa concentration of the concentrate samples with strongest increase in acetic acid acetic acid is also present at highest concentrations of 13 000 18 000 mg l the increasing rather than decreasing trend for the major vfas indicates minor mass loss via the membrane into the permeate looking at the permeate samples the major vfas from the concentrate such as acetic and propanoic are still dominant but the other vfas that were less dominant in the concentrate are higher in relative proportion this will be analysed next using the permeate concentration ratio vfa permeate concentration ratios r c i are shown in fig 13 for the bare ptfe membrane tests and for the hydrophilic coated ptfe membrane pu ptfe all being 13 the highest ratios specific to any vfa i for both membrane were detected for isocaproic acid up to 12 9 iso butyric up to 5 7 and iso valeric acid up to 5 5 it should be noted here that the feed and permeate cycles were open to the air suggesting the most volatile vfas such as acetic propanoic and butyric acids may have preferentially left the solutions over time leading to measurements underrepresenting their presence especially over the least volatile isocaproic however measurement of vfa concentration at 2 5 h and 20 h in the continuous run cont ptfe 8 with continuous operation show an increase of vfa concentrations in the feed see table 7 it is therefore still conclusive that the acetic acid diffused relatively less into the permeate over other less volatile vfas as it would have shown higher concentrations in the permeate considering its stronger presence in the feed table 7 also includes vfa concentration ratios r c i over time of the experiment cont ptfe 8 showing a decreasing trend of vfa permeation after 24 h in the continuous run this decrease might be due to a build up of fouling layer over time to minimize this impact values at 2 5 h have been taken into account for more detailed analysis given below the properties of the molecules need to be considered as part of further analysis of the vfa diffusion behaviour from feed to permeate fig 13 shows that the hydrophilic coated ptfe membrane with much smaller pore size of the outer layer 22 33 permeated less vfas than the ptfe membrane the pu ptfe membrane gave very low permeate ratios below 3 for most vfas isocaproic acid on the other hand was similar to the ptfe membrane highest ratios of 7 8 maybe slightly overestimated as the acid was present in very low concentration in this run in the feed and permeate concentration was measured at the detection limit of 30 mg l the relative order from lowest ratio to highest ratio was similar between bare ptfe and pu coated ptfe the influence of temperature conditions on the vfa permeate ratio visible in the comparison between experiments cont ptfe 8 to cont ptfe 11 is also shown in fig 13 there was no consistent trend with the feed or permeate temperatures to vfa behaviour so it appears that temperature conditions for these tests don t have a noticeable impact to the permeate concentration ratio in order to determine the vfa diffusion mode fig 14 shows the vfas in order of permeate ratio r c i for the cont ptfe 8 test together with their various properties and calculated parameters as r c i was low for all vfas 13 the feed values without considering permeate concentrations serve as a good indicator to the overall vfa driving force following the mass transfer model developed by 35 r c i increased with mw except for isobutyric acid in terms of volatility p vap generally decreased with r c i but h i shows a general increasing trend with r c i implying volatility in the dilute non ideal system could be the reason for increasing mass transfer indicated by r c i this is in line with the findings of winglee et al 35 who similarly observed this increasing h i trend with equilibrium ratio similar to our r c i in analyzing permeation of volatile petroleum hydrocarbons during md overall isocaproic acid had the highest r c i followed by isobutyric acid the much lighter higher p vap acetic acid showed the lowest r c i likewise for propanoic acid therefore the intuitive conclusion that increasing pure component vapour pressure would lead to higher specific vfa driving force and its permeation is clearly contradicted by the application of γi that corrects for non ideal solute behaviour increasing with mw of the organic acid 37 and instead provides increasing h i however the determination of h i accounts only for the vfa water nacl system where published vfa values for γi would have likely been measured under unadjusted acidic conditions ph not reported 37 our complex feed was closer to ph 8 being much greater than all pka values of all vfas 4 76 4 85 using the henderson hasselbalch equation the undissociated free acid proportion is 0 01 therefore the vfas are essentially all dissociated suggesting negligible free molecules that can readily vaporize and diffuse as vapour through the porous ptfe membrane vapour phase diffusion is thus unlikely to be responsible for vfa to transport from the feed to the permeate hydrophobic diffusion may instead explain the vfa transport logd is the distribution coefficient between lipophilic and hydrophilic phases and has been used to explain diffusion of hydrophobic organics previously in md 36 looking at logd i ph 8 presented in fig 14 there appears to be a correlation with the increasing r c i suggesting hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic ptfe membrane may explain the vfa diffusion although 36 declared that logd 3 classified the organic as hydrophobic even the negative values for the organic acids in our work lead to appreciable proportions vfa molecules in a hydrophobic state the antilog gives d values lipophilic hydrophilic ratio of 0 04 0 12 0 37 1 26 0 87 0 31 and 2 88 for acetic propanoic butyric valeric iso valeric isobutyric and isocaproic acids respectively these values appear high enough to explain the low but measureable proportions of vfas in the permeate relative to the feed particularly for the least lipophilic proportion acetic acid vs the most liphohilic proportion isocaproic acid on the basis that the lipophilic vfa species have an affinity for the hydrophobic ptfe membrane and can diffuse through its pores and desorb into the cooler permeate solution it may also suggest that molecules with higher lipophilic proportions could outcompete the others on the hydrophobic ptfe membrane surface in summary the analysis of volatile and hydrophobic properties is indicating a hydrophobic diffusion mode of vfas through the ptfe membranes fig 14 also includes comparison between feed and concentrate activity coefficients at infinite dilution γi feed and γi conc respectively for the model water acid nacl system the salt correction follows 35 and specifically in our case our nacl concentrations of 7900 mg l and 71 500 mg l for feed and concentrate respectively estimated from na in table 1 using cf 9 and 100 na rejection having a major effect to increase vfa water activity coefficients following the setschenow equation 38 as can be seen by the relevant activity coefficients in fig 14 this proportionately increases with the heavier molecules due to its correlation to molar volume according to 38 this can be interpreted to both increased volatility and hydrophobicity of organic solutes due to salting out effect this would suggest the higher mw vfas are driven more to diffuse through the membrane over lighter vfas due to the increasing salinity as a result of concentration by md considering the conclusions made earlier towards a more likely effect of hydrophobic diffusion of vfas this further aligns with the trend of increasing r c i but also with mw by molar volume during the md process a final interesting observation is that throughout the discussions iso valeric and isobutyric acids are not following the trend of r c i with increasing logd ph 8 hydrophobicity or activity coefficients volatility including isocaproic acid these are the vfas with the highest r c i values and coincidently all have methyl pendant groups the straight chain isomers valeric and butyric acids have very similar h i and logd values yet have relatively lower r c i the methyl branching of the vfa appears to have assisted with the diffusion from the feed to the permeate more than molecules with equivalent properties while this has no clear explanation from the properties it may be considered that the hydrophobic methyl pendant groups assist in the attachment and diffusion through the ptfe structure based on the discussion above it seems more likely that the vfa diffusion into the permeate was hydrophobic surface diffusion which has indeed been confirmed in studies on non volatile humic acid 34 the same pu ptfe membranes were studied in this prior work and yielded similar humic acid diffusion as through bare ptfe while in our case the vfas also diffused but to a lesser extent from our results it is clear that hydrophobic surface diffusion is playing a significant role in determining the vfa permeate water quality however a dedicated work on organic acid diffusion through md membranes is needed to confirm out findings a future test to observe the contribution from vapour diffusion could involve measuring vapour phase concentrations of vfas above controlled synthetic test solutions at various ph temperatures and salinities adsorption of vfas on to ptfe membranes and also testing with an omniphobic membrane where previously non volatile humic acid diffusing by hydrophobic interactions was reduced 34 4 conclusions in this work we studied md for valorisation of organic waste water effluents on hydrophobic ptfe and pu coated ptfe membranes lower temperature conditions feed temperature 55 c permeate temperature 15 c are favourable for higher permeate quality and constant flux behaviour in md experiments with ptfe membranes of this highly proteinaceous water most probably due to lower hydrophobic interaction of protein compounds with the ptfe membrane surface clearly the logarithmic temperature difference δtlog across the membrane significantly influences fouling behaviour with best performance values after 10 h of operation for lowest δtlog the protein compounds formed an outwardly hydrophilic layer on the hydrophobic membrane surface of ptfe leading to significant loss of flux at high concentrations tn 20 40 g l still at 30 over 10 h experimental time for the lowest temperature condition 50 c 10 c however the gel foulant layer does not lead to wetting phenomena in continuous md treatment of effluents with high loading of proteins with ptfe membranes at low temperatures 55 c for 24 h unless process disruptions occurred partial wetting occurs in the laboratory test apparatus after any process interruption presumably by the hydraulic pressure of the incoming feed or when air is driven through the system thus an optimum md module set up has to be found that allows smooth and effective cleaning procedures to gently remove the protein layer hydrophilic polyurethane membrane coating avoids fouling and shows very stable rejection performance but the added coating is believed to be responsible for very low total flux in comparison with bare ptfe membranes due to added mass transfer resistance ptfe membranes are therefore favourable vs pu coated ptfe in terms of stec and c m but a gentle removal of the fouling layer built up on the ptfe membrane is a key to maintain stable md performance and requires further research vfas diffusing through the membrane into the permeate was more positively correlated to hydrophobic surface diffusion than as vapour through the membrane for both ptfe and pu coated ptfe membranes in md we could successfully show a correlation of logd distribution coefficient with the concentration ratio of vfas the model vfa water nacl based henry s law constants also give a good trend with vfa permeation however pka values are much lower than the feed ph thus leaving almost no free acid molecules to leave as vapour suggesting a higher probability for hydrophobic surface diffusion over volatile transport in ptfe and pu membranes 0 7 13 3 of the vfa s found in the concentrate could be detected in the permeate in general the proportion of vfa diffused into the permeate was not significantly higher for the higher operation temperature conditions the re concentration of stick waters to 10 ts target concentrations for process re use therefore seems promising at low temperature conditions available by waste heat given that a membrane cleaning procedure can be identified that does not lead to decreases in membrane performance clean water recovery needs to take into account low vfa presence declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13231,combining the ultrasound and peroxydisulfate us pds process offers a promising advanced oxidation method to remove organic compounds from aqueous solutions this study evaluated the activation of pds by us irradiation based on bisphenol a bpa degradation experiments the effect of copper film cf as a metal catalyst was also tested the bpa degradation efficiency of pds as an oxidizing agent was compared to h2o2 under us irradiation pds was effectively activated by ultrasound and through ultrasound derived heat the presence of cf in the system was also observed to significantly enhance bpa degradation the performance of three single systems us pds and cf three dual systems us pds us cf and pds cf and one triple system us pds cf were compared it was found that the us pds cf triple system exhibited the highest bpa degradation of 99 51 within 30 min the effect of operating parameters on degradation efficacy was investigated bpa degradation was stimulated by the elevation of ultrasound power 38 87 97 17 w temperature 30 70 c and initial pds concentration 1 71 17 11 mm artificial neural network modeling was utilized to determine the significance of these operational parameters in bpa degradation it was estimated that the importance of these parameters was in order temperature 46 83 initial pds concentration 40 54 ultrasound power 12 63 furthermore bpa mineralization was studied in the us pds and us pds cf systems these findings facilitate an understanding of the us pds process to degrade organic compounds keywords ultrasound temperature peroxydisulfate bisphenol a artificial neural networks 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa is being increasingly used as a monomer to produce plastics food packaging dental sealants and thermal receipts 1 2 currently bpa is one of the highest globally produced chemicals with a total production capacity exceeding 3 8 million tons the amount of bpa released into the environment exceeds 450 tons per year 3 people may be exposed to bpa through the consumption of products containing polycarbonate and epoxy resin coatings which are used in food and beverage containers 4 the united states environmental protection agency usepa estimates that over 90 of people that have been tested have detectable bpa in their systems the highest of these levels were found in infants and children 5 based on data from human urine biomonitoring the daily intake of bpa is estimated to range from 0 019 to 0 060 μg kg d 6 in particular aquatic environments have been identified as the primary area in which bpas tend to accumulate 7 for example the highest concentration of bpa in the kogawauchi and kiyotake rivers in japan was 900 ng l 8 bpa is known to be harmful to human health it is an endocrine disruptor chemical with estrogenic properties that poses risks to the reproductive and nervous systems metabolic and immune functions and growth and development of offspring 9 10 it is also potentially toxic to aquatic organisms in freshwater and marine ecosystems 11 thus there is an urgent need to remove bpa from the aquatic environment advanced oxidation processes aops involving highly reactive oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 have gained significant research interest for their ability to degrade and mineralize organic compounds such as bpa 12 although oh is the most widely used reactive oxygen species so4 has recently replaced oh based aops to a certain extent 13 the formed so4 has a longer lifetime 30 40 μs than the hydroxyl radical 0 02 μs this facilitates the degradation of more organic contaminants by so4 14 typically the so4 is formed by activating oxidizing agents such as peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 through heat ultraviolet light and or other means 15 ultrasound us irradiation is an emerging method that when used alone or in combination with other aops may also be used to activate pds 16 18 this us activation has been proven to be effective in generating so4 via breakage of the oo bond of pds as such it has gained increasing interest particularly in recent years 19 pds may be activated by transition metal catalysts 20 previous studies have shown that among tested metal oxides e g fe2o3 mno2 cuo zno tio2 moo3 and ceo2 cuo has the best catalytic performance in activating pds to degrade 2 4 dichlorophenol 21 the ability to degrade recalcitrant organics via these catalytic reactions may be significantly strengthened by cleaning the surfaces of catalysts using us 22 antimicrobial copper films cfs have been widely used as quarantine products in recent years and may also be used as metal catalysts to activate oxidizing agents a previous study confirmed that cfs have a synergistic effect on bpa degradation by activating h2o2 to generate oh under us irradiation 23 however to the best of our knowledge the ability for a cf to activate pds under us irradiation has not yet been tested as both heat and us are generated in the us activation process it is difficult to distinguish between their individual effects 24 artificial neural network ann modeling is a means to evaluate these effects with relative ease anns have the ability to learn the underlying data generating process enabling their wide application in prediction forecasting function approximation and classification roles 25 thus anns are suitable for solving problems that are non linear and highly uncertain and are of particularly interest in water treatment studies 26 30 to date studies evaluating pds activation by us using anns are insufficient therefore in this study we evaluate the activation of pds under us irradiation in the presence or absence of cf using bpa degradation experiments the degradation efficiency of bpa by pds was compared with that of h2o2 under the same conditions the synergistic effect on bpa degradation by the combination of us pds and cf was investigated and the bpa degradation mechanism was analyzed through chemical scavenger tests the effects of operational parameters such as us power temperature and pds concentration were examined furthermore their significance relative to bpa degradation was determined using through ann modeling the mineralization of bpa was investigated in the us pds system and the reusability of cf for bpa degradation in the us pds cf system was also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials reagents were

direct q 3uv merck millipore seoul korea was used to prepare and dilute reagents 2 2 bisphenol a degradation experiments the bpa degradation experiments were conducted with a 0 1 mm bpa solution in a 100 ml vial where a 12 cm 8 cm cf was used as a catalyst a bath type single transducer sonicator elmasonic p30h elma germany was used at 37 khz to generate us the output power 100 calculated using the calorimetric method was 97 17 w these experiments were conducted at 60 c for 30 min when the bath temperature needed to be below 60 c it was adjusted by continuously and gradually exchanging water in the bath to discern the effect from the us a 100 ml vial was placed in a water bath maintained at 60 c and stirred using a magnetic stirrer msh 20d daihan scientific co korea at an agitation speed of 1500 rpm the solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh for the solution ph effect experiments the bpa concentration in each sample was measured by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with an ultraviolet visible light uv vis detector yl9100 plus system young in chromass korea and a reversed phase c18 column 4 6 mm 250mm 5 μm waters corporation usa the mobile phase was acetonitrile water v v 50 50 and the flow rate was 1 ml min the uv vis wavelength was 230 nm and the injection volume was 20 μl the total organic carbon toc concentration in each sample was measured using a toc analyzer toc vws shimadzu japan 2 3 ann modeling the ann model comprised input hidden and output layers three operating parameters initial pds concentration temperature and us power were the input variables the optimization of the ann model structure was evaluated using the range of neurons in the hidden layers 1 15 bpa degradation efficiency was used for the neuron output layer three input variable values were used following re adjustments using eq 1 1 x i x i min x max x min x where min x and max x were the minimum and maximum of the variable x value x i is the i th variable x value for transfer functions of hidden a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function tansig eq 2 and a linear transfer function purelin eq 3 were used for the transfer functions of the hidden and output layers 2 tansig x 2 1 e 2 x 1 3 purelin x x the experimental data were randomly divided into a 3 1 1 ratio to train validate and test the ann model model optimization was performed using the levenberg marquardt algorithm to minimize the mean squared error mse ann modeling was undertaken using the matlab 2021a mathworks usa software 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of bisphenol a degradation using different oxidizing agents under ultrasound irradiation the bpa degradation achieved by different oxidizing agents under us was compared using the same concentrations of pds and h2o2 fig 1 although h2o2 may be transformed into hydroxyl radicals under us irradiation eq 4 23 31 only 3 37 of bpa was removed in this system i e bpa 0 1 mm h2o2 100 mm temperature 60 c us power 97 17 w in contrast when 100 mm pds was used and all other experimental conditions were the same 100 of bpa was removed within 12 min the considerably higher bpa degradation by pds compared to h2o2 may be attributable to the heat induced during the us irradiation process h2o2 cannot be activated by heat whereas the heat 50 c or us induced eqs 5 and 6 activation of pds is possible 32 33 the results showed that the lifetime of so4 was longer than oh and the redox potential of so4 3 1 ev dissociated from pds was greater than that of oh 1 76 ev dissociated from h2o2 34 a similar finding was also reported in an ibuprofen degradation study the us pds system was considered more effective than the us h2o2 system in removing ibuprofen which exhibited an electrical energy per order of 263 5 kwh m3 at a cost of 41 8 m3 35 4 h 2 o 2 2oh 5 s 2 o 8 2 2so 4 6 s 2 o 8 2 heat 2so 4 the use of cfs with us and h2o2 substantially improved bpa degradation fig s2 this effective degradation was attributed to the catalytic activation of h2o2 by the cu present in the cf eqs 7 9 23 36 in the us h2o2 cf system i e bpa 0 1 mm cf size 12 cm 8 cm h2o2 100 mm 60 c us power 97 17 w 85 75 of bpa was removed within 30 min this improved degradation efficiency was lower than that of the us pds and us pds cf systems in which pds was utilized as an oxidizing agent 7 cu h 2 o 2 cu 2 oh oh 8 cu 2 h 2 o 2 cu ho 2 h 9 cu 2 ho 2 cu h o 2 3 2 factor comparative study on bisphenol a degradation in us pds and us pds cf system the performance of three single systems us pds and cf three dual systems us pds us cf pds cf and one triple system us pds cf were compared in terms of bpa degradation fig 2 it was found that there was negligible bpa degradation in the single and dual systems that were run for 30 min without pds us 1 44 cf 0 49 us cf 2 88 in contrast when using pds 64 45 bpa degradation was initially caused by heat activated persulfate eq 6 and then further enhanced by the combination of us and pds us pds 89 73 moreover the cavitation microbubbles induced from the us continued to grow until they reached a critical size this phenomenon caused a violent implosion collapse a rapid implosion leads to extremely high temperatures at the 5000 c local scale and a high pressure of 500 atm 37 these observed sono chemical effects may be responsible for the synergistic effect of persulfate decomposition and generation of sulfate radicals 38 the collapse of cavitation bubbles by us may also generate oh and h via the dissociation of water furthermore these radicals may activate persulfate into sulfate radicals through two key reactions shown in eqs 10 and 11 39 41 10 s 2 o 8 2 oh hso 4 so 4 0 5o 2 11 s 2 o 8 2 h hso 4 so 4 when cf was used in the pds system the bpa degradation over a period of 30 min showed improvement pds cf 66 18 us pds cf 99 51 this is because the oo bond in pds may be activated in a manner that is similar to h2o2 through the heterogeneous catalysis of copper oxides present in the cf eq 12 42 43 the us pds cf system was the sole system that was considerably different in terms of bpa degradation compared to the us pds system p 0 05 this is because the us irradiation possibly improved the overall reaction by promoting the catalytic reaction 23 12 cu 2 s 2 o 8 2 cu 3 so 4 so 4 2 to confirm the bpa degradation mechanism in the us pds and the us pds cf system radical scavenging tests were conducted using meoh and tba fig s3 as a result of the radical scavenging experiments bpa degradation over a period of 30 min was decreased in both us pds and us pds cf systems us pds meoh 68 90 us pds tba 82 56 us pds cf meoh 95 95 us pds cf tba 96 80 meanwhile meoh reaction rate with ho α h reacts is dozens of times greater than that with so4 k meoh ho 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 k meoh so4 1 6 7 7 1010 m 1 s 1 and the reaction rate of tba without α h reacts with so4 is much slower than that with ho k tba ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 k tba so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 44 45 thus the above results indicated that both so4 and ho participated in the bpa degradation but so4 could play a predominant role 3 3 effect of operational parameters on bpa degradation in us pds and us pds cf systems 3 3 1 ultrasound power the effects of us power in the us pds and us pds cf systems were evaluated fig 3 in both systems bpa degradation tended to increase with increasing us power the bpa degradation of the us pds system for 30 min at us powers of 40 38 87 w 60 58 30 w 80 77 74 w and 100 97 17 w were 73 66 76 59 78 95 and 89 73 respectively this degradation increased to 84 31 89 00 94 47 and 99 51 respectively in the us pds cf system this is because an increase in the us power increases the mixing intensity as a result of the turbulence from the cavitation bubble collapse the mixing intensity is also increased from the higher yield of reactive oxygen species due to the larger number of cavitation bubbles 46 these factors enable the acceleration of bpa degradation 3 3 2 temperature the effect of temperature on the us pds and us pds cf systems was also evaluated fig 4 both systems were found to be temperature sensitive as the temperature of the system increased from 30 c to 70 c there was a dramatic increase in bpa degradation i e us pds 30 c 0 95 us pds 40 c 5 21 us pds 50 c 23 99 us pds 60 c 89 73 us pds 70 c 100 us pds cf 30 c 2 84 us pds cf 40 c 7 76 us pds cf 50 c 24 77 us pds cf 60 c 99 51 us pds cf 70 c 100 these results clearly demonstrate that pds was converted to sulfate radicals through activation by us and heat in which the latter may be generated through increased solution temperatures from heat dissipation 47 3 3 3 initial pds concentration the effect of bpa degradation on the initial pds concentration was evaluated fig 5 a shows that bpa degradation in the us pds system tended to increase with the initial pds concentration the bpa degradation in 30

was increased to 3 7 and 11 in the us pds system the bpa degradation in 30 min increased to 82 59 88 26 and 90 29 respectively this is because naoh used to adjust the ph of the solution acted as an activator of persulfate under basic conditions acting synergistically on hydroxyl radical formation helping to remove bpa 48 conversely in the us pds cf system the bpa degradation in 30 min increased

13231,combining the ultrasound and peroxydisulfate us pds process offers a promising advanced oxidation method to remove organic compounds from aqueous solutions this study evaluated the activation of pds by us irradiation based on bisphenol a bpa degradation experiments the effect of copper film cf as a metal catalyst was also tested the bpa degradation efficiency of pds as an oxidizing agent was compared to h2o2 under us irradiation pds was effectively activated by ultrasound and through ultrasound derived heat the presence of cf in the system was also observed to significantly enhance bpa degradation the performance of three single systems us pds and cf three dual systems us pds us cf and pds cf and one triple system us pds cf were compared it was found that the us pds cf triple system exhibited the highest bpa degradation of 99 51 within 30 min the effect of operating parameters on degradation efficacy was investigated bpa degradation was stimulated by the elevation of ultrasound power 38 87 97 17 w temperature 30 70 c and initial pds concentration 1 71 17 11 mm artificial neural network modeling was utilized to determine the significance of these operational parameters in bpa degradation it was estimated that the importance of these parameters was in order temperature 46 83 initial pds concentration 40 54 ultrasound power 12 63 furthermore bpa mineralization was studied in the us pds and us pds cf systems these findings facilitate an understanding of the us pds process to degrade organic compounds keywords ultrasound temperature peroxydisulfate bisphenol a artificial neural networks 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa is being increasingly used as a monomer to produce plastics food packaging dental sealants and thermal receipts 1 2 currently bpa is one of the highest globally produced chemicals with a total production capacity exceeding 3 8 million tons the amount of bpa released into the environment exceeds 450 tons per year 3 people may be exposed to bpa through the consumption of products containing polycarbonate and epoxy resin coatings which are used in food and beverage containers 4 the united states environmental protection agency usepa estimates that over 90 of people that have been tested have detectable bpa in their systems the highest of these levels were found in infants and children 5 based on data from human urine biomonitoring the daily intake of bpa is estimated to range from 0 019 to 0 060 μg kg d 6 in particular aquatic environments have been identified as the primary area in which bpas tend to accumulate 7 for example the highest concentration of bpa in the kogawauchi and kiyotake rivers in japan was 900 ng l 8 bpa is known to be harmful to human health it is an endocrine disruptor chemical with estrogenic properties that poses risks to the reproductive and nervous systems metabolic and immune functions and growth and development of offspring 9 10 it is also potentially toxic to aquatic organisms in freshwater and marine ecosystems 11 thus there is an urgent need to remove bpa from the aquatic environment advanced oxidation processes aops involving highly reactive oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 have gained significant research interest for their ability to degrade and mineralize organic compounds such as bpa 12 although oh is the most widely used reactive oxygen species so4 has recently replaced oh based aops to a certain extent 13 the formed so4 has a longer lifetime 30 40 μs than the hydroxyl radical 0 02 μs this facilitates the degradation of more organic contaminants by so4 14 typically the so4 is formed by activating oxidizing agents such as peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 through heat ultraviolet light and or other means 15 ultrasound us irradiation is an emerging method that when used alone or in combination with other aops may also be used to activate pds 16 18 this us activation has been proven to be effective in generating so4 via breakage of the oo bond of pds as such it has gained increasing interest particularly in recent years 19 pds may be activated by transition metal catalysts 20 previous studies have shown that among tested metal oxides e g fe2o3 mno2 cuo zno tio2 moo3 and ceo2 cuo has the best catalytic performance in activating pds to degrade 2 4 dichlorophenol 21 the ability to degrade recalcitrant organics via these catalytic reactions may be significantly strengthened by cleaning the surfaces of catalysts using us 22 antimicrobial copper films cfs have been widely used as quarantine products in recent years and may also be used as metal catalysts to activate oxidizing agents a previous study confirmed that cfs have a synergistic effect on bpa degradation by activating h2o2 to generate oh under us irradiation 23 however to the best of our knowledge the ability for a cf to activate pds under us irradiation has not yet been tested as both heat and us are generated in the us activation process it is difficult to distinguish between their individual effects 24 artificial neural network ann modeling is a means to evaluate these effects with relative ease anns have the ability to learn the underlying data generating process enabling their wide application in prediction forecasting function approximation and classification roles 25 thus anns are suitable for solving problems that are non linear and highly uncertain and are of particularly interest in water treatment studies 26 30 to date studies evaluating pds activation by us using anns are insufficient therefore in this study we evaluate the activation of pds under us irradiation in the presence or absence of cf using bpa degradation experiments the degradation efficiency of bpa by pds was compared with that of h2o2 under the same conditions the synergistic effect on bpa degradation by the combination of us pds and cf was investigated and the bpa degradation mechanism was analyzed through chemical scavenger tests the effects of operational parameters such as us power temperature and pds concentration were examined furthermore their significance relative to bpa degradation was determined using through ann modeling the mineralization of bpa was investigated in the us pds system and the reusability of cf for bpa degradation in the us pds cf system was also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials reagents were

direct q 3uv merck millipore seoul korea was used to prepare and dilute reagents 2 2 bisphenol a degradation experiments the bpa degradation experiments were conducted with a 0 1 mm bpa solution in a 100 ml vial where a 12 cm 8 cm cf was used as a catalyst a bath type single transducer sonicator elmasonic p30h elma germany was used at 37 khz to generate us the output power 100 calculated using the calorimetric method was 97 17 w these experiments were conducted at 60 c for 30 min when the bath temperature needed to be below 60 c it was adjusted by continuously and gradually exchanging water in the bath to discern the effect from the us a 100 ml vial was placed in a water bath maintained at 60 c and stirred using a magnetic stirrer msh 20d daihan scientific co korea at an agitation speed of 1500 rpm the solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh for the solution ph effect experiments the bpa concentration in each sample was measured by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with an ultraviolet visible light uv vis detector yl9100 plus system young in chromass korea and a reversed phase c18 column 4 6 mm 250mm 5 μm waters corporation usa the mobile phase was acetonitrile water v v 50 50 and the flow rate was 1 ml min the uv vis wavelength was 230 nm and the injection volume was 20 μl the total organic carbon toc concentration in each sample was measured using a toc analyzer toc vws shimadzu japan 2 3 ann modeling the ann model comprised input hidden and output layers three operating parameters initial pds concentration temperature and us power were the input variables the optimization of the ann model structure was evaluated using the range of neurons in the hidden layers 1 15 bpa degradation efficiency was used for the neuron output layer three input variable values were used following re adjustments using eq 1 1 x i x i min x max x min x where min x and max x were the minimum and maximum of the variable x value x i is the i th variable x value for transfer functions of hidden a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function tansig eq 2 and a linear transfer function purelin eq 3 were used for the transfer functions of the hidden and output layers 2 tansig x 2 1 e 2 x 1 3 purelin x x the experimental data were randomly divided into a 3 1 1 ratio to train validate and test the ann model model optimization was performed using the levenberg marquardt algorithm to minimize the mean squared error mse ann modeling was undertaken using the matlab 2021a mathworks usa software 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of bisphenol a degradation using different oxidizing agents under ultrasound irradiation the bpa degradation achieved by different oxidizing agents under us was compared using the same concentrations of pds and h2o2 fig 1 although h2o2 may be transformed into hydroxyl radicals under us irradiation eq 4 23 31 only 3 37 of bpa was removed in this system i e bpa 0 1 mm h2o2 100 mm temperature 60 c us power 97 17 w in contrast when 100 mm pds was used and all other experimental conditions were the same 100 of bpa was removed within 12 min the considerably higher bpa degradation by pds compared to h2o2 may be attributable to the heat induced during the us irradiation process h2o2 cannot be activated by heat whereas the heat 50 c or us induced eqs 5 and 6 activation of pds is possible 32 33 the results showed that the lifetime of so4 was longer than oh and the redox potential of so4 3 1 ev dissociated from pds was greater than that of oh 1 76 ev dissociated from h2o2 34 a similar finding was also reported in an ibuprofen degradation study the us pds system was considered more effective than the us h2o2 system in removing ibuprofen which exhibited an electrical energy per order of 263 5 kwh m3 at a cost of 41 8 m3 35 4 h 2 o 2 2oh 5 s 2 o 8 2 2so 4 6 s 2 o 8 2 heat 2so 4 the use of cfs with us and h2o2 substantially improved bpa degradation fig s2 this effective degradation was attributed to the catalytic activation of h2o2 by the cu present in the cf eqs 7 9 23 36 in the us h2o2 cf system i e bpa 0 1 mm cf size 12 cm 8 cm h2o2 100 mm 60 c us power 97 17 w 85 75 of bpa was removed within 30 min this improved degradation efficiency was lower than that of the us pds and us pds cf systems in which pds was utilized as an oxidizing agent 7 cu h 2 o 2 cu 2 oh oh 8 cu 2 h 2 o 2 cu ho 2 h 9 cu 2 ho 2 cu h o 2 3 2 factor comparative study on bisphenol a degradation in us pds and us pds cf system the performance of three single systems us pds and cf three dual systems us pds us cf pds cf and one triple system us pds cf were compared in terms of bpa degradation fig 2 it was found that there was negligible bpa degradation in the single and dual systems that were run for 30 min without pds us 1 44 cf 0 49 us cf 2 88 in contrast when using pds 64 45 bpa degradation was initially caused by heat activated persulfate eq 6 and then further enhanced by the combination of us and pds us pds 89 73 moreover the cavitation microbubbles induced from the us continued to grow until they reached a critical size this phenomenon caused a violent implosion collapse a rapid implosion leads to extremely high temperatures at the 5000 c local scale and a high pressure of 500 atm 37 these observed sono chemical effects may be responsible for the synergistic effect of persulfate decomposition and generation of sulfate radicals 38 the collapse of cavitation bubbles by us may also generate oh and h via the dissociation of water furthermore these radicals may activate persulfate into sulfate radicals through two key reactions shown in eqs 10 and 11 39 41 10 s 2 o 8 2 oh hso 4 so 4 0 5o 2 11 s 2 o 8 2 h hso 4 so 4 when cf was used in the pds system the bpa degradation over a period of 30 min showed improvement pds cf 66 18 us pds cf 99 51 this is because the oo bond in pds may be activated in a manner that is similar to h2o2 through the heterogeneous catalysis of copper oxides present in the cf eq 12 42 43 the us pds cf system was the sole system that was considerably different in terms of bpa degradation compared to the us pds system p 0 05 this is because the us irradiation possibly improved the overall reaction by promoting the catalytic reaction 23 12 cu 2 s 2 o 8 2 cu 3 so 4 so 4 2 to confirm the bpa degradation mechanism in the us pds and the us pds cf system radical scavenging tests were conducted using meoh and tba fig s3 as a result of the radical scavenging experiments bpa degradation over a period of 30 min was decreased in both us pds and us pds cf systems us pds meoh 68 90 us pds tba 82 56 us pds cf meoh 95 95 us pds cf tba 96 80 meanwhile meoh reaction rate with ho α h reacts is dozens of times greater than that with so4 k meoh ho 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 k meoh so4 1 6 7 7 1010 m 1 s 1 and the reaction rate of tba without α h reacts with so4 is much slower than that with ho k tba ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 k tba so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 44 45 thus the above results indicated that both so4 and ho participated in the bpa degradation but so4 could play a predominant role 3 3 effect of operational parameters on bpa degradation in us pds and us pds cf systems 3 3 1 ultrasound power the effects of us power in the us pds and us pds cf systems were evaluated fig 3 in both systems bpa degradation tended to increase with increasing us power the bpa degradation of the us pds system for 30 min at us powers of 40 38 87 w 60 58 30 w 80 77 74 w and 100 97 17 w were 73 66 76 59 78 95 and 89 73 respectively this degradation increased to 84 31 89 00 94 47 and 99 51 respectively in the us pds cf system this is because an increase in the us power increases the mixing intensity as a result of the turbulence from the cavitation bubble collapse the mixing intensity is also increased from the higher yield of reactive oxygen species due to the larger number of cavitation bubbles 46 these factors enable the acceleration of bpa degradation 3 3 2 temperature the effect of temperature on the us pds and us pds cf systems was also evaluated fig 4 both systems were found to be temperature sensitive as the temperature of the system increased from 30 c to 70 c there was a dramatic increase in bpa degradation i e us pds 30 c 0 95 us pds 40 c 5 21 us pds 50 c 23 99 us pds 60 c 89 73 us pds 70 c 100 us pds cf 30 c 2 84 us pds cf 40 c 7 76 us pds cf 50 c 24 77 us pds cf 60 c 99 51 us pds cf 70 c 100 these results clearly demonstrate that pds was converted to sulfate radicals through activation by us and heat in which the latter may be generated through increased solution temperatures from heat dissipation 47 3 3 3 initial pds concentration the effect of bpa degradation on the initial pds concentration was evaluated fig 5 a shows that bpa degradation in the us pds system tended to increase with the initial pds concentration the bpa degradation in 30 min was 25 00 42 16 89 73 99 51 and 100 00 for pds concentrations of 1 71 3 42 8 56 13 69 and 17 11 mm respectively this degradation increased in the us pds cf system i e 1 71 mm 27 91 3 42 mm 50 24 8

7 excretion and improper disposal by the manufacturers are the main contributors most of the pharmaceuticals are found in the aquatic environment in its original or slightly modified form due to ineffective treatment in the wastewater treatment plants wwtps 8 9 diclofenac dcf is one of the extensively used analgesic antiarthritic and anti inflammatory non steroidal drugs nsaid although it is proven the fact that dcf can be removed by natural photolysis 10 11 yet it is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in water bodies such as groundwater 11 12 and surface water 13 14 at concentrations up to 1 2 μg dm 3 15 16 although its concentration detected in the water bodies has been found to be much lower than the effective concentration limit it was proven previously that dcf can exhibit acute toxicity to the organisms due to the cocktail effect in the presence of other pharmaceuticals 17 in addition there are evidences that the persistent exposure of dcf can affect the health of fish including the development of tumor and distortion of gills even at the lowest detected concentration i e 5 μg dm 3 18 the removal efficiencies of dcf in conventional biodegradable were found to be very low 20 40 in wwtps due to poor biodegradability and low sorption efficiency 19 frequent detection of dcf in aquatic environment and its acute toxicity towards the organisms necessitates an economic and efficient removal technique various removal processes based on physical or chemical methods including membrane filtration 20 adsorption 21 24 coagulation 25 ion exchange 26 activated sludge 27 28 and photocatalytic oxidation 29 30 have been extensively studied for the degradation of dcf in wastewater dcf was pointed out by water frame work directive in a list of 33 active chemicals which can be a possible threat to the aquatic environment in the next ten years 31 conventional wastewater treatment facilities are designed to eliminate bod biological oxygen demand pathogens and suspended solids mainly in recent years due to the conventional wastewater treatment methods inefficiency for removal of active organic compounds alternative and more efficient techniques such as advanced oxidation processes aops have been studied especially for pharmaceutical degradation photo fenton o3 o3 h2o2 catalytic ozonation and uv h2o2 are some of the proven tools for removing stubborn organic compounds from wastewater with a good mineralization efficiency ozone a strong oxidant can vitiate the refractory material into the biodegradable compounds which can be further eliminated in wwtps 32 34 complete mineralization was found to be expensive due to the extreme reaction conditions however in partial degradation more biodegradable and less toxic intermediates were formed which was the key to the removal of toxicity the potential of the aops for degradation of pharmaceuticals from wastewater has been well established in the previous studies 35 40 recently ozonation of dcf has been reported by many researchers 25 41 44 however only a limited extent of studies are available for the intermediates and the mechanism of degradation the present study aims to predict the degradation pathways of dcf during ozonation and detect the metabolites formed the effects of system ph ozone supply rate and initial concentration of the substrate were studied in detail the kinetic parameters for the ozonation of dcf were determined and a kinetic model was developed for the ozonation process involvement of the hydroxyl radicals in the degradation process was also investigated mass transfer of ozone in the aqueous phase was analyzed and the parameters for mass transfer were calculated for the toxicity analysis the seed germination technique was

concentrator model hg 03 make oz air country india and ozone generator model ism 10 oxy make oz air country india was used ozone concentrator uses the atmospheric air as feed and converts it into the pure oxygen 99 purity the oxygen concentrator works on the principle of pressure swing adsorption in which oxygen is isolated from air on the basis of its molecular properties and affinity towards the adsorbent oxygen generated from the oxygen concentrator was fed to the ozone generator in order to generate a gaseous mixture of ozone and oxygen the ozone generator works on the corona discharge method dielectric barrier discharge method 45 in which nascent oxygen is generated due to the voltage applied which combines with the oxygen molecule and generates ozone it consists of stainless steel electrode and quartz as dielectric and generates the ozone in the range of 0 2 78 mg s 1 the desired ozone supply can be controlled and regulated the ozone generated was fed to a 1 dm3 glass reactor with the help of a sparger which generated fine bubbles a syringe was installed into the reactor for sample collection unreacted ozone released from the reactor was converted into oxygen by an ozone destructor model dest 50 make oz air country india the schematic of the experimental setup is given in fig 1 2 3 ozonation and sample analysis ozonation of dcf was carried out in 1 dm3 glass reactor equipped with a sparger of pore size of 40 μm that was capable of generating fine bubbles 7 the reaction time was 10 60 min that varied with the ozonation system and the ph the ph of the aqueous solutions varied from 4 to 9 three different ozone supply rates i e 0 44 0 48 and 0 50 mg s 1 were applied for ozonation the samples were withdrawn after a certain time depending on the ozone supply rate all the experiments were repeated 3 4 times to ensure their repeatability the experiments were carried out at room temperature i e 298 k for ozone concentration measurement 10 cm3 of the sample was collected from the reactor and immediately analyzed in the colourimeter for quantification of dcf 5 cm3 of the sample was withdrawn from the reactor and quenched with bubbling nitrogen gas to remove the residual ozone then the sample was analyzed in the high pressure liquid chromatograph uv hplc uv model shimadzu make lc 20ad country japan equipped with a c18 column model xdb c18 make agilent country usa for quantitative analysis of dcf the dimensions of the column were 5 mm 4 6 mm 250 mm a mixture of 50 mol m 3 acetic acid and acetonitrile in the 30 70 volume ratio was used as the mobile phase with a sample injection volume of 20 10 3 μm3 the detection wavelength for dcf was 278 nm for mass spectrophotometry applied capillary and nozzle voltages were 3500 and 1000 v respectively gas and sheath gas flowrates were 13 and 11 dm3 min 1 respectively at nebulizer pressure of 2 4 bar the ozone concentration and chemical oxygen demand cod in the aqueous solution was measured by a colourimeter model 7100 make palintest country uk by using the dpd 4 tablets and cod reagents vials respectively the ph of the system was measured by a ph meter model eq 610 make

o i analytical country usa 2 4 mass transfer of ozone in the aqueous medium degradation of dcf is highly dependent on the ozone available in the aqueous phase availability of molecular ozone and generation of hydroxyl radicals is a function of mass transfer of ozone from the gas mixture to the aqueous phase to develop a better understanding of the behavior of ozone in water mass transfer of ozone was studied for different ozone supply rate and ph the ph of the system and ozone fed to the reactor plays an important role during the mass transfer phenomena it was recorded that the mass transfer and dissociation rates of ozone were higher in the alkaline medium than the acidic medium which is in agreement with the previous studies 46 47 the size of ozone bubble generated and its distribution affect the gas to liquid mass transfer the measurement of bubble size and its size distribution were performed in our previous study 7 the bubble generated from sparger was in the range of 0 044 0 45 mm and sauter mean diameter was 0 26 mm when ozone is in the liquid phase it simultaneously undergoes into the decomposition in a mixed batch reactor so the mass balance equation for ozone can be written as 1 d c o 3 dt k l a c o 3 c o 3 k d c o 3 where k d is the first order rate constant for decomposition and k l a is the volumetric mass transfer coefficient of ozone mass transfer resistance in the gas phase is negligible in comparison with the same in the liquid phase the equilibrium concentration of ozone in water can be written as 2 c s k l a k l a k d c o 3 from eqs 1 and 2 we get 3 d c o 3 dt k l a k d c s c o 3 upon integration of eq 3 with the initial condition at t 0 c o3 0 we get 4 ln c s c s c o 3 k l a k d t with continuous ozone supply the concentration of ozone in the aqueous phase was found to be constant after some time which can be considered as the saturation concentration of ozone the solubility profiles of ozone in water for different ozone supply rate are shown in fig 2 from the plot of ln c s c s c o 3 versus t the value of k d k l a can be determined from the slope as shown in fig 3 the values of k d at different ph were taken from a previous study 48 and the values of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient for ozone i e k l a were calculated by using them table 1 presents the values of k l a of ozone in water it was observed that k l a increased with the ph of the medium as well as the ozone supply to the reactor value of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient was increased by 2 5 folds when ph of the system was increased from 4 to 9 at the higher ph the decomposition rate constant of ozone was higher than that in the acidic medium as reported in a previous study 48 the value of the decomposition rate constant was increased from 2 5 to 13 3 when the ph was increased from 6 to 9 higher decomposition of ozone leads to the generation of hydroxyl radicals which enhances the degradation of dcf 2 5 uncertainty analysis the ozonation experiments were replicated 3 4 times the decreasing concentration of dcf during ozonation was estimated from the peaks obtained from hplc various factors i e instrumental human and environmental conditions led to the errors in the experiments during replication therefore it is essential to conduct an analysis of uncertainty on each data set the standard deviation sd of the data obtained was calculated from eq 5 5 sd 1 n c i c 2 n 1 where c i is the estimated value of the dcf concentration n is the number of replications of the experiments and c is the mean value of dcf concentration which can be calculated by 6 c 1 n i 1 n c i the standard value for uncertainty u and relative uncertainty u r are estimated from eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 u sd n 8 u r u c 100 the calculated values of the mean standard deviation and standard and relative uncertainty for the concentration of dcf are given in table 2 therefore it is observed that the relative uncertainty of data sets was in the range on 1 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph of the medium the oxidation of dcf was conducted in the ph range of 4 9 the results are shown in fig 4 a c the degradation efficiency was usually above 90 the ph of the solution had a strong effect on degradation effect of the ph on ozone lifetime and its decomposition rate were enunciated by von sonntag and von gunten 49 it has been reported that the lifetime of ozone decreases with increasing ph of the aqueous phase 50 this was also observed in the present study as at ph 9 the rate constant for decomposition was the highest see table 1 although ozone was short lived in the alkaline medium the time required to achieve 99 degradation was lesser than that in the acidic medium the increase in the rate of degradation of dcf with the ph of the medium suggests in situ generation of the hydroxyl radicals non selectivity and higher oxidizing power of the hydroxyl radicals make them a better oxidizing agent than molecular ozone for the oxidation of dcf the pseudo first order rate constant was increased by 32 when the ph was increased from 4 to 9 see fig 5 involvement of the hydroxyl radical in the oxidation of dcf was also confirmed by adding a catalyst and a scavenging agent for the hydroxyl radical see section 3 2 however system ph was found to be declining during the ozonation process due to generation of acidic metabolites and nox as reaction solutions were not buffered during the ozonation it was also reported in previous study that the during ozone generation nox production takes place due to electric discharge which also contributes into ph decline 51 3 2 effect of hydroxyl radical generation in situ h2o2 was added for the generation of hydroxyl radical and isopropyl alcohol was used for scavenging it fig 6 shows the effect of hydroxyl radicals present in the reaction system addition of isopropyl alcohol slowed down the reaction by consuming the hydroxyl radicals this led to a lower value of the reaction rate constant k app dropped from 0 4485 to 0 3947 min 1 when isopropyl alcohol at a concentration of 13 mol m 3 was added to the reaction medium addition of 42 mol m 3 h2o2 led to an increase in k app by 7 this variation in the rate constant confirmed the involvement of hydroxyl radicals in the degradation of dcf 3 3 effect of initial concentration of dcf to analyze the effect of loading of the target pollutant the concentration of dcf was varied in the range of 50 125 mg dm 3 at ph 9 for the ozone supply rate of 0 44 mg s 1 it was observed that the degradation efficiency of dcf dropped to 90 from 99 when the initial concentration of dcf was increased from 50 to 125 mg dm 3 see fig 7 these results indicate that the ozone demand increased as the initial concentration of dcf increased a lesser degradation efficiency at the higher concentration of the target pollutant suggests the unavailability of a sufficient amount of the oxidants i e molecular ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the aqueous phase for reacting with dcf to achieve a higher degree of removal of dcf an optimized ratio of ozone dose and dcf loading is required although the degradation efficiency for 125 mg dm 3 dcf was decreased by only 10 a low mineralization efficiency i e 9 was recorded for this system it implies that the intermediates formed during ozonation required a higher dose of the oxidant s for complete mineralization 3 4 effect of ozone supply rate ozonation of dcf was conducted at three different ozone supply rates i e 0 44 0 48 and 0 50 mg s 1 it was found that the removal of dcf was highly sensitive to the ozone supply rate a slight increase in the ozone supply rate led to a shorter reaction time for the removal dcf for all ozone supply rates complete removal of dcf was achieved however the time required for the removal showed significant differences when the ozone dose was increased by 0 04 mg s 1 the time required for complete removal of dcf was reduced to 15 min from 70 min when the ozone dose was increased further by 0 02 mg s 1 the reaction time was 6 10 min an identical behavior was observed for the ph range of 4 7 higher ozone supply rate led to the higher values of the apparent rate constant the increase in the rate constant with ozone supply can be described based on two film theory 52 according to which the higher concentration of ozone at the interface led to increase in the mass transfer coefficient however at a certain value of ozone supply the water will be saturated with ozone completely at this point ozone concentration in water will be constant and further increase in ozone dose will not affect the mass transfer after achieving the ozone saturation the degradation process would become dependent on the reaction rate constant hence a further increase in ozone dose does not affect the degradation efficiency the other major factor is enhanced hydroxyl radical production which takes part actively in the degradation process the effect of ozone supply rate on dcf degradation efficiency at different ph is shown in fig 8 3 5 production ammonia and chloride ion during dcf degradation fig 9 shows the concentration of ammonia and chloride ion detected in the reaction medium during the ozonation of dcf 88 of the total chlorine and 72 of the total nitrogen were released during the mineralization process in the first 25 min of the reaction the chloride concentration increased rapidly due to the probable substitution of chlorine by the oxygen containing groups after 25 min of reaction the concentration dropped slightly as some chloride ions reacted with the other metabolites and formed products such as dichloro aniline which is a major intermediate that was detected various chlorine containing intermediates were detected in the proposed mechanism see section 3 6 detection of ammonia reflects the loss of nitrogen atom in the structure of dcf the elimination of nitrogen is considered as an essential step in the mineralization process because it signifies the rupture of two aromatic rings although the final products did not contain nitrogen a loss of only 72 of the nitrogen illustrates the formation of intermediate nitrogen containing compounds which went undetected 3 6 mineralization toc and cod removal during ozonation fig 10a and b show toc and cod removal from dcf solution for various ozone supply maximum toc removal was 60 achieved at ozone supply of 0 50 mg s 1 for lower ozone supply 0 44 mg s 1 the toc removal was only 20 it indicates that at lower ozone supply recalcitrant intermediates were formed after 30 min of ozonation it can also be observed that at initial stage of ozonation 0 48 and 0 50 mg s 1 mineralization rate was higher due to availability of easily degradable parent compound behavior of cod removal also follows the same pattern as it was found to be maximum i e 80 for highest ozone supply 0 50 mg s 1 for lower ozone supply the cod removal 40 50 only direct ozonation of parent compound led to production of less degradable intermediates which can be partially removed by hydroxyl radicals and partial toc elimination and lower cod removal 53 54 3 7 identification of the intermediates and the mechanism proposed metabolites formed during the ozonation of dcf were identified in order to propose the probable degradation pathways it is important to find the final products and intermediates formed during ozonation to ensure the mineralization and toxicity for the identification study a separate experiment was conducted without altering the ph the ozone supply rate was 0 50 mg s 1 and the concentration of h2o2 was 42 mol m 3 for identification and detection of the intermediates hr lcms coupled with the library was used and the spectrum obtained is shown in fig 11 although the metabolites formed during oxidation depend on the technique applied for degradation the metabolites detected for sonolysis fenton and ozonation are common 41 55 56 during the reaction the solution turned to orange after 10 min which disappeared within 10 min it was found that the production of diclofenac 2 5 iminoquinone m3 was responsible for this color which also agrees with the recent studies 42 57 disappearance of m3 suggests its further degradation in the hr lcms spectrum total eight distinct peaks were visible out of which five peaks had low intensity the positive ion spectrum from the lc ms shows a peak at 9 93 min m z 312 for m h further fragmentation shows the loss of a water molecule m z 294 as m h2o both the mass spectroscopic results indicate the presence of 5 hydroxy dcf m2 5 hydroxy dcf is an unstable compound in the oxidative atmosphere it tends to be oxidized into dcf 2 5 iminoquinone which was also detected as a metabolite in the present study m2 may also produce the derivatives of phenyl acetic acid m7 and m11 m z 152 1 dcf 2 5 iminoquinone m3 was detected at rt 9 8 min m z 310 probable attack of ozone at the acetate group attached to the benzene ring may release a co2 molecule and oxidize the carbon attached to ring into the aldehyde group m1 m1 was converted to m4 i e n acetyl 2 amino salicylic acid m z 218 rt 7 58 min and 2 chloro benzoate i e m5 m z 177 rt 7 10 min at the advanced stages of oxidation further oxidation breaks the cn bond and produces various products containing one benzene ring cleavage of the cn bond leads to the generation of a major product i e dichloro aniline i e m6 m z 161 9 rt 7 024 min dichloro aniline was commonly found as a metabolite in the previous studies as well 56 further degradation of m6 produced 2 6 dichloro quinone i e m8 m z 178 4 amino 3 5 di chloro phenol m z 177 and 2 chloro aniline m z 127 after the cn cleavage ring opening reactions take place and generate smaller acids i e m13 m14 and m15 thus the ozonation of dcf involves the decarboxylation dechlorination and hydroxylation steps cleavage of the cn bond and opening of the benzene rings generated the compounds of lower molecular weight smaller carboxylic acids such as acetic acid formic acid and oxalic acid were produced at the final stage of ozonation which further mineralized to carbon dioxide and water dechlorination was also confirmed by the presence of chloride ion in the reaction medium fig 12 represents the probable mechanism for dcf ozonation 3 8 kinetic study of ozonation of dcf the reaction of the target pollutant with ozone is a function of various macroscopic parameters i e ozone supply rate pollutant loading and system ph availability of ozone in the aqueous phase depends on the extent of mass transfer of the ozone from the gas to the liquid phase the ph of the system also plays a vital role in ozone dissociation and mass transfer as described in details in section 2 4 thus the kinetics of the dcf degradation reaction was studied under different operating parameters dependence of the pseudo first order rate constant on the operational parameters was also studied since it is an established fact that both molecular ozone and hydroxyl radical act as the oxidants the rate of oxidation of dcf can be written as 9 d dcf dt k o 3 dcf o 3 k o h dcf o h where dcf oh and o3 denote the concentration of diclofenac hydroxyl radical and ozone respectively at time t k o3and k oh are the rate constants for the reactions involving ozone and hydroxyl radical respectively eq 9 can be simplified to eq 10 by considering the reaction as pseudo first order 10 d dcf dt k o 3 o 3 k o h o h dcf 11 d dcf dt k app dcf upon integration we get 12 ln dcf dcf 0 k app t the value of k app can be determined from the slope of the plot of ln dcf dcf 0 versus t the experimental data for the ozonation of dcf fitted eq 12 well for different operating conditions the coefficient of determination was greater than 0 93 therefore it can be concluded that the degradation of dcf by ozone and hydroxyl radical follows the pseudo first order kinetics the values of k app for dcf degradation were in the range of 0 0742 0 48 min 1 the highest value of k app was found to be 0 48 min 1 at the ozone supply rate of 0 50 mg s 1 and ph 9 degradation of dcf by ozone is a complex process that involves various direct and indirect parameters due to the unstable nature of the ozone and the constraints encountered during the measurement of hydroxyl radicals in the reaction medium the ozone supply was considered an independent variable system ph ozone dosage and the initial concentration of dcf were considered as the main affecting parameters for k app 58 the nature of dependency of all three parameters was estimated and an empirical model was developed for k app this model is given as 13 k app a exp e a rt q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r a ph b where q o3 is the ozone supply rate mg s 1 to the system dcf 0 is the initial concentration of dcf mg dm 3 and e a rt was considered as a constant since all experiments were performed at 298 k after taking logarithm on both sides 14 ln k app ln a a ln q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r b ln ph where a a exp e a rt values of a and b were calculated by performing the multiple regression analysis between ln k app q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r and ln ph from the multiple regression the values of a and b were estimated as 0 59 and 0 35 with r2 0 922 respectively value of lna was found to be 5 16 therefore eq 13 can be further written as 15 k app 5 71 10 3 q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r 0 59 ph 0 35 final equation for the dcf degradation can be written as 16 dcf dcf 0 exp 5 71 10 3 q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r 0 59 ph 0 35 t in order to verify the developed model the theoretical data were calculated with the help of model and compared with experimental data it was found that the relative error for model was 7 therefore the developed kinetic model for dcf degradation was considered accurate for the operating parameters i e ozone supply of 0 44 0 50 mg s 1 system ph of 4 9 and initial concentration of dcf 50 125 mg dm 3 3 9 effect of water matrix on the degradation of dcf to analyze the effect of water matrix a separate experiment was conducted with a real wastewater cod 50 55 mg dm 3 spiked with dcf and compared with the degradation efficiency achieved in ultra pure water cod 0 mg dm 3 and electrical resistivity 0 0055 μs cm 1 one run was conducted with a lower concentration of dcf based on the dcf concentrations present in the water bodies 59 61 the effect of water matrix on the removal efficiency and mineralization is shown in fig 13 it was observed that the organic and inorganic materials present in the real wastewater inhibit the ozonation of dcf to some extent the removal efficiency was dropped by 17 when the ozonation was conducted in wastewater instead of ultrapure water although the removal efficiency was lower 83 removal of dcf was achieved in 60 min of the reaction it can be concluded that the substances present in the wastewater competed with dcf for consuming the oxidant present in the solution therefore the availability of ozone and hydroxyl radical to dcf was decreased and hence a reduced removal rate was observed it can be anticipated that the presence of other contaminants inhibits the degradation process so the removal efficiency achieved in the case of ultra pure water cannot be achieved in the real wastewater 3 10 energy consumption to implement the ozonation process at the industrial level it is very important to analyze and minimize the cost of the process in the present study the main contributor to the operating cost was energy consumption the fixed cost involves the cost of the machinery the operating cost involves the cost of energy used inasmuch as there is no chemical consumption the operating cost is discussed in this section 17 operation cost α q where q and α are the energy consumption rate and the cost of electricity respectively the electricity consumed by the ozone generator is directly proportional to the ozone supply rate the experiments were conducted at three different ozone supply rates for the ozone supply rates of 0 44 and 0 5 mg s 1 the energy consumption rates are 32 6 and 37 w respectively according to the specifications provided by the equipment manufacturer the required reaction times for the complete removal of dcf were 60 and 10 min respectively for these ozone supply rates the total energy consumed and the associated cost are given in table 3 based on the present cost of electricity i e inr 9 45 per kwh from these calculations it is evident that the process was more economical at the ozone supply rate of 0 50 mg s 1 than 0 48 mg s 1 due to the lower reaction time the cost of the process was decreased by 19 when the ozone supply rate was higher by 1 13 the lowest cost for processing 1 dm3 dcf solution was usd 0 80 at the ozone supply rate of 0 5 mg s 1 4 conclusions ozonation was found to be a very effective method for removing dcf from water the removal efficiency was in the range of 95 99 in the alkaline as well as acidic media however the reaction time required for complete removal of dcf was less in the alkaline medium the values of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient were in the range of 1 150 103 2 717 103 s 1 for ph 6 9 and ozone supply rate of 0 44 0 5 mg s 1 the values of the pseudo first order rate constant were in range of 0 0742 0 0979 min 1 the results also confirmed the active participation of the hydroxyl radicals in the degradation process the rate constant dropped by 11 when 13 mmol dm 3 ipa was added as the radical scavenger the rate of ozone supply to the reactor was proved to be a key factor for the degradation time an increase of 0 06 mg s 1 in the ozone supply rate led to a rapid fall in the reaction time i e from 60 min to 6 min 88 of the total chlorine and 72 of the total nitrogen were released during the degradation process the final model for dcf ozonation developed was dcf dcf 0 exp 5 71 10 3 q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r 0 59 ph 0 35 t in which the effect of system ph initial concentration of dcf and ozone supply rate were considered as the main variables with a real effluent having 50 mg dm 3 cod the removal efficiency was dropped by 17 the mineralization of dcf by ozone mainly consisted of three steps i e attack of the oxidant cleavage of the cn bond and ring opening the major intermediates detected in hr lcms were di chloro aniline 5 hydroxy dcf dcf 2 5 iminoquinone 2 chloro benzoate derivatives of phenyl acetic acid and carboxylic acids e g acetic formic and oxalic acids the main mechanism involved in the degradation

13232,diclofenac dcf a non steroidal analgesic drug has been recurrently detected in surface and groundwater during the past two decades traces of dcf pass through the conventional wastewater treatment facilities without any alteration due to its resistance and high stability this study aims the complete degradation and partial mineralization of dcf by an ozonation process the findings of the study suggest that increasing ph of the system and ozone supply rate and generation of hydroxyl radicals in situ enhance the degradation process in contrast the increasing initial concentration of dcf slows down the process the pseudo first order reaction rate constants were in the range of 0 0742 0 0979 min 1 a model has been developed to predict the behavior of the rate constant with various operating variables high volumetric mass transfer coefficients i e 1 150 2 717 103 s 1 was observed during the mass transfer study of ozone in water a probable mechanism for ozonation is suggested

ineffective treatment in the wastewater treatment plants wwtps 8 9 diclofenac dcf is one of the extensively used analgesic antiarthritic and anti inflammatory non steroidal drugs nsaid although it is

concentrations up to 1 2 μg dm 3 15 16 although its concentration detected in the water bodies has been found to be much lower than the effective concentration limit it was proven previously that dcf can exhibit acute toxicity to the organisms due to the cocktail effect in the presence of other pharmaceuticals 17 in addition there are evidences that the persistent exposure of dcf can affect the health of fish including the development of tumor and distortion of gills even at the lowest detected concentration i e 5 μg dm 3 18 the removal efficiencies of dcf in conventional biodegradable were found to be very low 20 40 in wwtps due to poor biodegradability and low sorption efficiency 19 frequent detection of dcf in aquatic environment and its acute toxicity towards the organisms necessitates an economic and efficient removal technique various removal processes based on physical or chemical methods including membrane filtration 20 adsorption 21 24 coagulation 25 ion exchange 26 activated sludge 27 28 and photocatalytic oxidation 29 30 have been extensively studied for the degradation of dcf in wastewater dcf was pointed out by water frame work directive in a list of 33 active chemicals which can be a possible threat to the aquatic environment in the next ten years 31 conventional wastewater treatment facilities are designed to eliminate bod biological oxygen demand pathogens and suspended solids mainly in recent years due to the conventional wastewater treatment methods inefficiency for removal of active organic compounds alternative and more efficient techniques such as advanced oxidation processes aops have been studied especially for pharmaceutical degradation photo fenton o3 o3 h2o2 catalytic ozonation and uv h2o2 are some of the proven tools for removing stubborn organic compounds from wastewater with a good mineralization efficiency ozone a strong oxidant can vitiate the refractory material into the biodegradable compounds which can be further eliminated in wwtps 32 34 complete mineralization was found to be expensive due to the extreme reaction conditions however in partial degradation more biodegradable and less toxic intermediates were formed which was the key to the removal of toxicity the potential of the aops for degradation of pharmaceuticals from wastewater has been well established in the previous studies 35 40 recently ozonation of dcf has been reported by many researchers 25 41 44 however only a limited extent of studies are available for the intermediates and the mechanism of degradation the present study aims to predict the degradation pathways of dcf during ozonation and detect the metabolites formed the effects of system ph ozone supply rate and initial concentration of the substrate were studied in detail the kinetic parameters for the ozonation of dcf were determined and a kinetic model was developed for the ozonation process involvement of the hydroxyl radicals in the degradation process was also investigated mass transfer of ozone in the aqueous phase was analyzed and the parameters for mass transfer were calculated for the toxicity analysis the seed germination technique was used removal of total organic carbon toc and release of chloride ion during the reaction was also studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and standards the reagents and chemicals used in this

concentrator model hg 03 make oz air country india and ozone generator model ism 10 oxy make oz air country india was used ozone concentrator uses the atmospheric air as feed and converts it into the pure oxygen 99 purity the oxygen concentrator works on the principle of pressure swing adsorption in which oxygen is isolated from air on the basis of its molecular properties and affinity towards the adsorbent oxygen generated from the oxygen concentrator was fed to the ozone generator in order to generate a gaseous mixture of ozone and oxygen the ozone generator works on the corona discharge method dielectric barrier discharge method 45 in which nascent oxygen is generated due to the voltage applied which combines with the oxygen molecule and generates ozone it consists of stainless steel electrode and quartz as dielectric and generates the ozone in the range of 0 2 78 mg s 1 the desired ozone supply can be controlled and regulated the ozone generated was fed to a 1 dm3 glass reactor with the help of a sparger which generated fine bubbles a syringe was installed into the reactor for sample collection unreacted ozone released from the reactor was converted into oxygen by an ozone destructor model dest 50 make oz air country india the schematic of the experimental setup is given in fig 1 2 3 ozonation and sample analysis ozonation of dcf was carried out in 1 dm3 glass reactor equipped with a sparger of pore size of 40 μm that was capable of generating fine bubbles 7 the reaction time was 10 60 min that varied with the ozonation system and the ph the ph of the aqueous solutions varied from 4 to 9 three different ozone supply rates i e 0 44 0 48 and 0 50 mg s 1 were applied for ozonation the samples were withdrawn after a certain time depending on the ozone supply rate all the experiments were repeated 3 4 times to ensure their repeatability the experiments were carried out at room temperature i e 298 k for ozone concentration measurement 10 cm3 of the sample was collected from the reactor and immediately analyzed in the colourimeter for quantification of dcf 5 cm3 of the sample was withdrawn from the reactor and quenched with bubbling nitrogen gas to remove the residual ozone then the sample was analyzed in the high pressure liquid chromatograph uv hplc uv model shimadzu make lc 20ad country japan equipped with a c18 column model xdb c18 make agilent country usa for quantitative analysis of dcf the dimensions of the column were 5 mm 4 6 mm 250 mm a mixture of 50 mol m 3 acetic acid and acetonitrile in the 30 70 volume ratio was used as the mobile phase with a sample injection volume of 20 10 3 μm3 the detection wavelength for dcf was 278 nm for mass spectrophotometry applied capillary and nozzle voltages were 3500 and 1000 v respectively gas and sheath gas flowrates were 13 and 11 dm3 min 1 respectively at nebulizer pressure of 2 4 bar the ozone concentration and chemical oxygen demand cod in the aqueous solution was

o i analytical country usa 2 4 mass transfer of ozone in the aqueous medium degradation of dcf is highly dependent on the ozone available in the aqueous phase availability of molecular ozone and generation of hydroxyl radicals is a function of mass transfer of ozone from the gas mixture to the aqueous phase to develop a better understanding of the behavior of ozone in water mass transfer of ozone was studied for different ozone supply rate and ph the ph of the system and ozone fed to the reactor plays an important role during the mass transfer phenomena it was recorded that the mass transfer and dissociation rates of ozone were higher in the alkaline medium than the acidic medium which is in agreement with the previous studies 46 47 the size of ozone bubble generated and its distribution affect the gas to liquid mass transfer the measurement of bubble size and its size distribution were performed in our previous study 7 the bubble generated from sparger was in the range of 0 044 0 45 mm and sauter mean diameter was 0 26 mm when ozone is in the liquid phase it simultaneously undergoes into the decomposition in a mixed batch reactor so the mass balance equation for ozone can be written as 1 d c o 3 dt k l a c o 3 c o 3 k d c o 3 where k d is the first order rate constant for decomposition and k l a is the volumetric mass transfer coefficient of ozone mass transfer resistance in the gas phase is negligible in comparison with the same in the liquid phase the equilibrium concentration of ozone in water can be written as 2 c s k l a k l a k d c o 3 from eqs 1 and 2 we get 3 d c o 3 dt k l a k d c s c o 3 upon integration of eq 3 with the initial condition at t 0 c o3 0 we get 4 ln c s c s c o 3 k l a k d t with continuous ozone supply the concentration of ozone in the aqueous phase was found to be constant after some time which can be considered as the saturation concentration of ozone the solubility profiles of ozone in water for different ozone supply rate are shown in fig 2 from the plot of ln c s c s c o 3 versus t the value of k d k l a can be determined from the slope as shown in fig 3 the values of k d at different ph were taken from a previous study 48 and the values of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient for ozone i e k l a were calculated by using them table 1 presents the values of k l a of ozone in water it was observed that k l a increased with the ph of the medium as well as the ozone supply to the reactor value of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient was increased by 2 5 folds when ph of the system was increased from 4 to 9 at the higher ph the decomposition rate constant of ozone was higher than that in the acidic medium as reported in a previous study 48 the value of the decomposition rate constant was increased from 2 5 to 13 3 when the ph was increased from 6 to 9 higher decomposition of ozone leads to the generation of hydroxyl radicals which enhances the degradation of dcf 2 5 uncertainty analysis the ozonation experiments were replicated 3 4 times the decreasing concentration of dcf during ozonation was estimated from the peaks obtained from hplc various factors i e instrumental human and environmental conditions led to the errors in the experiments during replication therefore it is essential to conduct an analysis of uncertainty on each data set the standard deviation sd of the data obtained was calculated from eq 5 5 sd 1 n c i c 2 n 1 where c i is the estimated value of the dcf concentration n is the number of replications of the experiments and c is the mean value of dcf concentration which can be calculated by 6 c 1 n i 1 n c i the standard value for uncertainty u and relative uncertainty u r are estimated from eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 u sd n 8 u r u c 100 the calculated values of the mean standard deviation and standard and relative uncertainty for the concentration of dcf are given in table 2 therefore it is observed that the relative uncertainty of data sets was in the range on 1 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph of the medium the oxidation of dcf was conducted in the ph range of 4 9 the results are shown in fig 4 a c the degradation efficiency was usually above 90 the ph of the solution had a strong effect on degradation effect of the ph on ozone lifetime and its decomposition rate were enunciated by von sonntag and von gunten 49 it has been reported that the lifetime of ozone decreases with increasing ph of the aqueous phase 50 this was also observed in the present study as at ph 9 the rate constant for decomposition was the highest see table 1 although ozone was short lived in the alkaline medium the time required to achieve 99 degradation was lesser than that in the acidic medium the increase in the rate of degradation of dcf with the ph of the medium suggests in situ generation of the hydroxyl radicals non selectivity and higher oxidizing power of the hydroxyl radicals make them a better oxidizing agent than molecular ozone for the oxidation of dcf the pseudo first order rate constant was increased by 32 when the ph was increased from 4 to 9 see fig 5 involvement of the hydroxyl radical in the oxidation of dcf was also confirmed by adding a catalyst and a scavenging agent for the hydroxyl radical see section 3 2 however system ph was found to be declining during the ozonation process due to generation of acidic metabolites and nox as reaction solutions were not buffered during the ozonation it was also reported in previous study that the during ozone generation nox production takes place due to electric discharge which also contributes into ph decline 51 3 2 effect of hydroxyl radical generation in situ h2o2 was added for the generation of hydroxyl radical and isopropyl alcohol was used for scavenging it fig 6 shows the effect of hydroxyl radicals present in the reaction system addition of isopropyl alcohol slowed down the reaction by consuming the hydroxyl radicals this led to a lower value of the reaction rate constant k app dropped from 0 4485 to 0 3947 min 1 when isopropyl alcohol at a concentration of 13 mol m 3 was added to the reaction medium addition of 42 mol m 3 h2o2 led to an increase in k app by 7 this variation in the rate constant confirmed the involvement of hydroxyl radicals in the degradation of dcf 3 3 effect of initial concentration of dcf to analyze the effect of loading of the target pollutant the concentration of dcf was varied in the range of 50 125 mg dm 3 at ph 9 for the ozone supply rate of 0 44 mg s 1 it was observed that the degradation efficiency of dcf dropped to 90 from 99 when the initial concentration of dcf was increased from 50 to 125 mg dm 3 see fig 7 these results indicate that the ozone demand increased as the initial concentration of dcf increased a lesser degradation efficiency at the higher concentration of the target pollutant suggests the unavailability of a sufficient amount of the oxidants i e molecular ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the aqueous phase for reacting with dcf to achieve a higher degree of removal of dcf an optimized ratio of ozone dose and dcf loading is required although the degradation efficiency for 125 mg dm 3 dcf was decreased by only 10 a low mineralization efficiency i e 9 was recorded for this system it implies that the intermediates formed during ozonation required a higher dose of the oxidant s for complete mineralization 3 4 effect of ozone supply rate ozonation of dcf was conducted at three different ozone supply rates i e 0 44 0 48 and 0 50 mg s 1 it was found that the removal of dcf was highly sensitive to the ozone supply rate a slight increase in the ozone supply rate led to a shorter reaction time for the removal dcf for all ozone supply rates complete removal of dcf was achieved however the time required for the removal showed significant differences when the ozone dose was increased by 0 04 mg s 1 the time required for complete removal of dcf was reduced to 15 min from 70 min when the ozone dose was increased further by 0 02 mg s 1 the reaction time was 6 10 min an identical behavior was observed for the ph range of 4 7 higher ozone supply rate led to the higher values of the apparent rate constant the increase in the rate constant with ozone supply can be described based on two film theory 52 according to which the higher concentration of ozone at the interface led to increase in the mass transfer coefficient however at a certain value of ozone supply the water will be saturated with ozone completely at this point ozone concentration in water will be constant and further increase in ozone dose will not affect the mass transfer after achieving the ozone saturation the degradation process would become dependent on the reaction rate constant hence a further increase in ozone dose does not affect the degradation efficiency the other major factor is enhanced hydroxyl radical production which takes part actively in the degradation process the effect of ozone supply rate on dcf degradation efficiency at different ph is shown in fig 8 3 5 production ammonia and chloride ion during dcf degradation fig 9 shows the concentration of ammonia and chloride ion detected in the reaction medium during the ozonation of dcf 88 of the total chlorine and 72 of the total nitrogen were released during the mineralization process in the first 25 min of the reaction the chloride concentration increased rapidly due to the probable substitution of chlorine by the oxygen containing groups after 25 min of reaction the concentration dropped slightly as some chloride ions reacted with the other metabolites and formed products such as dichloro aniline which is a major intermediate that was detected various chlorine containing intermediates were detected in the proposed mechanism see section 3 6 detection of ammonia reflects the loss of nitrogen atom in the structure of dcf the elimination of nitrogen is considered as an essential step in the mineralization process because it signifies the rupture of two aromatic rings although the final products did not contain nitrogen a loss of only 72 of the nitrogen illustrates the formation of intermediate nitrogen containing compounds which went undetected 3 6 mineralization toc and cod removal during ozonation fig 10a and b show toc and cod removal from dcf solution for various ozone supply maximum toc removal was 60 achieved at ozone supply of 0 50 mg s 1 for lower ozone supply 0 44 mg s 1 the toc removal was only 20 it indicates that at lower ozone supply recalcitrant intermediates were formed after 30 min of ozonation it can also be observed that at initial stage of ozonation 0 48 and 0 50 mg s 1 mineralization rate was higher due to availability of easily degradable parent compound behavior of cod removal also follows the same pattern as it was found to be maximum i e 80 for highest ozone supply 0 50 mg s 1 for lower ozone supply the cod removal 40 50 only direct ozonation of parent compound led to production of less degradable intermediates which can be partially removed by hydroxyl radicals and partial toc elimination and lower cod removal 53 54 3 7 identification of the intermediates and the mechanism proposed metabolites formed during the ozonation of dcf were identified in order to propose the probable degradation pathways it is important to find the final products and intermediates formed during ozonation to ensure the mineralization and toxicity for the identification study a separate experiment was conducted without altering the ph the ozone supply rate was 0 50 mg s 1 and the concentration of h2o2 was 42 mol m 3 for identification and detection of the intermediates hr lcms coupled with the library was used and the spectrum obtained is shown in fig 11 although the metabolites formed during oxidation depend on the technique applied for degradation the metabolites detected for sonolysis fenton and ozonation are common 41 55 56 during the reaction the solution turned to orange after 10 min which disappeared within 10 min it was found that the production of diclofenac 2 5 iminoquinone m3 was responsible for this color which also agrees with the recent studies 42 57 disappearance of m3 suggests its further degradation in the hr lcms spectrum total eight distinct peaks were visible out of which five peaks had low intensity the positive ion spectrum from the lc ms shows a peak at 9 93 min m z 312 for m h further fragmentation shows the loss of a water molecule m z 294 as m h2o both the mass spectroscopic results indicate the presence of 5 hydroxy dcf m2 5 hydroxy dcf is an unstable compound in the oxidative atmosphere it tends to be oxidized into dcf 2 5 iminoquinone which was also detected as a metabolite in the present study m2 may also produce the derivatives of phenyl acetic acid m7 and m11 m z 152 1 dcf 2 5 iminoquinone m3 was detected at rt 9 8 min m z 310 probable attack of ozone at the acetate group attached to the benzene ring may release a co2 molecule and oxidize the carbon attached to ring into the aldehyde group m1 m1 was converted to m4 i e n acetyl 2 amino salicylic acid m z 218 rt 7 58 min and 2 chloro benzoate i e m5 m z 177 rt 7 10 min at the advanced stages of oxidation further oxidation breaks the cn bond and produces various products containing one benzene ring cleavage of the cn bond leads to the generation of a major product i e dichloro aniline i e m6 m z 161 9 rt 7 024 min dichloro aniline was commonly found as a metabolite in the previous studies as well 56 further degradation of m6 produced 2 6 dichloro quinone i e m8 m z 178 4 amino 3 5 di chloro phenol m z 177 and 2 chloro aniline m z 127 after the cn cleavage ring opening reactions take place and generate smaller acids i e m13 m14 and m15 thus the ozonation of dcf involves the decarboxylation dechlorination and hydroxylation steps cleavage of the cn bond and opening of the benzene rings generated the compounds of lower molecular weight smaller carboxylic acids such as acetic acid formic acid and oxalic acid were produced at the final stage of ozonation which further mineralized to carbon dioxide and water dechlorination was also confirmed by the presence of chloride ion in the reaction medium fig 12 represents the probable mechanism for dcf ozonation 3 8 kinetic study of ozonation of dcf the reaction of the target pollutant with ozone is a function of various macroscopic parameters i e ozone supply rate pollutant loading and system ph availability of ozone in the aqueous phase depends on the extent of mass transfer of the ozone from the gas to the liquid phase the ph of the system also plays a vital role in ozone dissociation and mass transfer as described in details in section 2 4 thus the kinetics of the dcf degradation reaction was studied under different operating parameters dependence of the pseudo first order rate constant on the operational parameters was also studied since it is an established fact that both molecular ozone and hydroxyl radical act as the oxidants the rate of oxidation of dcf can be written as 9 d dcf dt k o 3 dcf o 3 k o h dcf o h where dcf oh and o3 denote the concentration of diclofenac hydroxyl radical and ozone respectively at time t k o3and k oh are the rate constants for the reactions involving ozone and hydroxyl radical respectively eq 9 can be simplified to eq 10 by considering the reaction as pseudo first order 10 d dcf dt k o 3 o 3 k o h o h dcf 11 d dcf dt k app dcf upon integration we get 12 ln dcf dcf 0 k app t the value of k app can be determined from the slope of the plot of ln dcf dcf 0 versus t the experimental data for the ozonation of dcf fitted eq 12 well for different operating conditions the coefficient of determination was greater than 0 93 therefore it can be concluded that the degradation of dcf by ozone and hydroxyl radical follows the pseudo first order kinetics the values of k app for dcf degradation were in the range of 0 0742 0 48 min 1 the highest value of k app was found to be 0 48 min 1 at the ozone supply rate of 0 50 mg s 1 and ph 9 degradation of dcf by ozone is a complex process that involves various direct and indirect parameters due to the unstable nature of the ozone and the constraints encountered during the measurement of hydroxyl radicals in the reaction medium the ozone supply was considered an independent variable system ph ozone dosage and the initial concentration of dcf were considered as the main affecting parameters for k app 58 the nature of dependency of all three parameters was estimated and an empirical model was developed for k app this model is given as 13 k app a exp e a rt q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r a ph b where q o3 is the ozone supply rate mg s 1 to the system dcf 0 is the initial concentration of dcf mg dm 3 and e a rt was considered as a constant since all experiments were performed at 298 k after taking logarithm on both sides 14 ln k app ln a a ln q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r b ln ph where a a exp e a rt values of a and b were calculated by performing the multiple regression analysis between ln k app q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r and ln ph from the multiple regression the values of a and b were estimated as 0 59 and 0 35 with r2 0 922 respectively value of lna was found to be 5 16 therefore eq 13 can be further written as 15 k app 5 71 10 3 q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r 0 59 ph 0 35 final equation for the dcf degradation can be written as 16 dcf dcf 0 exp 5 71 10 3 q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r 0 59 ph 0 35 t in order to verify the developed model the theoretical data were calculated with the help of model and compared with experimental data it was found that the relative error for model was 7 therefore the developed kinetic model for dcf degradation was considered accurate for the operating parameters i e ozone supply of 0 44 0 50 mg s 1 system ph of 4 9 and initial concentration of dcf 50 125 mg dm 3 3 9 effect of water matrix on the degradation of dcf to analyze the effect of water matrix a separate experiment was conducted with a real wastewater cod 50 55 mg dm 3 spiked with dcf and compared with the degradation efficiency achieved in ultra pure water cod 0 mg dm 3 and electrical resistivity 0 0055 μs cm 1 one run was conducted with a lower concentration of dcf based on the dcf concentrations present in the water bodies 59 61 the effect of water matrix on the removal efficiency and mineralization is shown in fig 13 it was observed that the organic and inorganic materials present in the real wastewater inhibit the ozonation of dcf to some extent the removal efficiency was dropped by 17 when the ozonation was conducted in wastewater instead of ultrapure water although the removal efficiency was lower 83 removal of dcf was achieved in 60 min of the reaction it can be concluded that the substances present in the wastewater competed with dcf for consuming the oxidant present in the solution therefore the availability of ozone and hydroxyl radical to dcf was decreased and hence a reduced removal rate was observed it can be anticipated that the presence of other contaminants inhibits the degradation process so the removal efficiency achieved in the case of ultra pure water cannot be achieved in the real wastewater 3 10 energy consumption to implement the ozonation process at the industrial level it is very important to analyze and minimize the cost of the process in the present study the main contributor to the operating cost was energy consumption the fixed cost involves the cost of the machinery the operating cost involves the cost of energy used inasmuch as there is no chemical consumption the operating cost is discussed in this section 17 operation cost α q where q and α are the energy consumption rate and the cost of electricity respectively the electricity consumed by the ozone generator is directly proportional to the ozone supply rate the experiments were conducted at three different ozone supply rates for the ozone supply rates of 0 44 and 0 5 mg s 1 the energy consumption rates are 32 6 and 37 w respectively according to the specifications provided by the equipment manufacturer the required reaction times for the complete removal of dcf were 60 and 10 min respectively for these ozone supply rates the total energy consumed and the associated cost are given in table 3 based on the present cost of electricity i e inr 9 45 per kwh from these calculations it is evident that the process was more economical at the ozone supply rate of 0 50 mg s 1 than 0 48 mg s 1 due to the lower reaction time the cost of the process was decreased by 19 when the ozone supply rate was higher by 1 13 the lowest cost for processing 1 dm3 dcf solution was usd 0 80 at the ozone supply rate of 0 5 mg s 1 4 conclusions ozonation was found to be a very effective method for removing dcf from water the removal efficiency was in the range of 95 99 in the alkaline as well as acidic media however the reaction time required for complete removal of dcf was less in the alkaline medium the values of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient were in the range of 1 150 103 2 717 103 s 1 for ph 6 9 and ozone supply rate of 0 44 0 5 mg s 1 the values of the pseudo first order rate constant were in range of 0 0742 0 0979 min 1 the results also confirmed the active participation of the hydroxyl radicals in the degradation process the rate constant dropped by 11 when 13 mmol dm 3 ipa was added as the radical scavenger the rate of ozone supply to the reactor was proved to be a key factor for the degradation time an increase of 0 06 mg s 1 in the ozone supply rate led to a rapid fall in the reaction time i e from 60 min to 6 min 88 of the total chlorine and 72 of the total nitrogen were released during the degradation process the final model for dcf ozonation developed was dcf dcf 0 exp 5 71 10 3 q o 3 t r dcf 0 v r 0 59 ph 0 35 t in which the effect of system ph initial concentration of dcf and ozone supply rate were considered as the main variables with a real effluent having 50 mg dm 3 cod the removal efficiency was dropped by 17 the mineralization of dcf by ozone mainly consisted of three steps i e attack of the oxidant cleavage of the cn bond and ring opening the major intermediates detected in hr lcms were di chloro aniline 5 hydroxy dcf dcf 2 5 iminoquinone 2 chloro benzoate derivatives of phenyl acetic acid and carboxylic acids e g acetic formic and oxalic acids the main mechanism involved in the degradation

13233,anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is considered an important alternative biogas source while efficiently purifying sewage improving the methane ch4 content in the anmbr biogas in a cost effective way is closely related to its future availability in the study a novel system was proposed for in situ biogas upgrading using anmbr effluent the system achieves the dual goals of bioenergy recovery from sewage and biogas upgrading biogas upgrading results showed that the ch4 content in upgraded biogas was 90 3 at biogas flow of 0 36 l h effluent flow of 2 88 l h and normal temperature and pressure the mechanism analysis showed that efficient upgrading with anmbr effluent depended on sufficiency alkali products and less n2 and o2 meanwhile conversion efficiency of chemical oxygen demand cod to ch4 of anmbr was 78 5 under hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h and organic load rate of 1 2 g cod l d the novel system provides a new solution for cost effective in situ biogas upgrading using anmbr effluent by integration of anmbr with scrubbing column graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biogas upgrading bioenergy recovery anaerobic membrane bioreactor scrubbing column in situ 1 introduction biogas is the product of anaerobic digestion ad mainly composed of methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 1 as a renewable energy biogas has the potential to replace fossil fuels as an important part of the energy system by 2016 biogas electricity has a share of about 4 in global heat generation 2 however co2 in biogas reduces the low calorific value and increases transportation cost 3 for example the low calorific value of biogas containing 94 ch4 is 38 5 mj m3 while the low calorific value of biogas containing ch4 in the range of 60 65 is 20 25 mj m3 4 removing co2 to increase ch4 is the crucial to efficient utilization of biogas many biogas upgrading methods including water scrubbing chemical adsorption membrane separation low temperature separation and pressure swing adsorption have been proposed 5 among all these methods water scrubbing is the most widely applied because it is the simplest and cheapest one 1 generally a pressurized flow of biogas is injected into the bottom of scrubber column and a stream of water is provided from the top of the column to encounter the biogas flow 6 utilization of solubility difference between ch4 and co2 in water to achieve the purpose of biogas upgrading in order to improve efficient contact area between biogas and water the scrubber column is filled with random packing 7 additional regeneration unit is applied to strip off co2 for reusing the scrubbing water in water scrubbing process the addition of packing leads to scrubbing column blockage and the pressurized of biogas and regeneration unit increase the energy consumption and cost of upgrading biogas in addition other impurities gas including nitrogen n2 and oxygen o2 are introduced into upgraded biogas by water scrubbing leading to inefficient biogas upgrading performance furthermore the transportation cost of the ex situ biogas upgrading process increases with the distance between the anaerobic digestion plant and biogas upgrading plant anaerobic digestion technology is promising sewages process that converts organics to ch4 and co2 via microbial consortium under anaerobic environment and has the advantages of low energy consumption high organic loading rate and low sludge production 8 anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr which combines ad process and membrane filtration technology has the advantages of bioenergy recovery separation of sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt high ch4 conversion efficiency 9 10 sufficient alkali products are needed to neutralize the carbon acid formed by dissolution of co2 to provide a suitable environment for methanogens in anmbr 9 as a results there are still many alkali products in anmbr effluent such as nh3 hco3 co3 2 etc to absorb co2 of biogas in addition there are microorganisms in the anmbr to consume o2 in sewage to meet the strict anaerobic condition of methanogens during the operation of anmbr membrane fouling is alleviated by recirculating biogas to scour membrane surface which also lead to n2 and o2 escaping from sewage in particular anmbr ensures stability of excellent effluent quality to summarise anmbr effluent has potential to be a new solution for cost effective biogas upgraded in this study a novel system for scrubbing biogas using the anmbr effluent was proposed the performance of anmbr and biogas upgrading was studied respectively in addition the mechanism of biogas upgrading was analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the schematic diagram of the experimental setup was shown in fig 1 the experimental setup was composed of anmbr and biogas upgrading unit and the two parts were combined by a water storage anmbr biogas was replaced by synthetic biogas 60 ch4 40 co2 to simulate the anmbr biogas in situ upgraded by anmbr effluent anmbr was operated with a working liquid volume of 2 5 l hrt of 8 h organic load rate olr of 1 2 g chemical oxygen demand cod l d flux of 8 675 l m2 h the volatile solid suspension of seed sludge inoculated into the reactor was 6 21 g l the membrane characteristics and operation process were previously reported by yang et al 11 biogas upgrading unit mainly consisted of scrubbing column which was with a height of 1 2 m and a diameter of 0 06 m and working volume of 3 2 l the synthetic biogas was controlled by a mass flow controller d07 19b d08 1f sevenstar china and injected from the bottom of scrubbing column and divided into small bubbles by aerator the upgraded biogas was collected on the top of the column anmbr effluent was controlled by a peristaltic pump bt100j 1a huiyu china and fed into scrubbing column from top and discharged by the bottom of scrubbing column forming a counter flow with biogas no packing was added to the scrubbing column 2 2 operation conditions biogas upgrading experiments were conducted with varying flow rates of biogas and anmbr effluent to optimize the operation parameter in run 1 at a constant biogas flow rate qg of 0 36 l h the experiments were conducted at five different effluent flow rates qes of 0 72 l h 1 8 l h 2 88 l h 3 6 l h 4 32 l h respectively in run 2 at a constant qe of 1 2 l h the experiments were carried out at different qgs of 0 6 l h 0 24 l h 0 15 l h 0 12 l h respectively controlled experiments were set using tap water 2 3 sampling and analysis the gas composition n2 and o2 h2 ch4 and co2 was measured with a gas chromatograph gc 7900 tianmei china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector cod nh4 alkalinity was determined as per apha standard method 26 the concentration of nh3 was calculated based on temperature ph and nh4 concentration according to ge et al 12 the conversion efficiency of cod to ch4 was the ratio of cod converted into ch4 to that in the influent 1 g cod 0 35 l ch4 13 dissolved ch4 was measurement by the headspace technique 14 3 results and discussion 3 1 operating performance of the anmbr the proportion of ch4 in biogas kept about 85 and biogas production was 0 42 l l d for the duration of the experiment fig 2 a the cod mass balance of anmbr shows that conversion efficiency of cod to ch4 effluent cod other cod account for 78 52 17 82 3 6 of influent cod respectively fig 2b other cod includes cod for biomass growth and ch4 loss in anmbr the cod mass balance and biogas composition of anmbr prove its good digestion performance and stable characteristics of anmbr effluent during the operation of anmbr the alkalinity nh4 ph do of the anmbr effluent was 694 87 49 47 caco3 mg l 50 10 mg l 7 5 0 3 0 32 mg l respectively these indicators suggested that anmbr effluent has the potential for biogas upgrading 3 2 biogas upgrading efficiency ch4 enrichment is the different ch4 content in the biogas before and after upgrading as a percentage of ch4 content in raw biogas which shows the biogas upgrading efficiency the influence of qe on upgrading efficiency is presented in fig 3 run 1 at qe of 2 88 l h the maximum ch4 enrichment and ch4 content in upgraded biogas with anmbr effluent is 50 50 and 90 3 respectively both effluent and tap water co2 content in upgraded biogas decreased with the increasing of the liquid effluent and tap water flow rate ql because high liquid to gas ratio improved the driver force to absorb co2 15 in addition there was little difference in the co2 content in upgraded biogas with anmbr effluent and tap water and the contents of n2 and o2 in upgraded biogas increased with the ql regardless of ql the content of n2 and o2 in upgraded biogas with anmbr effluent were lower than those with tap water n2 and o2 in upgraded biogas came from the liquid and the contents of n2 and o2 in anmbr effluent were lower than those in tap water fig 2 run 2 shows ch4 enrichment and biogas composition of upgraded biogas at different qgs at qg of 0 15 l h the maximum ch4 enrichment and ch4 content in upgraded biogas with anmbr effluent is 48 67 and 89 2 respectively with the increase of qg co2 content in upgraded biogas increased while contents of n2 and o2 decreased this was due to shorter gas liquid contact time results from increasing qg 16 in conclusion biogas upgrading efficiency was optimization at qe qg of 8 1 2 88 0 36 or 1 2 0 15 biogas upgrading process is based on the solubility difference between ch4 and co2 in the liquid in the biogas upgrading process a small amount of ch4 was also separated from biogas ch4 loss expressed as percentage of ch4 content in raw biogas when the ql qg was 2 88 0 36 the ch4 loss of upgrading biogas with anmbr effluent and tap water was 30 4 24 1 respectively meanwhile the ch4 loss of upgrading biogas with anmbr effluent and tap water was 4 6 8 3 respectively at gl qg of 1 2 0 15 the results suggested that biogas flow rate affect ch4 loss and the difference in ch4 loss between anmbr effluent and tap water ch4 is approximately 21 times stronger greenhouse effect than co2 17 therefore we should choose the appropriate biogas flow rate to avoid the severe green house effect caused by ch4 loss according to the operation conditions of anmbr the ratio of anmbr effluent rate to the biogas production rate was 7 0 which was between 5 0 and 8 0 when the liquid biogas ratio was between 5 0 and 8 0 the content of upgrading biogas was ranged from 88 4 to 90 9 this meant that the liquid gas ratio produced by anmbr in this study could achieve the goal of efficiency biogas upgrading in addition the ch4 content of the synthetic biogas used in this study was only 60 while the ch4 content of the biogas produced by anmbr was about 85 therefore the partial pressure of co2 in synthetic biogas was greater than that produced by anmbr this may lead to the upgrading effect of synthetic biogas being superior to biogas produced by anmbr in the experiment additionally the maximum ch4 content in upgraded biogas was 90 3 without packing at normal temperature and pressure which was better than other studies table 1 r noorain et al 15 proposed a new water scrubber packed with polyurethane sponge and a plastic frame although the ch4 content in the upgraded biogas was 90 5 the addition of packing leads to the water column blockage s rasi et al achieved 89 ch4 content in upgraded biogas by water scrubbing under the pressure of 8 bar 18 however upgrading biogas at high pressures caused more ch4 loss and energy consumption than normal pressure currently in situ biogas upgrading method includes pressurized reactor 19 recirculation of digestate via aerated methanation reactor 20 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis via exogenous h2 input 21 and electro methanogenesis 22 these methods have a common drawback that is the upgrading process has a negative impact on efficiency of anaerobic digestion according to the upgrading efficiency of the study a new solution for in situ biogas upgrading was proposed anmbr biogas was upgraded directly with anmbr effluent by integration of anmbr with scrubbing column ad and biogas upgrading were carried out in two stages and effluent was not recirculated as a result the proposed method showed no negative on ad efficiency compared to the existing in situ biogas upgrading methods 3 3 mechanism of biogas upgrading the mechanism of biogas upgrading by anmbr effluent is presented in fig 4 the biogas upgraded by effluent consisted of 90 3 ch4 4 6 co2 4 1 n2 and o2 at qe of 2 88 l h and qg of 0 36 l h n2 and o2 in upgraded biogas were derived from anmbr effluent the reduction of co2 was due to the dissolution and absorption by anmbr effluent the alkalinity free co2 free nh3 ph of the anmbr effluent was 694 87 49 47 caco3 mg l 178 32 mg l 1 49 mg l 7 67 respectively when anmbr effluent and biogas meet in the scrubbing column some co2 exists in the form of free through physical dissolution and part of it forms h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 by h2o and alkali products the remaining co2 in the upgraded biogas and was discharged by the top of the scrubbing column the alkalinity free co2 nh3 ph of the biogas upgrading effluent was 634 21 caco3 mg l 182 14 mg l 0 53 mg l 7 22 respectively by calculation 6 68 co2 was reduced as free co2 82 85 co2 was removed by alkali products among alkali products nh3 reduces co2 up to 4 07 in addition 10 47 co2 content was in upgraded biogas biogas upgrading by tap water at normal temperature and pressure a high tap water flow rate qt qg is required to achieve better co2 removal however a high qt qg causes more n2 and o2 escaping into the upgraded biogas it is paradoxical to achieve both high co2 removal and low n2 and o2 introduce by controlling qt qg according to previous studies it is difficult to attain good upgrading efficiency for biogas upgrading by tap water at normal temperature and pressure results of the study showed that good biogas upgrading efficiency was realized by anmbr effluent scrubbing without packing at normal temperature and pressure furthermore anmbr effluent was a kind of wastewater so regeneration unit is not required anmbr effluent has potential to replace tap water as a new solution for cost effective biogas upgraded 4 conclusion simultaneous bioenergy recovery from sewage and biogas upgrading were realized in a novel system which anmbr biogas was upgraded directly with anmbr effluent by integration of anmbr with scrubbing column results showed that conversion efficiency of cod to ch4 was 78 52 in anmbr and the maximum ch4 content of 90 3 was obtained by effluent scrubbing the mechanism analysis showed that biogas upgrading depended on sufficient alkali products and less n2 and o2 in anmbr effluent results of the study contribute to development of a cost effective in situ biogas upgrade solution declaration of competing interest the authors

13233,anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is considered an important alternative biogas source while efficiently purifying sewage improving the methane ch4 content in the anmbr biogas in a cost effective way is closely related to its future availability in the study a novel system was proposed for in situ biogas upgrading using anmbr effluent the system achieves the dual goals of bioenergy recovery from sewage and biogas upgrading biogas upgrading results showed that the ch4 content in upgraded biogas was 90 3 at biogas flow of 0 36 l h effluent flow of 2 88 l h and normal temperature and pressure the mechanism analysis showed that efficient upgrading with anmbr effluent depended on sufficiency alkali products and less n2 and o2 meanwhile conversion efficiency of chemical oxygen demand cod to ch4 of anmbr was 78 5 under hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h and organic load rate of 1 2 g cod l d the novel system provides a new solution for cost effective in situ biogas upgrading using anmbr effluent by integration of anmbr with scrubbing column graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biogas upgrading bioenergy recovery anaerobic membrane bioreactor scrubbing column in situ 1 introduction biogas is the product of anaerobic digestion ad mainly composed of methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 1 as a renewable energy biogas has the potential to replace fossil fuels as an important part of the energy system by 2016 biogas electricity has a share of about 4 in global heat generation 2 however co2 in biogas reduces the low calorific value and increases transportation cost 3 for example the low calorific value of biogas containing 94 ch4 is 38 5 mj m3 while the low calorific value of biogas containing ch4 in the range of 60 65 is 20 25 mj m3 4 removing co2 to increase ch4 is the crucial to efficient utilization of biogas many biogas upgrading methods including water scrubbing chemical adsorption membrane separation low temperature separation and pressure swing adsorption have been proposed 5 among all these methods water scrubbing is the most widely applied because it is the simplest and cheapest one 1 generally a pressurized flow of biogas is injected into the bottom of scrubber column and a stream of water is provided from the top of the column to encounter the biogas flow 6 utilization of solubility difference between ch4 and co2 in water to achieve the purpose of biogas upgrading in order to improve efficient contact area between biogas and water the scrubber column is filled with random packing 7 additional regeneration unit is applied to strip off co2 for reusing the scrubbing water in water scrubbing process the addition of packing leads to scrubbing column blockage and the pressurized of biogas and regeneration unit increase the energy consumption and cost of upgrading biogas in addition other impurities gas including nitrogen n2 and oxygen o2 are introduced into upgraded biogas by water scrubbing leading to inefficient biogas upgrading performance furthermore the transportation cost of the ex situ biogas upgrading process increases with the distance between the anaerobic digestion plant and biogas upgrading plant anaerobic digestion technology is promising sewages process that converts organics to ch4 and co2 via microbial consortium under anaerobic environment and has the advantages of low energy consumption high organic loading rate and low sludge production 8 anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr which combines ad process and membrane filtration technology has the advantages of bioenergy recovery separation of sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt high ch4 conversion efficiency 9 10 sufficient alkali products are needed to neutralize the carbon acid formed by dissolution of co2 to provide a suitable environment for methanogens in anmbr 9 as a results there are still many alkali products in anmbr effluent such as nh3 hco3 co3 2 etc to absorb co2 of biogas in addition there are microorganisms in the anmbr to consume o2 in sewage to meet the strict anaerobic condition of methanogens during the operation of anmbr membrane fouling is

using h2o as the model solvent ε 78 4 28 3 results and discussion 3 1 nor degradation kinetics nor degradation was studied in three different ways single uv irradiation dark chlorination and the uv chlorine process fig 1 the following factors were present original nor concentration of 10 μm naclo dose of 0 1 mm uv light intensity of 4 0 w cm 2 and ph value of 7 0 the results indicated that nor was degraded by only 30 9 using single uv irradiation and by 37 0 using dark chlorination at 600 s the findings revealed that neither uv irradiation nor dark chlorination can effectively degrade nor however nor can be removed entirely over 99 5 in a degradation time of 360 s using the combination of single uv and chlorination it is clear that in comparison to uv and dark chlorination alone the uv chlorine process evidently improves nor degradation the previous study also confirmed the removal of fleroxacin 29 and trimethoprim 18 by the uv chlorine process the reactive species oh and cl produced during the uv chlorine phase were attributed to effective degradation as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 ocl h 2 o hocl oh 3 hocl ocl hv oh o cl in addition nor degradation under three conditions was followed by the pseudo first order kinetics eqs 4 and 5 with degradation rate constants k app of 0 0006 s 1 0 0008 s 1 and 0 0196 s 1 the k app for the uv chlorine process was 327 and 245 times faster than that of single uv and dark chlorination respectively 4 d nor t dt k app nor t 5 k app ln nor t nor 0 t where nor 0 and nor t are the nor concentrations at 0 s and t s respectively k app is the pseudo first order apparent rate constant s 1 3 2 the influence of process factors it is critical to understand the process parameters influencing nor degradation the effects of several primary factors on nor removal including naclo dose uv light intensity ph value and ammonia concentration were studied separately while other process parameters were held constant pseudo first order kinetics were also used to match the data as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the initial naclo addition usually has a strong influence on the degradation rate constants fig 2a and table 1 show that the rate constant k app increased from 0 0117 s 1 to 0 0280 s 1 with increasing naclo addition dose from 0 05 mm to 2 0 mm meanwhile the corresponding half life t 1 2 also decreased from 48 4 s to 27 2 s increasing naclo addition significantly promoted nor degradation naclo addition is the main resource of active radicals oh and cl a higher naclo addition dose can generate more radicals to attack nor molecules and improve the reaction rate constants the effects of uv light intensity were also investigated with other fixed parameters as follows initial nor concentration of 10 μm naclo addition of 0 1 mm ph 7 uv light intensity obviously enhanced nor degradation fig 2b and table 1 as the uv irradiation was elevated from 2 5 w cm 2 to 10 0 w cm 2 the k app for nor degradation increased from 0 0136 s 1 to 0 0362 s 1 respectively uv irradiation is critical for the generation of free radicals in the uv driven oxidation process increasing uv light intensity practically increases the number of photons injected into the reactor as a result uv light improves the activation reaction of hypochlorite yielding more ho and cl radicals thus accelerating the degradation process in conclusion a higher uv light intensity is an efficient alternative to obtain a low degradation reaction time for practical pilot of the uv chlorine process another critical parameter in the uv chlorine process is the ph value the experiment was carried out with ph values ranging from 5 to 9 the results shown in fig 2c and table 1 indicate that the degradation rate constants are improved from 0 0026 s 1 to 0 0171 s 1 when the ph value ranges from 5 to 9 this phenomenon is different from previous reports in which a higher degradation efficiency was achieved under acidic conditions 30 it is generally believed that the proportion of hocl is higher under acidic conditions which generates a greater amount of reactive radicals 31 32 however in this study higher rate constants were observed in neutral or alkaline conditions a similar observation was made when climbazole was degraded using the uv chlorine process 33 a possible reason for this is that deprotonated organics tend to react with free radicals at a greater rate than protonated organics 34 norfloxacin is a carboxylic acid with a pka value of 6 32 therefore norfloxacin mainly exists in the deprotonated state under neutral and alkaline conditions resulting in a better degradation rate constant 33 ammonia is widely present in the water environment and can react with hypochlorite and inhibit the disinfection efficiency in water treatment plants therefore it is necessary to investigate the effect of ammonia on nor degradation tests were carried out with ammonia concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 μm as shown in fig 2d and table 1 the findings showed that ammonia in water samples has a clear negative impact on nor oxidation the k app dramatically decreased from 0 0197 s 1 to 0 0026 s 1 as the ammonia concentration rose from 0 μm to 500 μm during the uv chlorine process ammonia quickly reacted with hypochlorite to produce inorganic chloramines monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine 35 as shown in eqs 6 7 and 8 respectively the existing ammonia consumes hypochlorite in water which reduces the production of active radicals and inhibits nor degradation 6 nh 3 hocl nh 2 cl h 2 o 7 nh 2 cl hocl nhcl 2 h 2 o 8 nhcl 2 hocl ncl 3 h 2 o nh2cl photolysis yields nh2 and cl radicals under uv light furthermore cl radical interacts with nh2cl lowering the amount of cl radical and inhibiting the degradation process as shown in eqs 9 and 10 36 9 nh 2 cl uv nh 2 cl 10 cl nh 2 cl nhcl h cl chloramines also known as secondary disinfection are also commonly utilized in water treatment process which provide longer lasting disinfection capacity therefore an alternative technique the uv chloramine process has recently been investigated and assessed 37 39 the data demonstrated that the degradation performance of the uv chloramine process is weaker than that of the uv chlorine process with the same oxidant concentration the increasing chloramine dosage hindered the degradation in the uv chloramine process 39 these features were consistent with our observations described above in addition the degradation mechanisms of these two processes are somewhat different it is commonly assumed that reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl clo and cl2 and hydroxyl radical oh are main contributors to the degradation in the uv chlorine processes however the clo radical created in the uv chlorine process cannot be generated in the uv chloramine process moreover reactive nitrogen species rns e g no2 and no have been reported to contribute to the degradation implying the existence of novel degradation pathways distances from the uv chlorine processes 40 41 3 3 relative contributions of active species to the degradation nitrobenzene nb was taken as the probe compound to evaluate the relative contributions of oh radical reactive chlorine species rcs chlorination and uv irradiation in the uv chlorine process nitrobenzene interacts preferentially with oh as a scavenger whereas the interaction with cl was negligible the chlorine radical cl is thought to be primary component of rcs the uv chlorine kinetics system was modelled using eq 11 the contribution calculation technique was also described in detail in dong s work 42 11 ln nor nor 0 k app t k uv k naclo k oh k cl t where k app was the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constants s 1 k uv was the pseudo first order direct photolysis rate constant s 1 k naclo was the pseudo first order rate constants of nor chlorination k oh and k cl were the pseudo first order degradation rate constants s 1 with oh and cl based on the steady state assumption the contributions of oh k oh and cl k cl can be calculated according to eqs 12 13 and 14 12 k oh k oh oh ss 13 oh ss k nb k oh nb 14 k cl k obs k uv k naclo k oh where oh ss represents the steady state concentration of oh k nb is the pseudo first order rate constant of nitrobenzene by the uv chlorine process k oh and k oh nb represents the second order rate constants for the reaction of oh with nor and nitrobenzene respectively which were determined to be 3 90 109 m 1 s 1 and 8 81 109 m 1 s 1 43 44 fig 3 illustrates the obtained first order rate constants of nor degradation by rcs oh chlorination and uv photolysis in the uv chlorine process the experimental conditions were also described in table 1 these results shows that at uv light intensity 250 and naclo dosage 0 1 mm the estimated relative contributions of rcs ho chlorination and uv photolysis were 77 3 13 3 5 9 and 3 6 respectively among all the radicals in the uv chlorine process rcs e g cl clo plays the crucial role in the degradation of nor furthermore both uv light intensity and naclo dosage promoted the degradation process with increasing uv light intensity from 250 to 1000 μw cm 2 the k app increased from 0 0136 s 1 to 0 0362 s 1 and the k app increased from 0 0117 s 1 to 0 0280 s 1 with naclo dosage ranging from 0 05 to 2 0 mm in addition uv light intensity and naclo dosage had limited effect on the relative contribution of free radicals as shown in fig 3 the relative contribution of the k rcs value fluctuated in the range of 77 3 to 88 4 while that of k cl fluctuated in the range of 6 2 to 13 3 throughout the varied experimental parameters the primary explanation is that uv light and naclo dosage do not significantly change the relative proportion of the generated reactive radicals previous research also reported ph value could significantly affect the equilibrium of free radical chemical reactions and therefore the relative percentage of active radicals the oh dominated the degradation in acidic circumstances whereas the rcs prevailed in neutral and basic conditions 18 45 3 4 molecular structure characterization of nor quantum chemistry is a useful technique that has enabled researchers to gain a theoretical understanding of a molecule s active sites in this study several prediction methods based on the electronic structure were performed to elucidate the chemical reactivity and stability of the nor molecule including frontier molecular orbital fmo theory molecular surface property approach mspa analysis conceptual density functional theory cdft analysis etc 3 4 1 frontier molecular orbital analysis fmo analysis the homo and lumo are the main molecular orbitals taking part in chemical reactions fig 4 the homo indicates a molecule s potential to donate electrons when the lumo illustrates the tendency to accept them the radical reaction tends to occur at the position where the sum of the electron densities in the homo and lumo orbitals is the greatest 46 as a result for the reaction initiated by the radicals the radical frontier electron density f r can be calculated as follows eq 15 15 f r i c ri homo 2 i c ri lumo 2 where r is the number of atoms in the i orbital 47 48 to anticipate the possible electron extraction and hydroxylation sites the radical frontier electron densities f r for each atom were estimated and summarized in table 2 the results show that n5 has the largest f r value of 0 3194 implying that n5 can be the first position where radicals extract electrons the second highest density value is 0 1790 at the c12 position which is the most likely to be attacked by radicals furthermore the c14 c15 c16 and c19 positions are also possibly vulnerable to be attacked furthermore the energy differential between the homo and lumo energy gap is also a key parameter in evaluating a molecule s electrical transport property 49 as shown in fig 4 the homo lumo energy gap is estimated to be 8 032 ev 3 4 2 molecular surface property approach mspa analysis mspa analysis enables the calculation of more molecular properties on an electronic isodensity surface to identify and describe all possible reactive sites in a molecule 50 two properties esp electrostatic potential and alie average local ionization energy were calculated here to study and anticipate the possible chemical reactivity between nor and radicals esp also called molecular electrical potential is the potential produced by nuclei and electrons at a point 51 esp analysis can give a number of extreme and minimal points in different regions of the molecule which are important for understanding the surface properties of the molecule fig 5 tables s1 and s2 show that there are 13 minimum and 16 maximum points the minimum points are mainly located near the carboxyl group and nitrogen atom such as minima of 50 62 kcal mol near the o4 atom 33 39 kcal mol near the o2 atom and 24 54 kcal mol near the n6 atom on the surface the esp near the carboxyl group and n6 atom is the smallest and is the most prone to electrophilic reactions or electron loss reactions however the prediction of reaction sites using esp analysis alone is somewhat unreliable if the esp value near an atom is more negative it only means that the electrophilic reagents are more likely to migrate to the vicinity of the atom this does not mean that the electrons near the atom are more active and thus more likely to participate in the reaction therefore alie defined as the average energy required for the extraction of an electron from a site in a molecule is a useful and complementary analysis for predicting reactive sites 51 the lower the alie value the smaller the electron binding and thus the greater the chemical activity at these sites fig 5 tables s3 and s4 also show that alie minima occur at 212 23 kcal mol near the n6 atom and 231 50 kcal mol near the n5 atom therefore the global minima for esp and alie occur near the n6 and n5 atoms indicating that these two positions are the least electron bound positions and the most likely positions for radical and electrophilic reactions 3 4 3 conceptual density functional theory cdft analysis cdft also known as reactivity dft is the latest attempt to understand and evaluate molecular reaction characteristics using basic density functional 52 according to cdft the chemical reactivity of a molecule is described by its response to changes in the quantity of electrons external potential and other factors thus cdft descriptors such as the fukui function and dual descriptor may be used to anticipate reactive sites of a molecule 53 the calculated results are presented in tables 3 s5 and fig 6 as shown in table s5 the nucleophilicity index of 0 1163 a u 3 11 ev indicates nor a strong nucleophile with n 3 0 ev 54 the other global descriptors such as mulliken electronegativity 0 110088 a u chemical potential 0 110088 a u also explain nor molecules easily lose electrons in the reaction and show a distinct nucleophilic character 55 the fukui function a successful and widely used descriptor for the prediction of reactive sites is calculated unambiguously for the three situations including electrophilic attack nucleophilic attack and radical attack it is generally believed that reactive sites have larger fukui function values than other regions for example a higher electrophilic fukui function f r indicates increased susceptibility of a site to electrophilic attack while a higher nucleophilic fukui function f r indicates increased susceptibility of a site to nucleophilic attack 55 the cdft descriptors in table 3 indicate that the n5 atom has a maximum value of 0 1582 for f r and 0 0864 for f 0 r it can be inferred that the n5 atom is the favoured target for electrophilic attack or radical attack and this atom can behave as a nucleophilic species in a chemical reaction moreover several other atoms such as o2 c14 c15 and c17 are also possible active sites for large values of f r and f 0 r as shown in eq 16 the dual descriptor dd δf r arises from f r minus f r 16 δf r f r f r current advances have shown that δf r is more efficient than fukui functions alone for predicting possible reaction sites 56 better than the fukui function the dual descriptor δf r can clearly and simultaneously reveal the nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in a molecule in other words nucleophilic reactions usually occur at positive values of δf r while electrophilic reaction takes place at negative values of δf r 57 previous research also reported dd index can successfully identify the activate sites of melanoidin and fungal peptides for radical attack 55 58 the n5 atom has the lowest δf r value of 0 1437 indicating potential electrophilic attack sites moreover c19 and c20 are also possible reactive sites for nucleophilic attack with δf r values of 0 0634 and 0 0574 respectively the graphical illustration of the fukui function and dual descriptor in fig 6d also clearly shows the lowest contour surface blue near the n5 atom all three analysis methods gave good predictions of the active sites of nor among all reactive sites n5 or n6 was predicted by these analysis methods however the active sites obtained using different prediction methods are often not fully consistent in many cases 59 for example fmo analysis indicated that the c12 site was the second most probable while mspa and cdft analyses did not this is because each analytical method has its own theoretical assumption and examines chemical reactions from different perspectives the complete reaction between two molecules can be divided into two steps i e the approach of two molecules step 1 and electronic structure rearrangement between two molecules step 2 long range electrostatic interactions are the important factor in the step 1 the analysis for electrostatic potential on the surface of atoms can tell where the reactants are likely to be pulled to therefore the reactive site predicted by esp index in step 1 is more meaningful meanwhile as the two molecules come closer the chemical reaction is completed through electronic structure rearrangement like bond formation and bond breaking where this step easily occurs depends critically on the atom which is near the area with high electron activity therefore alie index is more suitable for indicating reaction sites in short the final active sites need to be determined on the basis of a combination of multiple analytical methods the initiating reaction is likely to occur on the n6 or n5 atoms in the nor molecule which are the most reactive sites for electrophilic or radical attack 3 5 intermediates and reaction paths the nor degradation intermediates were analysed and identified based on the ms and ms2 spectra obtained by hrms mass spectrometry the molecular formulas retention time and structural properties of nor and its intermediates are summarized in fig 7 and table 3 nor appears in the chromatogram with a molecular ion of 320 1405 m z at a retention time rt of 4 3 min fig 7a the ms2 spectrum for nor showed that the product ion at 302 1299 m z c16h16fn3o2 is produced due to the loss of h2o 18 da from the carboxyl group fig 7b another fragment ion at 282 1238 m z c16h15n3o2 presumably arises from the further loss of fluorine hf 20 da the nor molecular structure mainly consists of benzene ring piperazine ring naphthyridine ring and other groups such as carbonyl and carboxyl groups the quantum chemical structure analysis of the nor molecule section 3 4 also shows that n5 and n6 in the piperazine ring c19 c20 and other carbon atoms are susceptible to attack by free radicals it is generally believed that the degradation of nor mainly occurs via the attack of radicals on the piperazine ring and quinolone group structures during aop processes 60 61 therefore nor degradation covers three reaction pathways the cleavage of the piperazine ring the transformation of the quinolone structure and the chloramination reaction pathway 1 cleavage and removal of the piperazine ring there are two important radicals oh and cl in the uv chlorination process oh radicals attack the piperazine ring and lead to the formation of carbonylated products of im334 and the hydroxylated product of im350 fig 8 carbonyl and hydroxyl groups are added to the piperazine ring esp and alie analysis showed that the n6 and n5 atoms are the most reactive sites and easy to lose electrons the piperazine ring is most likely to be the first to break off therefore products im322 and im294 are further produced through the loss of h2o and co which results in the cleavage of the piperazine ring subsequently im294 transforms to im279 and im251 through carboxylation and demethylation leading to the removal of the piperazine ring from the nor molecule these products were also observed and compared with reports covering nor degradation by several aops such as photocatalysis peroxy monosulfate and ionizing radiation 44 62 64 the results show that other fluoroquinolones with similar structures ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin etc can also be degraded through this degradation pathway pathway 2 transformation and cleavage of the quinolone structure free radicals readily attack the carbon carbon double bond close to the carboxyl group in quinol 61 65 cdft analysis also explains section 3 4 3 c19 and c20 are also possible reactive sites therefore the break of carbon carbon double bonds results in the step by step formation of im352 im324 and im252 however their peak intensities were slightly low indicating that the pathway is not the main degradation route in addition it has been suggested that a defluorination reaction can exist during the aop process 65 however defluorination products were not detected in this study probably because the activation energy of the defluorination reaction 2 35 ev is higher than that of the hydroxylation reaction 1 55 ev in addition the predicted active site section 3 4 also indicates that c16 which is attached to the f atom is not a preferred site for radical attack therefore the defluorination reaction is not the main pathway during the process and no defluorination products were detected pathway 3 chloramination reaction with rcs the presence of rcs cl hclo etc also contributes significantly to nor degradation im279 and im251 can also react directly with rcs and produce chloramine type compounds such as im313 and im285 due to the continuous action of reactive radicals nor can be completely oxidized and decomposed into co2 h2o f and other small molecules at the end stage based on the analysis of the above reaction mechanism fig 8 depicts the possible mechanism for nor degradation by the uv chlorine process 3 6 ecological risk prediction and evaluation it is beneficial for biological acute toxicity tests to evaluate the reliability of process operation and potential ecological risks the relative inhibition of luminescence intensity for each sample with time was determined during the uv chlorine process fig 9 this figure shows that the relative inhibition rate for the luminescence was only 9 before the test began indicating that the nor solution has weak acute toxicity to aquatic organisms with further degradation acute toxicity did not significantly decrease even though the parent compound nor was completely removed these data show that the toxicity of water samples degraded in the late stage is greater than that in the early stage the enhancement of toxicity may be due to the transformation and oxidation of the piperazine ring in the nor structure during the treatment process 66 the loss of several atoms from the piperazine ring promotes cell wall penetration resulting in higher inhibition of luminescent bacteria the inhibition of luminescence fluctuated at approximately 20 after a degradation time of 30 min and the toxicity remained higher than the parent compound nor the changes in luminescence inhibition during the process reveal that the removal of pollutants in water does not represent a reduction in ecological risk the qsar program ecosar ver 2 0 was used to estimate the toxicity of nor and its intermediates based on structural similarities to chemicals with previously assessed aquatic toxicity the results are presented in table 4 during the degradation process most of the intermediates such as im350 im308 and im324 showed predicted toxicity values that were higher than those of the parent compound nor this explained the decrease in the inhibition of luminescence intensity at certain moments in actual degradation however there still exist several intermediates with lower ec 50 or lc 50 i e im322 im251 im352 with higher toxicity for example the ec 50 for fish daphnid and green algae of im352 was only 33 8 mg l 4 25 mg l and 3 15 mg l which is apparently below the values for nor 20 100 mg l 1830 mg l and 2570 mg l this clarified why the inhibition of luminescent bacteria increased during the degradation process in short according to the acute toxicity test and ecosar prediction the increase in toxicity during the degradation process is mainly due to the generation of several highly toxic intermediates 4 conclusions compared to single uv irradiation or chlorination alone the removal of norfloxacin is greatly improved using the uv chlorine process the findings of this study reveal that nor can be effectively degraded in 360 s with a high degradation rate of 0 0196 s 1 using the uv chlorine process several process factors such as chlorine dose uv light intensity and coexisting components in water can affect the removal of nor using the uv chlorine process quantum chemical structure analysis including fmo mspa and cdft analysis was used to gain a theoretical understanding of the reactive sites for the nor molecule the most reactive sites for electrophilic or radical attack are the n6 or n5 atoms in the piperazine ring of the nor molecule which are both possible starting reaction sites for the degradation mechanism the pathways for the degradation of nor by uv chlorine mainly include cleavage and removal of the piperazine ring transformation and cleavage of the quinolone structure and chlorination reaction with rcs the full elimination of nor does not ensure a decrease in acute

13234,the uv chlorine process is a novel light driven oxidation technique in this study norfloxacin nor a typical quinolone contaminant was degraded by using the uv chlorine process the effects of the

found to be positively correlated with chlorine dose and uv intensity but negatively correlated with ammonia fmo mspa and cdft quantum chemical structure analyses reveal the most reactive sites for electrophilic or radical attack are the n6 or n5 atoms in the piperazine ring of the nor molecule which are also potential starting reaction sites for the degradation process thirteen degradation

introduction antibiotics were an important scientific discovery in the 20th century currently antibiotics are still widely used for epidemic prevention and disease treatment 1 on the other hand as a result of their abuse antibiotics have become a new form of pollutant in water systems human excretion agricultural animals and direct drainage of medical and industrial wastes can all introduce antibiotics into wastewater treatment plants wwtps 2 3 antibiotic residues in water can enter aquatic organisms such as fish and shrimp causing further harm to humans through food chain enrichment 4 5 antibiotics in animals and the environment can also cause bacteria to grow resistant strains 6 7 as a result concerns have been raised about the effects of low concentrations of antibiotics in aqueous environments 8 10 fluoroquinolones fqs are a class of synthetic antibacterial medications that have been widely used in human and veterinary medicine as well as in animal husbandry to treat bacterial infections in 2020 the global market for antibiotics was estimated to be worth usd 40 7 billion and fqs are expected to dominate with a 13 market share 11 in addition fqs have been found in water bodies with concentrations as high as 700 ng l 1 and 400 ng l 1 in the influent and effluent of wwtps respectively in north america europe and china in recent years 12 13 as a result the possible health threats posed by fqs in aqueous environments must be addressed norfloxacin nor a broad spectrum antibacterial agent that works against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria is one of the most commonly used fqs in traditional wwtps however fqs removal have been shown to be less efficient 14 it has been reported that typical fqs such as ciprofloxacin can be effectively degraded by several advanced oxidation processes aops including thermally activated persulfate 15 and ozonation 16 the uv chlorine process is a new aop that can be used to effectively remove trace contaminants from aqueous environments it has been proven that the uv chlorine process is more effective than the uv h2o2 process for controlling emerging pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine benzotriazole and methomylidine 17 19 to date most studies have focused on the removal and degradation kinetics of target fqs during the treatment process previously we reported typical sunscreen benzophenone 9 bp9 degradation by using the chlorination process the intermediates formed during the bp9 chlorination process are more toxic than the parent compound posing a possible threat to the quality of drinking water 20 21 to fully optimize and evaluate the treatment process the identification of intermediates produced during the degradation process is critical in addition the degradation of norfloxacin in water using the uv chlorine process has not been thoroughly investigated the degradation of the typical fqs norfloxacin nor was investigated in this study using the uv chlorine process kinetic studies were conducted to examine the effect of different parameters such as the initial free chlorine concentration uv light intensity ph value and ammonia concentration the molecular structural features of norfloxacin were explored to identify potential reactive sites the intermediates were identified and the reaction mechanism was proposed based on high resolution mass

was degraded by only 30 9 using single uv irradiation and by 37 0 using dark chlorination at 600 s the findings revealed that neither uv irradiation nor dark chlorination can effectively degrade nor however nor can be removed entirely over 99 5 in a degradation time of 360 s using the combination of single uv and chlorination it is clear that in comparison to uv and dark chlorination alone the uv chlorine process evidently improves nor degradation the previous study also confirmed the removal of fleroxacin 29 and trimethoprim 18 by the uv chlorine process the reactive species oh and cl produced during the uv chlorine phase were attributed to effective degradation as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 ocl h 2 o hocl oh 3 hocl ocl hv oh o cl in addition nor degradation under three conditions was followed by the pseudo first order kinetics eqs 4 and 5 with degradation rate constants k app of 0 0006 s 1 0 0008 s 1 and 0 0196 s 1 the k app for the uv chlorine process was 327 and 245 times faster than that of single uv and dark chlorination respectively 4 d nor t dt k app nor t 5 k app ln nor t nor 0 t where nor 0 and nor t are the nor concentrations at 0 s and t s respectively k app is the pseudo first order apparent rate constant s 1 3 2 the influence of process factors it is critical to understand the process parameters influencing nor degradation the effects of several primary factors on nor removal including naclo dose uv light intensity ph value and ammonia concentration were studied separately while other process parameters were held constant pseudo first order kinetics were also used to match the data as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the initial naclo addition usually has a strong influence on the degradation rate constants fig 2a and table 1 show that the rate constant k app increased from 0 0117 s 1 to 0 0280 s 1 with increasing naclo addition dose from 0 05 mm to 2 0 mm meanwhile the corresponding half life t 1 2 also decreased from 48 4 s to 27 2 s increasing naclo addition significantly promoted nor degradation naclo addition is the main resource of active radicals oh and cl a higher naclo addition dose can generate more radicals to attack nor molecules and improve the reaction rate constants the effects of uv light intensity were also investigated with other fixed parameters as follows initial nor concentration of 10 μm naclo addition of 0 1 mm ph 7 uv light intensity obviously enhanced nor degradation fig 2b and table 1 as the uv irradiation was elevated from 2 5 w cm 2 to 10 0 w cm 2 the k app for nor degradation increased from 0 0136 s 1 to 0 0362 s 1 respectively uv irradiation is critical for the generation of free radicals in the uv driven oxidation process increasing uv light intensity practically increases the number of photons injected into the reactor as a result uv light improves the activation reaction of hypochlorite yielding more ho and cl radicals thus accelerating the degradation process in conclusion a higher uv light intensity is an efficient alternative to obtain a low degradation reaction time for practical pilot of the uv chlorine process another critical parameter in the uv chlorine process is the ph value the experiment was carried out with ph values ranging from 5 to 9 the results shown in fig 2c and table 1 indicate that the degradation rate constants are improved from 0 0026 s 1 to 0 0171 s 1 when the ph value ranges from 5 to 9 this phenomenon is different from previous reports in which a higher degradation efficiency was achieved under acidic conditions 30 it is generally believed that the proportion of hocl is higher under acidic conditions which generates a greater amount of reactive radicals 31 32 however in this study higher rate constants were observed in neutral or alkaline conditions a similar observation was made when climbazole was degraded using the uv chlorine process 33 a possible reason for this is that deprotonated organics tend to react with free radicals at a greater rate than protonated organics 34 norfloxacin is a carboxylic acid with a pka value of 6 32 therefore norfloxacin mainly exists in the deprotonated state under neutral and alkaline conditions resulting in a better degradation rate constant 33 ammonia is widely present in the water environment and can react with hypochlorite and inhibit the disinfection efficiency in water treatment plants therefore it is necessary to investigate the effect of ammonia on nor degradation tests were carried out with ammonia concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 μm as shown in fig 2d and table 1 the findings showed that ammonia in water samples has a clear negative impact on nor oxidation the k app dramatically decreased from 0 0197 s 1 to 0 0026 s 1 as the ammonia concentration rose from 0 μm to 500 μm during the uv chlorine process ammonia quickly reacted with hypochlorite to produce inorganic chloramines monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine 35 as shown in eqs 6 7 and 8 respectively the existing ammonia consumes hypochlorite in water which reduces the production of active radicals and inhibits nor degradation 6 nh 3 hocl nh 2 cl h 2 o 7 nh 2 cl hocl nhcl 2 h 2 o 8 nhcl 2 hocl ncl 3 h 2 o nh2cl photolysis yields nh2 and cl radicals under uv light furthermore cl radical interacts with nh2cl lowering the amount of cl radical and inhibiting the degradation process as shown in eqs 9 and 10 36 9 nh 2 cl uv nh 2 cl 10 cl nh 2 cl nhcl h cl chloramines also known as secondary disinfection are also commonly utilized in water treatment process which provide longer lasting disinfection capacity therefore an alternative technique the uv chloramine process has recently been investigated and assessed 37 39 the data demonstrated that the degradation performance of the uv chloramine process is weaker than that of the uv chlorine process with the same oxidant concentration the increasing chloramine dosage hindered the degradation in the uv chloramine process 39 these features were consistent with our observations described above in addition the degradation mechanisms of these two processes are somewhat different it is commonly assumed that reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl clo and cl2 and hydroxyl radical oh are main contributors to the degradation in the uv chlorine processes however the clo radical created in the uv chlorine process cannot be generated in the uv chloramine process moreover reactive nitrogen species rns e g no2 and no have been reported to contribute to the degradation implying the existence of novel degradation pathways distances from the uv chlorine processes 40 41 3 3 relative contributions of active species to the degradation nitrobenzene nb was taken as the probe compound to evaluate the relative contributions of oh radical reactive chlorine species rcs chlorination and uv irradiation in the uv chlorine process nitrobenzene interacts preferentially with oh as a scavenger whereas the interaction with cl was negligible the chlorine radical cl is thought to be primary component of rcs the uv chlorine kinetics system was modelled using eq 11 the contribution calculation technique was also described in detail in dong s work 42 11 ln nor nor 0 k app t k uv k naclo k oh k cl t where k app was the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constants s 1 k uv was the pseudo first order direct photolysis rate constant s 1 k naclo was the pseudo first order rate constants of nor chlorination k oh and k cl were the pseudo first order degradation rate constants s 1 with oh and cl based on the steady state assumption the contributions of oh k oh and cl k cl can be calculated according to eqs 12 13 and 14 12 k oh k oh oh ss 13 oh ss k nb k oh nb 14 k cl k obs k uv k naclo k oh where oh ss represents the steady state concentration of oh k nb is the pseudo first order rate constant of nitrobenzene by the uv chlorine process k oh and k oh nb represents the second order rate constants for the reaction of oh with nor and nitrobenzene respectively which were determined to be 3 90 109 m 1 s 1 and 8 81 109 m 1 s 1 43 44 fig 3 illustrates the obtained first order rate constants of nor degradation by rcs oh chlorination and uv photolysis in the uv chlorine process the experimental conditions were also described in table 1 these results shows that at uv light intensity 250 and naclo dosage 0 1 mm the estimated relative contributions of rcs ho chlorination and uv photolysis were 77 3 13 3 5 9 and 3 6 respectively among all the radicals in the uv chlorine process rcs e g cl clo plays the crucial role in the degradation of nor furthermore both uv light intensity and naclo dosage promoted the degradation process with increasing uv light intensity from 250 to 1000 μw cm 2 the k app increased from 0 0136 s 1 to 0 0362 s 1 and the k app increased from 0 0117 s 1 to 0 0280 s 1 with naclo dosage ranging from 0 05 to 2 0 mm in addition uv light intensity and naclo dosage had limited effect on the relative contribution of free radicals as shown in fig 3 the relative contribution of the k rcs value fluctuated in the range of 77 3 to 88 4 while that of k cl fluctuated in the range of 6 2 to 13 3 throughout the varied experimental parameters the primary explanation is that uv light and naclo dosage do not significantly change the relative proportion of the generated reactive radicals previous research also reported ph value could significantly affect the equilibrium of free radical chemical reactions and therefore the relative percentage of active radicals the oh dominated the degradation in acidic circumstances whereas the rcs prevailed in neutral and basic conditions 18 45 3 4 molecular structure characterization of nor quantum chemistry is a useful technique that has enabled researchers to gain a theoretical understanding of a molecule s active sites in this study several prediction methods based on the electronic structure were performed to elucidate the chemical reactivity and stability of the nor molecule including frontier molecular orbital fmo theory molecular surface property approach mspa analysis conceptual density functional theory cdft analysis etc 3 4 1 frontier molecular orbital analysis fmo analysis the homo and lumo are the main molecular orbitals taking part in chemical reactions fig 4 the homo indicates a molecule s potential to donate electrons when the lumo illustrates the tendency to accept them the radical reaction tends to occur at the position where the sum of the electron densities in the homo and lumo orbitals is the greatest 46 as a result for the reaction initiated by the radicals the radical frontier electron density f r can be calculated as follows eq 15 15 f r i c ri homo 2 i c ri lumo 2 where r is the number of atoms in the i orbital 47 48 to anticipate the possible electron extraction and hydroxylation sites the radical frontier electron densities f r for each atom were estimated and summarized in table 2 the results show that n5 has the largest f r value of 0 3194 implying that n5 can be the first position where radicals extract electrons the second highest density value is 0 1790 at the c12 position which is the most likely to be attacked by radicals furthermore the c14 c15 c16 and c19 positions are also possibly vulnerable to be attacked furthermore the energy differential between the homo and lumo energy gap is also a key parameter in evaluating a molecule s electrical transport property 49 as shown in fig 4 the homo lumo energy gap is estimated to be 8 032 ev 3 4 2 molecular surface property approach mspa analysis mspa analysis enables the calculation of more molecular properties on an electronic isodensity surface to identify and describe all possible reactive sites in a molecule 50 two properties esp electrostatic potential and alie average local ionization energy were calculated here to study and anticipate the possible chemical reactivity between nor and radicals esp also called molecular electrical potential is the potential produced by nuclei and electrons at a point 51 esp analysis can give a number of extreme and minimal points in different regions of the molecule which are important for understanding the surface properties of the molecule fig 5 tables s1 and s2 show that there are 13 minimum and 16 maximum points the minimum points are mainly located near the carboxyl group and nitrogen atom such as minima of 50 62 kcal mol near the o4 atom 33 39 kcal mol near the o2 atom and 24 54 kcal mol near the n6 atom on the surface the esp near the carboxyl group and n6 atom is the smallest and is the most prone to electrophilic reactions or electron loss reactions however the prediction of reaction sites using esp analysis alone is somewhat unreliable if the esp value near an atom is more negative it only means that the electrophilic reagents are more likely to migrate to the vicinity of the atom this does not mean that the electrons near the atom are more active and thus more likely to participate in the reaction therefore alie defined as the average energy required for the extraction of an electron from a site in a molecule is a useful and complementary analysis for predicting reactive sites 51 the lower the alie value the smaller the electron binding and thus the greater the chemical activity at these sites fig 5 tables s3 and s4 also show that alie minima occur at 212 23 kcal mol near the n6 atom and 231 50 kcal mol near the n5 atom therefore the global minima for esp and alie occur near the n6 and n5 atoms indicating that these two positions are the least electron bound positions and the most likely positions for radical and electrophilic reactions 3 4 3 conceptual density functional theory cdft analysis cdft also known as reactivity dft is the latest attempt to understand and evaluate molecular reaction characteristics using basic density functional 52 according to cdft the chemical reactivity of a molecule is described by its response to changes in the quantity of electrons external potential and other factors thus cdft descriptors such as the fukui function and dual descriptor may be used to anticipate reactive sites of a molecule 53 the calculated results are presented in tables 3 s5 and fig 6 as shown in table s5 the nucleophilicity index of 0 1163 a u 3 11 ev indicates nor a strong nucleophile with n 3 0 ev 54 the other global descriptors such as mulliken electronegativity 0 110088 a u chemical potential 0 110088 a u also explain nor molecules easily lose electrons in the reaction and show a distinct nucleophilic character 55 the fukui function a successful and widely used descriptor for the prediction of reactive sites is calculated unambiguously for the three situations including electrophilic attack nucleophilic attack and radical attack it is generally believed that reactive sites have larger fukui function values than other regions for example a higher electrophilic fukui function f r indicates increased susceptibility of a site to electrophilic attack while a higher nucleophilic fukui function f r indicates increased susceptibility of a site to nucleophilic attack 55 the cdft descriptors in table 3 indicate that the n5 atom has a maximum value of 0 1582 for f r and 0 0864 for f 0 r it can be inferred that the n5 atom is the favoured target for electrophilic attack or radical attack and this atom can behave as a nucleophilic species in a chemical reaction moreover several other atoms such as o2 c14 c15 and c17 are also possible active sites for large values of f r and f 0 r as shown in eq 16 the dual descriptor dd δf r arises from f r minus f r 16 δf r f r f r current advances have shown that δf r is more efficient than fukui functions alone for predicting possible reaction sites 56 better than the fukui function the dual descriptor δf r can clearly and simultaneously reveal the nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in a molecule in other words nucleophilic reactions usually occur at positive values of δf r while electrophilic reaction takes place at negative values of δf r 57 previous research also reported dd index can successfully identify the activate sites of melanoidin and fungal peptides for radical attack 55 58 the n5 atom has the lowest δf r value of 0 1437 indicating potential electrophilic attack sites moreover c19 and c20 are also possible reactive sites for nucleophilic attack with δf r values of 0 0634 and 0 0574 respectively the graphical illustration of the fukui function and dual descriptor in fig 6d also clearly shows the lowest contour surface blue near the n5 atom all three analysis methods gave good predictions of the active sites of nor among all reactive sites n5 or n6 was predicted by these analysis methods however the active sites obtained using different prediction methods are often not fully consistent in many cases 59 for example fmo analysis indicated that the c12 site was the second most probable while mspa and cdft analyses did not this is because each analytical method has its own theoretical assumption and examines chemical reactions from different perspectives the complete reaction between two molecules can be divided into two steps i e the approach of two molecules step 1 and electronic structure rearrangement between two molecules step 2 long range electrostatic interactions are the important factor in the step 1 the analysis for electrostatic potential on the surface of atoms can tell where the reactants are likely to be pulled to therefore the reactive site predicted by esp index in step 1 is more meaningful meanwhile as the two molecules come closer the chemical reaction is completed through electronic structure rearrangement like bond formation and bond breaking where this step easily occurs depends critically on the atom which is near the area with high electron activity therefore alie index is more suitable for indicating reaction sites in short the final active sites need to be determined on the basis of a combination of multiple analytical methods the initiating reaction is likely to occur on the n6 or n5 atoms in the nor molecule which are the most reactive sites for electrophilic or radical attack 3 5 intermediates and reaction paths the nor degradation intermediates were analysed and identified based on the ms and ms2 spectra obtained by hrms mass spectrometry the molecular formulas retention time and structural properties of nor and its intermediates are summarized in fig 7 and table 3 nor appears in the chromatogram with a molecular ion of 320 1405 m z at a retention time rt of 4 3 min fig 7a the ms2 spectrum for nor showed that the product ion at 302 1299 m z c16h16fn3o2 is produced due to the loss of h2o 18 da from the carboxyl group fig 7b another fragment ion at 282 1238 m z c16h15n3o2 presumably arises from the further loss of fluorine hf 20 da the nor molecular structure mainly consists of benzene ring piperazine ring naphthyridine ring and other groups such as carbonyl and carboxyl groups the quantum chemical structure analysis of the nor molecule section 3 4 also shows that n5 and n6 in the piperazine ring c19 c20 and other carbon atoms are susceptible to attack by free radicals it is generally believed that the degradation of nor mainly occurs via the attack of radicals on the piperazine ring and quinolone group structures during aop processes 60 61 therefore nor degradation covers three reaction pathways the cleavage of the piperazine ring the transformation of the quinolone structure and the chloramination reaction pathway 1 cleavage and removal of the piperazine ring there are two important radicals oh and cl in the uv chlorination process oh radicals attack the piperazine ring and lead to the formation of carbonylated products of im334 and the hydroxylated product of im350 fig 8 carbonyl and hydroxyl groups are added to the piperazine ring esp and alie analysis showed that the n6 and n5 atoms are the most reactive sites and easy to lose electrons the piperazine ring is most likely to be the first to break off therefore products im322 and im294 are further produced through the loss of h2o and co which results in the cleavage of the piperazine ring subsequently im294 transforms to im279 and im251 through carboxylation and demethylation leading to the removal of the piperazine ring from the nor molecule these products were also observed and compared with reports covering nor degradation by several aops such as photocatalysis peroxy monosulfate and ionizing radiation 44 62 64 the results show that other fluoroquinolones with similar structures ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin etc can also be degraded through this degradation pathway pathway 2 transformation and cleavage of the quinolone structure free radicals readily attack the carbon carbon double bond close to the carboxyl group in quinol 61 65 cdft analysis also explains section 3 4 3 c19 and c20 are also possible reactive sites therefore the break of carbon carbon double bonds results in the step by step formation of im352 im324 and im252 however their peak intensities were slightly low indicating that the pathway is not the main degradation route in addition it has been suggested that a defluorination reaction can exist during the aop process 65 however defluorination products were not detected in this study probably because the activation energy of the defluorination reaction 2 35 ev is higher than that of the hydroxylation reaction 1 55 ev in addition the predicted active site section 3 4 also indicates that c16 which is attached to the f atom is not a preferred site for radical attack therefore the defluorination reaction is not the main pathway during the process and no defluorination products were detected pathway 3 chloramination reaction with rcs the presence of rcs cl hclo etc also contributes significantly to nor degradation im279 and im251 can also react directly with rcs and produce chloramine type compounds such as im313 and im285 due to the continuous action of reactive radicals nor can be completely oxidized and decomposed into co2 h2o f and other small molecules at the end stage based on the analysis of the above reaction mechanism fig 8 depicts the possible mechanism for nor degradation by the uv chlorine process 3 6 ecological risk prediction and evaluation it is beneficial for biological acute toxicity tests to evaluate the reliability of process operation and potential ecological risks the relative inhibition of luminescence intensity for each sample with time was determined during the uv chlorine process fig 9 this figure shows that the relative inhibition rate for the luminescence was only 9 before the test began indicating that the nor solution has weak acute toxicity to aquatic organisms with further degradation acute toxicity did not significantly decrease even though the parent compound nor was completely removed these data show that the toxicity of water samples degraded in the late stage is greater than that in the early stage the enhancement of toxicity may be due to the transformation and oxidation of the piperazine ring in the nor structure during the treatment process 66 the loss of several atoms from the piperazine ring promotes cell wall penetration resulting in higher inhibition of luminescent bacteria the inhibition of luminescence fluctuated at approximately 20 after a degradation time of 30 min and the toxicity remained higher than the parent compound nor the changes in luminescence inhibition during the process reveal that the removal of pollutants in water does not represent a reduction in ecological risk the qsar program ecosar ver 2 0 was used to estimate the toxicity of nor and its intermediates based on structural similarities to chemicals with previously assessed aquatic toxicity the results are presented in table 4 during the degradation process most of the intermediates such as im350 im308 and im324 showed predicted toxicity values that were higher than those of the parent compound nor this explained the decrease in the inhibition of luminescence intensity at certain moments in actual degradation however there still exist several intermediates with lower ec 50 or lc 50 i e im322 im251 im352 with higher toxicity for example the ec 50 for fish daphnid and green algae of im352 was only 33 8 mg l 4 25 mg l and 3 15 mg l which is apparently below the values for nor 20 100 mg l 1830 mg l and 2570 mg l this clarified why the inhibition of luminescent bacteria increased during the degradation process in short according to the acute toxicity test and ecosar prediction the increase in toxicity during the degradation process is mainly due to the generation of several highly toxic intermediates 4 conclusions compared to single uv irradiation or chlorination alone the removal of norfloxacin is greatly improved using the uv chlorine process the findings of this study reveal that nor can be effectively degraded in 360 s with a high degradation rate of 0 0196 s 1 using the uv chlorine process several process factors such as chlorine dose uv light intensity and coexisting components in water can affect the removal of nor using the uv chlorine process quantum chemical structure analysis including fmo mspa and cdft analysis was used to gain a theoretical understanding of the reactive sites for the nor molecule the most reactive sites for electrophilic or radical attack are the n6 or n5 atoms in the piperazine ring of the nor molecule which are both possible starting reaction sites for the degradation mechanism the pathways for the degradation of nor by uv chlorine mainly include cleavage and removal of the piperazine ring transformation and cleavage of the quinolone structure and chlorination reaction with rcs the full elimination of nor does not ensure a decrease in acute toxicity environmental risks associated with the uv chlorine process should be assessed further declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
