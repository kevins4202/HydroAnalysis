17625,coolia malayensis is one of the commonly found benthic dinoflagellates in hong kong which can produce biotoxins and threaten the early life stages of marine invertebrates seawater temperature has been recognized as one of the primary environmental factors that affect the formation of harmful algal blooms the present study evaluated the responses of c malayensis including growth toxicity and toxin content putative analogues of okadaic acid and azaspiracids after exposure to a range of seven different temperatures i e 16 c 18 c 20 c 22 c 24 c 26 c and 28 c the highest algal density and specific growth rate were recorded at 24 c significantly higher fv fm maximum quantum yield of psii and total phaeo pigment values were observed in the exponential growth phase at 28 c the toxicity of the algal extract which was assessed by the lethality rate of artemia larvae increased with temperature the highest toxin content was detected at the second highest temperature treatment i e 26 c overall temperature had significant effects on the physiological activities and toxicity of c malayensis this study has raised attention to the potentially increasing risks posed by toxic benthic dinoflagellates during heat waves in coastal waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photosynthesis climate change lc ms ms algal toxin ocean warming south china sea 1 introduction in contrast to pelagic dinoflagellates benthic dinoflagellates tend to live on macroalgae coral reefs rocks sand and particles in coastal marine habitats gómez 2012 coolia is a genus of benthic dinoflagellates which are widely distributed mainly in warm waters and often co occur with other toxin producing epiphytic algal species belonging to multiple genera gambierdiscus prorocentrum ostreopsis fukuyoa and amphidinium aligizaki and nikolaidis 2006 almada et al 2017 rhodes and smith 2019 to date a total of seven coolia species have been identified from tropical sub tropical and temperate regions faust 1995 fraga et al 2008 karafas et al 2015 leaw et al 2010 meunier 1919 ten hage et al 2000 c malayensis has been found in many coastal areas of the pacific and atlantic oceans since its first identification in 2010 gómez et al 2016 leaw et al 2016 in our previous study c malayensis was the most common benthic dinoflagellate observed in hong kong with 34 distinct strains isolated leung et al 2017 studies from various regions have similarly isolated strains of coolia malayensis and assessed their toxicities for instance c malayensis isolated from new zealand induced 50 morbidity in larval artemia salina brine shrimp after an 8 hour exposure and 50 morbidity after a 1 5 hour exposure in larval haliotis virginea abalone rhodes and thomas 1997 karafas et al 2015 reported that the crude toxin extract of a pacific strain of c malayensis is toxic to rhabdomyosarcoma cells derived from bone marrow of humans with a lc50 value of 1900 cells ml 1 another recent study has shown that c malayensis isolated from hong kong were toxic to marine invertebrates with lc50 values of 0 086 mg ml 1 and 0 016 mg ml 1 in brine shrimp and sea urchins respectively leung et al 2017 intraspecific variation in toxicity was also reported in isolates collected from different countries rhodes et al 2014b previously cooliatoxin cooliatin and putative analogues of yessotoxins were reported in coolia species holmes et al 1995 liang et al 2009 wakeman et al 2015 before the application of phylogenetic analysis in species identification of dinoflagellates some studies have misidentified c malayensis as c monotis and these misidentified strains have been re identified using molecular techniques and reassigned as c tropicalis or c malayensis leaw et al 2016 mohammad noor et al 2013 rhodes et al 2014b findings in these new reports imply that the toxic c malayensis could be distributed more widely than what has been reported and the risk of this toxin producing dinoflagellate therefore may be underestimated seawater temperature plays an important role in the physiological activities of various algal species it has been suggested that ocean warming and eutrophication may cause the distribution expansion of toxic algal species from the tropical areas to the higher latitude areas wells et al 2015 a report has shown that the proliferation of coolia in the north lake of tunis tunisia was positively correlated with seawater temperature armi et al 2010 the effect of temperature on the physiology of benthic dinoflagellates has been an emerging topic in recent years diverse responses from the different species have been reported for example pezzolesi et al 2012 reported that ostreopsis cf ovata collected from italy could survive from 20 to 30 c while the highest growth rate was found at 20 c another recent study has reported that prorocentrum lima can survive at a wider temperature range from 5 to 30 c with the optimum growth temperatures at 15 c and 25 c and the highest photosynthetic efficiency at 20 c aquino cruz et al 2018 decoupling of growth and quantum yield has been reported in coolia spp the effect of temperature on coolia is species specific aquino cruz and okilodov 2016 reported higher growth rates of c monotis at temperatures ranging from 15 to 25 c but the highest fv fm maximum quantum yield of psii values recorded were not associated with the optimum growth temperature the maximum growth rate of c malayensis collected from malaysia was higher at 30 c than at 25 c while no growth was observed at 20 and 35 c mohammad noor et al 2013 apart from affecting growth and photosynthesis a greater concern is the dependent effect of seawater temperature on the level of toxicities of the benthic dinoflagellates in the laboratory studies the variations on toxicities induced by temperature treatments have been observed in ostreopsis and prorocentrum the highest total toxin content on a per liter basis was recorded at 25 c in ostreopsis cf ovata pezzolesi et al 2012 the highest lipophilic toxicity of p lima was found at both low 10 15 c and elevated 30 c temperatures during the stationary growth phase while concentrations of free okadaic acid oa per cell increased with temperature up to 15 c aquino cruz et al 2018 under the limitation of phosphorus the toxin production of p hoffmannianum was enhanced at a higher temperature i e 27 c when compared to the algal cells maintained at 21 c accoroni et al 2018 effects of temperature on physiological activities and toxin production in different coolia species are largely unknown risks posed by c malayensis to the local marine ecosystem is an emerging concern in hong kong and its toxin producing mechanism is largely unknown therefore we aimed to evaluate the differential physiological responses of local isolates of c malayensis under exposure to seven temperatures spanning the ambient annual range 16 28 c that the species can survive the growth photosynthetic performance amounts of phaeo pigments toxicity and toxin content putative analogues of okadaic acid and azaspiracids of the algal samples after the temperature treatments were measured simultaneously to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on how temperature influences the physiological activities and toxin production of benthic dinoflagellate c malayensis the issue of global climate change and elevated seawater temperature has attracted increasing attention worldwide frame and stone 2013 against such a background the study will contribute to a better understanding of the responses of benthic algae to climate change and the associated emerging risks as well as provide supportive information to future studies on toxin producing mechanism in microalgae 2 materials

temperatures were shown in fig 1 the highest cell density was found at 24 c 1 0 1 3 104 cells ml 1 followed by those at 20 22 18 and 26 c the lowest abundance of cell number occurred at the two extreme temperatures of 16 c and 28 c the culture under 18 c was the earliest reaching its highest cell density i e at day 28 followed by cultures under 16 24 26 c i e at day 35 while the slowest were cultures under 20 22 28 c i e at day 42 under different temperatures the specific growth rates of c malayensis ranged from 0 049 to 0 100 day 1 the maximum growth rate was recorded at 24 c 0 100 day 1 during the exponential growth phase the specific growth rates under 18 20 and 22 c were significantly lower than 24 c one way anova p 0 05 with a range of 0 074 0 080 day 1 the cultures under 16 26 and 28 c had the lowest values of 0 049 0 055 day 1 fig 2 3 2 maximal quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry fv fm the fv fm values in the exponential growth phase were significantly different from the late stage growth phase under all temperature treatments two way anova p 0 05 the lowest fv fm 0 41 in the exponential growth phase occurred at 22 c fig 3 the values at 16 18 20 and 24 c were significantly higher than those at 22 c p 0 05 with the temperature elevated the fv fm increased from 22 to 28 c with a peak value 0 57 at 28 c in exponential growth phase on the contrary the lowest fv fm value in the late stage growth phase 0 35 was reported at 24 c both high 26 and 28 c and low temperatures 16 22 c could induce an increase of fv fm values in the late stage growth phase comparing to algal cultures under temperature treatment of 24 c with average values ranging from 0 40 to 0 50 3 3 pigment amounts in the exponential growth phase the lowest and the highest amounts of chlorophyll a b c carotenoids and total pigments were reached at 22 c and 28 c respectively figs 4 and s1 the individual and total pigment amounts were significantly higher at 26 and 28 c p 0 05 compared to other temperatures the amounts of chlorophyll a b c carotenoids and total pigments in the late stage growth phase of c malayensis cultures under seven temperature treatments were significantly different from those in the exponential growth phase fig s1 two way anova p 0 05 exposure to low 16 and 18 c and high temperatures 26 and 28 c induced significantly increased pigment

statistically significant negative correlation between the lc50 values and temperatures spearman r 0 6988 p 0 001 in addition the lc50 value of c malayensis extracts cultured at 16 c 0 31 mg ml 1 was significantly higher than at 26 c 0 074 mg ml 1 p 0 05 and 28 c 0 052 mg ml 1 p 0 01 interestingly the lc50 values of the toxic c malayensis extracts under seven temperature treatments to artemia

canariensis 3 5 toxin content the typical lats oa ytx dtx1 dtx2 aza1 aza2 and ptx2 were not detected in any of the samples however putative analogues of oa and aza1 were detected in the extracts under all the seven temperature treatments the eic of two transitions of three putative analogues are shown in fig s3 the concentrations of the detected putative analogues are shown in fig 5 the concentrations of each putative lipophilic algal toxin analogue detected in c malayensis cultures exposed to seven temperatures varied significantly one way anova p 0 05 the lowest concentration of putative oa analogue was detected in algal extracts from 16 c treatment 0 073 oaeq ng mg 1 while for putative aza1 analogue 1 and aza1 analogue 2 the lowest concentrations were detected in 20 c treatments 0 400 and 0 054 aza1eq pg mg 1 the concentrations of putative oa analogue aza1 analogue 1 and aza1 analogue 2 all peaked at 26 c with values of 0 21 oaeq ng mg 1 3 20 and 0 76 aza1eq pg mg 1 respectively the concentrations of putative aza1 analogue 1 and aza1 analogue 2 detected in c malayensis extracts had a significant correlation with temperatures at the 0 01 r 0 5439 and 0 05 r 0 4399 level respectively on the other hand the toxin contents of putative aza1 analogue 1 r 0 4850 p 0 01 and the putative oa analogue r 0 3908 p 0 05 were both significantly correlated to the lc50 values of c malayensis extracts 3 6 multivariate analyses pcoa on all the endpoints measured in the c malayensis cultures exposed to seven temperatures is shown in fig s4 two composite variables pco1

the low temperature treatments 16 and 18 c the high temperature treatments 26 and 28 c and the medium temperature treatments 20 22 and 24 c all endpoints of the c malayensis cultures exposed to seven temperatures differ significantly permanova p 0 001 as indicated by pair wise tests except temperature treatments of 20 and 22 c the endpoints under each temperature treatment were significantly different from the others at the 0 05 level table s4 4 discussion 4 1 effects of temperature on the growth fv fm and pigments of c malayensis previous work reported that c malayensis from florida did not survive below 20 c and its growth was restricted within the temperature range of 25 and 30 c leaw et al 2016 morton et al 1992 the optimum growth temperature of c malayensis isolated from malaysia was also between 25 0 49 day 1 and 30 c 0 66 day 1 it could not grow at a temperature below 20 or above 35 c mohammad noor et al 2013 however the c malayensis in the present study could survive and grow at a temperature that is relatively lower than the optimal growth temperature 24 0 5 c with a tolerant temperature range of 16 28 c this may be due to the phenotypic plasticity of the same species from different regions additionally interspecific variation on the growth temperature was also observed c monotis has a tolerant temperature range of 5 30 c while the tolerant temperature range of c malayensis in our study was observed at 16 28 c aquino cruz and okolodkov 2016 lewis et al 2018 the highest fv fm values in c monotis were not associated with the optimum growth temperature and when the temperature increased from 15 to 30 c the fv fm values decreased accordingly aquino cruz and okolodkov 2016 in our study decoupling of fv fm and growth was also observed higher fv fm values occurred at 16 18 26 and 28 c in exponential growth phase where c malayensis had relatively lower cell densities and growth rates the fv fm values measured were comparable to those in a previous study aquino cruz and okolodkov 2016 in other toxic benthic dinoflagellates amphidinium cf carterae and prorocentrum lima higher growth rates also induced relatively lower fv fm aquino cruz and okolodkov 2016 aquino cruz et al 2018 future investigations with more data on the morphological changes of cells and differential expression of genes associated with key phycological processes may help with determining the mechanisms driving the changes on photochemical efficiency the significantly higher amounts of total pigments in the late stage growth phase in algal samples from treatments 16 18 26 28 c than in the exponential growth phase suggests that pigment related biological activities e g photosynthesis varied between the exponential growth phase and late stage growth phase chlorophyll and carotenoid are presented as pigment protein complexes in chloroplasts and play an important role in photosynthesis lee 2008 the high amounts of chlorophyll a at 28 c and carotenoids at 16 c might be due to the different tolerant temperatures of corresponding enzymes that were necessary for biochemical reactions it has been reported that temperature changes can affect rubisco carbon fixation enzyme in photosynthesis activity and pigment levels in algae davison 1991 besides the expression of rubisco in benthic foraminifer also changed under extreme temperatures 34 c 8 c doo et al 2012 the maximum amount of chlorophyll a per cell in p lima occurred at the highest temperature 30 c aquino cruz et al 2018 in this study lower percentages of average chlorophyll c amounts 13 0 15 5 and higher percentages of average carotenoids amounts 23 7 26 0 were observed at 16 18 26 and 28 c in the exponential growth phase compared to what was observed between 20 24 c 17 4 18 3 and 18 7 21 4 respectively dinoflagellates might produce different pigments in response to their habitat which would cause the variation of pigment composition in benthic dinoflagellates under different environmental conditions yamada et al 2015 it was also reported that under environmental and cultural stress conditions some algae can produce active secondary metabolites by a carotenogenesis process to defend themselves takaichi 2011 this may be one of the reasons why higher percentages of average carotenoids amounts were observed at 16 18 26 and 28 c further research on carotenogenesis pathways in algae would help verify this the patterns of variation fig s4 under seven temperature treatments revealed significant temperature effects on the physiological activities of c malayensis cultures it seems that low middle and high temperatures induced different survival strategies of c malayensis cultures the adaption of enzymes under the three temperature ranges could be one important reason to verify the intrinsic mechanisms of c malayensis s physiological responses to temperature variations molecular approaches are highly recommended 4 2 effects of temperature on the toxicity of c malayensis the toxicity of c malayensis species collected from different locations under different environmental conditions could vary intra specifically i e some strains were toxic while the others were apparently non toxic to the testing organisms leaw et al 2016 leung et al 2017 mohammad noor et al 2013 rhodes et al 2000 rhodes et al 2014a b rhodes and thomas 1997 in this study the toxicity of c malayensis extracts to artemia larvae increased significantly with increasing temperature it has been reported that the lipophilic toxicity of p lima also increased under low 10 15 c and elevated 30 c temperatures during the late stage growth phase aquino cruz et al 2018 though the effect of temperature varies among algal species it seems higher toxicity of certain toxic algae tends to appear under stress conditions like extreme temperatures within their surviving thermal ranges a significant positive correlation between the fv fm values and the toxicities of c malayensis extracts was observed under seven temperature treatments the increase of cellular toxins during the exponential growth phase has been reported in other benthic dinoflagellates such as p lima pan et al 1999 previous research also illustrated that the chloroplast plays a vital role in toxin production oa and dtxs of prorocentrum spp lee et al 2016 the potential association of the production of specific toxin with the photosynthetic processes in c malayensis would deserve further investigation 4 3 effects of temperature on the toxin profiles of c malayensis the toxins produced by coolia species have been studied in several studies cooliatoxin cooliatin and compounds with derived molecular formulas of disulfated polyether analogues of ytx were reported holmes et al 1995 liang et al 2009 wakeman et al 2015 the toxins detected in c malayensis extracts in this study were three putative analogues of lats including oa analogue aza1 analogue 1 and aza1 analogue 2 these putative toxins were reported for the first time in c malayensis in our study the preferable toxin production temperatures among different genera of benthic dinoflagellates are different for prorocentrum lima the highest temperature 30 c induced the highest toxin production aquino cruz et al 2018 the toxin production of p hoffmannianum was enhanced at 27 c under p limitation conditions compared to the algal cells maintained at 21 c accoroni et al 2018 the toxin contents in lipophilic algal extracts of c malayensis increased with elevated temperatures and toxicity especially for putative aza1 analogue 1 and aza1 analogue 2 and the highest amount of three putative analogues of lats all recorded at 26 c it seems the toxin contents under stress conditions high temperature as well as the toxicity tends to be higher than that for normal conditions apart from a preferable temperature range for survival microalgae also have preferable environmental conditions for toxin production accoroni et al 2018 aquino cruz et al 2018 pezzolesi et al 2012 based on current information obtained the optimum growth condition for c malayensis does not completely correlate with the optimum condition for toxin production therefore when considering the toxicity of algae it is necessary to consider both their growth performance and cellular toxin production 5 conclusion as the primary producer in marine ecosystems toxic algae put various marine creatures in marine food web at risk even human beings this study contributes to the understanding of temperature effects on toxic benthic dinoflagellates which can produce biotoxins and form harmful algal blooms isolation of c malayensis from hong kong waters could survive at a temperature range of 16 c 28 c and its toxicity effects increased significantly as temperature elevated in addition putative analogues of oa and aza1 were detected in algal samples from seven temperature treatments with high amounts observed under high temperatures against the background of climate change the toxic c malayensis could be a potential emerging threat in subtropical e g hong kong waters under elevated temperature condition continuous field monitoring of this

17625,coolia malayensis is one of the commonly found benthic dinoflagellates in hong kong which can produce biotoxins and threaten the early life stages of marine invertebrates seawater temperature has been recognized as one of the primary environmental factors that affect the formation of harmful algal blooms the present study evaluated the responses of c malayensis including growth toxicity and toxin content putative analogues of okadaic acid and azaspiracids after exposure to a range of seven different temperatures i e 16 c 18 c 20 c 22 c 24 c 26 c and 28 c the highest algal density and specific growth rate were recorded at 24 c significantly higher fv fm maximum quantum yield of psii and total phaeo pigment values were observed in the exponential growth phase at 28 c the toxicity of the algal extract which was assessed by the lethality rate of artemia larvae increased with temperature the highest toxin content was detected at the second highest temperature treatment i e 26 c overall temperature had significant effects on the physiological activities and toxicity of c malayensis this study has raised attention to the potentially increasing risks posed by toxic benthic dinoflagellates during heat waves in coastal waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photosynthesis climate change lc ms ms algal toxin ocean warming south china sea 1 introduction in contrast to pelagic dinoflagellates benthic dinoflagellates tend to live on macroalgae coral reefs rocks sand and particles in coastal marine habitats gómez 2012 coolia is a genus of benthic dinoflagellates which are widely distributed mainly in warm waters and often co occur with other toxin producing epiphytic algal species belonging to multiple genera gambierdiscus prorocentrum ostreopsis fukuyoa and amphidinium aligizaki and nikolaidis 2006 almada et al 2017 rhodes and smith 2019 to date a total of seven coolia species have been identified from tropical sub tropical and temperate regions faust 1995 fraga et al 2008 karafas et al 2015 leaw et al 2010 meunier 1919 ten hage et al 2000 c malayensis has been found in many coastal areas of the pacific and atlantic oceans since its first identification in 2010 gómez et al 2016 leaw et al 2016 in our previous study c malayensis was the most common benthic dinoflagellate observed in hong kong with 34 distinct strains isolated leung et al 2017 studies from various regions have similarly isolated strains of coolia malayensis and assessed their toxicities for instance c malayensis isolated from new zealand induced 50 morbidity in larval artemia salina brine shrimp after an 8 hour exposure and 50 morbidity after a 1 5 hour exposure in larval haliotis virginea abalone rhodes and thomas 1997 karafas et al 2015 reported that the crude toxin extract of a pacific strain of c malayensis is toxic to rhabdomyosarcoma cells derived from bone marrow of humans with a lc50 value of 1900 cells ml 1 another recent study has shown that c malayensis isolated from hong kong were toxic to marine invertebrates with lc50 values of 0 086 mg ml 1 and 0 016 mg ml 1 in brine shrimp and sea urchins respectively leung et al 2017 intraspecific variation in toxicity was also reported in isolates collected from different countries rhodes et al 2014b previously cooliatoxin cooliatin and putative analogues of yessotoxins were reported in coolia species holmes et al 1995 liang et al 2009 wakeman et al 2015 before the application of phylogenetic analysis in species identification of dinoflagellates some studies have misidentified c malayensis as c monotis and these misidentified strains have been re identified using molecular techniques and reassigned as c tropicalis or c malayensis leaw et al 2016 mohammad noor et al 2013 rhodes et al 2014b findings in these new reports imply that the toxic c malayensis could be distributed more widely than what has been reported and the risk of this toxin producing dinoflagellate therefore may be underestimated seawater temperature plays an important role in the physiological activities of various algal species it has been suggested that ocean warming and eutrophication may cause the distribution expansion of toxic algal species from the tropical areas to the higher latitude areas wells et al 2015 a report has shown that the proliferation of coolia in the north lake of tunis tunisia was positively correlated with seawater temperature armi et al 2010 the effect of temperature on the physiology of benthic dinoflagellates has been an emerging topic in recent years diverse responses from the different species have been reported for example pezzolesi et al 2012 reported that ostreopsis cf ovata collected from italy could survive from 20 to 30 c while the highest growth rate was found at 20 c another recent study has reported that prorocentrum lima can survive at a wider temperature range from 5 to 30 c with the optimum growth temperatures at 15 c and 25 c and the highest photosynthetic efficiency at 20 c aquino cruz et al 2018 decoupling of growth and quantum yield has been reported in coolia spp the effect of temperature on coolia is species specific aquino cruz and okilodov 2016 reported higher growth rates of c monotis at temperatures ranging from 15 to 25 c but the highest fv fm maximum quantum yield of psii values recorded were not associated with the optimum growth temperature the maximum growth rate of c malayensis collected from malaysia was higher at 30 c than at 25 c while no growth was observed at 20 and 35 c mohammad noor et al 2013 apart from affecting growth and photosynthesis a greater concern is the dependent effect of seawater temperature on the level of toxicities of the benthic dinoflagellates in the laboratory studies the variations on toxicities induced by temperature treatments have been observed in ostreopsis and prorocentrum the highest total toxin content on a per liter basis was recorded at 25 c in ostreopsis cf ovata pezzolesi et al 2012 the highest lipophilic toxicity of p lima was found at both low 10 15 c and elevated 30 c temperatures during the stationary growth phase while concentrations of free okadaic acid oa per cell increased with temperature up to 15 c aquino cruz et al 2018 under the limitation of phosphorus the toxin production of p hoffmannianum was enhanced at a higher temperature i e 27 c when compared to the algal cells maintained at 21 c accoroni et al 2018 effects of temperature on physiological activities and toxin production in different coolia species are largely unknown risks posed by c malayensis to the local marine ecosystem is an emerging concern in hong kong and its toxin producing mechanism is largely unknown therefore we aimed to evaluate the differential physiological responses of local isolates of c malayensis under exposure to seven temperatures spanning the ambient annual range 16 28 c that the species can survive the growth photosynthetic performance amounts of phaeo pigments toxicity and toxin content putative analogues of okadaic acid and azaspiracids of the algal samples after the temperature treatments were measured simultaneously to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on how temperature influences the physiological activities and toxin production of benthic dinoflagellate c malayensis the issue of global climate change and elevated seawater temperature has attracted increasing attention worldwide frame and stone 2013 against such a background the study will contribute to a better understanding of the responses of benthic algae to climate change and the associated emerging risks as well as provide supportive information to future studies on toxin producing mechanism in microalgae 2 materials

temperatures were shown in fig 1 the highest cell density was found at 24 c 1 0 1 3 104 cells ml 1 followed by those at 20 22 18 and 26 c the lowest abundance of cell number occurred at the two extreme temperatures of 16 c and 28 c the culture under 18 c was the earliest reaching its highest cell density i e at day 28 followed by cultures under 16 24 26 c i e at day 35 while the slowest were cultures under 20 22 28 c i e at day 42 under different temperatures the specific growth rates of c malayensis ranged from 0 049 to 0 100 day 1 the maximum growth rate was recorded at 24 c 0 100 day 1 during the exponential growth phase the specific growth rates under 18 20 and 22 c were significantly lower than 24 c one way anova p 0 05 with a range of 0 074 0 080 day 1 the cultures under 16 26 and 28 c had the lowest values of 0 049 0 055 day 1 fig 2 3 2 maximal quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry fv fm the fv fm values in the exponential growth phase were significantly different from the late stage growth phase under all temperature treatments two way anova p 0 05 the lowest fv fm 0 41 in the exponential growth phase occurred at 22 c fig 3 the values at 16 18 20 and 24 c were significantly higher than those at 22 c p 0 05 with the temperature elevated the fv fm increased from 22 to 28 c with a peak value 0 57 at 28 c in exponential growth phase on the contrary the lowest fv fm value in the late stage growth phase 0 35 was reported at 24 c both high 26 and 28 c and low temperatures 16 22 c could induce an increase of fv fm values in the late stage growth phase comparing to algal cultures under temperature treatment of 24 c with average values ranging from 0 40 to 0 50 3 3 pigment amounts in the exponential growth phase the lowest and the highest amounts of chlorophyll a b c carotenoids and total pigments were reached at 22 c and 28 c respectively figs 4 and s1 the individual and total pigment amounts were significantly higher at 26 and 28 c p 0 05 compared to other temperatures the amounts of chlorophyll a b c carotenoids and total pigments in the late stage growth phase of c malayensis cultures under seven temperature treatments were significantly different from those in the exponential growth phase fig s1 two way anova p 0 05 exposure to low 16 and 18 c and high temperatures 26 and 28 c induced significantly increased pigment

statistically significant negative correlation between the lc50 values and temperatures spearman r 0 6988 p 0 001 in addition the lc50 value of c malayensis extracts cultured at 16 c 0 31 mg ml 1 was significantly higher than at 26 c 0 074 mg ml 1 p 0 05 and 28 c 0 052 mg ml 1 p 0 01 interestingly the lc50 values of the toxic c malayensis extracts under seven temperature treatments to artemia

all the seven temperature treatments the eic of two transitions of three putative analogues are shown in fig s3 the concentrations of the detected putative analogues are shown in fig 5 the concentrations of each putative lipophilic algal toxin analogue detected in c malayensis cultures exposed to seven temperatures varied significantly one way anova p 0 05 the lowest concentration of putative oa analogue was detected in algal extracts from 16 c treatment 0 073 oaeq ng mg 1 while for putative aza1 analogue 1 and aza1 analogue 2 the lowest concentrations were detected in 20 c treatments 0 400 and 0 054 aza1eq pg mg 1 the concentrations of putative oa analogue aza1 analogue 1 and aza1 analogue 2 all peaked at 26 c with values of 0 21 oaeq ng mg 1 3 20 and 0 76 aza1eq pg mg

the low temperature treatments 16 and 18 c the high temperature treatments 26 and 28 c and the medium temperature treatments 20 22 and 24 c all endpoints of the c malayensis cultures exposed to seven temperatures differ significantly permanova p 0 001 as indicated by pair wise tests except temperature treatments of 20 and 22 c the endpoints under each temperature treatment were significantly different from the others at the 0 05 level table s4 4 discussion 4 1 effects of temperature on the growth fv fm and pigments of c malayensis previous work reported that c malayensis from florida did not survive below 20 c and its growth was restricted within the temperature range of 25 and 30 c leaw et al 2016 morton et al 1992 the optimum growth temperature of c malayensis isolated from malaysia was also between 25 0 49 day 1 and 30 c 0 66 day 1 it could not grow at a temperature below 20 or above 35 c mohammad noor et al 2013 however the c malayensis in the present study could survive and grow at a temperature that is relatively lower than the optimal growth temperature 24 0 5 c with a tolerant temperature range of 16 28 c this may be due to the phenotypic plasticity of the same species from different regions additionally interspecific variation on the growth temperature was also observed c monotis has a tolerant temperature range of 5 30 c while the tolerant temperature range of c malayensis in our study was observed at 16 28 c aquino cruz and okolodkov 2016 lewis et al 2018 the highest fv fm values in c monotis were not associated with the optimum growth temperature and when the temperature increased from 15 to 30 c the fv fm values decreased accordingly aquino cruz and okolodkov 2016 in our study decoupling of fv fm and growth was also observed higher fv fm values occurred at 16 18 26 and 28 c in exponential growth phase where c malayensis had relatively lower cell densities and growth rates the fv fm values measured were comparable to those in a previous study aquino cruz and okolodkov 2016 in other toxic benthic dinoflagellates amphidinium cf carterae and prorocentrum lima higher growth rates also induced relatively lower fv fm aquino cruz and okolodkov 2016 aquino cruz et al 2018 future investigations with more data on the morphological changes of cells and differential expression of genes associated with key phycological processes may help with determining the mechanisms driving the changes on photochemical efficiency the significantly higher amounts of total pigments in the late stage growth phase in algal samples from treatments 16 18 26 28 c than in the exponential growth phase suggests that pigment related biological activities e g photosynthesis varied between the exponential growth phase and late stage growth phase chlorophyll and carotenoid are presented as pigment protein complexes in chloroplasts and play an important role in photosynthesis lee 2008 the high amounts of chlorophyll a at 28 c and carotenoids at 16 c might be due to the different tolerant temperatures of corresponding enzymes that were necessary for biochemical reactions it has been reported that temperature changes can affect rubisco carbon fixation enzyme in photosynthesis activity and pigment levels in algae davison 1991 besides the expression of rubisco in benthic foraminifer also changed under extreme temperatures 34 c 8 c doo et al 2012 the maximum amount of chlorophyll a per cell in p lima occurred at the highest temperature 30 c aquino cruz et al 2018 in this study lower percentages of average chlorophyll c amounts 13 0 15 5 and higher percentages of average carotenoids amounts 23 7 26 0 were observed at 16 18 26 and 28 c in the exponential growth phase compared to what was observed between 20 24 c 17 4 18 3 and 18 7 21 4 respectively dinoflagellates might produce different pigments in response to their habitat which would cause the variation of pigment composition in benthic dinoflagellates under different environmental conditions yamada et al 2015 it was also reported that under environmental and cultural stress conditions some algae can produce active secondary metabolites by a carotenogenesis process to defend themselves takaichi 2011 this may be one of the reasons why higher percentages of average carotenoids amounts were observed at 16 18 26 and 28 c further research on carotenogenesis pathways in algae would help verify this the patterns of variation fig s4 under seven temperature treatments revealed significant temperature effects on the physiological activities of c malayensis cultures it seems that low middle and high temperatures induced different survival strategies of c malayensis cultures the adaption of enzymes under the three temperature ranges could be one important reason to verify the intrinsic mechanisms of c malayensis s physiological responses to temperature variations molecular approaches are highly recommended 4 2 effects of temperature on the toxicity of c malayensis the toxicity of c malayensis species collected from different locations under different environmental conditions could vary intra specifically i e some strains were toxic while the others were apparently non toxic to the testing organisms leaw et al 2016 leung et al 2017 mohammad noor et al 2013 rhodes et al 2000 rhodes et al 2014a b rhodes and thomas 1997 in this study the toxicity of c malayensis extracts to artemia larvae increased significantly with increasing temperature it has been reported that the lipophilic toxicity of p lima also increased under low 10 15 c and elevated 30 c temperatures during the late stage growth phase aquino cruz et al 2018 though the effect of temperature varies among algal species it seems higher toxicity of certain toxic algae tends to appear under stress conditions like extreme temperatures within their surviving thermal ranges a significant positive correlation between the fv fm values and the toxicities of c malayensis extracts was observed under seven temperature treatments the increase of cellular toxins during the exponential growth phase has been reported in other benthic dinoflagellates such as p lima pan et al 1999 previous research also illustrated that the chloroplast plays a vital role in toxin production oa and dtxs of prorocentrum spp lee et al 2016 the potential association of the production of specific toxin with the photosynthetic processes in c malayensis would deserve further investigation 4 3 effects of temperature on the toxin profiles of c malayensis the toxins produced by coolia species have been studied in several studies cooliatoxin cooliatin and compounds with derived molecular formulas of disulfated polyether analogues of ytx were reported holmes et al 1995 liang et al 2009 wakeman et al 2015 the toxins detected in c malayensis extracts in this study were three putative analogues of lats including oa analogue aza1 analogue 1 and aza1 analogue 2 these putative toxins were reported for the first time in c malayensis in our study the preferable toxin production temperatures among different genera of benthic dinoflagellates are different for prorocentrum lima the highest temperature 30 c induced the highest toxin production aquino cruz et al 2018 the toxin production of p hoffmannianum was enhanced at 27 c under p limitation conditions compared to the algal cells maintained at 21 c accoroni et al 2018 the toxin contents in lipophilic algal extracts of c malayensis increased with elevated temperatures and toxicity especially for putative aza1 analogue 1 and aza1 analogue 2 and the highest amount of three putative analogues of lats all recorded at 26 c it seems the toxin contents under stress conditions high temperature as well as the toxicity tends to be higher than that for normal conditions apart from a preferable temperature range for survival microalgae also have preferable environmental conditions for toxin production accoroni et al 2018 aquino cruz et al 2018 pezzolesi et al 2012 based on current information obtained the optimum growth condition for c malayensis does not completely correlate with the optimum condition for toxin production therefore when considering the toxicity of algae it is necessary to consider both their growth performance and cellular toxin production 5 conclusion as the primary producer in marine ecosystems toxic algae put various marine creatures in marine food web at risk even human beings this study contributes to the understanding of temperature effects on toxic benthic dinoflagellates which can produce biotoxins and form harmful algal blooms isolation of c malayensis from hong kong waters could survive at a temperature range of 16 c 28 c and its toxicity effects increased significantly as temperature elevated in addition putative analogues of oa and aza1 were detected in algal samples from seven temperature treatments with high amounts observed under high temperatures against the background of climate change the toxic c malayensis could be a potential emerging threat in subtropical e g hong kong waters under elevated temperature condition continuous field monitoring of this

17626,the flowback water fw from shale gas exploitation can be effectively treated by bioelectrochemical technology but sulfide overproduction remains to be addressed herein sulfate reducing bacteria srb meditated microbial fuel cells mfcs with anodic potential control were used cod removal gradually increased to 67 4 5 1 in electrode potential control epc mfcs and 78 9 2 4 in the mfc with open circuit oc mfc however in epc mfcs sulfate removal stabilized at much lower levels no more than 19 9 1 9 along with much lower sulfide concentrations but in oc mfc it increased and finally stabilized at 59 9 0 1 partial sulfur reuse in epc mfcs was indicated by the current production notably thiosulfate was specially detected under low potentials and effectively oxidized in epc mfcs especially under 0 1 v vs she which probably related to the sulfur reuse metagenomics analysis showed that the anode with 0 1 and 0 2 v likely shunted electrons from cytochromes that used for reducing dsrc s0 trisulfide and thus contributed to producing thiosulfate and decreasing sulfide production meanwhile the anode with 0 1 v specially accumulated sulfur oxidizing system sox genes regarding thiosulfate and sulfite oxidation to sulfate which concurred to the effective thiosulfate oxidation and also indicated the possible direct sulfite oxidation to sulfate during the sulfur cycling but the anode of 0 2 v highly accumulated genes for thiosulfate and sulfite reduction both anodes also distinctly accumulated genes regarding thiosulfate oxidation to tetrathionate and sulfide oxidation to sulfur or polysulfide further sulfur oxidizing bacteria were specially enriched in epc mfcs and likely contributed to thiosulfate and sulfite oxidation thus we suggested that the higher electrode potential e g 0 1 v can shape a cryptic sulfur cycling in which sulfate was first reduced to sulfite and then reoxidized to sulfate by forming thiosulfate as an important intermediate or by direct sulfite oxidation the results provide new sights on the bioelectrochemical treatment of wastewater containing complex organics and sulfate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioelectrochemical system anodic potential sulfur cycling thiosulfate flowback water treatment 1 introduction a huge amount of flowback water fw produced from shale gas exploitation mainly contains high salinity complex organics sulfate and heavy metals thus posing a significant challenge the organic matters and sulfate in fw can cause proliferation of sulfate reducing bacteria srb during the temporal storage of fw in surface impoundments or tanks which will not only result in clogging and reservoir souring but also promote microbially influenced corrosion in storage tanks jain et al 2017 reservoir souring due to srb in oil fields also causes severe problems and results in huge economic loss in industries johnson et al 2017 a srb mediated bioelectrochemical system bes has advantages for this wastewater treatment because of its high salinity tolerance simultaneous removal of complex organics and heavy metals power generation and decreased sludge production jain et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however sulfide overproduction in this process is still a problem as it will inhibit heavy metal removal and deteriorate reservoir souring mokone et al 2012 in biological sulfate reduction process sulfate is first activated to adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps by sulfate adenylyltransferase and then reduced to sulfite e0 aps hso3 60 mv by adenylylsulfate reductase with electrons supplied by quinone modifying oxidoreductase qmoabc keller et al 2014 but the reduction of sulfite to sulfide e0 116 mv is presently treated as a black box current findings overwhelmingly support that sulfite is reduced by a dissimilatory sulfite reductase complex dsrab c firstly sulfite is reduced to s2 by dsrab and then to dsrc s0 santos et al 2015 secondly the dsrc s0 trisulfide is proposed to be reduced to sulfide and reduced dsrcr by the membrane bound sulfite reductase of dsrmkjop complex santos et al 2015 in this process type i tetraheme cytochrome c3 tpic3 e0 290 mv is supposed to transfer electrons to dsrmkjop for trisulfide bond reduction bishop et al 2013 santos et al 2015 thus during sulfite reduction many involved enzymes are electroactive and the redox potential for each step of sulfur transformation is different which enlighten the possible control of sulfate reduction by the electrochemistry cytochrome c of desulfovibrio desulfuricans has been reported to efficiently attach to the electrode and transfer electrons directly kang et al 2014 furthermore soluble fe3 as a competing electron acceptor that similar to a electrode under certatin potential has been demonstrated to totally inhibit sulfate reduction because periplasmic fe3 reduction could shortcut electron flow and eliminate electron delivery back to the cytoplasm for indirect sulfate reduction elias et al 2004 in addition in the reactors with the anode potential of 0 0 or 0 3 v vs ag agcl no obvious sulfate reduction had been found in the first 58days daghio et al 2015 which further indicated the electrode under certain potential may impact sulfate reduction the power generation and microbial community formation in mfcs with the anode potential of 0 3 v have also been investigated but not how the sulfur cycled chou et al 2013 2014 sulfur cycling in a bes without potential control has already been reported that sulfide produced from sulfate reduction was oxidized on the electrode to sulfur which was then reduced back to sulfide by acetate oxidizing bacteria as the electron acceptor dutta et al 2009 but how sulfur cycling performs under certain potential is still unclear whether we can apply the potential to regulate sulfate reduction process to avoid high sulfide production remains unknown how the sulfate metabolism performs under controlled potential at the molecular level has not been studied in this study sulfur cycling under controlled anode potentials was first studied to avoid high sulfide production but gain efficient organics removal during fw treatment in bess the interaction between different sulfur species under the different potential was focused and a novel sulfur cycling shaped by electrode potential was proposed furthermore 16s rrna and metagenomic analysis were conducted to elucidate the cryptic sulfur cycling mechanism at the molecular level the results provide new inspiration in treating fw by the bes 2 materials and methods 2 1 mfc construction and wastewater the mfc consisted of two 180 ml chambers separated by a nafion 117 proton exchange membrane fuel cell store us a carbon brush and a circular 1071 hcb carbon felt with projected surface area of 19 63 cm2 were used as the anodic and cathodic electrode respectively the synthetic fw used in this research was made based on our former research zhang et al 2018 with an adjustment and contained 1108 87 mg cod l 1936 9 95 4 mg so4 2 l 15 600 mg salinity l 133 mg anionic polyacrylamide pam l and 5 0 mg fe3 l with the ph of 7 0 0 1 those complex organics in the synthetic fw were elaborated in table s1 as functional components based on the disclosed industry formulas of hydraulic fracturing fluid stringfellow et al 2014 and the inorganic ions were shown in table s2 based on our former research zhang et al 2018 in the last cycle 1131 0 mg s2o3 2 l instead of sulfate was used as sulfur source in the synthetic fw a saline mixture of 50 mm k3fe cn 6 and 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 was used as catholyte 2 2 source of inoculum and mfc operation mfcs were initially seeded with anodic effluent from a mature srb mediated mfc in our laboratory at 8 3 v v of the anode chamber volume four anode potentials of 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v vs she were applied on ten different mfcs with triplicates under 0 2 and 0 0 v and duplicates under 0 1 and 0 2 v two other mfcs worked in open circuit as control designated as oc mfc after inoculation the anolyte was purged with a gas mixture of n2 co2 80 20 for 30 min before the anodic chamber was sealed to maintain an anaerobic microenvironment mfcs were operated in fed batch mode under ambient conditions for 130 days involving three phases in phase 1 mfcs were running under the hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 days in phase 2 the hrt was prolonged to 20 days in cycle 5 and 7 but reverted to 10 days in cycle 6 8 and 9 in phase 3 one of epc systems under each potential was converted into open circuit after that thiosulfate containing fw was used as the anodic influent to further study biological thiosulfate transformation in those systems the effluent was removed by syringes gas collecting bags full of n2 were used to balance pressure in reactors during sampling 2 3 electrochemical measurement and chemical analysis the anode potential was set with chronoamperometry by using an ivium n stat multi channel electrochemical workstation ivium netherlands ag agcl reference electrode was placed in the anodic chamber the coulombic efficiency ce was calculated as the percent of the electron number involved in the current to that involved in the whole removed cod cod was measured by an improved measurement for fw cardona et al 2016 with the use of a hgso4 cl ratio of 20 1 for pretreatment and an digestion solution of 14 7 g l k2cr2o7 based on our sample concentration the concentrations of sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate anions in the anolyte following 0 45 μm filtration were detected via a dionex ics 5000 ion chromatograph with an as18 column and naoh gradient elution at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 0 1 formaldehyde was added into the sample to protect sulfite from being oxidized sulfide concentration was measured using the methylene blue method lee et al 2014 elements on the surface of the used and clean anodes were analyzed employing a jeol jsm 7800f scanning electron microscope sem coupled with an energy dispersive x ray edx detector sangcharoen et al 2015 the sulfur valences accumulating on the used anode and precipitates were determined via an x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps thermo scientific escalab 250xi by recording the sulfur xps spectra 2 4 16s rrna library construction and metagenomics analysis the microbial community structures from the anode and anolyte in epc systems and oc mfc were determined using v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene the region was amplified using bacterial primers 338f and 806r the details for the construction of 16s rrna gene library and bioinformatics analysis were the same with our former research zhang et al 2018 metagenomic analysis was performed on the whole microbial community dna of the anodes from 0 2 and 0 1 v systems and oc mfc to further investigate the impact of electrode potentials on sulfate reduction at the molecular level the biofilm samples were taken rapidly together with anodes in a sterilized anaerobic glove box and then transferred into tubes after being cut into small pieces for total genomic dna extraction the details of dna extraction non redundant gene catalog construction and functional annotation were provided in the supplementary document representative sequences of non redundant gene catalog were aligned for taxonomic annotations including cluster of orthologous groups of proteins cog and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg read counts were normalized as rpkm value reads per kilobase per million mapped reads lawson et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfate removal sulfate removal showed no obvious increase in epc systems but kept increasing in oc mfc fig 1 and s1a as the reactors kept running the average sulfate removal efficiency slightly increased to 19 9 1 9 under 0 2 v in phase 2 with 10 days hrt but kept around 13 2 under both 0 1 and 0 0 v except 0 2 v 10 6 3 0 likely due to electrochemical oxidation daghio et al 2018 it significantly increased in oc mfc during phase 2 to 47 9 17 6 but stabilized at 59 9 0 1 the efficiency was even lower in all epc reactors in phase 2 with 20 days hrt and decreased with the rise of potential with 14 0 2 5 13 1 0 8 9 6 4 2 and 6 4 4 6 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively but was still much higher in oc mfc up to 53 0 3 8 thus sulfate reduction was likely impacted by the anode potential and prolonged hrt may also do influence during sulfate reduction thiosulfate and sulfide were detected but with much lower concentrations in epc systems thiosulfate only existed under 0 2 and 0 1 v in phase 1 at very small quantities 0 8 0 1 and 1 0 0 6 mg l respectively but it gradually increased up to 32 0 7 4 mg l with time in oc mfc fig 1c and decreased sharply to 2 1 0 8 mg l when hrt was prolonged in phase 2 thus some special sulfur metabolism likely occurred under the prolonged hrt as for sulfide it kept at a low level from 0 to 11 7 1 1 mg l in all epc systems but significantly increased in oc mfc from 0 2 to 83 4 7 4 mg l fig 1d meanwhile the molar ratio of sulfide produced to sulfate removed in epc systems was also much lower than that in oc mfc shown in fig s1d sulfide in all epc systems tended to be 0 mg l under the prolonged hrt in phase 2 which was similar to another study with sob functioning in the system zhang et al 2018 the very low sulfide concentration under 0 2 v could be attributed to electrochemical oxidation daghio et al 2018 meanwhile some elemental sulfur s0 accumulated on all epc anodes according to xps results fig s2 which likely also related to biological activity and contributed to the low sulfide concentration 3 2 cod removal and electricity production as electron donors for sulfate reduction cod removal gradually increased in all of those reactors fig 2 and s1b which did not concur with the sulfate removal in epc systems the average efficiency increased to 67 4 5 1 in phase 2 under 0 2 v with 10 days hrt it also increased to 65 7 6 3 under 0 0 v to around 58 under both 0 1 and 0 2 v though the sulfate removals showed no obvious increase this efficiency also increased in oc mfc to 78 9 2 4 but along with high sulfate removal likely due to the ability of srb to degrade complex organics in fw daghio et al 2018 rabus et al 2013 jain et al 2017 furthermore the efficiency was higher with rising potential under prolonged hrt in phase 2 with 63 3 8 1 63 1 13 9 72 5 4 5 and 74 4 7 4 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively it also stabilized at a higher level in oc mfc of 82 6 3 2 which agreed with its much high sulfate removal though cod removal efficiency in epc systems was a bit lower than in oc mfc it was very interesting that the percentage of cod theoretically used for sulfate reduction based on the sulfate removal efficiency to total cod removed psr cr in epc systems was much lower than in oc mfc fig 2b and decreased with rising potential the average psr cr decreased to 31 0 2 3 24 8 7 8 22 9 8 0 and 21 5 9 3 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively in phase 2 with 10 days hrt but it significantly increased in oc mfc and stabilized at 82 5 18 1 the percentage in all epc systems under prolonged hrt in phase 2 was even lower with 26 0 2 3 24 7 3 1 15 4 6 5 and 10 0 6 5 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively but was still much higher in oc mfc up to 56 0 21 4 however only the low percentage under 0 2 v can be attributed to the electrochemical oxidation of sulfide to sulfate data not shown therefore the electrode potential likely influenced sulfate reduction in epc systems and a higher potential seemed to benefit cod removal especially under prolonged hrt but psr cr was less than 100 in all reactors which indicated that partial sulfate may be reused by cycling for organics removal or that some organics may be removed by bacteria without reducing sulfate this reason was further studied in the following sections as the key connection of sulfur cycling to the electrode current production gradually increased in epc systems the peak current was higher under lower potential and occurred increasingly early fig s3 but the number of electrons involved in current production was the lowest under 0 2 v and higher under 0 1 and 0 0 v shown in fig 2c the peak current increased to 2 51 0 59 2 49 0 60 1 96 0 48 and 1 17 0 22 ma under 10 days hrt in phase 2 but accompanying with 310 9 25 3 373 3 19 1 354 9 24 0 and 349 9 24 5 c of electrons from the current fig 2c under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively those peak currents and electron numbers all rose under prolonged hrt in phase 2 following the similar trend under 10 days hrt the increased peak current and rapid start time under low potentials were likely due to the proposed promotion of microbial colonization by the anode potential for adaptation and energy efficiency maximization chou et al 2013 but the different electron number from the current likely related to the different performance of electricity producing bacteria and srb under specific potentials further by calculating the ratio of electrons from the current to that from the remaining removed organics except that theoretically used for sulfate reduction rec eo we found that this ratio rapidly increased to high levels in phase 1 shown in fig s4 but significantly decreased in phase 2 even under 20 days hrt though the remaining removed organics were much higher thus electricity producing bacteria with high activity could not be the main reason for the unstable rec eo electrons come from the remaining removed cod were probably overestimated which meant the real cod removal by sulfate reduction should be more than that theoretically calculated thus partial sulfur reuse likely existed in epc systems and did important contribution to the psr cr less than 100 meanwhile ce kept the lowest under 0 2 v but the highest under 0 1 v likely due to the efficient conversion of electrons from the removed cod to the current instead of the reduced sulfur compound under 0 1 v shown in fig s4d thus the partial sulfur reuse likely also contributed to the higher amount of electrons harvested in the currents under certain higher potential 3 3 sulfate transformation the further study of sulfate removal process during phase 2 showed that sulfate concentration in epc systems almost stabilized during the second half of the cycle but still decreased very obviously in oc mfc fig s5 however cod concentration decreased in all reactors during this period and resulted in low psr cr in epc systems rec eo in this cycle was also very low therefore special sulfur cycling likely occurred accepting electrons from cod removal in epc systems especially during the second half of the cycle notably significantly lower peak sulfide was detected in epc systems and decreased with rising potential sulfide concentration obviously decreased during the second half of the cycle in epc systems likely due to the bio electrochemical oxidation to sulfur on the anode and polysulfide in the precipitation fig s2 and s6 which may also result in the lower ratio of sulfide produced to sulfate removed but this oxidation could not be the main reason for the low peak sulfide concentration because it cannot contribute to the low psr cr in epc systems meanwhile the decrease of sulfate removal and the conversion of sulfide and thiosulfate under prolonged hrt in epc systems could be caused by more obvious sob metabolism as less cod was removed during the second half of the cycle in addition no sulfite was found in either epc systems or oc mfcs which were similar to the former study zhang et al 2018 and probably caused by quick sulfite conversion thiosulfate was also only detected under 0 2 and 0 1 v at very low concentrations 0 4 7 and 0 1 4 mg l respectively and decreased to zero during the second half of the cycle this concentration was higher 0 45 0 mg l in oc mfc and also decreased during the cycle likely due to srb metabolism jorgensen 1990 thiosulfate was regarded as an important product instead of sulfide in vitro sulfite reduction rabus et al 2013 and may greatlyd contribute to the low peak sulfide production in epc systems it was supposed to be produced by the absence or inhibition of dissimilatory sulfite reductase c oliveira et al 2008 which may be caused by the anodes with different potentials in those epc systems and was further studied in the following sections the much lower thiosulfate concentration in epc systems may related to the specific sulfur cycling to further study the impact of electrode potential on the specific sulfur cycling one of the parallel epc systems under each potential was changed into open circuit in phase 3 then sulfate removal became more efficient accompanying with sharply increased sulfide concentration in all of those open circuit epc systems fig 3 cod removal all became less efficient fig 3b along with psr cr increase in all open circuit epc systems table s3 the rec eo under each potential in this cycle was still lower than that gained in phase 1 furthermore thiosulfate then accumulated to around 4 mg l in all those open circuit epc systems which likely due to this special mode without bio electrochemical transformation on those anodes but the concentration was still lower than in oc mfc probably because of the different microbial community formed under controlled potential thus the impact of anode potentials on sulfate reduction and the existence of specific sulfur cycling were further confirmed thiosulfate was an important intermediate and its behavior was found to be associated with the anode potential 3 4 thiosulfate transformation thiosulfate was used as the substrate to investigate thiosulfate transformation in epc systems it was effectively removed in all epc systems and oc mfc with higher efficiency under 0 2 and 0 1 v than in oc mfc but lower efficiency under 0 0 and 0 2 v producing sulfate and sulfide fig 4 notably the molar ratios of sulfate produced to thiosulfate removed in epc systems were much higher than in oc mfc fig 4b the ratio was the highest of 0 41 0 06 under 0 1 v which likely related to the proper potential and stabilized at 0 34 0 03 and 0 33 0 01 under 0 2 and 0 0 v respectively it was very high at 0 68 under 0 2 v on day 3 due to the electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfate under this high potential but gradually decreased to 0 38 likely due to biological sulfate reduction sulfate was also produced in oc mfc but at a quite low ratio of 0 17 0 02 which indicated that microbial thiosulfate oxidation was much stronger in epc systems than in oc mfc especially under 0 1 v thiosulfate reportedly to be oxidized by lithotrophic sulfur bacteria once there were proper electron acceptors jorgensen 1990 which concurred to the condition in epc systems with different potential control anodes thiosulfate dehydrogenase or sulfur oxidizing system sox involved in lithotrophic sulfur bacteria can oxidize thiosulfate to sulfate denkmann et al 2012 liu et al 2018 regarding the sulfate in oc mfc it could be caused by thiosulfate disproportion as well especially during the second half of the cycle as many srb were identified to disproportionate thiosulfate when there was no proper electron acceptor kriimer and cypionka 1989 jorgensen 1990 during this process sulfide also behaved differently the molar ratio of sulfide produced to thiosulfate removed under 0 2 v changed very obviously from 0 31 at day 3 to 0 04 at day 10 it also changed quickly from 0 23 to nearly 0 under 0 1 v very little sulfide was detected under either 0 0 or 0 2 v which meant high sulfide oxidation ability in those systems on the contrary this ratio was much higher in oc mfc and changed from 0 43 at day 3 to 0 25 0 03 at day 10 therefore oc mfc showed higher preference in thiosulfate reduction to sulfide which likely related to the high biological sulfate reduction capacity in this reactor as thiosulfate can be reduced to sulfide by most of srb with organic matters in the system jorgensen 1990 the total molar ratio of sulfate and sulfide produced to thiosulfate removed was less than 1 which likely related to the accumulation of s0 and sn 2 on the surface of anodes and precipitates fig s2 and s6 then the relatively lower sulfate formation than sulfide production under potential control probably related to the too high thiosulfate concentration because it was far higher than that detected in all those systems and might beyond the oxidation capacity of sob in epc system thus thiosulfate behavior was further confirmed to correspond to anode potentials along with effective biological thiosulfate oxidation in epc systems which likely contributed to the low sulfate removal low psr cr and low sulfide production 3 5 microbial community analysis over 50 000 effective sequences were obtained for each sample table s4 and could reasonably represent the microbial communities based on the formed rarefaction curves fig s7 at the phylum level proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes all dominated at both the anode and anolyte with relative abundances more than 10 fig 5 bacteroidetes and firmicutes have been reported to link with fermentation and hydrolysis and dominate in the mfc treating raw landfill leachate kumar et al 2017 proteobacteria generally contains anode respiring bacteria srb and sob muyzer and stams 2008 3 5 1 fermentative families regarding organics degradation carnobacteriaceae was the most abundant on the anode of epc systems 30 with the highest of 68 2 under 0 1 v oc mfc 27 7 fig 5a and also very abundant in the anolyte of epc systems except 0 1 v only 2 8 fig 5b the genus of trichococcus within this family can produce lactic acid acetate and formate from various carbohydrates which then could benefit sulfate reduction stams et al 2009 prolixibacteraceae 43 3 and carnobacteriaceae 83 7 were the most abundant families from the anode and anolyte respectively in oc mfc in addition some other families including porphyromonadaceae 7 3 18 3 in all epc reactors clostridiaceae 1 and family xii o clostridiales totalled at 2 7 3 6 and 1 3 under 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively were specially accumulated on epc anodes prolixibacteraceae 9 3 17 4 in all epc reactors clostridiaceae 0 1 v 28 0 0 0 v 40 8 h2 producing spirochaetaceae 0 2 v 8 3 were specially enriched in anolyte of epc systems the last one was also enriched on oc mfc anode 6 6 those families likely formed important links between fermentative bacteria and srb due to the ability of fermentatively producing some small molecular organics and h2 wust et al 2011 clostridiaceae also reportedly to degrade pam effectively joshi and abed 2017 furthermore complex organics degraders including cellulomonadacea nocardiaceae and desulfobulbaceae were specially dominated on the anode of epc systems totalled at 1 7 2 3 4 0 and 2 2 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively and likely contributed to complex organics removal ye et al 2018 3 5 2 microbial families regarding sulfate reduction as for sulfate removal on anodes desulfovibrionaceae was the most dominant with the highest relative abundance of 22 6 under 0 2 v 7 6 16 8 8 1 and 6 2 in 0 1 0 0 0 2 v systems and oc mfc respectively fig 5a d desulfuricans a species within desulfovibrionaceae may greatly advantage sulfate removal and electricity production in those epc systems as it reportedly transferred electrons to the electrode directly through cytochrome c kang et al 2014 and produced nanoscale bacterial appendages for extracellular electron transfer eaktasang et al 2016 the 0 2 v anode also embraced other srb including desulfarculaceae 1 1 an unclassified family within desulfuromonadales 2 7 and synergistaceae 2 3 daghio et al 2015 the last one was also accumulated under 0 0 v 1 8 regarding the 0 2 v anode 3 4 desulfuromonadales and 3 3 shewanellaceae were enriched and likely also benefited electricity production under this high potential as for the anode from oc mfc 4 7 desulfobacteraceae also conduced to its sulfate removal the srb family in oc mfc capable of thiosulfate disproportionation likely also benefited the sulfate production during thiosulfate transformation kriimer and cypionka 1989 as for sulfate reduction in anolytes 7 1 desulfovibrionaceae 5 7 desulfarculaceae 7 7 desulfuromonadaceae and 7 0 synergistaceae were accumulated under 0 2 v fig 5b 15 3 desulfovibrionaceae was also accumulated under 0 1 v the anolyte under 0 0 v contained 3 2 desulfovibrionaceae 0 5 desulfarculaceae and 2 5 synergistaceae the anolyte under 0 2 v embraced 5 4 desulfovibrionaceae and 1 6 synergistaceae marinilabiliaceae capable of reducing sulfate and sulfite was also accumulated under 0 2 2 0 and 0 2 v 0 7 anolyte from oc mfc contained 0 9 desulfovibrionaceae 1 1 desulfarculaceae and 1 9 synergistaceae thus srb in epc systems were more abundant than in oc mfc and the most abundant under 0 2 v however sulfate removal was much lower in all epc system which did not concur to the srb distribution in those systems also sulfide concentration and psr cr in all epc systems were both much lower than in oc mfc thus some special microbial communities should make contributions in epc systems 3 5 3 microbial families regarding sulfur oxidation a special sob family of rhodobacteraceae was specially enriched on the anode of epc systems with 1 8 2 0 and 1 2 under 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively harboring both complete sox and reverse dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr pathways for thiosulfate sulfite and other sulfur compounds oxidation simon et al 2017 wasmund et al 2017 the anode under 0 2 v possessed 1 7 desulfobulbaceae which contained cable bacteria family reportedly mediated a cryptic sulfur cycle of sulfide to sulfate in freshwater sediments sandfeld et al 2020 meanwhile anodes from epc systems also specially enriched other sob including helicobacteraceae 0 2 v 0 5 0 0 v 0 6 halothiobacillaceae around 0 2 in all reactors and desulfuromonadales 0 2 v 2 7 0 2 v 3 4 some genera within desulfuromonadales can effectively oxidize s0 to so4 2 on the anode producing electricity zhang et al 2014 sulfur oxidation on anodes can also conduce to generate power in those systems miran et al 2017 furthermore regarding sob families in anolyte helicobacteraceae was highly accumulated under 0 1 v with 24 8 2 4 2 2 0 5 and 3 5 under 0 2 0 0 0 2 v and oc mfc respectively this family mainly contained the chemolithoautotrophic genera of sulfurovum capable of oxidizing some sulfur containing compounds e g s0 s2 and s2o3 2 producing sulfate nakagawa et al 2007 and may greatly contribute to the highest sulfate production under 0 1 v and might also benefit sulfate production in oc mfc using thiosulfate as the substrate desulfobulbaceae was also enriched in epc systems with 0 5 0 5 1 0 1 3 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively but halothiobacillaceae was only accumulated in anolyte under 0 2 0 6 and 0 1 v 3 4 the available nitrogen source from pam in those epc systems may facilitate sob growth in anolytes cui et al 2015 nakagawa et al 2007 poser et al 2014 the high accumulation of pam degrading clostridiaceae under 0 2 and 0 1 v probably played important roles joshi and abed 2017 in addition the minor fe3 in the synthetic fw might also benefit sulfurovum growth in both epc systems and oc mfc nakagawa et al 2007 but need further investigation therefore the main accumulation of rhodobacteraceae desulfobulbaceae and desulfuromonadales on the anode and helicobacteraceae and halothiobacillaceae in the anolyte probably played very important roles in biological oxidation of sulfide thiosulfate and sulfite and helped to decrease psr cr and sulfate removal in epc systems 3 6 metagenomic analysis illumina sequencing resulted in more than 5 3 million sequences and more than 96 9 sequences passed the quality control for downstream analysis table s5 after taxonomic annotation four kegg modules regarding sulfur metabolism were summarized in table s6 in which dsr module were the most abundant under 0 2 v but sox complex genes were specially accumulated under 0 1 v this distribution agreed with the abundances of srb and sob on those anodes 3 6 1 genes regarding sulfate transformation genes in srb coding enzymes for sulfate activation to aps sat aps reduction to sulfite apr ab and dissimilatory sulfite reduction dsrab were found in epc systems and oc mfc and assigned to different kegg ortholog groups ko in table 1 pereira et al 2011 sat and aprab genes were all the most abundant under 0 2 v indicating that the epc system with low potential may benefit sulfate activation and the subsequent aps reduction to sulfite assimilatory sulfite reductase genes were the most abundant under 0 1 v but dsrab genes were the most abundant under 0 2 v 1 46 and 1 35 fold of oc mfc and 0 1 v system respectively which suggested the enhancement of dsr under 0 2 v then the lower sulfate removal and sulfide concentration in both 0 2 and 0 1 v systems than in oc mfc should be attributed to the activities of some other enzymes as expected there were abundant genes coding enzymes for sulfide oxidation in epc systems table 1 the gene of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr catalyzing sulfide oxidation to sulfur polysulfide dominated under 0 1 and 0 2 v with abundances of 4 50 and 1 83 fold of oc mfc respectively and might also benefit psr cr decrease due to the important role of sqr both in sulfide oxidation to sulfate lahme et al 2020 poser et al 2014 and the sulfur cycling between s2 and s0 meanwhile genes of tetrathionate reductase were abundant under 0 1 and 0 2 v catalyzing tetrathionate reduction to thiosulfate coupling with sulfide oxidation to sulfur 3 10 and 2 58 fold of oc mfc respectively podgorsek and imhoff 1999 besides minor genes coding sulfide dehydrogenase and sulfite reductase ferredoxin catalyzing sulfide oxidation were also specially accumulated under 0 1 v therefore those enzymes likely contributed to sulfide decrease and s0 accumulation on anodes of epc systems especially under 0 1 v meanwhile abundant genes regarding thiosulfate metabolism were also found table 1 the gene abundance of thiosulfate reductase catalyzing thiosulfate reduction was the highest under 0 2 v and the lowest under 0 1 v 1 50 and 0 52 fold of oc mfc which suggested that thiosulfate reduction to sulfide and sulfite was enhanced under 0 2 v but inhibited under 0 1 v in addition the genes coding sox complex were highly accumulated in 0 1 v system 4 15 and 4 64 fold of oc mfc and 0 2 v system respectively mainly catalyzing thiosulfate and sulfite oxidation to sulfate anodes of 0 1 and 0 2 v also highly enriched genes of thiosulfate dehydrogenase with 2 82 and 2 79 fold of oc mfc under 0 1 and 0 2 v respectively reportedly catalyzing thiosulfate oxidation to tetrathionate for sulfate production in some sob and chemoorganoheterotrophic bacteria denkmann et al 2012 therefore those results agreed with the sob accumulation on anodes in epc systems and likely contributed to the much lower thiosulfate concentration and psr cr in epc systems especially under 0 1 v they may also play important roles in reducing sulfide production since sulfite and thiosulfate were preferentially oxidized to sulfate instead of being reduced to sulfide 3 6 2 genes regarding thiosulfate production during sulfite reduction to sulfide tpic3 was supposed as the important electron carrier that transferred electrons from h2 and formate to dsrmkjop for reducing the trisulfide bond and producing sulfide keller et al 2014 santos et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 according to ko results the very highly abundant genes regarding dsrmkjop complex formate dehydrogenase and nife hydrogenases in epc systems fig 6 and s8 indicated no inhibition of the expression on those enzymes in comparison with oc mfc the dsrc gene abundance from epc systems also showed no inhibition table 1 however anodes of 0 2 and 0 1 v distinctly accumulated genes coding tpic3 and high molecular mass cytochrome hmc with relative abundances of tpic3 at 2 48 and 1 41 fold of oc mfc and hmc at 2 87 and 1 88 fold of oc mfc respectively those two cytochromes reportedly were also key electron carriers capable of mediating the electron transfer between periplasmic hydrogenases and cytoplasmic enzymes rabus et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 but the relative abundances of their coding genes were lower than the other common electron carriers likely due to their very specific existence in srb rabus et al 2013 as the potential of 0 1 v was higher than the redox potential of tpic3 290 mv and the standard potential for sulfite reduction to sulfide 116 mv santos et al 2015 the 0 1 v anode probably directly accepted electrons from tpic3 and hmc producing electricity and inhibited dsrc s0 reduction oliveira et al 2008 which concurred to the high electron number from the current but this inhibition may weaken the oxidation capacity of srb to degrade complex organics with macromolecule such as pam and guar gum in fw and result in the lower cod removal in epc systems than in oc mfc furthermore during aps reduction to sulfite genes regarding qmoabc were more abundant under 0 1 and 0 2 v with 1 85 and 1 87 fold of oc mfc respectively those two anodes also accumulated more abundant genes coding enzymes transferring electrons from quinone pool and ferredoxin to qmoabc pereira et al 2011 figs 6 and s7 which indicated the preference of sulfite production under those two potentials thus the produced sulfite may further react with dsrc s0 yielding thiosulfate santos et al 2015 meanwhile 0 2 v anode specially embraced genes regarding some other cytochrome c3 totalled at 2 24 fold of oc mfc with midpoint potential between 0 325 and 0 125 v rabus et al 2013 and might also shunt electrons from tpic3 producing thiosulfate but the mechanism for the conversion from sulfite to thiosulfate in epc systems needs further study the highly abundant desulfovibrionaceae on epc anodes capable of directly transferring electrons to the anode may contribute to thiosulfate production the abiotic reaction between sulfide and sulfite may contribute to thiosulfate production in oc mfc bradley et al 2011 rabus et al 2013 in addition the obviously abundant genes concerning electron transfer flavoprotein under 0 1 v 1 69 fold of oc mfc and cytochrome bc1 complex under 0 2 and 0 1 v with 2 90 and 2 58 fold of oc mfc respectively fig 6 may further contribute to the electron transfer from quinones to cytochrome c for electricity production zhang et al 2006 meanwhile the abundant genes coding enzymes involved in electron transfer from nad p h to ubiquinone under 0 2 and 0 1 v may benefit the electron transfer via flavoprotein and cytochrome bc1 complex to the anode fig s9 but the highly abundant genes of ferredoxins under 0 2 and 0 1 v with 1 58 and 0 77 fold of oc mfc respectively also indicated the possible enhancement of thiosulfate reduction under 0 2 v fig s9 since ferredoxins had been suggested as appropriate electron donors for thiosulfate reductase rabus et al 2013 therefore anodes under 0 1 and 0 2 v likely shunted electrons from tpic3 and hmc to produce electricity and thus inhibited sulfite reduction and contributed to thiosulfate production but the 0 2 v anode likely enhanced thiosulfate reduction 4 conclusions the electrode potential control epc bes mediated by srb could effectively remove organics from fw but decrease sulfide production the higher potential e g 0 1 v likely shaped a novel sulfur cycle in epc systems in which sulfate was first reduced to sulfite and then reoxidized to sulfate via forming thiosulfate as an important intermediate or oxidizing sulfite directly the anodes with 0 1 and 0 2 v may shunt electrons from cytochromes of tpic3 and hmc and inhibit dsrc s0 trisulfide reduction and thus likely contributed to thiosulfate production and the decrease of peak sulfide production the special accumulation of sulfur oxidizing genes on the anode probably played important roles in oxidizing thiosulfate and decreasing sulfide concentrations including sox complex genes regarding thiosulfate and sulfite oxidation to sulfate on 0 1 v anode sqr genes regarding sulfide oxidation to sulfur or polysulfide and thiosulfate dehydrogenase genes regarding thiosulfate oxidation to tetrathionate on both 0 2 and 0 1 v anodes but abundant thiosulfate reductases genes and dsrab genes regarding thiosulfate and sulfite reduction under 0 2 v suggested preferential reduction of those sulfur compounds the enrichment of sob in epc systems including rhodobacteraceae desulfobulbaceae and desulfuromonadales on anodes and helicobacteraceae and halothiobacillaceae in anolytes likely contributed to the low sulfide production but along with efficient cod removal firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria enriched in anodic chambers seemed to be responsible for complex organics removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17626,the flowback water fw from shale gas exploitation can be effectively treated by bioelectrochemical technology but sulfide overproduction remains to be addressed herein sulfate reducing bacteria srb meditated microbial fuel cells mfcs with anodic potential control were used cod removal gradually increased to 67 4 5 1 in electrode potential control epc mfcs and 78 9 2 4 in the mfc with open circuit oc mfc however in epc mfcs sulfate removal stabilized at much lower levels no more than 19 9 1 9 along with much lower sulfide concentrations but in oc mfc it increased and finally stabilized at 59 9 0 1 partial sulfur reuse in epc mfcs was indicated by the current production notably thiosulfate was specially detected under low potentials and effectively oxidized in epc mfcs especially under 0 1 v vs she which probably related to the sulfur reuse metagenomics analysis showed that the anode with 0 1 and 0 2 v likely shunted electrons from cytochromes that used for reducing dsrc s0 trisulfide and thus contributed to producing thiosulfate and decreasing sulfide production meanwhile the anode with 0 1 v specially accumulated sulfur oxidizing system sox genes regarding thiosulfate and sulfite oxidation to sulfate which concurred to the effective thiosulfate oxidation and also indicated the possible direct sulfite oxidation to sulfate during the sulfur cycling but the anode of 0 2 v highly accumulated genes for thiosulfate and sulfite reduction both anodes also distinctly accumulated genes regarding thiosulfate oxidation to tetrathionate and sulfide oxidation to sulfur or polysulfide further sulfur oxidizing bacteria were specially enriched in epc mfcs and likely contributed to thiosulfate and sulfite oxidation thus we suggested that the higher electrode potential e g 0 1 v can shape a cryptic sulfur cycling in which sulfate was first reduced to sulfite and then reoxidized to sulfate by forming thiosulfate as an important intermediate or by direct sulfite oxidation the results provide new sights on the bioelectrochemical treatment of wastewater containing complex organics and sulfate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioelectrochemical system anodic potential sulfur cycling thiosulfate flowback water treatment 1 introduction a huge amount of flowback water fw produced from shale gas exploitation mainly contains high salinity complex organics sulfate and heavy metals thus posing a significant challenge the organic matters and sulfate in fw can cause proliferation of sulfate reducing bacteria srb during the temporal storage of fw in surface impoundments or tanks which will not only result in clogging and reservoir souring but also promote microbially influenced corrosion in storage tanks jain et al 2017 reservoir souring due to srb in oil fields also causes severe problems and results in huge economic loss in industries johnson et al 2017 a srb mediated bioelectrochemical system bes has advantages for this wastewater treatment because of its high salinity tolerance simultaneous removal of complex organics and heavy metals power generation and decreased sludge production jain et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however sulfide overproduction in this process is still a problem as it will inhibit heavy metal removal and deteriorate reservoir souring mokone et al 2012 in biological sulfate reduction process sulfate is first activated to adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps by sulfate adenylyltransferase and then reduced to sulfite e0 aps hso3 60 mv by adenylylsulfate reductase with electrons supplied by quinone modifying oxidoreductase qmoabc keller et al 2014 but the reduction of sulfite to sulfide e0 116 mv is presently treated as a black box current findings overwhelmingly support that sulfite is reduced by a dissimilatory sulfite reductase complex dsrab c firstly sulfite is reduced to s2 by dsrab and then to dsrc s0 santos et al 2015 secondly the dsrc s0 trisulfide is proposed to be reduced to sulfide and reduced dsrcr by the membrane bound sulfite reductase of dsrmkjop complex santos et al 2015 in this process type i tetraheme cytochrome c3 tpic3 e0 290 mv is supposed to transfer electrons to dsrmkjop for trisulfide bond reduction bishop et al 2013 santos et al 2015 thus during sulfite reduction many involved enzymes are electroactive and the redox potential for each step of sulfur transformation is different which enlighten the possible control of sulfate reduction by the electrochemistry cytochrome c of desulfovibrio desulfuricans has been reported to efficiently attach to the electrode and transfer electrons directly kang et al 2014 furthermore soluble fe3 as a competing electron acceptor that similar to a electrode under certatin potential has been demonstrated to totally inhibit sulfate reduction because periplasmic fe3 reduction could shortcut electron flow and eliminate electron delivery back to the cytoplasm for indirect sulfate reduction elias et al 2004 in addition in the reactors with the anode potential of 0 0 or 0 3 v vs ag agcl no obvious sulfate reduction had been found in the first 58days daghio et al 2015 which further indicated the electrode under certain potential may impact sulfate reduction the power generation and microbial community formation in mfcs with the anode potential of 0 3 v have also been investigated but not how the sulfur cycled chou et al 2013 2014 sulfur cycling in a bes without potential control has already been reported that sulfide produced from sulfate reduction was oxidized on the electrode to sulfur which was then reduced back to sulfide by acetate oxidizing bacteria as the electron acceptor dutta et al 2009 but how sulfur cycling performs under certain potential is still unclear whether we can apply the potential to regulate sulfate reduction process to avoid high sulfide production remains unknown how the sulfate metabolism performs under controlled potential at the molecular level has not been studied in this study sulfur cycling under controlled anode potentials was first studied to avoid high sulfide production but gain efficient organics removal during fw treatment in bess the interaction between different sulfur species under the different potential was focused and a novel sulfur cycling shaped by electrode potential was proposed furthermore 16s rrna and metagenomic analysis were conducted to elucidate the cryptic sulfur cycling mechanism at the molecular level the results provide new inspiration in treating fw by the bes 2 materials and methods 2 1 mfc construction and wastewater the mfc consisted of two 180 ml chambers separated by a nafion 117 proton exchange membrane fuel cell store us a carbon brush and a circular 1071 hcb carbon felt with projected surface area of 19 63 cm2 were used as the anodic and cathodic electrode respectively the synthetic fw used in this research was made based on our former research zhang et al 2018 with an adjustment and contained 1108 87 mg cod l 1936 9 95 4 mg so4 2 l 15 600 mg salinity l 133 mg anionic polyacrylamide pam l and 5 0 mg fe3 l with the ph of 7 0 0 1 those complex organics in the synthetic fw were elaborated in table s1 as functional components based on the disclosed industry formulas of hydraulic fracturing fluid stringfellow et al 2014 and the inorganic ions were shown in table s2 based on our former research zhang et al 2018 in the last cycle 1131 0 mg s2o3 2 l instead of sulfate was used as sulfur source in the synthetic fw a saline mixture of 50 mm k3fe cn 6 and 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 was used as catholyte 2 2 source of inoculum and mfc operation mfcs were initially seeded with anodic effluent from a mature srb mediated mfc in our laboratory at 8 3 v v of the anode chamber volume four anode potentials of 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v vs she were applied on ten different mfcs with triplicates under 0 2 and 0 0 v and duplicates under 0 1 and 0 2 v two other mfcs worked in open circuit as control designated as oc mfc after inoculation the anolyte was purged with a gas mixture of n2 co2 80 20 for 30 min before the anodic chamber was sealed to maintain an anaerobic microenvironment mfcs were operated in fed batch mode under ambient conditions for 130 days involving three phases in phase 1 mfcs were running under the hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 days in phase 2 the hrt was prolonged to 20 days in cycle 5 and 7 but reverted to 10 days in cycle 6 8 and 9 in phase 3 one of epc systems under each potential was converted into open circuit after that thiosulfate containing fw was used as the anodic influent to further study biological thiosulfate transformation in those systems the effluent was removed by syringes gas collecting bags full of n2 were used to balance pressure in reactors during sampling 2 3 electrochemical measurement and chemical analysis the anode potential was set with chronoamperometry by using an ivium n stat multi channel electrochemical workstation ivium netherlands ag agcl reference electrode was placed in the anodic chamber the coulombic efficiency ce was calculated as the percent of the electron number involved in the current to that involved in the whole removed cod cod was measured by an improved measurement for fw cardona et al 2016 with the use of a hgso4 cl ratio of 20 1 for pretreatment and an digestion solution of 14 7 g l k2cr2o7 based on our sample concentration the concentrations of sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate anions in the anolyte following 0 45 μm filtration were detected via a dionex ics 5000 ion chromatograph with an as18 column and naoh gradient elution at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 0 1 formaldehyde was added into the sample to protect sulfite from being oxidized sulfide concentration was measured using the methylene blue method lee et al 2014 elements on the surface of the used and clean anodes were analyzed employing a jeol jsm 7800f scanning electron microscope sem coupled with an energy dispersive x ray edx detector sangcharoen et al 2015 the sulfur valences accumulating on the used anode and precipitates were determined via an x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps thermo scientific escalab 250xi by recording the sulfur xps spectra 2 4 16s rrna library construction and metagenomics analysis the microbial community structures from the anode and anolyte in epc systems and oc mfc were determined using v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene the region was amplified using bacterial primers 338f and 806r the details for the construction of 16s rrna gene library and bioinformatics analysis were the same with our former research zhang et al 2018 metagenomic analysis was performed on the whole microbial community dna of the anodes from 0 2 and 0 1 v systems and oc mfc to further investigate the impact of electrode potentials on sulfate reduction at the molecular level the biofilm samples were taken rapidly together with anodes in a sterilized anaerobic glove box and then transferred into tubes after being cut into small pieces for total genomic dna extraction the details of dna extraction non redundant gene catalog construction and functional annotation were provided in the supplementary document representative sequences of non redundant gene catalog were aligned for taxonomic annotations including cluster of orthologous groups of proteins cog and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg read counts were normalized as rpkm value reads per kilobase per million mapped reads lawson et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfate removal sulfate removal showed no obvious increase in epc systems but kept increasing in oc mfc fig 1 and s1a as the reactors kept running the average sulfate removal efficiency slightly increased to 19 9 1 9 under 0 2 v in phase 2 with 10 days hrt but kept around 13 2 under both 0 1 and 0 0 v except 0 2 v 10 6 3 0 likely due to electrochemical oxidation daghio et al 2018 it significantly increased in oc mfc during phase 2 to 47 9 17 6 but stabilized at 59 9 0 1 the efficiency was even lower in all epc reactors in phase 2 with 20 days hrt and decreased with the rise of potential with 14 0 2 5 13 1 0 8 9 6 4 2 and 6 4 4 6 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively but was still much higher in oc mfc up to 53 0 3 8 thus sulfate reduction was likely impacted by the anode potential and prolonged hrt may also do influence during sulfate reduction thiosulfate and sulfide were detected but with much lower concentrations in epc systems thiosulfate only existed under 0 2 and 0 1 v in phase 1 at very small quantities 0 8 0 1 and 1 0 0 6 mg l respectively but it gradually increased up to 32 0 7 4 mg l with time in oc mfc fig 1c and decreased sharply to 2 1 0 8 mg l when hrt was prolonged in phase 2 thus some special sulfur metabolism likely occurred under the prolonged hrt as for sulfide it kept at a low level from 0 to 11 7 1 1 mg l in all epc systems but significantly increased in oc mfc from 0 2 to 83 4 7 4 mg l fig 1d meanwhile the molar ratio of sulfide produced to sulfate removed in epc systems was also much lower than that in oc mfc shown in fig s1d sulfide in all epc systems tended to be 0 mg l under the prolonged hrt in phase 2 which was similar to another study with sob functioning in the system zhang et al 2018 the very low sulfide concentration under 0 2 v could be attributed to electrochemical oxidation daghio et al 2018 meanwhile some elemental sulfur s0 accumulated on all epc anodes according to xps results fig s2 which likely also related to biological activity and contributed to the low sulfide concentration 3 2 cod removal and electricity production as electron donors for sulfate reduction cod removal gradually increased in all of those reactors fig 2 and s1b which did not concur with the sulfate removal in epc systems the average efficiency increased to 67 4 5 1 in phase 2 under 0 2 v with 10 days hrt it also increased to 65 7 6 3 under 0 0 v to around 58 under both 0 1 and 0 2 v though the sulfate removals showed no obvious increase this efficiency also increased in oc mfc to 78 9 2 4 but along with high sulfate removal likely due to the ability of srb to degrade complex organics in fw daghio et al 2018 rabus et al 2013 jain et al 2017 furthermore the efficiency was higher with rising potential under prolonged hrt in phase 2 with 63 3 8 1 63 1 13 9 72 5 4 5 and 74 4 7 4 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively it also stabilized at a higher level in oc mfc of 82 6 3 2 which agreed with its much high sulfate removal though cod removal efficiency in epc systems was a bit lower than in oc mfc it was very interesting that the percentage of cod theoretically used for sulfate reduction based on the sulfate removal efficiency to total cod removed psr cr in epc systems was much lower than in oc mfc fig 2b and decreased with rising potential the average psr cr decreased to 31 0 2 3 24 8 7 8 22 9 8 0 and 21 5 9 3 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively in phase 2 with 10 days hrt but it significantly increased in oc mfc and stabilized at 82 5 18 1 the percentage in all epc systems under prolonged hrt in phase 2 was even lower with 26 0 2 3 24 7 3 1 15 4 6 5 and 10 0 6 5 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively but was still much higher in oc mfc up to 56 0 21 4 however only the low percentage under 0 2 v can be attributed to the electrochemical oxidation of sulfide to sulfate data not shown therefore the electrode potential likely influenced sulfate reduction in epc systems and a higher potential seemed to benefit cod removal especially under prolonged hrt but psr cr was less than 100 in all reactors which indicated that partial sulfate may be reused by cycling for organics removal or that some organics may be removed by bacteria without reducing sulfate this reason was further studied in the following sections as the key connection of sulfur cycling to the electrode current production gradually increased in epc systems the peak current was higher under lower potential and occurred increasingly early fig s3 but the number of electrons involved in current production was the lowest under 0 2 v and higher under 0 1 and 0 0 v shown in fig 2c the peak current increased to 2 51 0 59 2 49 0 60 1 96 0 48 and 1 17 0 22 ma under 10 days hrt in phase 2 but accompanying with 310 9 25 3 373 3 19 1 354 9 24 0 and 349 9 24 5 c of electrons from the current fig 2c under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively those peak currents and electron numbers all rose under prolonged hrt in phase 2 following the similar trend under 10 days hrt the increased peak current and rapid start time under low potentials were likely due to the proposed promotion of microbial colonization by the anode potential for adaptation and energy efficiency maximization chou et al 2013 but the different electron number from the current likely related to the different performance of electricity producing bacteria and srb under specific potentials further by calculating the ratio of electrons from the current to that from the remaining removed organics except that theoretically used for sulfate reduction rec eo we found that this ratio rapidly increased to high levels in phase 1 shown in fig s4 but significantly decreased in phase 2 even under 20 days hrt though the remaining removed organics were much higher thus electricity producing bacteria with high activity could not be the main reason for the unstable rec eo electrons come from the remaining removed cod were probably overestimated which meant the real cod removal by sulfate reduction should be more than that theoretically calculated thus partial sulfur reuse likely existed in epc systems and did important contribution to the psr cr less than 100 meanwhile ce kept the lowest under 0 2 v but the highest under 0 1 v likely due to the efficient conversion of electrons from the removed cod to the current instead of the reduced sulfur compound under 0 1 v shown in fig s4d thus the partial sulfur reuse likely also contributed to the higher amount of electrons harvested in the currents under certain higher potential 3 3 sulfate transformation the further study of sulfate removal process during phase 2 showed that sulfate concentration in epc systems almost stabilized during the second half of the cycle but still decreased very obviously in oc mfc fig s5 however cod concentration decreased in all reactors during this period and resulted in low psr cr in epc systems rec eo in this cycle was also very low therefore special sulfur cycling likely occurred accepting electrons from cod removal in epc systems especially during the second half of the cycle notably significantly lower peak sulfide was detected in epc systems and decreased with rising potential sulfide concentration obviously decreased during the second half of the cycle in epc systems likely due to the bio electrochemical oxidation to sulfur on the anode and polysulfide in the precipitation fig s2 and s6 which may also result in the lower ratio of sulfide produced to sulfate removed but this oxidation could not be the main reason for the low peak sulfide concentration because it cannot contribute to the low psr cr in epc systems meanwhile the decrease of sulfate removal and the conversion of sulfide and thiosulfate under prolonged hrt in epc systems could be caused by more obvious sob metabolism as less cod was removed during the second half of the cycle in addition no sulfite was found in either epc systems or oc mfcs which were similar to the former study zhang et al 2018 and probably caused by quick sulfite conversion thiosulfate was also only detected under 0 2 and 0 1 v at very low concentrations 0 4 7 and 0 1 4 mg l respectively and decreased to zero during the second half of the cycle this concentration was higher 0 45 0 mg l in oc mfc and also decreased during the cycle likely due to srb metabolism jorgensen 1990 thiosulfate was regarded as an important product instead of sulfide in vitro sulfite reduction rabus et al 2013 and may greatlyd contribute to the low peak sulfide production in epc systems it was supposed to be produced by the absence or inhibition of dissimilatory sulfite reductase c oliveira et al 2008 which may be caused by the anodes with different potentials in those epc systems and was further studied in the following sections the much lower thiosulfate concentration in epc systems may related to the specific sulfur cycling to further study the impact of electrode potential on the specific sulfur cycling one of the parallel epc systems under each potential was changed into open circuit in phase 3 then sulfate removal became more efficient accompanying with sharply increased sulfide concentration in all of those open circuit epc systems fig 3 cod removal all became less efficient fig 3b along with psr cr increase in all open circuit epc systems table s3 the rec eo under each potential in this cycle was still lower than that gained in phase 1 furthermore thiosulfate then accumulated to around 4 mg l in all those open circuit epc systems which likely due to this special mode without bio electrochemical transformation on those anodes but the concentration was still lower than in oc mfc probably because of the different microbial community formed under controlled potential thus the impact of anode potentials on sulfate reduction and the existence of specific sulfur cycling were further confirmed thiosulfate was an important intermediate and its behavior was found to be associated with the anode potential 3 4 thiosulfate transformation thiosulfate was used as the substrate to investigate thiosulfate transformation in epc systems it was effectively removed in all epc systems and oc mfc with higher efficiency under 0 2 and 0 1 v than in oc mfc but lower efficiency under 0 0 and 0 2 v producing sulfate and sulfide fig 4 notably the molar ratios of sulfate produced to thiosulfate removed in epc systems were much higher than in oc mfc fig 4b the ratio was the highest of 0 41 0 06 under 0 1 v which likely related to the proper potential and stabilized at 0 34 0 03 and 0 33 0 01 under 0 2 and 0 0 v respectively it was very high at 0 68 under 0 2 v on day 3 due to the electrochemical oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfate under this high potential but gradually decreased to 0 38 likely due to biological sulfate reduction sulfate was also produced in oc mfc but at a quite low ratio of 0 17 0 02 which indicated that microbial thiosulfate oxidation was much stronger in epc systems than in oc mfc especially under 0 1 v thiosulfate reportedly to be oxidized by lithotrophic sulfur bacteria once there were proper electron acceptors jorgensen 1990 which concurred to the condition in epc systems with different potential control anodes thiosulfate dehydrogenase or sulfur oxidizing system sox involved in lithotrophic sulfur bacteria can oxidize thiosulfate to sulfate denkmann et al 2012 liu et al 2018 regarding the sulfate in oc mfc it could be caused by thiosulfate disproportion as well especially during the second half of the cycle as many srb were identified to disproportionate thiosulfate when there was no proper electron acceptor kriimer and cypionka 1989 jorgensen 1990 during this process sulfide also behaved differently the molar ratio of sulfide produced to thiosulfate removed under 0 2 v changed very obviously from 0 31 at day 3 to 0 04 at day 10 it also changed quickly from 0 23 to nearly 0 under 0 1 v very little sulfide was detected under either 0 0 or 0 2 v which meant high sulfide oxidation ability in those systems on the contrary this ratio was much higher in oc mfc and changed from 0 43 at day 3 to 0 25 0 03 at day 10 therefore oc mfc showed higher preference in thiosulfate reduction to sulfide which likely related to the high biological sulfate reduction capacity in this reactor as thiosulfate can be reduced to sulfide by most of srb with organic matters in the system jorgensen 1990 the total molar ratio of sulfate and sulfide produced to thiosulfate removed was less than 1 which likely related to the accumulation of s0 and sn 2 on the surface of anodes and precipitates fig s2 and s6 then the relatively lower sulfate formation than sulfide production under potential control probably related to the too high thiosulfate concentration because it was far higher than that detected in all those systems and might beyond the oxidation capacity of sob in epc system thus thiosulfate behavior was further confirmed to correspond to anode potentials along with effective biological thiosulfate oxidation in epc systems which likely contributed to the low sulfate removal low psr cr and low sulfide production 3 5 microbial community analysis over 50 000 effective sequences were obtained for each sample table s4 and could reasonably represent the microbial communities based on the formed rarefaction curves fig s7 at the phylum level proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes all dominated at both the anode and anolyte with relative abundances more than 10 fig 5 bacteroidetes and firmicutes have been reported to link with fermentation and hydrolysis and dominate in the mfc treating raw landfill leachate kumar et al 2017 proteobacteria generally contains anode respiring bacteria srb and sob muyzer and stams 2008 3 5 1 fermentative families regarding organics degradation carnobacteriaceae was the most abundant on the anode of epc systems 30 with the highest of 68 2 under 0 1 v oc mfc 27 7 fig 5a and also very abundant in the anolyte of epc systems except 0 1 v only 2 8 fig 5b the genus of trichococcus within this family can produce lactic acid acetate and formate from various carbohydrates which then could benefit sulfate reduction stams et al 2009 prolixibacteraceae 43 3 and carnobacteriaceae 83 7 were the most abundant families from the anode and anolyte respectively in oc mfc in addition some other families including porphyromonadaceae 7 3 18 3 in all epc reactors clostridiaceae 1 and family xii o clostridiales totalled at 2 7 3 6 and 1 3 under 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively were specially accumulated on epc anodes prolixibacteraceae 9 3 17 4 in all epc reactors clostridiaceae 0 1 v 28 0 0 0 v 40 8 h2 producing spirochaetaceae 0 2 v 8 3 were specially enriched in anolyte of epc systems the last one was also enriched on oc mfc anode 6 6 those families likely formed important links between fermentative bacteria and srb due to the ability of fermentatively producing some small molecular organics and h2 wust et al 2011 clostridiaceae also reportedly to degrade pam effectively joshi and abed 2017 furthermore complex organics degraders including cellulomonadacea nocardiaceae and desulfobulbaceae were specially dominated on the anode of epc systems totalled at 1 7 2 3 4 0 and 2 2 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively and likely contributed to complex organics removal ye et al 2018 3 5 2 microbial families regarding sulfate reduction as for sulfate removal on anodes desulfovibrionaceae was the most dominant with the highest relative abundance of 22 6 under 0 2 v 7 6 16 8 8 1 and 6 2 in 0 1 0 0 0 2 v systems and oc mfc respectively fig 5a d desulfuricans a species within desulfovibrionaceae may greatly advantage sulfate removal and electricity production in those epc systems as it reportedly transferred electrons to the electrode directly through cytochrome c kang et al 2014 and produced nanoscale bacterial appendages for extracellular electron transfer eaktasang et al 2016 the 0 2 v anode also embraced other srb including desulfarculaceae 1 1 an unclassified family within desulfuromonadales 2 7 and synergistaceae 2 3 daghio et al 2015 the last one was also accumulated under 0 0 v 1 8 regarding the 0 2 v anode 3 4 desulfuromonadales and 3 3 shewanellaceae were enriched and likely also benefited electricity production under this high potential as for the anode from oc mfc 4 7 desulfobacteraceae also conduced to its sulfate removal the srb family in oc mfc capable of thiosulfate disproportionation likely also benefited the sulfate production during thiosulfate transformation kriimer and cypionka 1989 as for sulfate reduction in anolytes 7 1 desulfovibrionaceae 5 7 desulfarculaceae 7 7 desulfuromonadaceae and 7 0 synergistaceae were accumulated under 0 2 v fig 5b 15 3 desulfovibrionaceae was also accumulated under 0 1 v the anolyte under 0 0 v contained 3 2 desulfovibrionaceae 0 5 desulfarculaceae and 2 5 synergistaceae the anolyte under 0 2 v embraced 5 4 desulfovibrionaceae and 1 6 synergistaceae marinilabiliaceae capable of reducing sulfate and sulfite was also accumulated under 0 2 2 0 and 0 2 v 0 7 anolyte from oc mfc contained 0 9 desulfovibrionaceae 1 1 desulfarculaceae and 1 9 synergistaceae thus srb in epc systems were more abundant than in oc mfc and the most abundant under 0 2 v however sulfate removal was much lower in all epc system which did not concur to the srb distribution in those systems also sulfide concentration and psr cr in all epc systems were both much lower than in oc mfc thus some special microbial communities should make contributions in epc systems 3 5 3 microbial families regarding sulfur oxidation a special sob family of rhodobacteraceae was specially enriched on the anode of epc systems with 1 8 2 0 and 1 2 under 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively harboring both complete sox and reverse dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr pathways for thiosulfate sulfite and other sulfur compounds oxidation simon et al 2017 wasmund et al 2017 the anode under 0 2 v possessed 1 7 desulfobulbaceae which contained cable bacteria family reportedly mediated a cryptic sulfur cycle of sulfide to sulfate in freshwater sediments sandfeld et al 2020 meanwhile anodes from epc systems also specially enriched other sob including helicobacteraceae 0 2 v 0 5 0 0 v 0 6 halothiobacillaceae around 0 2 in all reactors and desulfuromonadales 0 2 v 2 7 0 2 v 3 4 some genera within desulfuromonadales can effectively oxidize s0 to so4 2 on the anode producing electricity zhang et al 2014 sulfur oxidation on anodes can also conduce to generate power in those systems miran et al 2017 furthermore regarding sob families in anolyte helicobacteraceae was highly accumulated under 0 1 v with 24 8 2 4 2 2 0 5 and 3 5 under 0 2 0 0 0 2 v and oc mfc respectively this family mainly contained the chemolithoautotrophic genera of sulfurovum capable of oxidizing some sulfur containing compounds e g s0 s2 and s2o3 2 producing sulfate nakagawa et al 2007 and may greatly contribute to the highest sulfate production under 0 1 v and might also benefit sulfate production in oc mfc using thiosulfate as the substrate desulfobulbaceae was also enriched in epc systems with 0 5 0 5 1 0 1 3 under 0 2 0 1 0 0 and 0 2 v respectively but halothiobacillaceae was only accumulated in anolyte under 0 2 0 6 and 0 1 v 3 4 the available nitrogen source from pam in those epc systems may facilitate sob growth in anolytes cui et al 2015 nakagawa et al 2007 poser et al 2014 the high accumulation of pam degrading clostridiaceae under 0 2 and 0 1 v probably played important roles joshi and abed 2017 in addition the minor fe3 in the synthetic fw might also benefit sulfurovum growth in both epc systems and oc mfc nakagawa et al 2007 but need further investigation therefore the main accumulation of rhodobacteraceae desulfobulbaceae and desulfuromonadales on the anode and helicobacteraceae and halothiobacillaceae in the anolyte probably played very important roles in biological oxidation of sulfide thiosulfate and sulfite and helped to decrease psr cr and sulfate removal in epc systems 3 6 metagenomic analysis illumina sequencing resulted in more than 5 3 million sequences and more than 96 9 sequences passed the quality control for downstream analysis table s5 after taxonomic annotation four kegg modules regarding sulfur metabolism were summarized in table s6 in which dsr module were the most abundant under 0 2 v but sox complex genes were specially accumulated under 0 1 v this distribution agreed with the abundances of srb and sob on those anodes 3 6 1 genes regarding sulfate transformation genes in srb coding enzymes for sulfate activation to aps sat aps reduction to sulfite apr ab and dissimilatory sulfite reduction dsrab were found in epc systems and oc mfc and assigned to different kegg ortholog groups ko in table 1 pereira et al 2011 sat and aprab genes were all the most abundant under 0 2 v indicating that the epc system with low potential may benefit sulfate activation and the subsequent aps reduction to sulfite assimilatory sulfite reductase genes were the most abundant under 0 1 v but dsrab genes were the most abundant under 0 2 v 1 46 and 1 35 fold of oc mfc and 0 1 v system respectively which suggested the enhancement of dsr under 0 2 v then the lower sulfate removal and sulfide concentration in both 0 2 and 0 1 v systems than in oc mfc should be attributed to the activities of some other enzymes as expected there were abundant genes coding enzymes for sulfide oxidation in epc systems table 1 the gene of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr catalyzing sulfide oxidation to sulfur polysulfide dominated under 0 1 and 0 2 v with abundances of 4 50 and 1 83 fold of oc mfc respectively and might also benefit psr cr decrease due to the important role of sqr both in sulfide oxidation to sulfate lahme et al 2020 poser et al 2014 and the sulfur cycling between s2 and s0 meanwhile genes of tetrathionate reductase were abundant under 0 1 and 0 2 v catalyzing tetrathionate reduction to thiosulfate coupling with sulfide oxidation to sulfur 3 10 and 2 58 fold of oc mfc respectively podgorsek and imhoff 1999 besides minor genes coding sulfide dehydrogenase and sulfite reductase ferredoxin catalyzing sulfide oxidation were also specially accumulated under 0 1 v therefore those enzymes likely contributed to sulfide decrease and s0 accumulation on anodes of epc systems especially under 0 1 v meanwhile abundant genes regarding thiosulfate metabolism were also found table 1 the gene abundance of thiosulfate reductase catalyzing thiosulfate reduction was the highest under 0 2 v and the lowest under 0 1 v 1 50 and 0 52 fold of oc mfc which suggested that thiosulfate reduction to sulfide and sulfite was enhanced under 0 2 v but inhibited under 0 1 v in addition the genes coding sox complex were highly accumulated in 0 1 v system 4 15 and 4 64 fold of oc mfc and 0 2 v system respectively mainly catalyzing thiosulfate and sulfite oxidation to sulfate anodes of 0 1 and 0 2 v also highly enriched genes of thiosulfate dehydrogenase with 2 82 and 2 79 fold of oc mfc under 0 1 and 0 2 v respectively reportedly catalyzing thiosulfate oxidation to tetrathionate for sulfate production in some sob and chemoorganoheterotrophic bacteria denkmann et al 2012 therefore those results agreed with the sob accumulation on anodes in epc systems and likely contributed to the much lower thiosulfate concentration and psr cr in epc systems especially under 0 1 v they may also play important roles in reducing sulfide production since sulfite and thiosulfate were preferentially oxidized to sulfate instead of being reduced to sulfide 3 6 2 genes regarding thiosulfate production during sulfite reduction to sulfide tpic3 was supposed as the important electron carrier that transferred electrons from h2 and formate to dsrmkjop for reducing the trisulfide bond and producing sulfide keller et al 2014 santos et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 according to ko results the very highly abundant genes regarding dsrmkjop complex formate dehydrogenase and nife hydrogenases in epc systems fig 6 and s8 indicated no inhibition of the expression on those enzymes in comparison with oc mfc the dsrc gene abundance from epc systems also showed no inhibition table 1 however anodes of 0 2 and 0 1 v distinctly accumulated genes coding tpic3 and high molecular mass cytochrome hmc with relative abundances of tpic3 at 2 48 and 1 41 fold of oc mfc and hmc at 2 87 and 1 88 fold of oc mfc respectively those two cytochromes reportedly were also key electron carriers capable of mediating the electron transfer between periplasmic hydrogenases and cytoplasmic enzymes rabus et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 but the relative abundances of their coding genes were lower than the other common electron carriers likely due to their very specific existence in srb rabus et al 2013 as the potential of 0 1 v was higher than the redox potential of tpic3 290 mv and the standard potential for sulfite reduction to sulfide 116 mv santos et al 2015 the 0 1 v anode probably directly accepted electrons from tpic3 and hmc producing electricity and inhibited dsrc s0 reduction oliveira et al 2008 which concurred to the high electron number from the current but this inhibition may weaken the oxidation capacity of srb to degrade complex organics with macromolecule such as pam and guar gum in fw and result in the lower cod removal in epc systems than in oc mfc furthermore during aps reduction to sulfite genes regarding qmoabc were more abundant under 0 1 and 0 2 v with 1 85 and 1 87 fold of oc mfc respectively those two anodes also accumulated more abundant genes coding enzymes transferring electrons from quinone pool and ferredoxin to qmoabc pereira et al 2011 figs 6 and s7 which indicated the preference of sulfite production under those two potentials thus the produced sulfite may further react with dsrc s0 yielding thiosulfate santos et al 2015 meanwhile 0 2 v anode specially embraced genes regarding some other cytochrome c3 totalled at 2 24 fold of oc mfc with midpoint potential between 0 325 and 0 125 v rabus et al 2013 and might also shunt electrons from tpic3 producing thiosulfate but the mechanism for the conversion from sulfite to thiosulfate in epc systems needs further study the highly abundant desulfovibrionaceae on epc anodes capable of directly transferring electrons to the anode may contribute to thiosulfate production the abiotic reaction between sulfide and sulfite may contribute to thiosulfate production in oc mfc bradley et al 2011 rabus et al 2013 in addition the obviously abundant genes concerning electron transfer flavoprotein under 0 1 v 1 69 fold of oc mfc and cytochrome bc1 complex under 0 2 and 0 1 v with 2 90 and 2 58 fold of oc mfc respectively fig 6 may further contribute to the electron transfer from quinones to cytochrome c for electricity production zhang et al 2006 meanwhile the abundant genes coding enzymes involved in electron transfer from nad p h to ubiquinone under 0 2 and 0 1 v may benefit the electron transfer via flavoprotein and cytochrome bc1 complex to the anode fig s9 but the highly abundant genes of ferredoxins under 0 2 and 0 1 v with 1 58 and 0 77 fold of oc mfc respectively also indicated the possible enhancement of thiosulfate reduction under 0 2 v fig s9 since ferredoxins had been suggested as appropriate electron donors for thiosulfate reductase rabus et al 2013 therefore anodes under 0 1 and 0 2 v likely shunted electrons from tpic3 and hmc to produce electricity and thus inhibited sulfite reduction and contributed to thiosulfate production but the 0 2 v anode likely enhanced thiosulfate reduction 4 conclusions the electrode potential control epc bes mediated by srb could effectively remove organics from fw but decrease sulfide production the higher potential e g 0 1 v likely shaped a novel sulfur cycle in epc systems in which sulfate was first reduced to sulfite and then reoxidized to sulfate via forming thiosulfate as an important intermediate or oxidizing sulfite directly the anodes with 0 1 and 0 2 v may shunt electrons from cytochromes of tpic3 and hmc and inhibit dsrc s0 trisulfide reduction and thus likely contributed to thiosulfate production and the decrease of peak sulfide production the special accumulation of sulfur oxidizing genes on the anode probably played important roles in oxidizing thiosulfate and decreasing sulfide concentrations including sox complex genes regarding thiosulfate and sulfite oxidation to sulfate on 0 1 v anode sqr genes regarding sulfide oxidation to sulfur or polysulfide and thiosulfate dehydrogenase genes regarding thiosulfate oxidation to tetrathionate on both 0 2 and 0 1 v anodes but abundant thiosulfate reductases genes and dsrab genes regarding thiosulfate and sulfite reduction under 0 2 v suggested preferential reduction of those sulfur compounds the enrichment of sob in epc systems including rhodobacteraceae desulfobulbaceae and desulfuromonadales on anodes and helicobacteraceae and halothiobacillaceae in anolytes likely contributed to the low sulfide production but along with efficient cod removal firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria enriched in anodic chambers seemed to be responsible for complex organics removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17627,this study identifies causes of rising arsenic as concentrations over 17 years in an inter montane aquifer system located just north of the trans mexican volcanic belt in the mesa central physiographic region that is extensively developed by long screened production wells arsenic concentrations increased by more than 10 µg l in 14 3 22 of re sampled wells similarly in a larger scale analysis wherein as concentrations measured in 137 wells in 2016 were compared to interpolated baseline concentrations from 246 wells in 1999 as concentrations rose more than 10 µg l in 30 of wells between 1999 and 2016 the percentage of all wells sampled in each basin wide sampling campaign exceeding the world health organization s 10 µg l drinking water limit increased from 38 to 64 principal components analysis pca step wise multiple regression and random forest modeling rf revealed that high as concentrations are closely associated with high ph and temperature and high concentrations of fluoride f molybdenum mo lithium li sodium na and silica si but low calcium ca and nitrate no3 concentrations pumping induced mixing with hot geothermally impacted groundwater generates alkaline water through hydrolysis of silicate minerals the rising ph converts oxyanion sorption sites from positive to negative releasing as and mo to pore waters the negative correlation between nitrate and as concentrations can be explained by conservative mixing of shallow young groundwater with geothermally influenced groundwater therefore water carrying an anthropogenic contaminant dilutes water carrying geogenic contaminants this process is enabled by long well screens over exploitation of aquifers in geothermal regions for agriculture can drive as concentrations in water from production wells to toxic levels even as the total dissolved solids remain low graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic groundwater fluoride geogenic nitrate geothermal wellbore mixing 1 introduction the aim of target 6 1 within the united nation s sustainable development goal 6 is to achieve universal convenient access to safe and affordable drinking water global indicator 6 1 1 tracks progress towards achieving universal access to safe drinking water and states that priority contaminants like arsenic as and fluoride f should be progressively monitored in household drinking water united nations water 2017 the testing and subsequent mitigation will require massive investment by governments non governmental organizations ngos private households and businesses the success of mitigation strategies which are designed based on the knowledge that is generated through these testing campaigns will be susceptible to the stability of as and f concentrations in groundwater although groundwater chemistry is commonly stable over time as concentrations have been observed to change over time mihajlov et al 2020 seasonal concentration fluctuations may occur in shallow aquifers influenced by seasonal surface water table fluctuations schaefer et al 2016 and long term increases in as concentrations occur in production wells that are pumped at high rates ayotte et al 2015 long term and large scale studies suggest that changes in as concentrations can be substantial across a region within a wide variety of aquifer settings under the influence of intensive pumping appleyard et al 2006 ayotte et al 2015 2011 erban et al 2013 harvey et al 2005 smith et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 as rampant groundwater depletion for agriculture in arid regions continues around the

african rift valley darling et al 1996 rango et al 2013 furthermore numerous studies have found elevated as concentrations in pore waters of volcanic rocks amini et al 2008 busico et al 2018 johannesson and tang 2009 aquifers containing toxic concentrations of as throughout latin america are commonly comprised of volcanic rocks and sediments which contain remnant geothermal heat bundschuh et al 2012 morales arredondo et al 2018 exhaustive reviews however of reports of arsenic occurrence in groundwater throughout latin america indicate that few studies have analyzed long term changes of as concentrations in heavily pumped geothermally influenced aquifers bundschuh et al 2012 groundwater is the primary source of water for municipal agricultural and industrial demand in central mexico this groundwater is typically stored within the sediments and rocks of inter montane basins with near surface geothermal heat morales arredondo et al 2018 these aquifers are being dewatered at alarming rates amongst other problems such as subsidence the falling water table drives up drilling and electricity costs for pumping hoogesteger 2018 hoogesteger and wester 2017 mexicano 2017 ortega

the objectives of this study are to 1 estimate changes in temperature and groundwater chemistry across the independence basin between 1999 and 2016 2 estimate changes in as concentrations at different spatial scales and 3 deduce the hydrogeochemical processes driving as concentrations using multivariate regression and machine learning geothermally influenced ground waters in volcanic rock and

morales arredondo et al 2018 munoz et al 2015 rango et al 2013 higher pore water temperatures accelerate the hydrolysis of albite to kaolinite clay this releases si and na and raises the ph rango et al 2013 this reaction generates new cation exchange sites that favor calcium ca over na which releases additional na to pore waters the rising ph moreover converts the charge of metal oxide surfaces from positive to negative releasing oxyanions of as and molybdenum mo dixit and hering 2003 dzombak and morel 1990 johannesson and tang 2009 smedley et al 2002 lastly the reduction in dissolved ca concentrations through cation exchange on the newly produced clay promotes the dissolution of fluorite releasing f to groundwater via the common ion effect apambire et al 1997 this sequence of reactions will be deduced from the joint basin wide analysis of 1 changing temperature and chemistry between 1999 and 2016 2 the multivariate structure of the physical and chemical properties in 2016

central mexico in a general nne ssw direction alaniz alvarez and nieto samaniego 2007 prominent cliffs throughout the basin demarcate the location of normal faults formed during extensional events over the last 30 million years nieto samaniego et al 2007 these events caused the sinking of the basement rock and the infilling of grabens with thick layers of sediments from the eroding mountains one of these grabens comprises the western half of the basin and hosts the drainage network of the rio laja fig 2 the porous sandstone and conglomerate that infills this graben is known to state and federal water managers as the rio laja basin aquifer carl the laja river exits the basin in the southwest corner and flows into the lerma chapala river system towards the pacific ocean the basin experiences an average annual temperature of 16 c and receives 600 mm of rainfall per year with the majority falling from june to september maximum evaporation is 1828 mm water table maps and chemistry show that recharge to the aquifer occurs along the perimeter of the basin through faults channels and through arroyos in the western half of the basin de leon et al 2005 knappett et al 2018

the well caretaker or owner when it was possible static and dynamic water levels were measured using an electric water level meter model 102 solinst canada ltd georgetown canada prior to sampling temperature ph specific conductance sc and oxidative reductive potential orp were measured using a calibrated multi meter ysi professional plus the well was pumped until these parameters stabilized

nylon syringe filters model s25ny045 simsii inc irvine ca into pre rinsed 20 ml high density polyethylene hdpe scintillation vials ls vial wheaton industries inc millville nj two vials were acidified to 0 1 nitric acid for cation and total elemental analyses the nitric acid was distilled from 70 acs grade nitric acid using an acid purification system 1000 dst savillex corp eden prairie mn one additional 20 ml glass vial was filled with filtered water for water isotopes δ18o and δ2h all samples were stored at 4 c prior to analysis most of the wells were chlorinated with an inline chlorination pump to avoid chlorine samples were collected upstream of the chlorine injection port a total of 137 wells were sampled like this between 2015 and 2017 these were sampled over several field trips which occurred during the dry season months of january and march and the wet season months of june and july these are referred to as the 2016 database in addition over this period approximately 35 of the 137 wells were sampled several times including the subset of 22 wells that were re sampled between 1999 and 2016 to assess the short term 2 year stability of the chemistry and temperature in the wells therefore for 137 wells a total of 224 water samples were available to assess potential systematic effects of season dry season vs wet season on the observed temperature and chemistry 2 3 laboratory analytical methods a study completed in 1999 sampled a total of 246 wells the samples were analyzed for a range of chemical parameters including major ions and the geogenic contaminants as manganese mn and selenium se and the anthropogenic contaminant nitrate no3 n mahlknecht 2003 all samples were filtered with a 0 45 µm syringe filter samples for cations were acidified

isotopes at the isotope laboratory of the university of waterloo canada the concentrations of major ions were compared between 1999 and 2016 in our previous study knappett et al 2018 but here we

water isotopes δ18o and δ2h were analyzed on a picarro cavity ring down system picarro inc santa clara ca within the stable isotope geosciences facility sigf at tamu based on running the known standards from the international agency for atomic energy iaea vsmow2 and slap the error was estimated to within 0 1 2 4 geo spatial analyses local or neighborhood concentrations of as were contoured along with temperature and chemical parameters measured on samples from 246 wells sampled in 1999 these were used to produce baseline values from which changes in 2016 could be calculated the typical spatial extent of a neighborhood for each parameter was calculated with ordinary kriging ok montero et al 2015 in contrast to other settings with high spatial variability in as concentrations over short distances 100 m aziz et al 2017 van geen et al 2003 long lag distances of approximately 10 km were observed in temperature and most of the chemical parameters thus aquifer chemistry and specifically as concentrations varied gradually over long distances in 1999 the uncertainty of interpolating 1999 concentrations was assessed by cross validation as detailed in our previous study haslauer et al 2016 knappett et al 2018 this error was reasonably small since the average spacing between the 1999 samples was much closer than the spatial lag distance this method of comparing the value of a parameter in a given well overlaid on the past 2 d interpolated concentration does not explicitly address the third dimension depth this issue is addressed here the depths of the wells sampled in 1999 were not reported but the depths for 102 out 137 wells were reported in 2016 of these 102 wells with known depths the vast majority had perforated casings that tapped the depth interval from 150 to 300 m below the surface the water table is generally 100 150 m below surface therefore most of the wells are pumping water from a similar depth range this agrees with a large database of over 1000 wells from the state water authority ceag in which practically all of the wells are installed to approximately 150 to 300 m below surface it is assumed that wells had a similar depth range in 1999 because few farmers or communities are willing to spend extra money to drill deeper than they need to for a sustained water source six deep wells 450 m however were included in the 2016 dataset which introduced the possibility of a depth bias in evaluating changing aquifer chemistry little relationship was observed however between well depth and temperature or chemical parameters this implies that the long well screens are mixing vertically stratified aquifers in similar proportions izbicki et al 2015 mayo 2010 to test the hypothesis that geothermal waters rising up faults is driving as concentrations the influence of proximity to known faults 1 km on as concentrations was assessed using the non parametric kruskal wallis test overlay and proximity tools were implemented in arcmap to extract the distance to the nearest mapped fault the fault map was a published structural geologic and tectonic map of central mexico that was modified based on extensive field observations of the basin by the authors nieto samaniego et al 2007 since the mineralogy of the overlying rock sediments and soil may influence as concentrations rango et al 2013 shamsudduha et al 2015 winkel et al 2008 their potential role was assessed using the kruskal wallis test combined with overlay and proximity tools in arcmap a digital surface geology map was created in arcmap from 16 maps of the region of 1 250 000 and 1 50 000 scale published by the mexican geological service servicio geologico mexicano a soil 1 250 000 scale soil map created by the national institute for statistics geography and information inegi 2007 was used to assess spatial correlations between as concentrations and soil type to test whether human alteration of the land surface and vadose zone through disposal of untreated urban wastewater or the application of fertilizers and irrigation return flow from farm fields may be influencing as concentrations land use immediately surrounding each well was defined as urban peri urban farming or rural based on visual observation on google earth images taken in 2016 the influence of the land use variable was then tested using the kruskal wallis test 2 5 bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses to identify possible mixing or reaction processes driving high as concentrations covariates were assessed through bivariate regression with temperature and chemical parameters on the 2016 dataset next pca was performed on the 2016 dataset to visualize the collinearity between parameters collinearity manifests by clustering of parameters on the pc1 vs pc2 loadings plot to minimize the impact of outliers and linearize non linear relationships between parameters the pca was performed on z scores of both un transformed and ln transformed datasets respectively to quantify the specific impact that each covariate had on as concentrations while controlling for the influence of other parameters three types of step wise linear regression simple robust and ln transformed were performed on the 2016 dataset the performance of all models were assessed by their ability to predict as concentrations using the root mean squared error rmse and r2 the goal was to develop a parsimonious model predicting as concentrations across the basin as a function of temperature and chemical parameters to elucidate geochemical and hydrological processes driving as concentrations the point estimates of the slopes b standard errors se and significance level p value for each statistically significant parameter were reported from the multiple regression models all bivariate and multivariate modeling was performed using concentrations in units of mm so that stoichiometric relationships could be determined the direction and magnitude of changes 1999 2016 in neighborhood parameter values were compared to the slopes of statistically significant predictor variables in the multiple regression models of the 2016 dataset if the multivariate analysis on the 2016 dataset indicated that parameter x was significantly and positively correlated to as concentrations parameter x also should have increased between 1999 and 2016 2 6 random forest modeling random forest rf regression models a classification and regression tree cart model were trained to analyze and account for non linear relationships breiman 2001 breiman et al 1984 between as concentrations and the measured hydro chemical parameters the rf is one of a growing number of machine learning algorithms that have been applied to understand and predict the distribution of anthropogenic and geogenic contaminants in groundwater bui et al 2020 smith et al 2018 one features of these machine learning models is that even poorly correlated parameters can help make the predictions more accurate bui et al 2020 therefore unlike the multiple regression models where only statistically significant parameters were retained in the final model all parameters were used in the rf model the rf algorithm has many advantages compared to single decision tree methods it can handle the high dimensionality of the data set it is relatively fast to train and robust against outliers missing data and non normal datasets which are typical of groundwater chemistry studies the pre modeling data treatment was the same as for the step wise linear regression models random forest compared to other decision tree models grows multiple decision trees and the results are averaged over all grown trees with randomized predictor subsets for tree growing and node splitting this can lead to more accurate and stable predictions here up to 1000 trees were grown and maximal number of predictors to split a node were set 3 n n number of predictors to prevent over fitting leave one group out cross validation with 100 repetitions for each repetition training 80 and validation 20 datasets were randomly selected for model training and validation respectively the final model was selected by one standard error of the minimal rmse of all trained models to analyze the impact of the predictors on as concentrations variable importance was assessed by averaging the impurity decreases for all nodes over all trees with the gini impurity metric which defines the variable selection for node splitting louppe et al 2013 therefore the higher the value of the mean decrease in gini the higher the importance of the variable in the model and consequently for predicting as concentrations however compared to linear regression models the variable importance of random forest models does not account for the direction positive or negative of the relationship between the predictor and as concentrations therefore partial dependence plots pdp were estimated to test effects between the predicted response variable and individual predictor variables by averaging the effect of all other predictors friedman 2001 to visualize the direction of the effect in the trained random forest model 2 7 geochemical modeling saturation indices si s for over 150 minerals were calculated using temperature and water chemistry data from the 2016 datasets using the software phreeqc and the wateq4 database parkhurst and appelo 2013 saturation indices indicate the equilibrium state of water with respect to minerals it is defined as si log iap k where iap is the ion activity product and k is the equilibrium constant if si 0 the solution is in equilibrium with the mineral phase and therefore highly influential on the dissolved concentrations of the constituent elements in that mineral phase if si 0 groundwater is oversaturated with respect to the particular mineral which means that the mineral phase may precipitate to achieve equilibrium finally if si 0 the mineral will dissolve if it is present in the aquifer 3 results 3 1 changing neighborhood temperature and chemical parameters over time the median percentage increase in 137 neighborhood concentrations from 1999 to 2016 of ba na li s si temperature and ph was 36 28 27 17 8 5 and 4 respectively table 1 fig s2 in contrast the median percentage decrease in neighborhood concentrations of fe mn br hco3 ca and no3 n was 97 55 33 26 10 and 8 respectively the median neighborhood temperature increase was 1 5 c while ph increased by 0 3 units the previously reported rise in δ18o of 0 9 was maintained with the larger dataset used in the present study knappett et al 2018 significantly neighborhood cl concentrations and sc were stable between 1999 and 2016 to control for uncertainties arising from interpolating neighborhood baseline concentrations and temperature in 1999 changes in parameter values were assessed using the smaller number of 22 re sampled wells and approximately the same magnitude and direction of change was observed in the same parameters fig s1 3 2 evidence for rising arsenic concentrations of all wells sampled in 1999 the median and 90th percentile as concentrations were 9 and 20 µg l respectively fig 3 a in 2016 however the median and 90th percentile as concentrations were 14 and 40 µg l respectively in 1999 19 8 and 93 38 of 246 wells exceeded the mexican 25 µg l and who drinking water limits for as respectively in 2016 however 29 21 and 88 64 of 137 wells exceeded mexican and who limits respectively fig 3a furthermore 3 of the 22 wells that were re sampled in 2016 increased by more than 10 µg l compared to the 1999 value fig 4 b substantial increases in as concentrations were observed in certain neighborhoods fig 4a c thirty percent of wells sampled in 2016 contained as concentrations that exceeded their previous baseline neighborhood concentrations 1999 by at least 10 µg l fig 3b an additional 45 of wells exhibited modest increases in as concentrations 0 10 µg l the greatest increases in as concentrations were observed in two geographical areas the first was an area that previously had high as concentrations in 1999 located in the northeast part of the basin called laguna seca the second area with the greatest increases were distributed throughout the western part of the basin or the carl aquifer in 1999 all wells sampled in the carl aquifer contained low as concentrations near the who limit in 2016 however this region hosted many wells exceeding the who limit and some exceeding the mexican limit fig 1 no systematic variation in as concentrations was observed with season fig s3 and samples were taken at different times of the year so it is unlikely that seasonal fluctuations in as concentrations possibly driven by more pumping to irrigate during the dry season can explain the widespread increases 3 3 arsenic concentrations land use and geology to assess the possible influence of geological composition and faulting and human land use on as concentrations 2016 concentrations were compared to four land surface variables proximity to known faults surface geology type soil type and land use type the non parametric kruskal test confirmed that wells located within 1 km of a known fault did not have higher as concentrations than wells located further away fig s4 the vast majority of wells sampled in 2016 are installed on outcropping sedimentary deposits such as conglomerate and sandstone n 113 and along with wells installed on acidic volcanic rock n 7 tend to have the highest as concentrations p 0 05 fig s5 the eight wells installed on outcropping basic volcanic rocks had the lowest as concentrations wells installed on outcropping carbonate rocks had intermediate as concentrations arsenic concentrations were systematically higher in wells underlying farm land and rural areas compared to urban areas p 0 05 fig s6 no systematic variation in as concentration was observed across the three major soil types in the basin fig s7 in summary wells installed in agricultural or rural areas underlain by sedimentary or acidic volcanic rocks had the highest as concentrations 3 4 arsenic concentrations and well construction and use to yield insight into the impact of flow processes within wells on rising as concentrations as concentrations measured in 2016 were compared to well construction and operation variables including well depth bottom elevation and pumping rate numerous reports consultores en geologia 1992 ingenieros civiles y geologos asociados 1980 suggest that wells in this region are perforated over their entire length this creates the possibility for cross formational flow through these long well screens especially in the six recently installed community wells ranging from 450 to 650 m in depth these very deep wells typically have moderately high as concentrations fig 5 b ranging from 20 to 60 µg l this finding is likely because of dilution with low tds shallow groundwater across the long well screens this is further evidenced by convergence to the basin s mean sc value in wells with the highest pumping rates where moderate as concentrations also are found fig 5a wells with the highest pumping rates tended to range from 150 to 300 m depth but there was a substantial range of pumping rates observed for wells in every depth interval fig s8 3 5 arsenic concentrations and temperature and chemical parameters the relationship between as concentrations and temperature chemical parameters and water isotopes were analyzed to gain insight into the hydrological and geochemical processes that may be driving as concentrations higher in this intensively pumped aquifer system a piper plot revealed that as concentrations increase smoothly as the dominant cation transitions from ca mg to na k fig 6 bivariate correlations were calculated between as concentrations and all potential co variates measured in 2016 table 1 both robust and ln transformed fig s9 bivariate regressions were performed to minimize the influence of localized processes in the ln transformed bivariate regression analysis as concentrations correlated significantly and positively to temperature ph sc hco3 na si s mo li f and cl table 1 the collinearity between variables were further investigated on the ln transformed data using pca fig 7 fig s10 the strongest collinearity was observed between the variables sc na hco3 cl s and mo which formed the first principal component pc1 fig 7 the variables as f temperature ph and li also clustered together but were distinct from pc1 the variables mg ca sr ba and no3 n comprised pc2 the specific influence of each variable on as concentrations while controlling for the effects of other covariates was assessed using step wise multiple regression and rf modeling table 1 three types of linear regression were used regular robust and ln transformed the latter two models were performed to minimize the impact of outliers on the model regular multiple regression indicated many significant predictor variables of as concentrations however many of these variables did not have robust bivariate relationships to as or the bivariate relationship was of the opposite sign table 1 as assessed by r2 the robust regression model performed poorly r2 0 39 under predicting the concentrations of 5 wells with the highest as concentrations in the basin fig 8 b the ln transformed performed consistently across all as concentrations fig 8c was internally consistent since the bivariate relationships had the same sign as in the model and was much more parsimonious compared to the first model this regression model has six significant predictor variables temperature ph si mo f and no3 n of these only no3 n has a negative slope meaning that decreasing no3 n concentrations predicted increasing as concentrations when controlling for the effects of other predictor variables table 1 the rf model performed the best r2 0 90 fig 8d this machine learning model confirmed the importance of the variables identified by stepwise multiple regression but also detected the influence of ca and na which may have been masked through collinearity in the ln transformed multiple regression model the partial dependence plots from the rf model show that ca and na had a negative and positive effect on as concentrations respectively fig s11 s12 the variables identified by rf modeling from most to least important for predicting as concentrations were f mo ca na temperature ph no3 n and li the negative influence of ca on as concentrations was detected by bivariate and two multiple regression models table 1 fig s9 the spatial distribution of each of the eight as predictor variables identified by the ln transformed multiple regression and rf models reveal further insight into the prediction power of these variables on as concentrations fig s13 s20 wells emplaced upon outcropping bedrock on the higher elevation periphery of the basin tended to have cooler temperatures and low as concentrations fig s13 the center of the basin exhibits zones with temperatures varying from 30 to over 40 c with the highest temperature zones exhibiting the highest as concentrations ph exhibits a similar pattern to temperature fig s14 fluoride concentrations also peak in wells with the warmest and most alkaline waters fig s17 knappett et al 2018 molybdenum also closely correlates to as across the basin fig s16 in contrast si concentrations tend to be highest in the center of the basin and lowest around the periphery but wells with intermediate 10 25 µg l as concentrations tend to have the highest si concentrations fig s15 the rf model did not rank si highly as an important variable in predicting as concentrations table 1 a subset of 109 wells analyzed for the element boron b showed at strong bivariate correlation r2 0 4 with as fig s21 however because of the missing data this element was not included in the multivariate analyses the largest clustering of sampled wells with high no3 n 5 mg l 0 36 mm and low as 6 µg l 8e 05 mm concentrations occurs around the city of san miguel de allende however this is a common occurrence over the outer periphery of the basin fig s18 in contrast in the center of the basin many wells have intermediate concentrations of both as and no3 n 0 6 5 0 mg l and wells with the highest as concentrations 50 µg l 4 7e 04 mm have the least no3 n 1 5 mg l 0 1 mm a subset of 53 wells tested for oxygen contained concentrations ranging from 3 to 7 mg l therefore the aquifer appears to be well oxidized a subset of 45 wells contained doc ranging from 0 5 to 7 mg l the presence of abundant oxygen and high orp suggests this doc is not bioavailable chapelle et al 2013 the reason may be that the organic carbon is locked up in biofilms on grain surfaces that are mobilized by shear forces during pumping graham et al 2015 alternatively wells screened across geochemically stratified aquifers may promote mixing between oxidizing and reducing agents izbicki et al 2015 mayo 2010 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 so the abundant oxygen and doc may not come from the same parts of the aquifer system 4 discussion 4 1 accelerated silicate hydrolysis from mixing with geothermal waters the best multiple regression model explained 72 of the variability of as concentrations across the basin in 2016 whereas the rf machine learning model explained 90 many of the parameters that drive the as concentrations higher are common tracers of geothermal waters smedley and kinniburgh 2002 hot geothermal waters accelerate the dissolution of widely present silicate minerals such as albite releasing high concentrations of na and si the mineral albite was near saturation across the basin fig s22 the transformation of albite to kaolinite also raises the si for albite in pore waters while raising ph through the following hydrolysis reaction 1 naalsi3o8 2h 9h2o na 4h4sio4 al2si2 oh 4 studies in the mer suggested that the hydrolysis of albite drove increasing ph rango et al 2013 albite hydrolysis tends to proceed most quickly at acidic and basic ph s and slowest at near neutral chen and brantley 1997 this process is greatly accelerated by higher temperatures albite glass that is found in pyroclastic flows and tuffs gulbrandsen and cressman 1960 is weathered more easily than crystalline albite found in volcanic rocks like rhyolite hamilton et al 2000 this rising ph converts iron oxide oxyanion binding sites from positive to negatively charged which releases oxyanions like as and mo dixit and hering 2003 johannesson and tang 2009 smedley et al 2002 albite hydrolysis furthermore releases na ions when it transforms to kaolinite fig 9 the mineral kaolinite was supersaturated across much of the basin fig s22 the formation of kaolinite and other clays increases the abundance of cation exchange sites which further depletes the aquifer of ca and releases more na rango et al 2013 cation exchange on kaolinite can be represented by the following formula 2 na al2si2 oh 4 ca2 na ca2 al2si2 oh 4 the mineral fluorite is consistently slightly undersaturated si 0 across the basin suggesting this soluble mineral controls the concentrations of ca and f ions therefore decreasing ca concentration through reactions 1 2 acts to dissolve the mineral fluorite through the common ion effect apambire et al 1997 3 caf2 s ca2 2f this explains the co rising f concentrations between 1999 and 2016 and the tight correlation between as and f concentrations in the 2016 dataset table 1 fig 9 evidence of the internal consistency of the ln transformed and rf models can be found by examining the bivariate associations both the regular linear regression and the robust regression models are limited in that they are seeking simple straight line relationships between as and each variable many variables like temperature and ph follow a positive exponential relationship with as whereas other variables like ca mg and no3 n have an inverse relationship these are poorly fit with straight lines other researchers have found such negative correlations between ca and mg and as and f in the geothermally influenced sedimentary aquifers of the mer rango et al 2013 these authors found that basaltic rock aquifers tended to have high concentrations of ca and mg but low concentrations of as f and na the basic volcanic rocks on the flanks of the palo huerfano volcano located at the southern edge of the basin host wells that are consistently low in as concentrations and high in ca and mg fig 1 fig s20 a similar multi variate structure amongst chemical parameters but not temperature was observed in 769 wells within orange county north carolina dinwiddie and liu 2018 in that study the source of as was attributed to the oxidation of pyrite within the clastic sedimentary rocks and the release of as from metal oxides at higher ph the authors furthermore found that as concentrations increased with proximity to faults which they attributed to the presence of more as bearing sulfide minerals in the present study area pyrite was rarely found in a recent mineralogical study on surface outcrops and the exhaustive analyses of borehole cuttings from two deep 450 m wells including one within the high as region in the eastern part of the basin fig 1 shepherd 2018 furthermore the oxidation of pyrite does not explain the apparent rising ph over time or the highly significant impact that ph has on as concentrations in the 2016 dataset since pyrite oxidation drives ph down appleyard et al 2006 the significance of the parameters temperature ph and f along with si and na in the ln transformed regression and rf models respectively and the tendency for the highest as wells to be found in felsic sedimentary or volcanic rocks suggest that warm geothermally influenced waters are driving as concentrations higher through hydrolysis of silicate minerals like albite glass found in volcanic tuff high as wells however are not limited to those installed in volcanic tuff which is suggested by surface mapping and driller s logs to be present in large quantities in the southeastern part of the basin fig 1 and 2 across the basin the majority of wells are drawing water from the first 100 300 m which is typically comprised of clastic sedimentary rocks sourced from the surrounding mountains a subset of approximately 109 samples that were analyzed for boron b had a highly significant bivariate positive correlation with as p 0 01 this further strengthens the argument for mixing with geothermal waters being the primary driver of as since both li and b are considered a tracer of geothermal waters busico et al 2018 grassi et al 2014 guo et al 2008 morales arredondo et al 2018 munoz et al 2015 rango et al 2013 the slopes of the ln transformed multiple regression model can be quantitatively interpreted table 1 for example a 1 increase in temperature will produce a 1 increase in as concentrations a 1 increase in ph will produce a 2 increase in as concentrations a 1 increase in si mo and f concentrations will produce 0 32 0 24 and 0 37 increases in as concentrations respectively in contrast a 1 increase in no3 n will cause a 0 14 decrease in as concentrations between 1999 and 2016 temperature ph and concentrations of na si f and li typically increased in specific wells and at the neighborhood scale further supporting the hypothesis that geothermal waters are mixing in increasing proportion with the freshly recharged young groundwater driving silicate hydrolysis and raising ph the fact that cl and no3 n concentrations remained relatively stable however implies that changes to the composition of recharge water from irrigation return flow has yet to reach the water table mahlknecht et al 2004 this agrees with the estimated 2 000 to 10 000 year old well water that was calculated using c14 age dating on water samples taken from 24 wells across the basin in 2000 mahlknecht et al 2006a and the absence of tritium in 21 of those wells prior to the drilling of production wells in the 1940 s the water table was close to the surface in many low lying areas de leon et al 2005 between 1999 and 2016 the vadose zone thickness typically grew approximately 20 m across the basin knappett et al 2018 li et al 2020 in 2016 the water table was typically found 50 to 200 m below the surface studies based on observed chloride mass accounting from rainfall and groundwater age dating have demonstrated that thick vadose zones in arid to semi arid regions delay the arrival of recharge water by thousands of years phillips 1994 scanlon et al 2003 tyler et al 1996 together these results suggest that the growing vadose zone has protected the aquifer from contamination from land use changes including fertilizer application irrigation return flow as a process for concentrating dissolved solids is therefore not driving as concentrations clark and fritz 1997 the rising δ18o that we previously reported knappett et al 2018 implies that the geothermal waters are more enriched in 18o compared to more recently recharged water this could be attributed to cooler paleoclimate conditions in this region at the time of recharge resulting in more depleted heavy isotopes clark and fritz 1997 the close correlation between as and mo oxyanions can be explained by their binding to positively charged metal oxides sites at neutral ph when ph rises these sites are converted to negatively charged releasing the oxyanions to pore waters rango et al 2013 smedley et al 2002 4 2 nitrate indicates shallow aquifer water and predicts low arsenic as concentrations between 1999 and 2016 no3 n concentrations were relatively stable table 1 the most toxic concentrations of no3 n 10 mg l underlie the city of san miguel de allende founded in the 16th century on a permeable alluvial fan mahlknecht et al 2006b the source of this nitrate is debatable it may be attributed to household latrines onsite sanitation which were traditionally installed in the basements of houses in san miguel alternatively in the 1990 s hog farms located near the city were suspected as the source and have since been moved away perhaps coincidentally these city wells are installed on the basic igneous rocks along the flanks of the palo huerfano volcano which as mentioned above drive as concentrations lower nevertheless across the basin a robust inverse relationship was observed between as and no3 n concentrations this relationship was significant in the ln transformed multiple regression model and an important variable in the rf model suggesting that even when controlling for the impacts of other processes and atypical regions like the urbanized slopes of the palo huerfano volcano higher no3 concentrations were predictive of low as concentrations this can be explained by mixing of shallow recently recharged water 100 years with deeper geothermally impacted older groundwater that hasn t been impacted by the intensive growth in agriculture since 1940 a greater proportion of fresh shallow groundwater in a well acts to dilute the older more mineralized groundwater mixing of diverse water types through long well screens is likely an important process in this basin that impacts well water chemistry this is supported by the observation that wells with high pumping rates 40 l s tended to have intermediate sc values fig 5a in contrast wells with the small pumping rates 10 l s sample aquifer conditions that are specific to a narrower depth interval although this mixes waters contaminated by geothermal and anthropogenic surface processes it also acts to dilute each therefore water that has abundant no3 n suppresses as concentrations through dilution the presence of long screened wells means that there is ample opportunity in this basin for cross formational flow several thousand wells have been installed across the basin hoogesteger 2018 the typical well depths are 100 to 300 m deep knappett et al 2018 although municipal wells installed in the last 5 years tend to be much deeper up to 650 m these long screened wells have likely connected geochemically distinct aquifers and promoted mixing along these conduits driven by hydraulic head differences between the layers izbicki et al 2015 mayo 2010 4 3 limitations of this study although the evidence presented indicates rising or stable as concentrations but almost never decreasing as water tables fall the long term trends are not available owing to lack of regular re sampling in the years between 1999 and 2016 therefore some of the variability in the changing as concentrations das in the 22 re sampled well and 137 neighborhood comparison may be driven by short term fluctuations the cumulative distribution curves of as concentrations for the entire sampling campaigns of 1999 and 2016 suggest however the concentrations are rising but this may have been influenced by a greater sampling density in the center of the basin in 2016 than in 1999 where many of the wells were located in the southeast corner of the basin known as the dr mora san jose iturbide dmsj groundwater management zone by the state and federal water managers although it is impossible to capture long term trends with only two snap shots of the basin the situation appears quite serious since in some cases neighborhood concentrations have doubled over the 17 years in spite of these limitations this study describes one approach to cautiously utilize previous sampling campaigns in aquifer systems which are rarely monitored and publicly reported to suggest changing chemistry develop hypotheses and design more robust experiments to test those hypotheses the direction of change in other variables over 17 years added strength to the conclusions of the multivariate modeling on the 2016 dataset fig s2 but these changes are best regarded as tendencies wherein a parameter commonly both increased stayed the same and decreased in different wells nevertheless the match of the direction of change in parameters over time to the sign of the coefficients of those parameters in the regression and rf modeling suggest that the same processes driving as concentrations as water tables fall are operating over time and space land surface changes seem to have minimal impact on as concentrations but the natural geology shallow geothermal heat natural recharge areas and aggressive pumping from long screened wells are critically important until this aquifer system is geologically mapped using hundreds of borehole lithologies and long screen wells are profiled using down hole sampling to map the aquifer chemistry and hydraulic properties this aquifer cannot be confidently managed from the perspective of the future fate of geogenic contaminants like as and f this study is not a replacement for these more conclusive and invasive methods to study aquifer systems but rather shows one approach to monitor and infer what can be known by studying the geology the multi variate structure of the temperature and chemistry data sampled from long screened wells 4 4 implications of rising arsenic concentrations with falling water tables arsenic concentrations rose over a time period when the average water table decline was approximately 20 m over 17 years knappett et al 2018 li et al 2020 in 1999 the area of the basin that exceeded the who drinking water limit was mostly confined to the eastern side of the basin in the laguna seca region in 2016 however while as concentrations increased in this more impacted region the western half of the basin now hosts numerous wells that exceed the who drinking water limit this study suggests that the primary process driving increasing as concentrations is mixing with geothermal waters specifically the observed rising ph liberates as from metal oxide surfaces rango et al 2013 the geospatial analysis found that the highest as concentrations tended to be located in the most intensively farmed parts of the basin which are also most influenced by geothermal waters irrigation return flow however is not driving the rising as concentrations as evidenced by the stability of indicators of irrigation return cl and no3 n this suggests that there is a long lag time of at least several decades between changes to the land surface and the aquifer chemistry at 150 300 m depth mahlknecht et al 2004 therefore the density of farms and irrigation pumping coincides with falling water tables driving the most mixing with geothermal waters in the basin center known faults were not found to play a major role across the basin but may still have local importance 5 conclusions the long term consequences of over exploiting aquifer systems in semi arid volcanic and geothermal regions is unknown owing to lack of long term monitoring programs and process level insights into what drives changes in the chemical composition of well water this study helps to address each of these deficiencies by comparing the distribution of as concentrations across an intensively exploited basin over a period of 17 years and evaluating the local environment and chemical covariates that consistently drive as concentrations in both space and time between 1999 and 2016 neighborhood as concentrations increased by 19 in long screened production wells across in an over exploited inter montane aquifer system with near surface geothermal heat parts of the aquifer system with high temperature and ph and high as concentrations in 1999 had much higher as concentrations in 2016 this is reflected by the doubling of the 90th percentile as concentration from 20 µg l in 1999 to 40 µg l in 2016 parts of the aquifer system in the western recharge area with low as concentrations in 1999 witnessed as concentrations rising over the who drinking water limit in many wells ln transformed stepwise multiple regression indicated five statistically significant positively correlated predictor variables of as temperature ph si mo and f and one negatively correlating predictor variable no3 n random forest modeling of as added na positive correlate and ca negative correlate to the list of important variables that predict as concentrations while confirming the importance of the others the neighborhood values of the above mentioned positive and negative predictor variables increased and decreased between 1999 and 2016 respectively this suggests that these parameters impact as concentrations across space and time these observations are consistent with three chemical reactions that are accelerated by rising groundwater temperatures 1 silicate hydrolysis to kaolinite clay raising ph 2 conversion of metal oxide sorption sites from positive to negative releasing as oxyanions to pore waters and 3 stripping of ca from pore waters through cation exchange with na thereby driving the release of f through dissolution of the mineral fluorite the presence of long well screens allows for the possibility that this sequence of reactions are occurring in response to the transport of deeper hot geothermal groundwater into shallower aquifers by flowing through the artificial open conduits but more work is needed to localize these reactions through characterizing water flow and transport this study demonstrates a link between falling water tables and rising as concentrations across a 100 km wide basin this relationship should be robustly quantified within over exploited aquifer systems with known geogenic contaminants so that an accurate accounting of the costs and benefits of pumping that aquifer can be made the findings of this study suggests future research and management strategies which may help mitigate exposure to rising as and other geogenic contaminants first the hydrostratigraphy geology and hydraulic properties of the aquifer system needs to be systematically mapped through a system that publicly shares borehole lithology from newly installed wells second the pore water chemistry needs to be mapped at the sub hydrostratigraphic unit scale to determine at which depth and in what rock or sediment the long screened wells are drawing the most as f and no3 third this information should be widely shared so that farmers and municipalities can use the new information to target currently safe units with short screened wells fourth the water chemistry should be systematically monitored twice per year dry and wet season in key wells that are

17627,this study identifies causes of rising arsenic as concentrations over 17 years in an inter montane aquifer system located just north of the trans mexican volcanic belt in the mesa central physiographic region that is extensively developed by long screened production wells arsenic concentrations increased by more than 10 µg l in 14 3 22 of re sampled wells similarly in a larger scale analysis wherein as concentrations measured in 137 wells in 2016 were compared to interpolated baseline concentrations from 246 wells in 1999 as concentrations rose more than 10 µg l in 30 of wells between 1999 and 2016 the percentage of all wells sampled in each basin wide sampling campaign exceeding the world health organization s 10 µg l drinking water limit increased from 38 to 64 principal components analysis pca step wise multiple regression and random forest modeling rf revealed that high as concentrations are closely associated with high ph and temperature and high concentrations of fluoride f molybdenum mo lithium li sodium na and silica si but low calcium ca and nitrate no3 concentrations pumping induced mixing with hot geothermally impacted groundwater generates alkaline water through hydrolysis of silicate minerals the rising ph converts oxyanion sorption sites from positive to negative releasing as and mo to pore waters the negative correlation between nitrate and as concentrations can be explained by conservative mixing of shallow young groundwater with geothermally influenced groundwater therefore water carrying an anthropogenic contaminant dilutes water carrying geogenic contaminants this process is enabled by long well screens over exploitation of aquifers in geothermal regions for agriculture can drive as concentrations in water from production wells to toxic levels even as the total dissolved solids remain low graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic groundwater fluoride geogenic nitrate geothermal wellbore mixing 1 introduction the aim of target 6 1 within the united nation s sustainable development goal 6 is to achieve universal convenient access to safe and affordable drinking water global indicator 6 1 1 tracks progress towards achieving universal access to safe drinking water and states that priority contaminants like arsenic as and fluoride f should be progressively monitored in household drinking water united nations water 2017 the testing and subsequent mitigation will require massive investment by governments non governmental organizations ngos private households and businesses the success of mitigation strategies which are designed based on the knowledge that is generated through these testing campaigns will be susceptible to the stability of as and f concentrations in groundwater although groundwater chemistry is commonly stable over time as concentrations have been observed to change over time mihajlov et al 2020 seasonal concentration fluctuations may occur in shallow aquifers influenced by seasonal surface water table fluctuations schaefer et al 2016 and long term increases in as concentrations occur in production wells that are pumped at high rates ayotte et al 2015 long term and large scale studies suggest that changes in as concentrations can be substantial across a region within a wide variety of aquifer settings under the influence of intensive pumping appleyard et al 2006 ayotte et al 2015 2011 erban et al 2013 harvey et al 2005 smith et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 as rampant groundwater depletion for agriculture in arid regions continues around the world rising concentrations of geogenic contaminants and resulting chronic diseases may result hellegers et al 2011 ling et al 2011 the impacts of intensive pumping on concentrations of geogenic as in over exploited inter montane aquifer systems under the influence of geothermal waters however has not to our knowledge been systematically studied at a regional scale three types of aquifers commonly

abundant dissolved organic carbon doc for example within the ganges brahmaputra delta fendorf et al 2010 nickson et al 1998 2 high ph waters in semi arid or arid regions for example in pakistan naseem and mcarthur 2018 and 3 geothermally influenced ground waters grassi et al 2014 guo et al 2008 which are typical of western latin america bundschuh et al 2012 munoz et al 2015 nordstrom 2002 and the african rift valley darling et al 1996 rango et al 2013 furthermore numerous studies have found elevated as concentrations in pore waters of volcanic rocks amini et al 2008 busico et al 2018 johannesson and tang 2009 aquifers containing toxic concentrations of as throughout latin america are commonly comprised of volcanic rocks and sediments which contain remnant geothermal heat bundschuh et al 2012 morales arredondo et al 2018 exhaustive reviews however of reports of arsenic occurrence in groundwater throughout latin america indicate that few studies have analyzed long term changes of as concentrations in heavily pumped geothermally influenced aquifers bundschuh et al 2012 groundwater is the primary source of water for municipal agricultural and industrial demand in central mexico this groundwater is typically stored within the sediments and rocks of inter montane basins with near surface geothermal heat morales arredondo et al 2018 these aquifers are being dewatered at alarming rates amongst other problems such as subsidence the falling water table drives up drilling and electricity costs for pumping hoogesteger 2018 hoogesteger and wester 2017 mexicano 2017 ortega guerrero 2009 wester et al 2011 the present study is concerned with the deterioration in groundwater quality that accompanies the dewatering of geothermally influenced aquifers to serve agriculture the objectives of this study are to 1 estimate changes in temperature and groundwater chemistry across the independence basin between 1999 and 2016 2 estimate changes in as concentrations at different spatial scales and 3 deduce the hydrogeochemical processes driving as concentrations using multivariate regression and machine learning geothermally influenced ground waters in volcanic rock and sediments commonly contain high dissolved as concentrations along with high temperature ph and concentrations of fluoride f silica si sodium na lithium li and boron b grassi et al 2014 guo et al 2008 morales arredondo et al 2018 munoz et al 2015 rango et al 2013 higher pore water temperatures accelerate the hydrolysis of albite to kaolinite clay this releases si and na and raises the ph rango et al 2013 this reaction generates new cation exchange sites that favor calcium ca over na which releases additional na to pore waters the rising ph moreover converts the charge of metal oxide surfaces from positive to negative releasing oxyanions of as and molybdenum mo dixit and hering 2003 dzombak and morel 1990 johannesson and tang 2009 smedley et al 2002 lastly the reduction in dissolved ca concentrations through cation exchange on the newly produced clay promotes the dissolution of fluorite releasing f to groundwater via the common ion effect apambire et al 1997 this sequence of reactions will be deduced from the joint basin wide analysis of 1 changing temperature and chemistry between 1999 and 2016 2 the multivariate structure of the physical and chemical properties in 2016 3 calculated 2016 saturation indices and 4 the spatial relationship between as concentrations and surface geology other potentially confounding processes that may locally influence well water temperature and chemistry were tested through spatial analysis these include 1 including mixing of shallow and deep geothermal waters by upwelling along faults morales arredondo et al 2018 2 the infiltration of fertilizers from fields and 3 the infiltration of untreated sewage from cities 2 study area and methods 2 1 description of study area the study area is the so called independence basin in the state of guanajuato mexico ortega guerrero 2009 according to water authorities the official name is upper río laja watershed cuenca alta del río laja this study area was discussed in previous publications but is briefly reviewed here de leon et al 2005 knappett et al 2018 mahlknecht 2003 mahlknecht et al 2006a 2004 ortega guerrero 2009 the basin is roughly 100 km in diameter and ranges in elevation from 1900 m above sea level masl to 3000 masl the flat central and eastern part of the basin is known as the dry lake laguna seca area the western central part of the basin has 100 m of undulating relief created by arroyos and larger channels of the rio laja and its tributaries the basin is surrounded on all sides by outcropping acidic intermediate and basic volcanic rocks the western side of the basin is bounded by rhyolite and ignimbrite of the guanajuato sierras the southern side of the basin is bounded by basalt andesite and pyroclastic material of the extinct palo huerfano volcano the east and northern edges are comprised of alternating zones of ignimbrites tuff and pyroclastic material and basalts fig 1 del rio varela et al 2020 the central area of the basin is underlain by layers of clastic sedimentary rocks derived from the surrounding mountains these fluvial deposits are interlayered with welded tuff volcanic ash and basaltic lava flows consultores en geologia 1992 del rio varela et al 2020 ingenieros civiles y geologos asociados 1980 the basement rock is comprised of fractured acidic volcanic rocks shepherd 2018 lastly marine carbonate rocks outcrop in a few places throughout the basin normal faults and graben structures are common in the basin and are part of the extensive taxco san miguel de allende system of faults which run through central mexico in a general nne ssw direction alaniz alvarez and nieto samaniego 2007 prominent cliffs throughout the basin demarcate the location of normal faults formed during extensional events over the last 30 million years nieto samaniego et al 2007 these events caused the sinking of the basement rock and the infilling of grabens with thick layers of sediments from the eroding mountains one of these grabens comprises the western half of the basin and hosts the drainage network of the rio laja fig 2 the porous sandstone and conglomerate that infills this graben is known to state and federal water managers as the rio laja basin aquifer carl the laja river exits the basin in the southwest corner and flows into the lerma chapala river system towards the pacific ocean the basin experiences an average annual temperature of 16 c and receives 600 mm of rainfall per year with the majority falling from june to september maximum evaporation is 1828 mm water table maps and chemistry show that recharge to the aquifer occurs along the perimeter of the basin through faults channels and through arroyos in the western half of the basin de leon et al 2005 knappett et al 2018 li et al 2020 agriculture consumes approximately 85 of all the groundwater extracted in this basin wester et al 2011 the same aquifers pumped for irrigation are relied upon for a growing population of approximately 600 000 people inegi 2019 2 2 field measurements and sampling the locations of wells were surveyed using a handheld gps etrex 30 garmin well construction information was obtained from

temperature ph specific conductance sc and oxidative reductive potential orp were measured using a calibrated multi meter ysi professional plus the well was pumped until these parameters stabilized

nylon syringe filters model s25ny045 simsii inc irvine ca into pre rinsed 20 ml high density polyethylene hdpe scintillation vials ls vial wheaton industries inc millville nj two vials were acidified to 0 1 nitric acid for cation and total elemental analyses the nitric acid was distilled from 70 acs grade nitric acid using an acid purification system 1000 dst savillex corp eden prairie mn one additional 20 ml glass vial was filled with filtered water for water isotopes δ18o and δ2h all samples were stored at 4 c prior to analysis most of the wells were chlorinated with an inline chlorination pump to avoid chlorine samples were collected upstream of the chlorine injection port a total of 137 wells were sampled like this between 2015 and 2017 these were sampled over several field trips which occurred during the dry season months of january and march and the wet season months of june and july these are referred to as the 2016 database in addition over this period approximately 35 of the 137 wells were sampled several times including the subset of 22 wells that were re sampled between 1999 and 2016 to assess the short term 2 year stability of the chemistry and temperature in the wells therefore for 137 wells a total of 224 water samples were available to assess potential systematic effects of season dry season vs wet season on the observed temperature and chemistry 2 3 laboratory analytical methods a study completed in 1999 sampled a total of 246 wells the samples were analyzed for a range of chemical parameters including major ions and the geogenic contaminants as manganese mn and selenium se and the anthropogenic contaminant nitrate no3 n mahlknecht 2003 all samples were filtered with a 0 45 µm syringe filter samples for cations were acidified to a ph of 2 using ultrapure nitric acid cations and anions were measured with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms and an ion chromatograph respectively by activation laboratories ltd ancaster ontario alkalinity concentrations were determined in the field by titration with 1 5 n h2so4 and the ph indicator methyl orange mahlknecht et al 2004 water samples were analyzed for water isotopes at the isotope laboratory of the university of waterloo canada the concentrations of major ions were compared between 1999 and 2016 in our previous study knappett et al 2018 but here we introduce the results from an expanded dataset from 137 wells and includes trace elements which were not previously available samples taken from the 137 production wells in 2016 were analyzed for

water isotopes δ18o and δ2h were analyzed on a picarro cavity ring down system picarro inc santa clara ca within the stable isotope geosciences facility sigf at tamu based on running the known standards from the international agency for atomic energy iaea vsmow2 and slap the error was estimated to within 0 1 2 4 geo spatial analyses local or neighborhood concentrations of as were contoured along with temperature and chemical parameters measured on samples from 246 wells sampled in 1999 these were used to produce baseline values from which changes in 2016 could be calculated the typical spatial extent of a neighborhood for each parameter was calculated with ordinary kriging ok montero et al 2015 in contrast to other settings with high spatial variability in as concentrations over short distances 100 m aziz et al 2017 van geen et al 2003 long lag distances of approximately 10 km were observed in temperature and most of the chemical parameters thus aquifer chemistry and specifically as concentrations varied gradually over long distances in 1999 the uncertainty of interpolating 1999 concentrations was assessed by cross validation as detailed in our previous study haslauer et al 2016 knappett et al 2018 this error was reasonably small since the average spacing between the 1999 samples was much closer than the spatial lag distance this method of comparing the value of a parameter in a given well overlaid on the past 2 d interpolated concentration does not explicitly address the third dimension depth this issue is addressed here the depths of the wells sampled in 1999 were not reported but the depths for 102 out 137 wells were reported in 2016 of these 102 wells with known depths the vast majority had perforated casings that tapped the depth interval from 150 to 300 m below the surface the water table is generally 100 150 m below surface therefore most of the wells are pumping water from a similar depth range this agrees with a large database of over 1000 wells from the state water authority ceag in which practically all of the wells are installed to approximately 150 to 300 m below surface it is assumed that wells had a similar depth range in 1999 because few farmers or communities are willing to spend extra money to drill deeper than they need to for a sustained water source six deep wells 450 m however were included in the 2016 dataset which introduced the possibility of a depth bias in evaluating changing aquifer chemistry little relationship was observed however between well depth and temperature or chemical parameters this implies that the long well screens are mixing vertically stratified aquifers in similar proportions izbicki et al 2015 mayo 2010 to test the hypothesis that geothermal waters rising up faults is driving as concentrations the influence of proximity to known faults 1 km on as concentrations was assessed using the non parametric kruskal wallis test overlay and proximity tools were implemented in arcmap to extract the distance to the nearest mapped fault the fault map was a published structural geologic and tectonic map of central mexico that was modified based on extensive field observations of the basin by the authors nieto samaniego et al 2007 since the mineralogy of the overlying rock sediments and soil may influence as concentrations rango et al 2013 shamsudduha et al 2015 winkel et al 2008 their potential role was assessed using the kruskal wallis test combined with overlay and proximity tools in arcmap a digital surface geology map was created in arcmap from 16 maps of the region of 1 250 000 and 1 50 000 scale published by the mexican geological service servicio geologico mexicano a soil 1 250 000 scale soil map created by the national institute for statistics geography and information inegi 2007 was used to assess spatial correlations between as concentrations and soil type to test whether human alteration of the land surface and vadose zone through disposal of untreated urban wastewater or the application of fertilizers and irrigation return flow from farm fields may be influencing as concentrations land use immediately surrounding each well was defined as urban peri urban farming or rural based on visual observation on google earth images taken in 2016 the influence of the land use variable was then tested using the kruskal wallis test 2 5 bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses to identify possible mixing or reaction processes driving high as concentrations covariates were assessed through bivariate regression with temperature and chemical parameters on the 2016 dataset next pca was performed on the 2016 dataset to visualize the collinearity between parameters collinearity manifests by clustering of parameters on the pc1 vs pc2 loadings plot to minimize the impact of outliers and linearize non linear relationships between parameters the pca was performed on z scores of both un transformed and ln transformed datasets respectively to quantify the specific impact that each covariate had on as concentrations while controlling for the influence of other parameters three types of step wise linear regression simple robust and ln transformed were performed on the 2016 dataset the performance of all models were assessed by their ability to predict as concentrations using the root mean squared error rmse and r2 the goal was to develop a parsimonious model predicting as concentrations across the basin as a function of temperature and chemical parameters to elucidate geochemical and hydrological processes driving as concentrations the point estimates of the slopes b standard errors se and significance level p value for each statistically significant parameter were reported from the multiple regression models all bivariate and multivariate modeling was performed using concentrations in units of mm so that stoichiometric relationships could be determined the direction and magnitude of changes 1999 2016 in neighborhood parameter values were compared to the slopes of statistically significant predictor variables in the multiple regression models of the 2016 dataset if the multivariate analysis on the 2016 dataset indicated that parameter x was significantly and positively correlated to as concentrations parameter x also should have increased between 1999 and 2016 2 6 random forest modeling random forest rf regression models a classification and regression tree cart model were trained to analyze and account for non linear relationships breiman 2001 breiman et al 1984 between as concentrations and the measured hydro chemical parameters the rf is one of a growing number of machine learning algorithms that have been applied to understand and predict the distribution of anthropogenic and geogenic contaminants in groundwater bui et al 2020 smith et al 2018 one features of these machine learning models is that even poorly correlated parameters can help make the predictions more accurate bui et al 2020 therefore unlike the multiple regression models where only statistically significant parameters were retained in the final model all parameters were used in the rf model the rf algorithm has many advantages compared to single decision tree methods it can handle the high dimensionality of the data set it is relatively fast to train and robust against outliers missing data and non normal datasets which are typical of groundwater chemistry studies the pre modeling data treatment was the same as for the step wise linear regression models random forest compared to other decision tree models grows multiple decision trees and the results are averaged over all grown trees with randomized predictor subsets for tree growing and node splitting this can lead to more accurate and stable predictions here up to 1000 trees were grown and maximal number of predictors to split a node were set 3 n n number of predictors to prevent over fitting leave one group out cross validation with 100 repetitions for each repetition training 80 and validation 20 datasets were randomly selected for model training and validation respectively the final model was selected by one standard error of the minimal rmse of all trained models to analyze the impact of the predictors on as concentrations variable importance was assessed by averaging the impurity decreases for all nodes over all trees with the gini impurity metric which defines the variable selection for node splitting louppe et al 2013 therefore the higher the value of the mean decrease in gini the higher the importance of the variable in the model and consequently for predicting as concentrations however compared to linear regression models the variable importance of random forest models does not account for the direction positive or negative of the relationship between the predictor and as concentrations therefore partial dependence plots pdp were estimated to test effects between the predicted response variable and individual predictor variables by averaging the effect of all other predictors friedman 2001 to visualize the direction of the effect in the trained random forest model 2 7 geochemical modeling saturation indices si s for over 150 minerals were calculated using temperature and water chemistry data from the 2016 datasets using the software phreeqc and the wateq4 database parkhurst and appelo 2013 saturation indices indicate the equilibrium state of water with respect to minerals it is defined as si log iap k where iap is the ion activity product and k is the equilibrium constant if si 0 the solution is in equilibrium with the mineral phase and therefore highly influential on the dissolved concentrations of the constituent elements in that mineral phase if si 0 groundwater is oversaturated with respect to the particular mineral which means that the mineral phase may precipitate to achieve equilibrium finally if si 0 the mineral will dissolve if it is present in the aquifer 3 results 3 1 changing neighborhood temperature and chemical parameters over time the median percentage increase in 137 neighborhood concentrations from 1999 to 2016 of ba na li s si temperature and ph was 36 28 27 17 8 5 and 4 respectively table 1 fig s2 in contrast the median percentage decrease in neighborhood concentrations of fe mn br hco3 ca and no3 n was 97 55 33 26 10 and 8 respectively the median neighborhood temperature increase was 1 5 c while ph increased by 0 3 units the previously reported rise in δ18o of 0 9 was maintained with the larger dataset used in the present study knappett et al 2018 significantly neighborhood cl concentrations and sc were stable between 1999 and 2016 to control for uncertainties arising from interpolating neighborhood baseline concentrations and temperature in 1999 changes in parameter values were assessed using the smaller number of 22 re sampled wells and approximately the same magnitude and direction of change was observed in the same parameters fig s1 3 2 evidence for rising arsenic concentrations of all wells sampled in 1999 the median and 90th percentile as concentrations were 9 and 20 µg l respectively fig 3 a in 2016 however the median and 90th percentile as concentrations were 14 and 40 µg l respectively in 1999 19 8 and 93 38 of 246 wells exceeded the mexican 25 µg l and who drinking water limits for as respectively in 2016 however 29 21 and 88 64 of 137 wells exceeded mexican and who limits respectively fig 3a furthermore 3 of the 22 wells that were re sampled in 2016 increased by more than 10 µg l compared to the 1999 value fig 4 b substantial increases in as concentrations were observed in certain neighborhoods fig 4a c thirty percent of wells sampled in 2016 contained as concentrations that exceeded their previous baseline neighborhood concentrations 1999 by at least 10 µg l fig 3b an additional 45 of wells exhibited modest increases in as concentrations 0 10 µg l the greatest increases in as concentrations were observed in two geographical areas the first was an area that previously had high as concentrations in 1999 located in the northeast part of the basin called laguna seca the second area with the greatest increases were distributed throughout the western part of the basin or the carl aquifer in 1999 all wells sampled in the carl aquifer contained low as concentrations near the who limit in 2016 however this region hosted many wells exceeding the who limit and some exceeding the mexican limit fig 1 no systematic variation in as concentrations was observed with season fig s3 and samples were taken at different times of the year so it is unlikely that seasonal fluctuations in as concentrations possibly driven by more pumping to irrigate during the dry season can explain the widespread increases 3 3 arsenic concentrations land use and geology to assess the possible influence of geological composition and faulting and human land use on as concentrations 2016 concentrations were compared to four land surface variables proximity to known faults surface geology type soil type and land use type the non parametric kruskal test confirmed that wells located within 1 km of a known fault did not have higher as concentrations than wells located further away fig s4 the vast majority of wells sampled in 2016 are installed on outcropping sedimentary deposits such as conglomerate and sandstone n 113 and along with wells installed on acidic volcanic rock n 7 tend to have the highest as concentrations p 0 05 fig s5 the eight wells installed on outcropping basic volcanic rocks had the lowest as concentrations wells installed on outcropping carbonate rocks had intermediate as concentrations arsenic concentrations were systematically higher in wells underlying farm land and rural areas compared to urban areas p 0 05 fig s6 no systematic variation in as concentration was observed across the three major soil types in the basin fig s7 in summary wells installed in agricultural or rural areas underlain by sedimentary or acidic volcanic rocks had the highest as concentrations 3 4 arsenic concentrations and well construction and use to yield insight into the impact of flow processes within wells on rising as concentrations as concentrations measured in 2016 were compared to well construction and operation variables including well depth bottom elevation and pumping rate numerous reports consultores en geologia 1992 ingenieros civiles y geologos asociados 1980 suggest that wells in this region are perforated over their entire length this creates the possibility for cross formational flow through these long well screens especially in the six recently installed community wells ranging from 450 to 650 m in depth these very deep wells typically have moderately high as concentrations fig 5 b ranging from 20 to 60 µg l this finding is likely because of dilution with low tds shallow groundwater across the long well screens this is further evidenced by convergence to the basin s mean sc value in wells with the highest pumping rates where moderate as concentrations also are found fig 5a wells with the highest pumping rates tended to range from 150 to 300 m depth but there was a substantial range of pumping rates observed for wells in every depth interval fig s8 3 5 arsenic concentrations and temperature and chemical parameters the relationship between as concentrations and temperature chemical parameters and water isotopes were analyzed to gain insight into the hydrological and geochemical processes that may be driving as concentrations higher in this intensively pumped aquifer system a piper plot revealed that as concentrations increase smoothly as the dominant cation transitions from ca mg to na k fig 6 bivariate correlations were calculated between as concentrations and all potential co variates measured in 2016 table 1 both robust and ln transformed fig s9 bivariate regressions were performed to minimize the influence of localized processes in the ln transformed bivariate regression analysis as concentrations correlated significantly and positively to temperature ph sc hco3 na si s mo li f and cl table 1 the collinearity between variables were further investigated on the ln transformed data using pca fig 7 fig s10 the strongest collinearity was observed between the variables sc na hco3 cl s and mo which formed the first principal component pc1 fig 7 the variables as f temperature ph and li also clustered together but were distinct from pc1 the variables mg ca sr ba and no3 n comprised pc2 the specific influence of each variable on as concentrations while controlling for the effects of other covariates was assessed using step wise multiple regression and rf modeling table 1 three types of linear regression were used regular robust and ln transformed the latter two models were performed to minimize the impact of outliers on the model regular multiple regression indicated many significant predictor variables of as concentrations however many of these variables did not have robust bivariate relationships to as or the bivariate relationship was of the opposite sign table 1 as assessed by r2 the robust regression model performed poorly r2 0 39 under predicting the concentrations of 5 wells with the highest as concentrations in the basin fig 8 b the ln transformed performed consistently across all as concentrations fig 8c was internally consistent since the bivariate relationships had the same sign as in the model and was much more parsimonious compared to the first model this regression model has six significant predictor variables temperature ph si mo f and no3 n of these only no3 n has a negative slope meaning that decreasing no3 n concentrations predicted increasing as concentrations when controlling for the effects of other predictor variables table 1 the rf model performed the best r2 0 90 fig 8d this machine learning model confirmed the importance of the variables identified by stepwise multiple regression but also detected the influence of ca and na which may have been masked through collinearity in the ln transformed multiple regression model the partial dependence plots from the rf model show that ca and na had a negative and positive effect on as concentrations respectively fig s11 s12 the variables identified by rf modeling from most to least important for predicting as concentrations were f mo ca na temperature ph no3 n and li the negative influence of ca on as concentrations was detected by bivariate and two multiple regression models table 1 fig s9 the spatial distribution of each of the eight as predictor variables identified by the ln transformed multiple regression and rf models reveal further insight into the prediction power of these variables on as concentrations fig s13 s20 wells emplaced upon outcropping bedrock on the higher elevation periphery of the basin tended to have cooler temperatures and low as concentrations fig s13 the center of the basin exhibits zones with temperatures varying from 30 to over 40 c with the highest temperature zones exhibiting the highest as concentrations ph exhibits a similar pattern to temperature fig s14 fluoride concentrations also peak in wells with the warmest and most alkaline waters fig s17 knappett et al 2018 molybdenum also closely correlates to as across the basin fig s16 in contrast si concentrations tend to be highest in the center of the basin and lowest around the periphery but wells with intermediate 10 25 µg l as concentrations tend to have the highest si concentrations fig s15 the rf model did not rank si highly as an important variable in predicting as concentrations table 1 a subset of 109 wells analyzed for the element boron b showed at strong bivariate correlation r2 0 4 with as fig s21 however because of the missing data this element was not included in the multivariate analyses the largest clustering of sampled wells with high no3 n 5 mg l 0 36 mm and low as 6 µg l 8e 05 mm concentrations occurs around the city of san miguel de allende however this is a common occurrence over the outer periphery of the basin fig s18 in contrast in the center of the basin many wells have intermediate concentrations of both as and no3 n 0 6 5 0 mg l and wells with the highest as concentrations 50 µg l 4 7e 04 mm have the least no3 n 1 5 mg l 0 1 mm a subset of 53 wells tested for oxygen contained concentrations ranging from 3 to 7 mg l therefore the aquifer appears to be well oxidized a subset of 45 wells contained doc ranging from 0 5 to 7 mg l the presence of abundant oxygen and high orp suggests this doc is not bioavailable chapelle et al 2013 the reason may be that the organic carbon is locked up in biofilms on grain surfaces that are mobilized by shear forces during pumping graham et al 2015 alternatively wells screened across geochemically stratified aquifers may promote mixing between oxidizing and reducing agents izbicki et al 2015 mayo 2010 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 so the abundant oxygen and doc may not come from the same parts of the aquifer system 4 discussion 4 1 accelerated silicate hydrolysis from mixing with geothermal waters the best multiple regression model explained 72 of the variability of as concentrations across the basin in 2016 whereas the rf machine learning model explained 90 many of the parameters that drive the as concentrations higher are common tracers of geothermal waters smedley and kinniburgh 2002 hot geothermal waters accelerate the dissolution of widely present silicate minerals such as albite releasing high concentrations of na and si the mineral albite was near saturation across the basin fig s22 the transformation of albite to kaolinite also raises the si for albite in pore waters while raising ph through the following hydrolysis reaction 1 naalsi3o8 2h 9h2o na 4h4sio4 al2si2 oh 4 studies in the mer suggested that the hydrolysis of albite drove increasing ph rango et al 2013 albite hydrolysis tends to proceed most quickly at acidic and basic ph s and slowest at near neutral chen and brantley 1997 this process is greatly accelerated by higher temperatures albite glass that is found in pyroclastic flows and tuffs gulbrandsen and cressman 1960 is weathered more easily than crystalline albite found in volcanic rocks like rhyolite hamilton et al 2000 this rising ph converts iron oxide oxyanion binding sites from positive to negatively charged which releases oxyanions like as and mo dixit and hering 2003 johannesson and tang 2009 smedley et al 2002 albite hydrolysis furthermore releases na ions when it transforms to kaolinite fig 9 the mineral kaolinite was supersaturated across much of the basin fig s22 the formation of kaolinite and other clays increases the abundance of cation exchange sites which further depletes the aquifer of ca and releases more na rango et al 2013 cation exchange on kaolinite can be represented by the following formula 2 na al2si2 oh 4 ca2 na ca2 al2si2 oh 4 the mineral fluorite is consistently slightly undersaturated si 0 across the basin suggesting this soluble mineral controls the concentrations of ca and f ions therefore decreasing ca concentration through reactions 1 2 acts to dissolve the mineral fluorite through the common ion effect apambire et al 1997 3 caf2 s ca2 2f this explains the co rising f concentrations between 1999 and 2016 and the tight correlation between as and f concentrations in the 2016 dataset table 1 fig 9 evidence of the internal consistency of the ln transformed and rf models can be found by examining the bivariate associations both the regular linear regression and the robust regression models are limited in that they are seeking simple straight line relationships between as and each variable many variables like temperature and ph follow a positive exponential relationship with as whereas other variables like ca mg and no3 n have an inverse relationship these are poorly fit with straight lines other researchers have found such negative correlations between ca and mg and as and f in the geothermally influenced sedimentary aquifers of the mer rango et al 2013 these authors found that basaltic rock aquifers tended to have high concentrations of ca and mg but low concentrations of as f and na the basic volcanic rocks on the flanks of the palo huerfano volcano located at the southern edge of the basin host wells that are consistently low in as concentrations and high in ca and mg fig 1 fig s20 a similar multi variate structure amongst chemical parameters but not temperature was observed in 769 wells within orange county north carolina dinwiddie and liu 2018 in that study the source of as was attributed to the oxidation of pyrite within the clastic sedimentary rocks and the release of as from metal oxides at higher ph the authors furthermore found that as concentrations increased with proximity to faults which they attributed to the presence of more as bearing sulfide minerals in the present study area pyrite was rarely found in a recent mineralogical study on surface outcrops and the exhaustive analyses of borehole cuttings from two deep 450 m wells including one within the high as region in the eastern part of the basin fig 1 shepherd 2018 furthermore the oxidation of pyrite does not explain the apparent rising ph over time or the highly significant impact that ph has on as concentrations in the 2016 dataset since pyrite oxidation drives ph down appleyard et al 2006 the significance of the parameters temperature ph and f along with si and na in the ln transformed regression and rf models respectively and the tendency for the highest as wells to be found in felsic sedimentary or volcanic rocks suggest that warm geothermally influenced waters are driving as concentrations higher through hydrolysis of silicate minerals like albite glass found in volcanic tuff high as wells however are not limited to those installed in volcanic tuff which is suggested by surface mapping and driller s logs to be present in large quantities in the southeastern part of the basin fig 1 and 2 across the basin the majority of wells are drawing water from the first 100 300 m which is typically comprised of clastic sedimentary rocks sourced from the surrounding mountains a subset of approximately 109 samples that were analyzed for boron b had a highly significant bivariate positive correlation with as p 0 01 this further strengthens the argument for mixing with geothermal waters being the primary driver of as since both li and b are considered a tracer of geothermal waters busico et al 2018 grassi et al 2014 guo et al 2008 morales arredondo et al 2018 munoz et al 2015 rango et al 2013 the slopes of the ln transformed multiple regression model can be quantitatively interpreted table 1 for example a 1 increase in temperature will produce a 1 increase in as concentrations a 1 increase in ph will produce a 2 increase in as concentrations a 1 increase in si mo and f concentrations will produce 0 32 0 24 and 0 37 increases in as concentrations respectively in contrast a 1 increase in no3 n will cause a 0 14 decrease in as concentrations between 1999 and 2016 temperature ph and concentrations of na si f and li typically increased in specific wells and at the neighborhood scale further supporting the hypothesis that geothermal waters are mixing in increasing proportion with the freshly recharged young groundwater driving silicate hydrolysis and raising ph the fact that cl and no3 n concentrations remained relatively stable however implies that changes to the composition of recharge water from irrigation return flow has yet to reach the water table mahlknecht et al 2004 this agrees with the estimated 2 000 to 10 000 year old well water that was calculated using c14 age dating on water samples taken from 24 wells across the basin in 2000 mahlknecht et al 2006a and the absence of tritium in 21 of those wells prior to the drilling of production wells in the 1940 s the water table was close to the surface in many low lying areas de leon et al 2005 between 1999 and 2016 the vadose zone thickness typically grew approximately 20 m across the basin knappett et al 2018 li et al 2020 in 2016 the water table was typically found 50 to 200 m below the surface studies based on observed chloride mass accounting from rainfall and groundwater age dating have demonstrated that thick vadose zones in arid to semi arid regions delay the arrival of recharge water by thousands of years phillips 1994 scanlon et al 2003 tyler et al 1996 together these results suggest that the growing vadose zone has protected the aquifer from contamination from land use changes including fertilizer application irrigation return flow as a process for concentrating dissolved solids is therefore not driving as concentrations clark and fritz 1997 the rising δ18o that we previously reported knappett et al 2018 implies that the geothermal waters are more enriched in 18o compared to more recently recharged water this could be attributed to cooler paleoclimate conditions in this region at the time of recharge resulting in more depleted heavy isotopes clark and fritz 1997 the close correlation between as and mo oxyanions can be explained by their binding to positively charged metal oxides sites at neutral ph when ph rises these sites are converted to negatively charged releasing the oxyanions to pore waters rango et al 2013 smedley et al 2002 4 2 nitrate indicates shallow aquifer water and predicts low arsenic as concentrations between 1999 and 2016 no3 n concentrations were relatively stable table 1 the most toxic concentrations of no3 n 10 mg l underlie the city of san miguel de allende founded in the 16th century on a permeable alluvial fan mahlknecht et al 2006b the source of this nitrate is debatable it may be attributed to household latrines onsite sanitation which were traditionally installed in the basements of houses in san miguel alternatively in the 1990 s hog farms located near the city were suspected as the source and have since been moved away perhaps coincidentally these city wells are installed on the basic igneous rocks along the flanks of the palo huerfano volcano which as mentioned above drive as concentrations lower nevertheless across the basin a robust inverse relationship was observed between as and no3 n concentrations this relationship was significant in the ln transformed multiple regression model and an important variable in the rf model suggesting that even when controlling for the impacts of other processes and atypical regions like the urbanized slopes of the palo huerfano volcano higher no3 concentrations were predictive of low as concentrations this can be explained by mixing of shallow recently recharged water 100 years with deeper geothermally impacted older groundwater that hasn t been impacted by the intensive growth in agriculture since 1940 a greater proportion of fresh shallow groundwater in a well acts to dilute the older more mineralized groundwater mixing of diverse water types through long well screens is likely an important process in this basin that impacts well water chemistry this is supported by the observation that wells with high pumping rates 40 l s tended to have intermediate sc values fig 5a in contrast wells with the small pumping rates 10 l s sample aquifer conditions that are specific to a narrower depth interval although this mixes waters contaminated by geothermal and anthropogenic surface processes it also acts to dilute each therefore water that has abundant no3 n suppresses as concentrations through dilution the presence of long screened wells means that there is ample opportunity in this basin for cross formational flow several thousand wells have been installed across the basin hoogesteger 2018 the typical well depths are 100 to 300 m deep knappett et al 2018 although municipal wells installed in the last 5 years tend to be much deeper up to 650 m these long screened wells have likely connected geochemically distinct aquifers and promoted mixing along these conduits driven by hydraulic head differences between the layers izbicki et al 2015 mayo 2010 4 3 limitations of this study although the evidence presented indicates rising or stable as concentrations but almost never decreasing as water tables fall the long term trends are not available owing to lack of regular re sampling in the years between 1999 and 2016 therefore some of the variability in the changing as concentrations das in the 22 re sampled well and 137 neighborhood comparison may be driven by short term fluctuations the cumulative distribution curves of as concentrations for the entire sampling campaigns of 1999 and 2016 suggest however the concentrations are rising but this may have been influenced by a greater sampling density in the center of the basin in 2016 than in 1999 where many of the wells were located in the southeast corner of the basin known as the dr mora san jose iturbide dmsj groundwater management zone by the state and federal water managers although it is impossible to capture long term trends with only two snap shots of the basin the situation appears quite serious since in some cases neighborhood concentrations have doubled over the 17 years in spite of these limitations this study describes one approach to cautiously utilize previous sampling campaigns in aquifer systems which are rarely monitored and publicly reported to suggest changing chemistry develop hypotheses and design more robust experiments to test those hypotheses the direction of change in other variables over 17 years added strength to the conclusions of the multivariate modeling on the 2016 dataset fig s2 but these changes are best regarded as tendencies wherein a parameter commonly both increased stayed the same and decreased in different wells nevertheless the match of the direction of change in parameters over time to the sign of the coefficients of those parameters in the regression and rf modeling suggest that the same processes driving as concentrations as water tables fall are operating over time and space land surface changes seem to have minimal impact on as concentrations but the natural geology shallow geothermal heat natural recharge areas and aggressive pumping from long screened wells are critically important until this aquifer system is geologically mapped using hundreds of borehole lithologies and long screen wells are profiled using down hole sampling to map the aquifer chemistry and hydraulic properties this aquifer cannot be confidently managed from the perspective of the future fate of geogenic contaminants like as and f this study is not a replacement for these more conclusive and invasive methods to study aquifer systems but rather shows one approach to monitor and infer what can be known by studying the geology the multi variate structure of the temperature and chemistry data sampled from long screened wells 4 4 implications of rising arsenic concentrations with falling water tables arsenic concentrations rose over a time period when the average water table decline was approximately 20 m over 17 years knappett et al 2018 li et al 2020 in 1999 the area of the basin that exceeded the who drinking water limit was mostly confined to the eastern side of the basin in the laguna seca region in 2016 however while as concentrations increased in this more impacted region the western half of the basin now hosts numerous wells that exceed the who drinking water limit this study suggests that the primary process driving increasing as concentrations is mixing with geothermal waters specifically the observed rising ph liberates as from metal oxide surfaces rango et al 2013 the geospatial analysis found that the highest as concentrations tended to be located in the most intensively farmed parts of the basin which are also most influenced by geothermal waters irrigation return flow however is not driving the rising as concentrations as evidenced by the stability of indicators of irrigation return cl and no3 n this suggests that there is a long lag time of at least several decades between changes to the land surface and the aquifer chemistry at 150 300 m depth mahlknecht et al 2004 therefore the density of farms and irrigation pumping coincides with falling water tables driving the most mixing with geothermal waters in the basin center known faults were not found to play a major role across the basin but may still have local importance 5 conclusions the long term consequences of over exploiting aquifer systems in semi arid volcanic and geothermal regions is unknown owing to lack of long term monitoring programs and process level insights into what drives changes in the chemical composition of well water this study helps to address each of these deficiencies by comparing the distribution of as concentrations across an intensively exploited basin over a period of 17 years and evaluating the local environment and chemical covariates that consistently drive as concentrations in both space and time between 1999 and 2016 neighborhood as concentrations increased by 19 in long screened production wells across in an over exploited inter montane aquifer system with near surface geothermal heat parts of the aquifer system with high temperature and ph and high as concentrations in 1999 had much higher as concentrations in 2016 this is reflected by the doubling of the 90th percentile as concentration from 20 µg l in 1999 to 40 µg l in 2016 parts of the aquifer system in the western recharge area with low as concentrations in 1999 witnessed as concentrations rising over the who drinking water limit in many wells ln transformed stepwise multiple regression indicated five statistically significant positively correlated predictor variables of as temperature ph si mo and f and one negatively correlating predictor variable no3 n random forest modeling of as added na positive correlate and ca negative correlate to the list of important variables that predict as concentrations while confirming the importance of the others the neighborhood values of the above mentioned positive and negative predictor variables increased and decreased between 1999 and 2016 respectively this suggests that these parameters impact as concentrations across space and time these observations are consistent with three chemical reactions that are accelerated by rising groundwater temperatures 1 silicate hydrolysis to kaolinite clay raising ph 2 conversion of metal oxide sorption sites from positive to negative releasing as oxyanions to pore waters and 3 stripping of ca from pore waters through cation exchange with na thereby driving the release of f through dissolution of the mineral fluorite the presence of long well screens allows for the possibility that this sequence of reactions are occurring in response to the transport of deeper hot geothermal groundwater into shallower aquifers by flowing through the artificial open conduits but more work is needed to localize these reactions through characterizing water flow and transport this study demonstrates a link between falling water tables and rising as concentrations across a 100 km wide basin this relationship should be robustly quantified within over exploited aquifer systems with known geogenic contaminants so that an accurate accounting of the costs and benefits of pumping that aquifer can be made the findings of this study suggests future research and management strategies which may help mitigate exposure to rising as and other geogenic contaminants first the hydrostratigraphy geology and hydraulic properties of the aquifer system needs to be systematically mapped through a system that publicly shares borehole lithology from newly installed wells second the pore water chemistry needs to be mapped at the sub hydrostratigraphic unit scale to determine at which depth and in what rock or sediment the long screened wells are drawing the most as f and no3 third this information should be widely shared so that farmers and municipalities can use the new information to target currently safe units with short screened wells fourth the water chemistry should be systematically monitored twice per year dry and wet season in key wells that are

the water transfer period exhibited a more distinct increasing trend from the upstream to the downstream lakes fig 4b the wqi score for hongze lake during the water transfer period was lower than its score during the non water transfer period while dongping lake showed an opposite pattern the annual wqi score showed an overall increasing trend from upstream to downstream lakes fig 4b a total of 55

water quality in the impounded lakes along the eastern route of snwdp showed clear spatial and temporal patterns fig 2 in these lakes wt and tp in the summer and autumn were higher than those in the spring and winter while do tn no3 n and th showed the reverse seasonal pattern in all the seasons tu tss and most nutrients showed a clear declining trend while cond th and cl had an increasing trend from the upstream to downstream lakes this pattern validated our previous findings in these lakes guo et al 2020b and further indicated that the upstream downstream lake water quality gradient exists independent of seasons the studied lakes are shallow and in the warm temperate zone except that gaoyou lake and part of hongze lake are in the subtropical area the wt pattern monitored is consistent with the characteristics of lakes in the geographic region ren 2016 zhu et al 2019 assessed the eutrophication status in these impounded lakes in two seasons and found that tp in october autumn was significantly higher than that in april spring and the upstream lakes had significantly higher values than other lakes these were consistent with our results but we further identified that summer was another season with higher phosphorus which drew our attention to possible eutrophication in these lakes as higher water temperature and phosphorus in summers could trigger algal blooms schindler et al 2008 the mean tp in gaoyou lake and hongze lake were approximately 0 10 mg l which exceeded the threshold concentration that eutrophication occurs in inland shallow lakes tn in these lakes were generally higher in the spring and winter than in the summer and autumn which was the opposite to the findings before the operation of the eastern route of snwdp song et al 2006 he et al 2010 shu et al 2012 this high tn period was also the water transfer period december to may china ministry of water resources http nsbd mwr gov cn of these lakes the concentrations of inorganic nitrogen in the yangtze river i e the source water are higher than those in the impounded lakes and the long term water transfer could potentially result in increases of inorganic nitrogen in the impounded lakes zhou et al 1994 most of the inorganic nitrogen in the impounded lakes was in form of nitrate partly oxidized from nh4 and no2 and partly from direct inputs of the increasing anthropogenic activities do concentrations in the impounded lakes in the spring and winter were significantly higher than those in the summer and autumn which is partly related to wt benson and krause jr 1980 another possible reason is that water transfer changed the lake hydrodynamics increased the disturbance of the water body and shortened the water retention time during the water diversion period jiang 2012 tu and tss can reflect lake primary productivity to some extent and the main influencing factors include the coverage of submerged plants algal production sediment resuspension disturbance of wind and waves decomposition of organic matter and others niemistö et al 2005 zhu et al 2005 swift et al 2006 niemistö et al 2005 believed that 75 95 of total sediment in shallow water can be resuspended as the main reason for the formation of turbidity in water sediment resuspension in gaoyou lake and hongze lake potentially caused by wind and waves due to large lake area corresponding to the long wind path and huai river runoff stirring the bottom sediments wetzel 2001 li et al 2009 was more significant than the downstream lakes exogenous nutrient laden inputs from the huai river j wang et al 2017 guo et al 2020a and endogenous nutrients release caused by frequent sediment resuspension both contributed to higher nutrients in gaoyou lake and hongze lake than the downstream lakes cond th and cl in the current study showed an increasing upstream downstream trend in lakes along the eastern route which is consistent with results from previous lake studies wu et al 2012 yao et al 2019 the downstream lakes donghu lake dongping lake and transitional lake nansi lake are located at the yimeng mountains region the geographical location coupled with long term high evaporation and low runoff could contribute to higher levels of ca2 mg2 and other ions in these lakes moreover the increased risk of saltwater intrusion from the yangtze river estuary due to reduced runoff from the yangtze river will not only affect the water quality of the southern water supplying area but also has potential to increase salinity in the northern water receiving area zhuang 2016 based on seasonal and annual patterns of individual water qualtiy parameters pca identified three lake groups upstream gaoyou lake and hongze lake transitional luoma lake and nansi lake and downstream dongping lake and donghu lake this further validates our previous conclusion that this upstream downstream pattern persists in all seasons resulting in a year round gradient across these impounded lakes guo et al 2020b large spatial differences of water quality parameters in gaoyou lake and nansi lake such as nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand indicate that other anthropogenic activities also contributed to the spatial patterns of water quality across these impounded lakes besides water diversions guo et al 2020a although the water quality impacts from the surrounding watersheds have been alleviated in the past decade guo et al 2013 lv et al 2015 our study indicated that pollution control measures still need to be implemented to prevent water quality degradation in these lakes 4 2 overall water quality condition and patterns based on the wqi our study indicated that the water quality in the impounded lakes along the eastern route of snwdp was rated good in most seasons except the upstream gaoyou lake the spring of hongze lake and summer and autumn of dongping lake these were generally consistent with previous related studies in the study area for instance wu et al 2018 applied the wqi method to assess water quality in taihu lake basin which is close to the gaoyou lake and found that the water quality were rated moderate mainly caused by industrial wastewater and domestic sewage in another study hou et al 2016 assessed water quality of reservoirs adjacent to dongping lake and donghu lake and found that those reservoirs had good to very poor water quality during the water transfer period the overall water quality showed a distinct improving trend from the upstream to the downstream lakes in the downstream lakes water transfer could be the main reason for water quality improvements as it provided sufficient water to those lakes in water scarcity hu et al 2019 meanwhile water transfer promoted the water circulation and changed the hydrodynamics in the downstream lakes due to their relatively small storage capacities jiang 2012 however the wqi scores for hongze lake during the water transfer period were lower than those during the non water transfer period this could be attributed to water transfer that accelerated pollutants diffusion to the entire lake from some pollution hotspots that were impacted by intensive watershed human stressors lin et al 2019 guo et al 2020a wan et al 2020 donghu lake is an artificially constructed and levee surrounded plain reservoir which only receives the diversion water from the jiping main canal without other runoff inputs from the surrounding watershed jiang 2012 sedimentation occurs when flow is low and little particle scouring occurs allan and castillo 2007 xiang et al 2008 from 2013 to 2017 approximately 8 2 107m3 of water was supplied to donghu lake and majority of them was stored with only 0 64 107m3 of them was released and re distributed csnwdpc 2018 this indicates that the water retention time in donghu lake was long and sedimentation of suspended matter could occur extensively xiang et al 2008 resulting in nutrients deposited and transparency increased in the water thus the larger wqi in donghu lake the annual water storage capacity in dongping lake and luoma lake in 2017 were 2 94 108m3 yrcc 2018 and 8 85 108 m3 hrcc 2018 respectively the total amount of water transferred into the dongping lake and luoma lake from the eastern route of snwdp were 8 14 108 m3 and 11 51 108 m3 and the total volume of water transferred out were 7 63 108 m3 and 11 48 108 m3 csnwdpc 2018 respectively the operation of the water transfer project has replaced the water in dongping lake and luoma lake 2 59 and 1 29 times respectively which improved the water quality in these lakes hu et al 2019 the water flow in the eastern route of snwdp has improved the original hydraulic conditions such as regional mobility water exchange rate and diffusion speed and improved the water environment of nansi lake wang 2016 aquatic plants in nansihu lake are rich in variety and large in coverage ke et al 2018 these plants can directly absorb and use excessive nutrients in the water body which can play an important role in water purification seo et al 2005 both hongze lake and gaoyou lake are in the area downstream of the huai river basin and runoff from the huai river basin flows directly into these two lakes the pollution sources in the huai river watershed include extensive mining activities domestic sewage runoff from agricultural land and industries and they most likely have contributed to the deteriorated water quality currently observed in hongze lake and gaoyou lake j wang et al 2017 guo et al 2020a correlation analysis found that nutrient parameters in gaoyou lake and hongze lake had significant positive relationships with turbidity and total suspended solids hydrodynamics disturbances of wind and wave and sediments resuspension in shallow lakes can cause elevated levels of turbidity and total suspended solids niemistö et al 2005 zhu et al 2005 swift et al 2006 cao et al 2017 frequent wind and wave disturbances and sediment resuspension could lead to release of large amounts of endogenous nutrients into the water column qin and fan 2002 fan et al 2003 zhu et al 2005 water quality in hongze lake and gaoyou lake were likely to be affected by wind and waves as these lakes were rich in wind energy resources zhu and dou 1993 li et al 2009 cai et al 2016 compared with downstream nansi and dongping lakes the hongze lake and gaoyou lake are more susceptible to wind and waves due to lake morphology zhu and dou 1993 cai et al 2016 for instance nansi lake is about 126 km long from north to south and rich in aquatic macrophytes the area of dongping lake is relatively small and its northeast is surrounded by mountains the huai river flows directly into the upstream hongze lake and gaoyou lake and adds nutrients and suspended solids loads to these lakes guo et al 2020a moreover due to inputs from surrounding watersheds and river inflows pollutants associated with the sediments in gaoyou lake and hongze lake had relatively higher concentrations than those in the downstream lakes which could have caused increased release of pollutants from the sediments into water column in these two upstream lakes l f wang et al 2017 li et al 2019 lin et al 2019 wan et al 2020 5 conclusions building upon our previous studies we conducted a holistic assessment of water quality condition and spatiotemporal patterns in the impounded lakes along the eastern route of china s south to north water diversion project by applying both individual parameter analysis and wqi main conclusions are as follows 1 from upstream to downstream there was a clear declining trend of turbidity total suspended solids and nutrients and increasing trend of conductivity total hardness and chloride in these lakes which were seasonally independent 2 principal component analysis indicated that the lakes could be classified into three groups based on individual water quality parameters upstream gaoyou lake and hongze lake transitional luoma lake and nansi lake and downstream dongping lake and donghu lake 3 the wqi indicated an overall good water quality in the impounded lakes in most seasons except the upstream gaoyou lake the spring of hongze lake and the summer and autumn of dongping lake 4 water quality management attentions should be paid to high nitrogen phosphorus turbidity and total suspended solids in the upstream lakes high chloride in the downstream lakes high nitrogen during water diversion seasons and high phosphorus during non water diversion seasons evidences suggested that these water quality issues were caused by a combination of exogenous inputs from watersheds endogenous inputs from lake sediments and the water transfer the current study greatly improved our understanding of the overall water quality condition their spatiotemporal patterns across the impounded lakes and potential impacts of the water diversion project on the impounded lakes potential eutrophication caused by high nutrients in upstream lakes and during the water diversion period calls for stricter control of watershed exogenous inputs of pollutants the findings have important implications and can be used to develop seasonal and river basin specific strategies

water quality in the impounded lakes along the eastern route of snwdp showed clear spatial and temporal patterns fig 2 in these lakes wt and tp in the summer and autumn were higher than those in the spring and winter while do tn no3 n and th showed the reverse seasonal pattern in all the seasons tu tss and most nutrients showed a clear declining trend while cond th and cl had an increasing trend from the upstream to downstream lakes this pattern validated our previous findings in these lakes guo et al 2020b and further indicated that the upstream downstream lake water quality gradient exists independent of seasons the studied lakes are shallow and in the warm temperate zone except that gaoyou lake and part of hongze lake are in the subtropical area the wt pattern monitored is consistent with the characteristics of lakes in the geographic region ren 2016 zhu et al 2019 assessed the eutrophication status in these impounded lakes in two seasons and found that tp in october autumn was significantly higher than that in april spring and the upstream lakes had significantly higher values than other lakes these were consistent with our results but we further identified that summer was another season with higher phosphorus which drew our attention to possible eutrophication in these lakes as higher water temperature and phosphorus in summers could trigger algal blooms schindler et al 2008 the mean tp in gaoyou lake and hongze lake were approximately 0 10 mg l which exceeded the threshold concentration that eutrophication occurs in inland shallow lakes tn in these lakes were generally higher in the spring and winter than in the summer and autumn which was the opposite to the findings before the operation of the eastern route of snwdp song et al 2006 he et al 2010 shu et al 2012 this high tn period was also the water transfer period december to may china ministry of water resources http nsbd mwr gov cn of these lakes the concentrations of inorganic nitrogen in the yangtze river i e the source water are higher than those in the impounded lakes and the long term water transfer could potentially result in increases of inorganic nitrogen in the impounded lakes zhou et al 1994 most of the inorganic nitrogen in the impounded lakes was in form of nitrate partly oxidized from nh4 and no2 and partly from direct inputs of the increasing anthropogenic activities do concentrations in the impounded lakes in the spring and winter were significantly higher than those in the summer and autumn which is partly related to wt benson and krause jr 1980 another possible reason is that water transfer changed the lake hydrodynamics increased the disturbance of the water body and shortened the water retention time during the water diversion period jiang 2012 tu and tss can reflect lake primary productivity to some extent and the main influencing factors include the coverage of submerged plants algal production sediment resuspension disturbance of wind and waves decomposition of organic matter and others niemistö et al 2005 zhu et al 2005 swift et al 2006 niemistö et al 2005 believed that 75 95 of total sediment in shallow water can be resuspended as the main reason for the formation of turbidity in water sediment resuspension in gaoyou lake and hongze lake potentially caused by wind and waves due to large lake area corresponding to the long wind path and huai river runoff stirring the bottom sediments wetzel 2001 li et al 2009 was more significant than the downstream lakes exogenous nutrient laden inputs from the huai river j wang et al 2017 guo et al 2020a and endogenous nutrients release caused by frequent sediment resuspension both contributed to higher nutrients in gaoyou lake and hongze lake than the downstream lakes cond th and cl in the current study showed an increasing upstream downstream trend in lakes along the eastern route which is consistent with results from previous lake studies wu et al 2012 yao et al 2019 the downstream lakes donghu lake dongping lake and transitional lake nansi lake are located at the yimeng mountains region the geographical location coupled with long term high evaporation and low runoff could contribute to higher levels of ca2 mg2 and other ions in these lakes moreover the increased risk of saltwater intrusion from the yangtze river estuary due to reduced runoff from the yangtze river will not only affect the water quality of the southern water supplying area but also has potential to increase salinity in the northern water receiving area zhuang 2016 based on seasonal and annual patterns of individual water qualtiy parameters pca identified three lake groups upstream gaoyou lake and hongze lake transitional luoma lake and nansi lake and downstream dongping lake and donghu lake this further validates our previous conclusion that this upstream downstream pattern persists in all seasons resulting in a year round gradient across these impounded lakes guo et al 2020b large spatial differences of water quality parameters in gaoyou lake and nansi lake such as nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand indicate that other anthropogenic activities also contributed to the spatial patterns of water quality across these impounded lakes besides water diversions guo et al 2020a although the water quality impacts from the surrounding watersheds have been alleviated in the past decade guo et al 2013 lv et al 2015 our study indicated that pollution control measures still need to be implemented to prevent water quality degradation in these lakes 4 2 overall water quality condition and patterns based on the wqi our study indicated that the water quality in the impounded lakes along the eastern route of snwdp was rated good in most seasons except the upstream gaoyou lake the spring of hongze lake and summer and autumn of dongping lake these were generally consistent with previous related studies in the study area for instance wu et al 2018 applied the wqi method to assess water quality in taihu lake basin which is close to the gaoyou lake and found that the water quality were rated moderate mainly caused by industrial wastewater and domestic sewage in another study hou et al 2016 assessed water quality of reservoirs adjacent to dongping lake and donghu lake and found that those reservoirs had good to very poor water quality during the water transfer period the overall water quality showed a distinct improving trend from the upstream to the downstream lakes in the downstream lakes water transfer could be the main reason for water quality improvements as it provided sufficient water to those lakes in water scarcity hu et al 2019 meanwhile water transfer promoted the water circulation and changed the hydrodynamics in the downstream lakes due to their relatively small storage capacities jiang 2012 however the wqi scores for hongze lake during the water transfer period were lower than those during the non water transfer period this could be attributed to water transfer that accelerated pollutants diffusion to the entire lake from some pollution hotspots that were impacted by intensive watershed human stressors lin et al 2019 guo et al 2020a wan et al 2020 donghu lake is an artificially constructed and levee surrounded plain reservoir which only receives the diversion water from the jiping main canal without other runoff inputs from the surrounding watershed jiang 2012 sedimentation occurs when flow is low and little particle scouring occurs allan and castillo 2007 xiang et al 2008 from 2013 to 2017 approximately 8 2 107m3 of water was supplied to donghu lake and majority of them was stored with only 0 64 107m3 of them was released and re distributed csnwdpc 2018 this indicates that the water retention time in donghu lake was long and sedimentation of suspended matter could occur extensively xiang et al 2008 resulting in nutrients deposited and transparency increased in the water thus the larger wqi in donghu lake the annual water storage capacity in dongping lake and luoma lake in 2017 were 2 94 108m3 yrcc 2018 and 8 85 108 m3 hrcc 2018 respectively the total amount of water transferred into the dongping lake and luoma lake from the eastern route of snwdp were 8 14 108 m3 and 11 51 108 m3 and the total volume of water transferred out were 7 63 108 m3 and 11 48 108 m3 csnwdpc 2018 respectively the operation of the water transfer project has replaced the water in dongping lake and luoma lake 2 59 and 1 29 times respectively which improved the water quality in these lakes hu et al 2019 the water flow in the eastern route of snwdp has improved the original hydraulic conditions such as regional mobility water exchange rate and diffusion speed and improved the water environment of nansi lake wang 2016 aquatic plants in nansihu lake are rich in variety and large in coverage ke et al 2018 these plants can directly absorb and use excessive nutrients in the water body which can play an important role in water purification seo et al 2005 both hongze lake and gaoyou lake are in the area downstream of the huai river basin and runoff from the huai river basin flows directly into these two lakes the pollution sources in the huai river watershed include extensive mining activities domestic sewage runoff from agricultural land and industries and they most likely have contributed to the deteriorated water quality currently observed in hongze lake and gaoyou lake j wang et al 2017 guo et al 2020a correlation analysis found that nutrient parameters in gaoyou lake and hongze lake had significant positive relationships with turbidity and total suspended solids hydrodynamics disturbances of wind and wave and sediments resuspension in shallow lakes can cause elevated levels of turbidity and total suspended solids niemistö et al 2005 zhu et al 2005 swift et al 2006 cao et al 2017 frequent wind and wave disturbances and sediment resuspension could lead to release of large amounts of endogenous nutrients into the water column qin and fan 2002 fan et al 2003 zhu et al 2005 water quality in hongze lake and gaoyou lake were likely to be affected by wind and waves as these lakes were rich in wind energy resources zhu and dou 1993 li et al 2009 cai et al 2016 compared with downstream nansi and dongping lakes the hongze lake and gaoyou lake are more susceptible to wind and waves due to lake morphology zhu and dou 1993 cai et al 2016 for instance nansi lake is about 126 km long from north to south and rich in aquatic macrophytes the area of dongping lake is relatively small and its northeast is surrounded by mountains the huai river flows directly into the upstream hongze lake and gaoyou lake and adds nutrients and suspended solids loads to these lakes guo et al 2020a moreover due to inputs from surrounding watersheds and river inflows pollutants associated with the sediments in gaoyou lake and hongze lake had relatively higher concentrations than those in the downstream lakes which could have caused increased release of pollutants from the sediments into water column in these two upstream lakes l f wang et al 2017 li et al 2019 lin et al 2019 wan et al 2020 5 conclusions building upon our previous studies we conducted a holistic assessment of water quality condition and spatiotemporal patterns in the impounded lakes along the eastern route of china s south to north water diversion project by applying both individual parameter analysis and wqi main conclusions are as follows 1 from upstream to downstream there was a clear declining trend of turbidity total suspended solids and nutrients and increasing trend of conductivity total hardness and chloride in these lakes which were seasonally independent 2 principal component analysis indicated that the lakes could be classified into three groups based on individual water quality parameters upstream gaoyou lake and hongze lake transitional luoma lake and nansi lake and downstream dongping lake and donghu lake 3 the wqi indicated an overall good water quality in the impounded lakes in most seasons except the upstream gaoyou lake the spring of hongze lake and the summer and autumn of dongping lake 4 water quality management attentions should be paid to high nitrogen phosphorus turbidity and total suspended solids in the upstream lakes high chloride in the downstream lakes high nitrogen during water diversion seasons and high phosphorus during non water diversion seasons evidences suggested that these water quality issues were caused by a combination of exogenous inputs from watersheds endogenous inputs from lake sediments and the water transfer the current study greatly improved our understanding of the overall water quality condition their spatiotemporal patterns across the impounded lakes and potential impacts of the water diversion project on the impounded lakes potential eutrophication caused by high nutrients in upstream lakes and during the water diversion period calls for stricter control of watershed exogenous inputs of pollutants the findings have important implications and can be used to develop seasonal and river basin specific strategies

theoretical calculation indicated that the thioether sulfur in hras except rxtd was the main reactive site for pms oxidation transformation product analysis further elucidated oxidation of the thioether sulfur to sulfoxide product through an oxygen atom transfer process moreover the thioether sulfur on the straight chain was more susceptible to oxygen transfer with pms than that on the thiazole ring of hras toxicity evaluation indicated the ecotoxicity of hras could be remarkably reduced after pms oxidation hence this work provides a promising strategy to rapidly remove hras and

structure yang et al 2018 for example pms shows specific and high reactivity towards β lactam antibiotics chen et al 2018 fluoroquinolone zhou et al 2018b sulfonamides ji et al 2018 yin et al 2018 and thioether sulfur n4 amine on piperazine ring and amino group on the benzene were regarded as the effective sites for pms oxidation respectively hras seem to be reactive towards various oxidants due to the presence of multiple reactive moieties groups such as furan ring amine and thioether sulfur ikehata et al 2006b however it is still unclear whether pms can degrade hras in this work we found pms exhibited specific and high reactivity towards some hras without external energy or activators this new discovery motivated us to conduct an in depth study to address two major research questions 1 how pms reacts with hras and 2 what characteristics render hras highly reactive towards pms to our best knowledge this study is among the first to systematically reveal the specific and rapid reaction between pms and hras the new findings of this study provide a promising and facile strategy to eliminate hras contamination in wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the standard chemicals of fmtd rntd cmtd nztd and rxtd were purchased from sigma aldrich or anpel laboratory technologies shanghai inc at the highest purity pms and pds were obtained from sigma aldrich at 99 purity methanol meoh acetonitrile and tert butyl alcohol tba formic acid and ammonium acetate were also obtained from sigma aldrich at hplc grade hydrogen peroxide hp h2o2 sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 sodium chloride nacl sodium bicarbonate nahco3 sodium hydroxide naoh humic acid and sulfuric acid h2so4 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd at analytical grade deionized di reagent water was produced from a millipore milli q ultrapure gradient a10 purification system 2 2 real water samples surface water sw from a river and municipal wastewater mww were collected at locations in the southeast region of china samples were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters immediately upon collection and stored at 5 c before use the characteristics of the samples are shown in tables s1 a synthetic hospital wastewater hww was prepared by adopting recipes serna galvis et al 2017 and also used to evaluate the efficiency of hras degradation the composition of hww is shown in table s2 2 3 experimental procedures experiments were conducted in amber glass serum bottles at room temperature 22 c reaction ph was maintained with 10 mm phosphate buffer reaction solutions were prepared with hras and buffer and then pms was added to initiate the reaction samples were collected at the predetermined time and quenched with 100 μl of 1 m sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 which could completely consume the remaining pms the initial concentrations used for hras and pms were 10 and 100 μm respectively for most experiments 10 500 μm of pms were added to the hras solution to evaluate the impact of pms concentration radical quenchers i e meoh and tba were added to investigate whether the radicals contributed to the degradation of hras cl hco3 and humic acid were spiked into the reaction solution to evaluate the impact of water matrices the above reactions were also conducted in the real water matrices i e sw mww and hww all the experiments were conducted in duplicate or more 2 4 analytical methods hras were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc 1260 agilent technology usa equipped with a uv detector samples with 15 μl injection was separated on a kromasil c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm the details are provided in table s3 transformation products were determined on a

were separated on a zorbax sb c18 column 2 1 150 mm 5 μm the detailed conditions are summarized in text s1 pms was analyzed by a spectrophotometric method proposed by liang et al liang et al 2008 as detailed in text s2 2 5 theoretical calculation the frontier electron density fed calculations were conducted by the gaussian 09 program on a basis set of b3lyp 6 31 g d p the feds of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo were obtained and visualized condensed fukui function based on the density functional theory dft was used to predict the regioselectivity of different reactive species on the hras molecules 2 6 ecotoxicity assessment the ecotoxicity of hras and the oxidized products were evaluated using the ecological structure activity relationship model ecosar program liu et al 2018 this program has been successfully used to predict the ecotoxicity to screen contaminants the ecotoxicity was assessed for three trophic levels of aquatic organisms i e fish daphnid and green algae half lethal concentration lc50 values for fish 96 h daphnid 48 h and half effective concentration ec50 values for algae 96 h were used to assess the acute toxicity chronic value chv was used to demonstrate chronic toxicity 3 results and discussion 3 1 pms promoted degradation of hras advanced oxidation processes aops are considered as efficient techniques to degrade a wide range of contaminants owing to the generation of highly reactive radicals e g so4 and ho indeed rntd was susceptible to significant degradation in the uv pds and uv hp systems fig 2 in the uv pms system rntd degradation was much faster than that observed in uv pds or uv hp systems with complete degradation occurred after 2 min interestingly pms alone could also promote rapid degradation of rntd while the presence of pds or hp alone exhibited negligible effect on rntd degradation fig 2 pms oxidation reactive radical oxidation and uv photodegradation could contribute to rntd degradation in the uv pms system the similar trend of rntd degradation in pms and uv pms system indicated that the contribution of pms oxidation overwhelms other two degradation processes in uv pms system fig 2 indeed the decomposition of pms was only slightly increased after introduction of uv irradiation figure s1 hence the rapid degradation of rntd in uv pms system was most likely contributed from the pms promoted degradation we further conducted radical quenching experiments to investigate whether radical species involved in the pms induced oxidation of rntd generally meoh and tba are always selected as the radical probes to distinguish so4 and ho meoh reacts with so4 and ho at a comparable rate 9 7 108 m 1s 1 3 2 106 m 1s 1 for so4 and ho respectively while tba reacts with so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 much slower than that with ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 liang and su 2009 as shown in figure s2 the addition of alcohols did not affect the degradation of rntd by pms even when the concentration of alcohols increased to 1000 mm this result indicated that radical species did not involve in the pms promoted degradation of rntd and this reaction most likely proceeded via the non radical process it is noted that singlet oxygen 1o2 can be generated from the self decomposition of pms furfuryl alcohol ffa a scavenger for 1o2 yang et al 2018 was added in pms rntd solution and the results showed that both rntd degradation and pms decomposition were not affected after addition of ffa after 2 min figure s3 and thus 1o2 did not contribute to the pms promoted degradation of rntd hence pms likely exhibited specific reactivity towards rntd we further investigated the degradation of other four hras by pms to evaluate whether pms shows specific reactivity towards all hras as shown in fig 3 pms promoted rapid degradation of cmtd fmtd and nztd but was inert for the degradation of rxtd hence pms promoted degradation was dependent on hras structure hras possess several electron rich moieties groups e g amine which are always regarded as the potential reactive sites for oxidants on the other hand multiple amine moieties groups are present in the investigated hras while thioether sulfur occurs in cmtd rntd fmtd and nztd but not in rxtd fig 1 it is thus suggested that the different reactivity of hras towards pms likely related to the presence absence of the thioether sulfur which will be further elucidated in the following sections 3 2 degradation kinetics the impact of hras concentration on the pms promoted degradation was investigated at neutral ph condition as shown in fig 4 a pms promoted hras degradation increased with pms concentration increasing from 0 05 mm to 0 5 mm moreover hras degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics at various pms concentrations eq 1 with the calculated pseudo first order constants kobs demonstrated in fig 4b log kobs linearly increased with log cpms and the slope was close to unity hence kobs showed a linear relationship with respect to pms concentration suggesting the overall reaction could be described by a second order kinetics eq 2 apparent second order reaction rate constants k2 app could be obtained by dividing kobs by pms concentration as shown in fig 4c k2 app was calculated to be 481 6 16 7 872 57 9 531 6 36 2 403 21 5 m 1s 1 for rntd fmtd cmtd and nztd respectively the calculated k2 app values for hras were almost one order of magnitude higher than those for the reaction between pms and β lactam antibiotics chen et al 2018 and tetracyclines chen et al 2019a 1 d hras d t k obs hras hras 2 d hras d t k 2 app hras hras pms 3 3 ph impact the oxidation of organic contaminants by pms was previously reported to depend on solution ph nihemaiti et al 2020 hence ph impact was further examined for the degradation of hras by pms at ph 3 0 9 0 as illustrated in fig 5 pms promoted degradation of hras were ph dependent generally hras degradation by pms was almost unaffected by the solution ph from 3 0 to 5 0 afterwards the values of k2 app slightly decreased with ph further increased to ph 7 0 and more sharply decreased when ph finally increased to ph 9 0 pms possesses two pka values pka1 0 pka2 9 4 zhang et al 2013 and thus mainly exhibiting hso5 and so5 2 species at the investigated phs hso 5 h so 5 2 pka2 9 4 figure s4 in addition the pka values for the amine groups in hras were at around ph 7 0 i e pka 8 2 latch et al 2003 7 1 latch et al 2003 6 7 echizen and ishizaki 1991 and 6 8 wu et al 2001 for rntd cmtd fmtd and nztd respectively hence hras exhibit the protonated state at the acidic phs ph 3 0 and 5 0 but deprotonated state at ph 9 0 hras0 h hra s the species specific reaction between hras and pms was used to explain the ph dependency of k2 app of hras eq 3 and 4 3 d h r a s t d t k 2 app hras hras t pms t i j m n k i j α i β j h r a s t pms t hence 4 k 2 app hras i j m n k i j α i β j where hras t and pms t represent the total concentration of hras and pms respectively ki j represents the species specific second order rate constant for the reaction between species i of hras and species j of pms and αi and βj represent the distribution coefficients of hras and pms species respectively the ki j were obtained by least squares regression of the experimental data of k2 app hras to eq 4 because of the small fraction of hras0 so5 2 figure s5 and lower oxidation capacity of so5 2 than hso5 the specific reaction between hras0 and so5 2 was not considered as shown in fig 5 the experimental data of k2 app hras at various phs could be well explained by the species specific reactions the values of ki j are summarized in table s4 and their contribution to the overall k2 app is described in figure s6 results show that the contribution of so5 2 could be neglected at ph 7 and below figure s6 indeed so5 2 showed relatively low reactivity towards hras table s4 and so5 2 were reported to possess lower oxidation capacity than hso5 lei et al 2016 furthermore hras0 was more susceptible to oxidation with pms than hras which is different from the fact that the deprotonated species with richer electrons normally react faster with oxidants it was thus implied that the reaction site on hras towards pms oxidation is not the deprotonated functional group i e the amine groups on hras which will be further discussed in the following sections the higher reactivity of hras0 towards pms might be explained by electrostatic interactions the negatively charged pms could get close to the protonated hras more easily than the deprotonated hras thus exhibited higher reactivity towards the protonated hras 3 4 impact of water matrices we further evaluated the impact of water matrices on pms promoted degradation of hras with the results shown in fig 6 unlike the aops with radical generation the addition of common anions e g cl 0 300 mm and hco3 0 100 mm did not affect the degradation of hras by pms at neutral ph fig 6a and b indicating these anions in water matrices exhibited negligible effect on pms promoted degradation of hras indeed cl reacts with hso5 and so5 2 at the rate constants of 2 06 10 3 m 1s 1 and 3 8 10 4 m 1s 1 respectively lente et al 2009 which are much lower than the rate constants between hras with pms 403 872 m 1s 1 hence the impact of cl on pms induced oxidation of hras could be negligible moreover the degradation of hras was not affected in the presence of ha 0 50 mg l fig 6c suggesting that the natural organic matter also showed neglectable effect on hras degradation organic matter and cl are always known to affect so4 and thus the water matrices can compete with the target contaminants towards the radical consumption in aops thus reducing the treatment efficiency chen et al 2019b the negligible impact of water matrices on pms promoted hras degradation also implied that hras degradation was not primarily contributed from radicals we further investigated pms promoted degradation of hras in the real water samples as shown in fig 7 hras degradation in di water was similar to those in the sw hww and mww thus the degradation of hras by pms was not affected by the real water matrices moreover we also evaluated the decomposition of pms along the hras degradation in the real water matrices and the results show that pms decomposition was initially fast and finally ceased figure s7 the trend of pms decomposition resembled the degradation of hras indicating that the decomposition of pms was induced by the reaction with hras but not by the water matrices on the other hand pms decomposition was also not influenced by the real water matrices these evidences further confirmed that pms showed specific and rapid reactivity towards hras which was not affected by the water matrices hence compared to the aops with radical generation pms oxidation was a more appealing alternative for degradation of hras in real water matrices 3 5 reaction pathway and mechanism 3 5 1 theoretical prediction of reaction sites the abovementioned radical scavenging experiments verified the non radical process for pms promoted hras degradation the oxidation of hras most likely proceeded via electrophilic reaction by pms pms tends to attack the moieties groups with high electron density in hras indeed the electron rich moieties groups in hras such as double bonds amine sulfur were regarded as the potential sites susceptible to oxidation by various oxidants e g o3 kmno4 cl2 and clo2 wang et al 2016 theoretical calculations were frequently used to predict the potential reaction sites in electrophilic reaction qu et al 2015 based on the frontier molecular orbital theory the electrophilic reaction probably takes place at the electron rich homo regions and the results were shown in fig 8 generally the homo orbits cannot precisely describe the gain or loss of electron on each hras molecule site during reaction therefore we also calculated the fukui index on electrophilic attack f according to natural population analysis npa charge distribution of hras molecule tables s5 s9 for the investigated hras except rxtd the homos and f were mainly distributed on the double bond sulfur and nitrogen atoms suggesting these sites might act as the potential reactive sites susceptible to pms attack for rxtd however the homos primarily located on the double bond and the nitrogen atoms based on the abovementioned results that rxtd showed negligible reactivity towards pms sulfur atom absence in rxtd was likely the reactive sites for pms oxidation to facilitate discerning the reaction mechanism the transformation products by pms oxidation were further analyzed 3 5 2 transformation products transformation products of hras were further investigated by lc ms ms the primary products with molecular weights mw of m 16 and m 32 m mw of the parent hras were observed during pms promoted oxidation of hras fig 9 they were most probably the oxidation products with one two oxygen addition on the parent hras which were also observed in the direct oxidation of β lactam antibiotics tetracycline by pms chen et al 2018 chen et al 2019a in the pms promoted oxidation however the product profile of hras was different from those of β lactam antibiotics tetracycline for example two or more m 16 products were generated and verified as the isomers in pms promoted oxidation of β lactam antibiotics chen et al 2018 while the sole m 16 product was produced in hras degradation by pms on the other hand m 16 products were generated via oxygen transfer from pms to the thioether sulfur on the five six membered ring of β lactam antibiotics chen et al 2018 but via hydroxylation process in the b ring of tetracycline chen et al 2019a it is still unclear how m 16 were generated in the pms promoted oxidation of hras the structure of transformation products were thus analyzed based on the mass fragments 3 5 2 1 rntd both m 16 and m 32 products were generated in pms promoted oxidation of rntd and the intensity of m 16 was much higher than that of m 32 fig 9a hence the reaction between pms and rntd primarily proceeded via the addition of one oxygen atom on rntd to evaluate the potential reactive sites on rntd we analyzed the bond cleavage of rntd in the esi fragmentation at first in the mass spectrum of the parent compound rntd figure s8 the presence of m z 176 138 and m z 170 144 indicated the breakage of the s c bond hence this site is susceptible to cleave in the reaction moreover the m z 130 is also observed in the spectrum of rntd especially at the higher fragmentation voltage suggesting that the c c near the sulfur atom is also likely to cleave during the reaction but the required energy is higher than the cleavage of s c in addition the fragment of m z 270 was generated via the loss of n n dimethylamino moiety from rntd and further loss of no2 of m z 270 produced the fragment of m z 224 in the m 16 product the presence of m z 138 and m z 110 fragments indicated the intact furan structure in rntd figure s9 hence the oxygen addition site most likely located on the other side part of rntd which was verified by the presence of m z 192 192 176 16 m z 176 is the s containing structure in rntd in the m 16 product fragment of m z 286 was generated from the loss of n n dimethylamine 45 da from rntd and further loss of h2o 18 da generated the fragment ion m z 268 it is noted that both rntd and m 16 product contain fragment of m z 130 suggesting the oxygen addition could not occur at the double bond on the right side figure s9 hence the s c is the most likely site for oxygen addition according to the theoretical calculation homos of sulfur atom is much higher than the neighboring carbon thus sulfur is vulnerable to electrophilic attack by pms indeed the thioether sulfur was previously regarded as preferable site for pms oxidation chen et al 2018 hence m 16 product was supposed to be the sulfoxide product of rntd both the fragments of m z 130 and m z 138 were observed in the mass spectra of rntd and its m 32 product figure s10 indicating the intact furan structure on the left side and the double bond on the right side in m 32 product the s c moiety is also the potential reactive sites for two oxygen atoms addition in the rntd sulfoxide the oxygen is difficult to further add on the sulfur to generate sulfone products owing to the steric hindrance effect the second oxygen is most likely to add on the carbon neighboring to sulfur and underwent via the hydroxylation process this hypothesis was verified by the presence of m z 192 fragment in the mass spectrum of m 32 product because of the extremely low intensity of m 32 product fig 9a the hydroxylation at carbon neighboring sulfur on rntd could be negligible compared to the oxidation at thioether sulfur on rntd 3 5 2 2 cmtd only m 16 product was observed in the reaction between pms and cmtd fig 9b the prominent fragment of cmtd was m z 159 figure s11 suggesting the s c is liable to cleave and thus this moiety is vulnerable to reactions with the increasing fragmentation voltage the intensity of m z 117 increased along with the decreasing m z 159 intensity indicating the loss of n cn in cmtd in m 16 product figure s12 the sulfur atom was most susceptible to electrophilic attack by pms based on the theoretical calculation indeed the presence of m z 175 175 159 16 and m z 133 133 117 16 also indicated that the oxygen atom likely added on the sulfur to generate cmtd sulfoxide product 3 5 2 3 fmtd the product profile of fmtd was similar to that of rntd both m 16 and m 32 products were observed along fmtd oxidation fig 9c the mass fragment pattern of fmtd resembled that of cmtd that is few fragments were observed even at high voltage figure s13 the presence of m z 189 and m z 155 indicated the cleavage of s c moiety while m z 259 means the loss of so2 nh2 fragments in m 16 product the most abundant fragment is m z 205 figure s14 indicating the oxygen addition likely occurred on the m z 189 fragment in fmtd 205 189 16 similarly the presence of m z 275 suggests the oxygen addition on m z 259 in fmtd 275 259 16 on the other hand the fragment of m z 155 in m 16 product indicated the presence of intact thiazole ring the fragments of m z 275 205 and 155 were also reported in the product of fmtd generated by the photo catalytic oxidation which was finally identified as sulfoxide of fmtd murphy et al 2012 the above evidences indicated that the oxygen addition was located on the sulfur atom generating the fmtd sulfoxide product for m 32 the intensity of m 32 na is much higher than that of m 32 h and the mass spectrum of m 32 na was obtained and shown in figure s15 the presence of m z 313 means the oxygen addition on m z 259 fragment 313 259 32 h na and the loss of so2 nh2 fragments moreover the appearance of m z 243 indicated the second oxygen added on the left side of m 16 243 205 16 h na probably on the sulfur on thiazole ring based on the theoretical calculation 3 5 2 4 nztd both m 16 and m 32 products were observed in pms promoted oxidation of nztd fig 9d in the mass spectrum of nztd the presence of m z 155 and m z 187 indicated the cleavage of s c in the fragmentation figure s16 it is noted that nztd and rntd share the same right side in their structure fig 1 the cleavage of s c in rntd generated the primary fragment of m z 176 which was not observed in nztd however m z 131 was observed in the fragments of nztd and its intensity increased as the most abundant fragment when the voltage increased to 30 ev m z 131 was supposed as the product of m z 176 after loss of no2 the appearance of m z 286 also verified no2 prone to lose in the fragmentation according to the theoretical calculation the sulfur atom and the c atom next to no2 possess high homos consistent with the fragmentation patterns of nztd in the m 16 product the presence of m z 130 and m z 144 indicated the intact right side of nztd figure s17 and thus the oxygen addition could not locate on the double bond next to no2 in addition the appearance of fragments of m z 205 and m z 147 suggest the oxygen added on the sulfur on the straight chain m z 147 was supposed to be the addition of oxygen on m z 131 fragment of nztd and the loss of no2 in the right side according to the evolution of transformation products m 16 product initially increased and then gradually decreased at the same time the other product i e m 32 continuously increased fig 9d hence m 16 product was further transformed to m 32 product and the second oxygen likely added on m 16 product the presence of m z 147 and m z 192 indicated an intact right side of m 16 figure s18 hence the second oxygen was likely added on the sulfur atom on thiazole ring based on the theoretical calculation overall m 16 and m 32 products were identified as the primary products of hras after reaction with pms although the hydroxylation took place in the pms promoted degradation of rntd to form m 32 its intensity was much lower than m 16 and thus this reaction process could be neglected in pms promoted oxidation of hras oxidation of thioether sulfur to generate sulfoxide were supposed as the dominant mechanism for hras oxidation 3 5 3 reaction mechanism the conventional pms activation processes rely on the generation of radicals for contaminant destruction in this work pms promoted degradation of hras did not rely on radical generation but proceeded via a direct oxidation this mild process was previously reported to dominate in the oxidation of arsenite wang et al 2014 hydrogen sulfide betterton and hoffmann 1990 and β lactam antibiotics by pms chen et al 2018 generally the direct oxidation process proceeds through two electron transfer which involves the heterolytic breakage of the peroxide bond and an oxygen transfer from pms to the contaminants fig 10 pms was converted to sulfate ion upon reaction without so4 generation indeed in the direct oxidation between pms and hras the symmetry adapted configuration between 2p orbital of oxygen and empty 3d orbital in sulfur renders lone pair electrons of oxygen liable to donate to sulfur generating a feedback coordination bond wang et al 2016 this process results in an oxygen atom transfer from pms to the thioether sulfur with the formation of hras sulfoxide it is noted that two stereoisomeric sulfoxides were generated in β lactam antibiotics oxidized by pms chen et al 2018 the fusion of β lactam ring and five or six membered ring makes the electrons of thioether sulfur on the ring more exposed outside thus susceptible to peroxide attack from different directions such structure characteristic is not observed in hras thus only one sulfoxide is generated in pms promoted oxidation of hras it is noted that multiple thioether sulfur containing moieties groups are present in the structures of hras e g fmtd and nztd based on the transformation product analysis of fmtd and nztd both the thioether sulfurs on the straight chain and the thiazole ring show reactivity towards pms oxidation moreover the intensity of m 16 product was much higher than that of m 32 product indicating that the thioether sulfur on the straight chain shows much higher reactivity towards pms than that on the thiazole ring of hras on the one hand the fukui index f of thioether sulfur on the straight chain was higher than that on the thiazole ring tables s6 and s7 hence the thioether sulfur on the straight chain was more susceptible to electrophilic attack by pms than that on the thiazole ring on the other hand the amine groups adjacent to thioether sulfur on the thiazole ring might hinder the attack of pms on the thioether sulfur owing to the steric hindrance effect thus contributing to the observed lower reactivity to pms these two factors induced the thioether sulfur on the straight chain in hras more susceptible to oxygen transfer with pms compared to the conventional pms activation with radical generation two electron transfer i e oxygen atom transfer process for hras oxidation exhibited high efficiency because the oxidation capacity of the peroxide were fully utilized moreover the direct oxidation by pms was not affected by the background ions and nom in the water matrices and thus showed high treatment efficiency in the real water matrices hence this process could minimize the adverse impact of coexisting matrix constituent and maximize the utilization efficiency of pms on the other hand the oxidation of nitro hras by conventional oxidants e g ozone and chlorine could generate the products with high tcnm formation potential wang et al 2016 while the oxygen transfer process only involved the oxidation at thioether sulfur but made little contribution to tcnm formation overall direct oxidation by pms is a facile and environmental friendly strategy to alleviate hras contamination in the water 3 6 ecotoxicity evaluation qsar analysis was used to predict the ecotoxicity of contaminants and their products by ecosar program as shown in table 1 the acute toxicity was categorized as not harmful 100 mg l to fish for all the target contaminants and classified as harmful 10 100 mg l to daphnid and green algae for cmtd and rntd compared to the parent hras the acute toxicity of the transformation products e g m 16 and m 32 products belong to the not harmful category and the lc50 or ec50 values were ten times or even higher than those of hras hence acute toxicity of the hras could be significantly reduced after treatment with pms for the chronic toxicity cmtd and rntd are classified as toxic 1 10 mg l compounds to daphnid but harmful compounds to fish and algae while their products have a significantly lower chronic toxicity with the chv values on 1 order of magnitude higher than hras similarly transformation products of fmtd and nztd show much lower chronic toxicity than their corresponding parent contaminants overall ecotoxicity of hras could be remarkably reduced after pms treatment and thus oxidation by pms is a promising strategy to degrade hras and eliminate their toxicity 4 conclusions pms exhibits specific and high reactivity towards hras except rxtd and the apparent second order rate constants were determined to be in the range from 403 to 872 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 radical scavenging experiments confirmed lack of involvement of radical species this non radical process was not influenced by the water matrices and thus maintained high efficiency in wastewater treatment theoretical calculations and transformation product analysis indicated that the thioether sulfur in hras except rntd was the site susceptible to pms oxidation and was oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide product toxicity evaluation indicated the ecotoxicity of hras was remarkably decreased after pms oxidation this work highlights a promising and facile strategy for alleviating hra contamination in water treatment

17629,peroxymonosulfate pms is an appealing oxidant for organic contaminant destruction relying on radical generation after activation herein we report pms promoted rapid degradation of histamine h2 receptor antagonists hras through non radical process for the first time five commonly used hras i e ranitidine rntd cimetidine cmtd famotidine fmtd nizatidine nztd and roxatidine rxtd were examined their reactivity towards pms results show that hras except rxtd exhibit high reactivity towards pms with apparent second order rate constants from 403 to 872 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 radical scavenging experiments excluded the contribution of radicals to pms promoted degradation of hras and this non radical process was unaffected by the real water matrices structure activity assessment and theoretical calculation indicated that the thioether sulfur in hras except rxtd was the main reactive site for pms oxidation transformation product analysis further elucidated oxidation of the thioether sulfur to sulfoxide product through an oxygen atom transfer process moreover the thioether sulfur on the straight chain was more susceptible to oxygen transfer with pms than that on the thiazole ring of hras toxicity evaluation indicated the ecotoxicity of hras could be remarkably reduced after pms oxidation hence this work provides a promising strategy to rapidly remove hras and significantly reduce their toxicity in water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords histamine h2 receptor antagonists peroxymonosulfate non radical process thioether sulfur 1

et al 2009 rntd and cmtd were found to occur in the surface water at concentrations ranging from 10 to 580 ng l kolpin et al 2002 zuccato et al 2000 and rntd has been regarded as one of the highest risk pharmaceuticals in the surface water besse and garric 2008 the occurrence of hras in the environment may exert biological effects on non target organisms and thus raises potential risk to the ecosystem and public health generally biological treatment processes were reported to be ineffective to remove hras in wastewater treatment plants radjenović et al 2009 while oxidative water treatment is an important method to degrade hras disinfection unit is a significant sink for hras before hras discharging to the environment hras e g cmtd are susceptible to rapid oxidation by free chlorine and chloramines generating some unexpected products with higher toxicity buth et al 2007 ozonation was found to be effective in oxidizing nitro hras e g rntd and nztd but the oxidized products had higher potential to form halonitromethanes tcnm which show high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity and thus have been regulated wang et al 2016 although nitro hras are photo reactive under uv irradiation uv intensity currently used in disinfection could not fully eliminate hras and their tcnm formation potential dong et al 2017 hence more efficient and clean techniques are required to remove these hras from wastewater effectively persulfate ps including peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds have become emerging oxidants in wastewater treatment zhang et al 2015a the homogeneous cleavage of peroxide bond in ps can generate reactive radical species e g so4 chen et al 2019b activation of ps to generate so4 is generally considered to be crucial for contaminant destruction in wastewater treatment qian et al 2018 various strategies have been used to activate ps for so4 generation including electron transfer reaction e g activation with transition metal anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 or base furman et al 2010 and external energy stimulation e g uv zhang et al 2015b zhou et al 2018a and heating chen et al 2016a gao et al 2016 so4 is a strong oxidant with high redox potential e0 2 5 3 1 v and thus can degrade a broad range of contaminants chen et al 2016b however so4 is non selective and thus also shows high reactivity towards water matrices e g cl hco3 and natural organic matters qian et al 2016 which might reduce the treatment efficiency in the real water matrices recently the non radical process with ps has received considerable concerns owing to its high selectivity towards target contaminants duan et al 2018 pms was reported to effectively oxidize some organic contaminants without activation and such reaction is significantly dependent on the contaminant structure yang et al 2018 for example pms shows specific and high reactivity towards β lactam antibiotics chen et al 2018 fluoroquinolone zhou et al 2018b sulfonamides ji et al 2018 yin et al 2018 and thioether sulfur n4 amine on piperazine ring and amino group on the benzene were regarded as the effective sites for pms oxidation respectively hras seem to be reactive towards various oxidants due to the presence of multiple reactive moieties groups such as furan ring amine and thioether sulfur ikehata et al 2006b however it is still unclear whether pms can degrade hras in this work we found pms exhibited specific and high reactivity towards some hras without external energy or activators this new discovery motivated us to conduct an in depth study to address two major research questions 1 how pms reacts with hras and 2 what characteristics render hras highly reactive towards pms to our best knowledge this study is among the first to systematically reveal the specific and rapid reaction between pms and hras the new findings of this study provide a promising and facile strategy to eliminate hras contamination in wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the standard chemicals of fmtd rntd cmtd nztd and rxtd were purchased from sigma aldrich or anpel laboratory technologies shanghai inc at the highest purity pms and pds were obtained from sigma aldrich at 99 purity methanol meoh acetonitrile and tert butyl alcohol tba formic acid and ammonium acetate were also obtained from sigma aldrich at hplc grade hydrogen peroxide hp h2o2 sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 sodium chloride nacl sodium bicarbonate nahco3 sodium hydroxide naoh humic acid and sulfuric acid h2so4 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd at analytical grade deionized di reagent water was produced from a millipore milli q ultrapure gradient a10 purification system 2 2 real water samples surface water sw from a river and municipal wastewater mww were collected at locations in the southeast region of china samples were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters immediately upon collection and stored at 5 c before use the characteristics of the samples are shown in tables s1 a synthetic hospital wastewater hww was prepared by adopting recipes serna galvis et al 2017 and also used to evaluate the efficiency of hras degradation the composition of hww is shown in table s2 2 3 experimental procedures experiments were conducted in amber glass serum bottles at room temperature 22 c reaction ph was maintained with 10 mm phosphate buffer reaction solutions were prepared with hras and buffer and then pms was added to initiate the reaction samples were collected at the predetermined time and quenched with 100 μl of 1 m sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 which could completely consume the remaining pms the initial concentrations used for hras and pms were 10 and 100 μm respectively for most experiments 10 500 μm of pms were added to the hras solution to evaluate the impact of pms concentration radical quenchers i e meoh and tba were added to investigate whether the radicals contributed to the degradation of hras cl hco3 and humic acid were spiked into the reaction solution to evaluate the impact of water matrices the above reactions were also conducted in the real water matrices i e sw mww and hww all the experiments were conducted in duplicate or more 2 4 analytical methods hras were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc 1260 agilent technology usa equipped with a uv detector samples with 15 μl injection was separated on a kromasil c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm the details are provided in table s3 transformation products were determined on a hplc system utimate 3000 dionex usa connected to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer tsq quantum ultra emr thermo fisher scientific usa with electrospray ionization esi samples with 40 μl injection were separated on a zorbax sb c18 column 2 1 150 mm 5 μm the detailed conditions are summarized in text s1 pms was analyzed by a spectrophotometric method proposed by liang et al liang et al 2008 as detailed in text s2 2 5 theoretical calculation the frontier electron density fed calculations were conducted by the gaussian 09 program on a basis set of b3lyp 6 31 g d p the feds of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo were obtained and visualized condensed fukui function based on the density functional theory dft was used to predict the regioselectivity of different reactive species on the hras molecules 2 6 ecotoxicity assessment the ecotoxicity of hras and the oxidized products were evaluated using the ecological structure activity relationship model ecosar program liu et al 2018 this program has been successfully used to predict the ecotoxicity to screen contaminants the ecotoxicity was assessed for three trophic levels of aquatic organisms i e fish daphnid and green algae half lethal concentration lc50 values for fish 96 h daphnid 48 h and half effective concentration ec50 values for algae 96 h were used to assess the acute toxicity chronic value chv was used to demonstrate chronic toxicity 3 results and discussion 3 1 pms promoted degradation of hras advanced oxidation processes aops are considered as efficient techniques to degrade a wide range of contaminants owing to the generation of highly reactive radicals e g so4 and ho indeed rntd was susceptible to significant degradation in the uv pds and uv hp systems fig 2 in the uv pms system rntd degradation was much faster than that observed in uv pds or uv hp systems with complete degradation occurred after 2 min interestingly pms alone could also promote rapid degradation of rntd while the presence of pds or hp alone exhibited negligible effect on rntd degradation fig 2 pms oxidation reactive radical oxidation and uv photodegradation could contribute to rntd degradation in the uv pms system the similar trend of rntd degradation in pms and uv pms system indicated that the contribution of pms oxidation overwhelms other two degradation processes in uv pms system fig 2 indeed the decomposition of pms was only slightly increased after introduction of uv irradiation figure s1 hence the rapid degradation of rntd in uv pms system was most likely contributed from the pms promoted degradation we further conducted radical quenching experiments to investigate whether radical species involved in the pms induced oxidation of rntd generally meoh and tba are always selected as the radical probes to distinguish so4 and ho meoh reacts with so4 and ho at a comparable rate 9 7 108 m 1s 1 3 2 106 m 1s 1 for so4 and ho respectively while tba reacts with so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 much slower than that with ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 liang and su 2009 as shown in figure s2 the addition of alcohols did not affect the degradation of rntd by pms even when the concentration of alcohols increased to 1000 mm this result indicated that radical species did not involve in the pms promoted degradation of rntd and this reaction most likely proceeded via the non radical process it is noted that singlet oxygen 1o2 can be generated from the self decomposition of pms furfuryl alcohol ffa a scavenger for 1o2 yang et al 2018 was added in pms rntd solution and the results showed that both rntd degradation and pms decomposition were not affected after addition of ffa after 2 min figure s3 and thus 1o2 did not contribute to the pms promoted degradation of rntd hence pms likely exhibited specific reactivity towards rntd we further investigated the degradation of other four hras by pms to evaluate whether pms shows specific reactivity towards all hras as shown in fig 3 pms promoted rapid degradation of cmtd fmtd and nztd but was inert for the degradation of rxtd hence pms promoted degradation was dependent on hras structure hras possess several electron rich moieties groups e g amine which are always regarded as the potential reactive sites for oxidants on the other hand multiple amine moieties groups are present in the investigated hras while thioether sulfur occurs in cmtd rntd fmtd and nztd but not in rxtd fig 1 it is thus suggested that the different reactivity of hras towards pms likely related to the presence absence of the thioether sulfur which will be further elucidated in the following sections 3 2 degradation kinetics the impact of hras concentration on the pms promoted degradation was investigated at neutral ph condition as shown in fig 4 a pms promoted hras degradation increased with pms concentration increasing from 0 05 mm to 0 5 mm moreover hras degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics at various pms concentrations eq 1 with the calculated pseudo first order constants kobs demonstrated in fig 4b log kobs linearly increased with log cpms and the slope was close to unity hence kobs showed a linear relationship with respect to pms concentration suggesting the overall reaction could be described by a second order kinetics eq 2 apparent second order reaction rate constants k2 app could be obtained by dividing kobs by pms concentration as shown in fig 4c k2 app was calculated to be 481 6 16 7 872 57 9 531 6 36 2 403 21 5 m 1s 1 for rntd fmtd cmtd and nztd respectively the calculated k2 app values for hras were almost one order of magnitude higher than those for the reaction between pms and β lactam antibiotics chen et al 2018 and tetracyclines chen et al 2019a 1 d hras d t k obs hras hras 2 d hras d t k 2 app hras hras pms 3 3 ph impact the oxidation of organic contaminants by pms was previously reported to depend on solution ph nihemaiti et al 2020 hence ph impact was further examined for the degradation of hras by pms at ph 3 0 9 0 as illustrated in fig 5 pms promoted degradation of hras were ph dependent generally hras degradation by pms was almost unaffected by the solution ph from 3 0 to 5 0 afterwards the values of k2 app slightly decreased with ph further increased to ph 7 0 and more sharply decreased when ph finally increased to ph 9 0 pms possesses two pka values pka1 0 pka2 9 4 zhang et al 2013 and thus mainly exhibiting hso5 and so5 2 species at the investigated phs hso 5 h so 5 2 pka2 9 4 figure s4 in addition the pka values for the amine groups in hras were at around ph 7 0 i e pka 8 2 latch et al 2003 7 1 latch et al 2003 6 7 echizen and ishizaki 1991 and 6 8 wu et al 2001 for rntd cmtd fmtd and nztd respectively hence hras exhibit the protonated state at the acidic phs ph 3 0 and 5 0 but deprotonated state at ph 9 0 hras0 h hra s the species specific reaction between hras and pms was used to explain the ph dependency of k2 app of hras eq 3 and 4 3 d h r a s t d t k 2 app hras hras t pms t i j m n k i j α i β j h r a s t pms t hence 4 k 2 app hras i j m n k i j α i β j where hras t and pms t represent the total concentration of hras and pms respectively ki j represents the species specific second order rate constant for the reaction between species i of hras and species j of pms and αi and βj represent the distribution coefficients of hras and pms species respectively the ki j were obtained by least squares regression of the experimental data of k2 app hras to eq 4 because of the small fraction of hras0 so5 2 figure s5 and lower oxidation capacity of so5 2 than hso5 the specific reaction between hras0 and so5 2 was not considered as shown in fig 5 the experimental data of k2 app hras at various phs could be well explained by the species specific reactions the values of ki j are summarized in table s4 and their contribution to the overall k2 app is described in figure s6 results show that the contribution of so5 2 could be neglected at ph 7 and below figure s6 indeed so5 2 showed relatively low reactivity towards hras table s4 and so5 2 were reported to possess lower oxidation capacity than hso5 lei et al 2016 furthermore hras0 was more susceptible to oxidation with pms than hras which is different from the fact that the deprotonated species with richer electrons normally react faster with oxidants it was thus implied that the reaction site on hras towards pms oxidation is not the deprotonated functional group i e the amine groups on hras which will be further discussed in the following sections the higher reactivity of hras0 towards pms might be explained by electrostatic interactions the negatively charged pms could get close to the protonated hras more easily than the deprotonated hras thus exhibited higher reactivity towards the protonated hras 3 4 impact of water matrices we further evaluated the impact of water matrices on pms promoted degradation of hras with the results shown in fig 6 unlike the aops with radical generation the addition of common anions e g cl 0 300 mm and hco3 0 100 mm did not affect the degradation of hras by pms at neutral ph fig 6a and b indicating these anions in water matrices exhibited negligible effect on pms promoted degradation of hras indeed cl reacts with hso5 and so5 2 at the rate constants of 2 06 10 3 m 1s 1 and 3 8 10 4 m 1s 1 respectively lente et al 2009 which are much lower than the rate constants between hras with pms 403 872 m 1s 1 hence the impact of cl on pms induced oxidation of hras could be negligible moreover the degradation of hras was not affected in the presence of ha 0 50 mg l fig 6c suggesting that the natural organic matter also showed neglectable effect on hras degradation organic matter and cl are always known to affect so4 and thus the water matrices can compete with the target contaminants towards the radical consumption in aops thus reducing the treatment efficiency chen et al 2019b the negligible impact of water matrices on pms promoted hras degradation also implied that hras degradation was not primarily contributed from radicals we further investigated pms promoted degradation of hras in the real water samples as shown in fig 7 hras degradation in di water was similar to those in the sw hww and mww thus the degradation of hras by pms was not affected by the real water matrices moreover we also evaluated the decomposition of pms along the hras degradation in the real water matrices and the results show that pms decomposition was initially fast and finally ceased figure s7 the trend of pms decomposition resembled the degradation of hras indicating that the decomposition of pms was induced by the reaction with hras but not by the water matrices on the other hand pms decomposition was also not influenced by the real water matrices these evidences further confirmed that pms showed specific and rapid reactivity towards hras which was not affected by the water matrices hence compared to the aops with radical generation pms oxidation was a more appealing alternative for degradation of hras in real water matrices 3 5 reaction pathway and mechanism 3 5 1 theoretical prediction of reaction sites the abovementioned radical scavenging experiments verified the non radical process for pms promoted hras degradation the oxidation of hras most likely proceeded via electrophilic reaction by pms pms tends to attack the moieties groups with high electron density in hras indeed the electron rich moieties groups in hras such as double bonds amine sulfur were regarded as the potential sites susceptible to oxidation by various oxidants e g o3 kmno4 cl2 and clo2 wang et al 2016 theoretical calculations were frequently used to predict the potential reaction sites in electrophilic reaction qu et al 2015 based on the frontier molecular orbital theory the electrophilic reaction probably takes place at the electron rich homo regions and the results were shown in fig 8 generally the homo orbits cannot precisely describe the gain or loss of electron on each hras molecule site during reaction therefore we also calculated the fukui index on electrophilic attack f according to natural population analysis npa charge distribution of hras molecule tables s5 s9 for the investigated hras except rxtd the homos and f were mainly distributed on the double bond sulfur and nitrogen atoms suggesting these sites might act as the potential reactive sites susceptible to pms attack for rxtd however the homos primarily located on the double bond and the nitrogen atoms based on the abovementioned results that rxtd showed negligible reactivity towards pms sulfur atom absence in rxtd was likely the reactive sites for pms oxidation to facilitate discerning the reaction mechanism the transformation products by pms oxidation were further analyzed 3 5 2 transformation products transformation products of hras were further investigated by lc ms ms the primary products with molecular weights mw of m 16 and m 32 m mw of the parent hras were observed during pms promoted oxidation of hras fig 9 they were most probably the oxidation products with one two oxygen addition on the parent hras which were also observed in the direct oxidation of β lactam antibiotics tetracycline by pms chen et al 2018 chen et al 2019a in the pms promoted oxidation however the product profile of hras was different from those of β lactam antibiotics tetracycline for example two or more m 16 products were generated and verified as the isomers in pms promoted oxidation of β lactam antibiotics chen et al 2018 while the sole m 16 product was produced in hras degradation by pms on the other hand m 16 products were generated via oxygen transfer from pms to the thioether sulfur on the five six membered ring of β lactam antibiotics chen et al 2018 but via hydroxylation process in the b ring of tetracycline chen et al 2019a it is still unclear how m 16 were generated in the pms promoted oxidation of hras the structure of transformation products were thus analyzed based on the mass fragments 3 5 2 1 rntd both m 16 and m 32 products were generated in pms promoted oxidation of rntd and the intensity of m 16 was much higher than that of m 32 fig 9a hence the reaction between pms and rntd primarily proceeded via the addition of one oxygen atom on rntd to evaluate the potential reactive sites on rntd we analyzed the bond cleavage of rntd in the esi fragmentation at first in the mass spectrum of the parent compound rntd figure s8 the presence of m z 176 138 and m z 170 144 indicated the breakage of the s c bond hence this site is susceptible to cleave in the reaction moreover the m z 130 is also observed in the spectrum of rntd especially at the higher fragmentation voltage suggesting that the c c near the sulfur atom is also likely to cleave during the reaction but the required energy is higher than the cleavage of s c in addition the fragment of m z 270 was generated via the loss of n n dimethylamino moiety from rntd and further loss of no2 of m z 270 produced the fragment of m z 224 in the m 16 product the presence of m z 138 and m z 110 fragments indicated the intact furan structure in rntd figure s9 hence the oxygen addition site most likely located on the other side part of rntd which was verified by the presence of m z 192 192 176 16 m z 176 is the s containing structure in rntd in the m 16 product fragment of m z 286 was generated from the loss of n n dimethylamine 45 da from rntd and further loss of h2o 18 da generated the fragment ion m z 268 it is noted that both rntd and m 16 product contain fragment of m z 130 suggesting the oxygen addition could not occur at the double bond on the right side figure s9 hence the s c is the most likely site for oxygen addition according to the theoretical calculation homos of sulfur atom is much higher than the neighboring carbon thus sulfur is vulnerable to electrophilic attack by pms indeed the thioether sulfur was previously regarded as preferable site for pms oxidation chen et al 2018 hence m 16 product was supposed to be the sulfoxide product of rntd both the fragments of m z 130 and m z 138 were observed in the mass spectra of rntd and its m 32 product figure s10 indicating the intact furan structure on the left side and the double bond on the right side in m 32 product the s c moiety is also the potential reactive sites for two oxygen atoms addition in the rntd sulfoxide the oxygen is difficult to further add on the sulfur to generate sulfone products owing to the steric hindrance effect the second oxygen is most likely to add on the carbon neighboring to sulfur and underwent via the hydroxylation process this hypothesis was verified by the presence of m z 192 fragment in the mass spectrum of m 32 product because of the extremely low intensity of m 32 product fig 9a the hydroxylation at carbon neighboring sulfur on rntd could be negligible compared to the oxidation at thioether sulfur on rntd 3 5 2 2 cmtd only m 16 product was observed in the reaction between pms and cmtd fig 9b the prominent fragment of cmtd was m z 159 figure s11 suggesting the s c is liable to cleave and thus this moiety is vulnerable to reactions with the increasing fragmentation voltage the intensity of m z 117 increased along with the decreasing m z 159 intensity indicating the loss of n cn in cmtd in m 16 product figure s12 the sulfur atom was most susceptible to electrophilic attack by pms based on the theoretical calculation indeed the presence of m z 175 175 159 16 and m z 133 133 117 16 also indicated that the oxygen atom likely added on the sulfur to generate cmtd sulfoxide product 3 5 2 3 fmtd the product profile of fmtd was similar to that of rntd both m 16 and m 32 products were observed along fmtd oxidation fig 9c the mass fragment pattern of fmtd resembled that of cmtd that is few fragments were observed even at high voltage figure s13 the presence of m z 189 and m z 155 indicated the cleavage of s c moiety while m z 259 means the loss of so2 nh2 fragments in m 16 product the most abundant fragment is m z 205 figure s14 indicating the oxygen addition likely occurred on the m z 189 fragment in fmtd 205 189 16 similarly the presence of m z 275 suggests the oxygen addition on m z 259 in fmtd 275 259 16 on the other hand the fragment of m z 155 in m 16 product indicated the presence of intact thiazole ring the fragments of m z 275 205 and 155 were also reported in the product of fmtd generated by the photo catalytic oxidation which was finally identified as sulfoxide of fmtd murphy et al 2012 the above evidences indicated that the oxygen addition was located on the sulfur atom generating the fmtd sulfoxide product for m 32 the intensity of m 32 na is much higher than that of m 32 h and the mass spectrum of m 32 na was obtained and shown in figure s15 the presence of m z 313 means the oxygen addition on m z 259 fragment 313 259 32 h na and the loss of so2 nh2 fragments moreover the appearance of m z 243 indicated the second oxygen added on the left side of m 16 243 205 16 h na probably on the sulfur on thiazole ring based on the theoretical calculation 3 5 2 4 nztd both m 16 and m 32 products were observed in pms promoted oxidation of nztd fig 9d in the mass spectrum of nztd the presence of m z 155 and m z 187 indicated the cleavage of s c in the fragmentation figure s16 it is noted that nztd and rntd share the same right side in their structure fig 1 the cleavage of s c in rntd generated the primary fragment of m z 176 which was not observed in nztd however m z 131 was observed in the fragments of nztd and its intensity increased as the most abundant fragment when the voltage increased to 30 ev m z 131 was supposed as the product of m z 176 after loss of no2 the appearance of m z 286 also verified no2 prone to lose in the fragmentation according to the theoretical calculation the sulfur atom and the c atom next to no2 possess high homos consistent with the fragmentation patterns of nztd in the m 16 product the presence of m z 130 and m z 144 indicated the intact right side of nztd figure s17 and thus the oxygen addition could not locate on the double bond next to no2 in addition the appearance of fragments of m z 205 and m z 147 suggest the oxygen added on the sulfur on the straight chain m z 147 was supposed to be the addition of oxygen on m z 131 fragment of nztd and the loss of no2 in the right side according to the evolution of transformation products m 16 product initially increased and then gradually decreased at the same time the other product i e m 32 continuously increased fig 9d hence m 16 product was further transformed to m 32 product and the second oxygen likely added on m 16 product the presence of m z 147 and m z 192 indicated an intact right side of m 16 figure s18 hence the second oxygen was likely added on the sulfur atom on thiazole ring based on the theoretical calculation overall m 16 and m 32 products were identified as the primary products of hras after reaction with pms although the hydroxylation took place in the pms promoted degradation of rntd to form m 32 its intensity was much lower than m 16 and thus this reaction process could be neglected in pms promoted oxidation of hras oxidation of thioether sulfur to generate sulfoxide were supposed as the dominant mechanism for hras oxidation 3 5 3 reaction mechanism the conventional pms activation processes rely on the generation of radicals for contaminant destruction in this work pms promoted degradation of hras did not rely on radical generation but proceeded via a direct oxidation this mild process was previously reported to dominate in the oxidation of arsenite wang et al 2014 hydrogen sulfide betterton and hoffmann 1990 and β lactam antibiotics by pms chen et al 2018 generally the direct oxidation process proceeds through two electron transfer which involves the heterolytic breakage of the peroxide bond and an oxygen transfer from pms to the contaminants fig 10 pms was converted to sulfate ion upon reaction without so4 generation indeed in the direct oxidation between pms and hras the symmetry adapted configuration between 2p orbital of oxygen and empty 3d orbital in sulfur renders lone pair electrons of oxygen liable to donate to sulfur generating a feedback coordination bond wang et al 2016 this process results in an oxygen atom transfer from pms to the thioether sulfur with the formation of hras sulfoxide it is noted that two stereoisomeric sulfoxides were generated in β lactam antibiotics oxidized by pms chen et al 2018 the fusion of β lactam ring and five or six membered ring makes the electrons of thioether sulfur on the ring more exposed outside thus susceptible to peroxide attack from different directions such structure characteristic is not observed in hras thus only one sulfoxide is generated in pms promoted oxidation of hras it is noted that multiple thioether sulfur containing moieties groups are present in the structures of hras e g fmtd and nztd based on the transformation product analysis of fmtd and nztd both the thioether sulfurs on the straight chain and the thiazole ring show reactivity towards pms oxidation moreover the intensity of m 16 product was much higher than that of m 32 product indicating that the thioether sulfur on the straight chain shows much higher reactivity towards pms than that on the thiazole ring of hras on the one hand the fukui index f of thioether sulfur on the straight chain was higher than that on the thiazole ring tables s6 and s7 hence the thioether sulfur on the straight chain was more susceptible to electrophilic attack by pms than that on the thiazole ring on the other hand the amine groups adjacent to thioether sulfur on the thiazole ring might hinder the attack of pms on the thioether sulfur owing to the steric hindrance effect thus contributing to the observed lower reactivity to pms these two factors induced the thioether sulfur on the straight chain in hras more susceptible to oxygen transfer with pms compared to the conventional pms activation with radical generation two electron transfer i e oxygen atom transfer process for hras oxidation exhibited high efficiency because the oxidation capacity of the peroxide were fully utilized moreover the direct oxidation by pms was not affected by the background ions and nom in the water matrices and thus showed high treatment efficiency in the real water matrices hence this process could minimize the adverse impact of coexisting matrix constituent and maximize the utilization efficiency of pms on the other hand the oxidation of nitro hras by conventional oxidants e g ozone and chlorine could generate the products with high tcnm formation potential wang et al 2016 while the oxygen transfer process only involved the oxidation at thioether sulfur but made little contribution to tcnm formation overall direct oxidation by pms is a facile and environmental friendly strategy to alleviate hras contamination in the water 3 6 ecotoxicity evaluation qsar analysis was used to predict the ecotoxicity of contaminants and their products by ecosar program as shown in table 1 the acute toxicity was categorized as not harmful 100 mg l to fish for all the target contaminants and classified as harmful 10 100 mg l to daphnid and green algae for cmtd and rntd compared to the parent hras the acute toxicity of the transformation products e g m 16 and m 32 products belong to the not harmful category and the lc50 or ec50 values were ten times or even higher than those of hras hence acute toxicity of the hras could be significantly reduced after treatment with pms for the chronic toxicity cmtd and rntd are classified as toxic 1 10 mg l compounds to daphnid but harmful compounds to fish and algae while their products have a significantly lower chronic toxicity with the chv values on 1 order of magnitude higher than hras similarly transformation products of fmtd and nztd show much lower chronic toxicity than their corresponding parent contaminants overall ecotoxicity of hras could be remarkably reduced after pms treatment and thus oxidation by pms is a promising strategy to degrade hras and eliminate their toxicity 4 conclusions pms exhibits specific and high reactivity towards hras except rxtd and the apparent second order rate constants were determined to be in the range from 403 to 872 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 radical scavenging experiments confirmed lack of involvement of radical species this non radical process was not influenced by the water matrices and thus maintained high efficiency in wastewater treatment theoretical calculations and
