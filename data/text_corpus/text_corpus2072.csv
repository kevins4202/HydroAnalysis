10360,reference evapotranspiration et0 is one of the most important parameters which is required in many fields such as hydrological agricultural and climatological studies therefore its estimation via reliable and accurate techniques is a necessity the present study aims to estimate the monthly et0 time series of six stations located in iran to achieve this objective gene expression programming gep and support vector regression svr were used as standalone models a novel hybrid model was then introduced through coupling the classical svr with an optimization algorithm namely intelligent water drops iwd i e svr iwd two various types of scenarios were considered including the climatic data and antecedent et0 data based patterns in the climatic data based models the effective climatic parameters were recognized by using two pre processing techniques consisting of τ kendall and entropy it is worthy to mention that developing the hybrid svr iwd model as well as utilizing the τ kendall and entropy approaches to discern the most influential weather parameters on et0 are the innovations of current research the results illustrated that the applied pre processing methods introduced different climatic inputs to feed the models the overall results of present study revealed that the proposed hybrid svr iwd model outperformed the standalone svr one under both the considered scenarios when estimating the monthly et0 in addition to the mentioned models two types of empirical equations were also used including the hargreaves samani h s and priestley taylor p t in

requirement etc is an essential task for optimizing water consumption irrigation planning and increasing water consumption efficiency güçlü et al 2017 gharbia et al 2018 adamala et al 2019 its computation for any particular crop is also required in many projects related to water resources irrigation and drainage agricultural water management etc direct measurement of this important parameter through the lysimeters is almost difficult time consuming and costly indirect measurements should be therefore taken into consideration practically reference evapotranspiration et0 is firstly computed and it is then converted to the etc by multiplying the et0 in crop coefficient kumar et al 2002 adamala et al 2019 various climatic data including temperature sunshine hours wind speed relative humidity etc are the most influential weather parameters on the rate of et0 adamala et al 2014 2019 mehdizadeh et al 2017a it can be therefore said that the evapotranspiration process includes a non linear and complex nature hence robust tools are needed to capture the et0 time series different approaches can be used to estimate the et0 comprising of the empirical models artificial intelligence ai techniques etc many empirical equations have been developed namely the temperature based mass transfer based and radiation based among them the popular penman monteith equation i e fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 is universally accepted as a reference approach to estimate the et0 and evaluate the performance of other models trajkovic 2009 valiantzas 2013 mossad and alazba 2016 güçlü et al 2017 mehdizadeh et al 2017b in recent years the application of ai models has been dramatically expanded to address issues in hydrology and water resources engineering gocić et al 2015 feng et al 2016 güçlü et al 2017 adamala et al 2019 mehdizadeh and kozekalani sales 2018 mehdizadeh 2018a 2020 mehdizadeh et al 2017c 2018 in this regard it can be mentioned to gene expression programming gep support vector regression svr and so on in fact the gep is an advanced form of genetic programming which is initially proposed by ferreira 2001 the features of two techniques including genetic programming gp and genetic algorithm ga are merged in the gep svr is a popular technique for classification estimation regression and pattern recognition vapnik et al 1997 vapnik et al 1997 introduced svr for applying classification in the linear and non linear data set recently svr technique is used as a powerful tool for modeling of non linear systems such as evaporation moazenzadeh et al 2018 evapotranspiration mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 air temperature mehdizadeh 2018b aghelpour et al 2019 and streamflow tikhamarine et al 2019 in addition to the standalone ai models the hybrid models can also be developed indeed the aim of implementing the hybrid models is to improve the performance of standalone models when estimating the target parameter i e et0 in this study recently bio inspired optimization algorithms have received significant attention to develop the hybrid models in hydrological studies such as estimating the et0 literature review shows the ability of optimization algorithms as a boosting tool for predictor models like svr intelligent water drops iwd is an evolutionary and population based algorithm based on the mechanism of water droplets in rivers that encounter many obstacles to reach lakes and oceans but eventually find their way to their destination they are inspired recently iwd has tested in different applied engineering fields as an optimizer tool kamkar et al 2010 alijla et al 2014 hendrawan and murase 2011 hoang et al 2012 and it has also shown well performance in comparison with other nature inspired optimization algorithms shah hosseini 2007 2009a 2009b here some of the previous works published in literature on the et0 modeling are briefly reviewed the modeling performance of extreme learning machine elm was investigated by abdullah et al 2015 for modeling the et0 of three weather stations located in iraq the results illustrated that the elm provided better results than the feed forward back propagation ffbp kisi 2016 assessed the modeling performance of least square support vector machine lssvm multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and m5tree models in modeling the monthly et0 of two stations in turkey two data analysis approaches were considered namely the local and external methods the mars and m5 tree techniques illustrated superior performances in the local and external conditions respectively mehdizadeh 2018a applied the mars and gep approaches for estimating the daily et0 at six weather stations in iran and was found that the mars performed the best for the whole of the studied stations kisi and alizamir 2018 modeled the daily et0 time series of the ankara and kirikkale turkey they developed a hybrid model via coupling the wavelet w with the elm i e welm and then compared its performance with wavelet artificial neural networks i e wann standalone elm online sequential elm and standalone ann it was reported that the proposed welm performed the best a new machine learning model was proposed by fan et al 2019 named light gradient boosting machine lgbm for modeling the daily et0 of 49 meteorological stations located in china its performance was also compared with the m5tree random forests rf and four empirical models the lgbm was found to be the best model a comparative study was performed by saggi and jain 2019 to assess the performance of deep learning dl rf gradient boosting machine gbm and generalized linear model glm in daily et0 modeling of two stations located in india it was concluded that the dl showed superiority over the other models used huang et al 2019 evaluated the modeling accuracy of catboost svm and rf to estimate the daily et0 at 12 meteorological stations in china they reported that the svm and catboost models were the best models under the limited and full access to the climatic data respectively the gep and rf models were employed by wang et al 2019 to estimate daily et0 at 24 weather stations china the authors reported the reliable potential of both the mentioned methods malik et al 2019 investigated the applicability of co active neuro fuzzy inference system canfis for monthly et0 prediction of two stations located in india they concluded that the canfis presented reliable et0 estimates compared to the other applied ai techniques tikhamarine et al 2019 proposed five hybrid models through hybridizing the ann and five different types of optimization algorithms for modeling the monthly et0 of two sites in india and algeria the hybrid model of ann coupled with gray wolf optimizer i e ann gwo was found to perform the best del cerro et al 2020 compared the potential of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and some empirical equations for modeling the daily et0 of south india and reported the better performance of anfis than the empirical models the daily et0 time series at southeastern australia were estimated by shi et al 2020 using the rf and empirical models the rf was found to illustrate better results than the empirical equations used ferreira and da cunha 2020 proposed a novel method including the convolutional neural networks cnn for the daily et0 modeling of 53 locations in brazil its modeling performance was also compared with other techniques namely rf xgboost and ann the results revealed the higher accuracy of proposed cnn than the other models tikhamarine et al 2020 applied three various optimization algorithms to improve the accuracy of svr in modeling monthly et0 of three sites at algeria superior performance of the hybrid models than the standalone svr was reported by the authors heddam et al 2020 proposed two types of elm including optimally pruned elm opelm and online sequential elm oselm to predict daily et0 of a mediterranean region located in algeria they found out that the opelm outperformed the oselm the overall outcomes of literature review as mentioned above confirmed the reliable potential of ai models to capturing the et0 time series on various time scales on the other hand our literature review illustrated that pre processing techniques are rarely used by researchers to select the most important climatic inputs in developing the ai based models however pre processing methods can be a great help in choosing the correct input variables to feed the ai models when estimating the et0 time series and they can therefore increase the modeling accuracy suitable methods with dependable accuracy are needed to estimate the et0 due to its importance in the hydrological and climatological studies the main goals of the present study are therefore as follows to 1 apply standalone gep and svr considering the climatic data and antecedent et0 data based scenarios 2 employ two different pre processing techniques namely τ kendall and entropy for recognizing the most influential climatic parameters to feed the models 3 propose a novel hybrid model via coupling the svr and intelligent water drops iwd 4 use the empirical equations including the hargreaves samani h s and priestley taylor p t in their original and calibrated versions to do these six stations located in iran were chosen as the study areas it is worthwhile to note that the application of τ kendall and entropy pre processing methods in order to determine most effective climatic parameters on et0 as well as implementing the hybrid svr iwd are the novelties of this work which have received less attention in previous works on estimating the et0 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used the present study considered six stations located in iran as the study areas three of the six selected stations i e arak mashhad shiraz include semi arid climate and the other three ones i e bandar abbas tehran yazd have the arid climate it is worthwhile to mention that the climates of the studied stations were determined using the climatic classification proposed by de martonne 1925 table 1 tabulates the geographical coordinates of the study locations besides the spatial distribution of the locations is shown in fig 1 the weather data needed to accomplish the current work consist of the monthly minimum air temperature tmin maximum air temperature tmax mean air temperature t wind speed at 2 m height u2 sunshine duration n and relative humidity rh for the period of january 1973 to december 2018 which were compiled from the iranian meteorological organization imo the monthly statistical features of the weather data comprising of the minimum maximum average and standard deviation are summarized in table 2 in this table rs represents the mean monthly solar radiation the angstrom prescott equation angstrom 1924 prescott 1940 i e eq 1 was used in this study to compute the rs data since the observed mean monthly rs data were not available at the studied sites 1 r s a b n n r a where r s r a n and n denote the solar radiation extraterrestrial radiation actual sunshine duration and maximum possible sunshine duration respectively additionally a and b represent the coefficients of the angstrom prescott equation which are as a 0 25 and b 0 5 it is better to note that the ra and n parameters can be computed using the julian day i e 1 for 1 january and 365 for 31 december and latitude of each location it is clear that the mean daily values of ra and n at each month were considered as the mean monthly ra and n whole the weather data were divided into two categories including the train and test datasets in the applications the first 432 data between january 1973 and december 2008 were used when training the models and the remaining data from january 2009 to december 2018 were used to test the applied models fig 2 graphically demonstrates the time series of monthly et0 at the study regions for the train and test phases 2 2 pre processing techniques selecting the appropriate and most effective inputs on the investigated problem i e et0 in the current study is always of special importance in order to better recognize the nature of the mechanism governing phenomenon therefore two pre processing approaches namely τ kendall and entropy were used to discern the most influential weather parameters in estimating et0 2 2 1 τ kendall correlation coefficient one of the commonly used methods to determine the dependence of hydrological parameters is to use the pearson s correlation coefficient this is a parametric technique and therefore its application requires the conditions that must be respected in the data set one of the most important assumptions is that the statistical distribution is normal which is not always true in the hydrological data in addition the presence of outlier data could affect the results of modeling to solve this problem the non parametric method of τ kendall correlation coefficient can be used non parametric methods are not sensitive to the distribution of data and the presence of outlier data and are therefore more consistent with the hydrological data mehdizadeh et al 2020a the τ kendall is a rank correlation coefficient and varies in the range of 1 1 for a random sample including n pair observations x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n the τ kendall estimator is calculated through the following equations mehdizadeh et al 2020a mirabbasi et al 2012 2 τ ˆ n 2 1 1 i j n sgn x i x j y i y j 3 sgn ψ 1 i f ψ 0 0 i f ψ 0 1 i f ψ 0 where i j 1 2 n and sgn is the sign function 2 2 2 shannon s entropy entropy is a concept in information theory that refers to the amount of information received from each message the concept of entropy was firstly proposed by boltzmann and was then used by shannon and weaver 1949 as a tool to express uncertainty the measurement of this uncertainty can be presented as follows shannon 2001 4 e j s p 1 p 2 p n k i 1 m p i l n p i i 1 m where k is a constant value it is also called p i probability distribution entropy since the above mentioned equation is usually applied in the statistical calculations when p i is equal to each other for the given values of i j mukhopadhyay and khan 2015 we have 5 p i 1 n in a decision matrix p ij can be used to evaluate different options for example m option and n criteria are considered in the below decision matrix saray et al 2020 6 d a 11 a 1 n a m 1 a m n the results of the above matrix for the j criterion p ij are as follows saray et al 2020 7 p i j a i j i 1 m r i j j 1 n i j then e j entropy can be calculated as below saray et al 2020 8 e j k i 1 m p i j l n p i j i j and k as a constant term is computed as follows saray et al 2020 9 k 1 l n m next the amount of d j degree of deviation is calculated which indicates the amount of useful information j available to the decision maker saray et al 2020 10 d j 1 e j j finally the value of w j is calculated in which the best weight is selected shannon 2001 11 w j d j i 1 n d j j 2 3 estimation models 2 3 1 gene expression programming gene expression programming gep was initially proposed by ferreira 2001 which is a combined technique of two methods consisting of genetic programming gp and genetic algorithm ga linear and simple chromosomes with constant length similar to the ga are combined with branch structures consisting of different sizes and shapes similar to parse trees in the gp to build the gep structure since in the gep all the branch structures with different shapes are encoded in linear chromosomes with constant length it is equivalent to the fact that the phenotype and genotype are separated and the system can therefore benefit from all the evolutionary benefits of their existence the phenotype in gep includes the same type of branch structures used in gp while the branch structures also called expression trees that are inferred by the gep indicate all the independent genomes in summary it can be said that improvements in gep occur in a linear structure and are then expressed as a tree structure this allows only the modified genome to be passed on to the next generation and there is no need for heavy structures to reproduce and mutate ferreira 2004 in gep each gene is encoded as an expression tree in the case of multi gene chromosomes all the expression trees are connected to each other from their root nodes using the linking function each gene consists of a coding region called orf open reading framework or k expression which is expressed as a tree after decoding and represents a candidate solution to the problem the most important advantage of the gep over other ai techniques is its potential to provide relationships related to the issues under consideration this issue distinguishes this method from other ai based models and can be used to understand the mathematical relationships between the output i e et0 in this study and inputs introduced to the model i e weather data and lagged et0 data for more detailed information about the various steps and the numerical values of parameters applied when using the gep please refer to mehdizadeh et al 2019a 2019b 2 3 2 support vector regression a support vector regression svr theory is based on the classification technique which applies a linear model to divide the main data into a feature space through a nonlinear mapping function vapnik 1998 this technique maximizes the boundary between the two opposing classes and minimizes the risk of a structure svr can also be used in the regression relationships the regression method used in svr is different from the usual regression methods moazenzadeh and mohammadi 2019 aghelpour et al 2019 in general in order to reduce the number of errors in the training phase this model uses non linear machines to find the most suitable hyper plane guan et al 2020 mohammadi and aghashariatmadari 2020 in this case the inputs are mostly non linear and after being mapped to a large scale feature space they correlate with the outputs linearly the nonlinear part of the svr is the recognition of kernel functions and the simplest form of this function is the linear kernel mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 other types of kernels include the polynomial gaussian radial basis function rbf and sigmoid in every problem a lot of experiments are conducted to select the appropriate kernel if a kernel could not separate the points it would have to do so until it was properly segmented with other kernels in this study the kernel function of rbf type was selected 2 3 3 intelligent water drops the intelligent water drops iwd is a population based optimization algorithm the iwd is an algorithm that works as a group and is inspired by nature this algorithm is originally used for combinatorial optimization but it can also be used for continuous optimization this algorithm was firstly proposed in 2007 by shah hosseini 2007 since then several researchers have sought to improve and apply this algorithm to a variety of problems the iwd algorithm is based on water droplets that flow in nature so that each drop makes an answer by traversing the spacecraft s space and changing the environment around it in nature countless water trains work together to build an optimal route to reach the destination in other words this is a collective intelligence based mechanism the iwd algorithm uses this mechanism to generate data from populations of water trains iwds used to build different routes to optimize routes or close to optimal gradually and overtime shah hosseini 2009a each drop of water iwd which initially represents a blank answer completes its answer by starting from the source and selecting points from its surroundings and adding them to its answer and along the way to the destination in this algorithm an iwd always prefers a path with less soil to a path with more soil each iwd carries some soil and given its speed after selecting the path moving from one point of the river to another some of the soil washes the path and adds to the soil it carries so that an iwd the faster the soil the more soil you will get in turn the iwd soil velocity needs to be borne by the effect of the amount of soil that travels so that an iwd in a path with less soil will increase the speed more than the path with more soil shah hosseini 2009b in order for the iwd algorithm to be able to solve various optimization problems in addition to the above mentioned natural rules soil is defined as a revelation function called hud this function actually calculates the amount of undesirable movement from one point of the path to another point of that path according to the goal of optimizing the problem therefore moving to a node with a less undesirable amount will wash more soil out of that path and vice versa therefore the appropriate answers for a specific problem will be in the dirtier routes and after a while the iwds will be able to choose the soil of the low dirt route which will be the optimal route fig 3 shows flowchart of iwd algorithm alijla et al 2014 2 3 4 hybrid svr iwd development the proposed method aims at improving performance of the classic svr model for simulating of et0 in a monthly scale the iwd algorithm is as the meta heuristic algorithm in order for boosting parameters of the membership functions of svr and weights between layers of this model in the proposed method the iwd algorithm is coupled on svr i e svr iwd and the iwd optimizes the rbf parameter functions in order to use the iwd for svr weight updates training svr as a function should be highlighted and the problem aims to optimize it in a n dimensional space in the weight optimization process the weights are randomly assigned initially the initial weights are changed and modified in each repetition as long as the difference of svr output and the output related to the actual inputs is less than a specified limit fig 4 schematically illustrates inputs output and modeling process of the proposed hybrid svr iwd model 2 4 empirical models used in the current study three different empirical models were used consisting of the penman monteith provided in food and agricultural organization no 56 known as fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 hargreaves samani known as h s hargreaves and samani 1985 and priestly taylor known as p t priestly and taylor 1972 they can be respectively formulated as follows 12 e t o 0 408 r n g 900 γ u 2 t 273 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 13 e t o 1 λ c h s r a t 17 8 t max t min 0 5 14 e t o c p t δ δ γ r n g λ where et 0 is the

u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 e s and e a are respectively the saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa λ is the latent heat of evaporation mj kg 1 δ illustrates the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa ºc 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa ºc 1 in addition c h s and c p t are the original coefficients of the h s and p t equations respectively which are c h s 0 0023 and c p t 1 26 the values of et0 time series calculated by the fao 56 pm equation were taken into consideration as the reference data to assess the performance of other techniques including the h s and p t empirical models standalone gep and svr as well as the hybrid svr iwd 2 5 performance evaluation statistics used the present study used three statistical metrics namely the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and co efficient of correlation r to measure the accuracy of all the applied models used i e the standalone gep and svr hybrid svr iwd and empirical models when estimating the et0 time series as below 15 r m s e i 1 n e t o i e t e i 2 n 16 m a e i 1 n e t o i e t e i n 17 r i 1 n e t o i e t o e t e i e t e i 1 n e t o i e t

applied estimation models n denotes the total observations separately for each train and test periods e t o and e t e illustrate the averages of the computed fao 56 pm and estimated reference evapotranspiration values respectively 3 results in this study two different scenarios consisting of the climatic data and antecedent et0 data based patterns were used for estimating the monthly et0 time series of the considered stations to do this various approaches were employed such as standalone gep and svr hybrid svr iwd and two different empirical models the performance of all the developed models was evaluated by means of the rmse mae and r statistical metrics two pre processing techniques including the τ kendall and entropy were initially applied to recognize the most effective climatic parameters on the monthly et0 in the τ kendall method a correlation is assigned to each of the influential climatic parameters while weights in percent between 0 and 100 are assigned to the effective parameters for the shannon entropy figs 5 and 6 schematically demonstrate the results of the applied pre processing approaches in terms of heat map among the climatic data the rs and air temperature parameters including the tmin tmax and t represent the highest τ kendall correlations for all the stations in other hands u2 had the least correlation with the et0 for most of the studied sites except for the bandar abbas station in which the rh illustrated the weakest τ kendall correlation for the case of entropy technique different results were achieved at the arak and mashhad stations u2 and followed by tmax provided the highest weights in addition tmin and t at shiraz tmin and u2 at bandar abbas tmin t and tmax at tehran tmin rh and t at yazd station are the most effective climatic parameters generally n parameter presents the least impact on the et0 process due to the lowest entropy weight after evaluating the impacts of climatic data on the et0 through the τ kendall and entropy techniques the most effective variables were selected as inputs of the ai models when estimating the monthly et0 in this regard the climatic parameters with the τ kendall correlations higher than 0 70 were used as the predictors in the τ kendall pre processing method for the case of the entropy approach the climatic parameters were chosen that could justify a total of about 70 of the et0 phenomenon the considered inputs predictors in both the applied pre processing techniques are tabulated in table 3 as an example at the bandar abbas station tmax t and rs in the τ kendall method as well as tmin tmax u2 and rs in the entropy method were employed as inputs to feed the ai models under the climatic data based scenarios the performance of the standalone gep and svr models under the climatic data based pattern in terms of the rmse mae and r is provided in the first sections of tables 4 9 as seen the monthly et0 time series of the stations could be estimated considering the inputs introduced by both the pre processing techniques besides the application of standalone gep and svr a novel hybrid model was implemented in this study through coupling the svr and an optimization approach named the iwd i e svr iwd the statistical results of the hybrid model are provided in the tables 4 9 as can be seen in the tables the hybrid svr iwd outperformed the classical svr at whole the study locations to estimate monthly et0 due to the lower values of rmse and mae as well as higher values for the r statistic best performing hybrid models at the studied stations during the test phase are svr iwd τ kendall at the arak svr iwd entropy at the mashhad svr iwd τ kendall at the shiraz svr iwd entropy at the bandar abbas svr iwd τ kendall at the tehran svr iwd τ kendall at the yazd the values of rmse mae and r statistical parameters for the mentioned best models under the climatic data based scenarios are visible in boldface in tables 4 9 as mentioned above this study also applied the antecedent et0 data based scenarios along with the climatic data based models in this context the et0 data from the previous one i e gep1 and svr1 to five months i e gep5 and svr5 were used for estimating the et0 of the current month the results of antecedent et0 data based scenarios in terms of the rmse mae and r are given in the second parts of tables 4 9 for whole the study sites the gep1 and svr1 illustrated the weakest performances besides the performance of standalone gep and svr models was generally increased with increasing the inputs i e from gep1 to gep5 and svr1 to svr5 similar to the climatic data based svr models the hybrid svr iwd was also developed for the lagged et0 data based scenarios to achieve this the best performing svr models at the studied locations were selected to implement the hybrid svr iwd the results showed that the proposed hybrid svr iwd performed better than the classical svr the optimal hybrid models in the test phase are the svr5 iwd at the arak rmse 0 404 mm d 1 mae 0 303 mm d 1 r 0 980 svr4 iwd at the mashhad rmse 0 540 mm d 1 mae 0 414 mm d 1 r 0 983 svr4 iwd at the shiraz rmse 0 299 mm d 1 mae 0 219 mm d 1 r 0 989 svr4 iwd at the bandar abbas rmse 0 457 mm d 1 mae 0 370 mm d 1 r 0 962 svr5 iwd at the tehran rmse 0 559 mm d 1 mae 0 446 mm d 1 r 0 978 svr4 iwd at the yazd rmse 0 399 mm d 1 mae 0 314 mm d 1 r 0 986 the mentioned statistical values in the lagged et0 data based scenarios are highlighted in boldface in tables 4 9 the rmse distribution of the whole of ai based models developed under the climatic and antecedent et0 data based models for the test stage in terms of radar diagrams is illustrated in fig 7 as seen gep1 and svr1 models which use 1 month antecedent et0 data demonstrate the worst performance in terms of highest rmse values at the whole of the studied stations furthermore the hybrid svr iwd τ kendall and svr iwd entropy models presented lower rmse values than the corresponding standalone models i e svr τ kendall and svr entropy indicating the reliable potential of proposed hybrid models for estimating the monthly et0 time series of the studied locations in addition to developing the standalone gep and svr as well as hybrid svr iwd models two types of the empirical models comprising of the h s and p t were also used when estimating the monthly et0 of the studied locations it is worthwhile to mention that the empirical equations were applied in their original and calibrated versions the results of empirical equations in terms of the statistical metrics including the rmse mae and r are summarized in table 10 additionally the values of calibrated coefficients of h s and p t equations i e ch s and cp t are given in table 11 as seen in this table the values of ch s at the semi arid stations including the arak mashhad and shiraz are lower than the original value 0 0023 and vice versa higher than the original amount for the bandar abbas tehran and yazd arid stations for the case of calibrated cp t they are totally higher than the original cp t value 1 26 at whole the study sites it can be clearly observed that calibrated versions of h s and p t equations presented better results than their original versions to estimate the monthly et0 which confirms the need for calibrating before their using in addition fig 8 depicts the distribution of rmse metric attained for the original and calibrated empirical models in the test period as clear the calibrated versions of empirical equations provide improved performances than their original forms here the performance of all the techniques used in this study is compared with each other regarding the gep models under climatic data based scenarios it can be said that τ kendall is a reliable tool to discern the most effective parameters except for the bandar abbas and tehran stations where gep entropy model outperformed the gep τ kendall for the case of climatic data based svr models svr entropy illustrated better results compared to the svr τ kendall models at the mashhad bandar abbas and train phase of arak station however the svr τ kendall showed superiority over the svr entropy at the shiraz tehran yazd and test phase of arak station moreover the hybrid svr iwd presented better performances than the corresponding standalone svr at whole the studied stations the best hybrid models under the climatic data based patterns are svr iwd entropy at the mashhad bandar abbas and train stage of the arak station for other cases the hybrid svr τ kendall is the best performing model in general the gep models implemented under the antecedent et0 data based scenarios slightly illustrated better statistics in comparison to the svr ones however the best et0 estimations under the mentioned scenarios were obtained through the hybrid svr iwd at whole the study sites regarding the capabilities of the standalone and hybrid models it can be concluded that the climatic data based models generally outperformed the antecedent et0 data based models among the original versions of the h s and p t table 10 the performance of original h s is better than the original p t except for the training phase of the arak and bandar abbas stations as well as test phase of the shiraz station where the original p t slightly performed better than the original h s furthermore the calibrated h s generally outperformed the calibrated p t at the studied stations to accurately estimate the monthly et0 the performance assessment of the standalone and hybrid ai based models with the empirical equations reveals that the ai based models generally demonstrated better results than the original versions of used empirical models on the other hand the calibrated versions of the h s and p t specifically the h s equation could be considered as the competitive models with the ai based approaches 4 discussion as noted two pre processing techniques used in this study including the τ kendall and entropy introduced different input combinations to estimate the monthly et0 as is apparent the air temperature parameters tmin tmax t and solar radiation rs as the effective parameters can affect the et0 process the τ kendall method is a correlation based pre processing technique so that it introduces the high correlated weather parameters with the et0 as the most influential parameters it can be seen from the table 3 that the aforementioned parameters are generally considered as the predictors at all the stations when estimating the et0 among the climatic parameters affecting the et0 process wind speed u2 is an important parameter that is not considered and then introduced as an effective parameter in the τ kendall approach this is due to the low τ kendall correlation values among the wind speed and evapotranspiration therefore it can be taken into consideration as one of the weaknesses of this technique on the other hand the entropy is a weight based pre processing technique it assigns a weight to each of the influential climatic parameters similar to the τ kendall method temperature components for all the stations and also solar radiation for 4 of the 6 stations are introduced as effective parameters applying the entropy approach the main difference among the two employed pre processing methods is non considering the wind speed via the τ kendall method and considering it through the entropy approach at 3 stations arak mashhad bandar abbas previous studies have also justified the importance of wind speed on the et0 phenomenon in this context mehdizadeh et al 2017b and citakoglu et al 2014 concluded that wind speed could present weakest results as the sole input in the ai models however the et0 modeling performance can be significantly improved considering the wind speed along with the other climatic data hence it is necessary to be considered its role in estimating the et0 by using the different methods the literature review illustrated that the pre processing techniques had been rarely used to determine effective climatic parameters when estimating the et0 recently mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 used four approaches as the pre processing methods including the principal component analysis correlation coefficient random forests and relief to estimate the daily et0 of three stations located in iran it was reported that various input combinations were proposed by applying each of the mentioned methods however the random forest and relief were the best and worst pre processing methods respectively it is recommended that the performance of mentioned approaches could be compared with the methods applied in this study i e τ kendall and entropy as mentioned the standalone gep and svr were applied as the ai based models in the current study the gep is an evolutionary technique that has the potential to present the mathematical algebraic equations representing the relationship between the inputs climatic data and output et0 this feature distinguishes the gep from the other ai models so that the algebraic equations presented by the gep can be used to estimate the et0 by having an access to the climatic data of each region the algebraic equations provided by the superior gep models during the test phase are shown in table 12 one of the chief aims of this study was to propose a novel approach by coupling the svr and iwd optimization technique namely the svr iwd the performance comparison of the standalone svr and hybrid svr iwd models demonstrated that the hybrid model performed better than the classical svr to estimate the monthly et0 of the studied stations it can be verified considering the fact that optimization algorithms like iwd can be used as a boosting tool for improving svr abilities in et0 estimation for this aim iwd makes update the svr weights and it helps to svr for finding optimal parameters in other words iwd improves svr training phase and then svr can reach a better result when estimating the et0 in addition for more justification about this issue and by attending to the previous works there are some researches as they proved abilities of the optimization techniques for coupling via estimator tools mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 proved ability of whale optimization algorithm coupled by svr for et0 estimating guan et al 2020 showed new approach for evaporation modeling by krill herd algorithm coupling via svr model mohammadi et al 2020 used multi verse optimizer and coupling it by ann for river streamflow modeling mehdizadeh et al 2020b applied gravitational search algorithm and ant colony optimization to improve the performance of an elman neural network for soil temperature modeling the reliable potential of both the optimization algorithms was concluded to increase the accuracy of standalone elman neural networks safari et al 2020 tested ability of invasive weed optimization algorithm coupled via adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for sediment transporting simulation and they shown suitable abilities of optimization techniques for coupling by estimator tools in hydrological molding studies furthermore as concluded calibrating the empirical equations improved the monthly et0 estimations than their original versions this confirms the significance of calibrating the empirical equations in each particular region before their applications the calibrated versions of the empirical equations can compete with the ai based models consisting of the standalone and hybrid ones for an accurate estimation of et0 they are simple to use and require less time compared to the ai based techniques while the ai models need to be firstly trained and then tested which is a time consuming procedure however the ai models especially the hybrid ones could illustrate higher accuracies than the empirical equations to precisely estimate the target et0 parameter 5 conclusions in this study the monthly et0 time series of six stations situated in iran were estimated for the period from 1973 to 2018 to that end three different methods were used comprising of the standalone models i e gep and svr a novel hybrid model i e svr iwd and empirical models in their original and calibrated versions i e h s and p t the standalone and hybrid models were implemented considering the climatic data and antecedent et0 data based scenarios additionally τ kendall and entropy pre processing approaches were applied for determining the most influential climatic parameters as inputs of the models under the climatic data based models the outcomes achieved in the present study can be summarized as follows the pre processing methods applied in this study proposed different input combinations as the predictors of the models at the studied stations in general air temperatures tmin tmax t and solar radiation rs were the most effective climatic data to estimate the et0 through both the τ kendall and entropy techniques generally the standalone gep slightly showed better results compared to the standalone svr under the antecedent et0 data based scenarios however various results were obtained in the climatic data based models so that the standalone gep outperformed the svr for some cases and vice versa for other cases as a general conclusion the proposed hybrid svr iwd performed the best for whole the studied locations under both the climatic data and antecedent et0 data based scenarios furthermore the climatic data based scenarios in the standalone and hybrid models presented higher accuracy in comparison to the antecedent et0 data based models the results of estimating monthly et0 through the empirical models demonstrated that the original h s generally showed lower error statistics than the original p t besides the calibration of empirical equations led to improve their performances similarly the calibrated h s showed better results compared to the calibrated p t this study recognized the effective climatic data to feed the models by using the τ kendall and entropy methods it is suggested that other pre processing methods could be of use in future works to determine the inputs of the models such as correlation analysis random forest principal component analysis etc when estimating the et0 time series moreover it is recommended that the novel hybrid model i e svr iwd could be used in hydrological studies to estimate the hydrological parameters time series including evaporation precipitation streamflow and so on a hybrid svr iwd model was developed in this study via coupling the svr and iwd further works could be accomplished in future works to propose other types of the hybrid models by means of coupling the ai based ann and anfis models with the diverse types of optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso fruit fly algorithm ffa shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla etc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10360,reference evapotranspiration et0 is one of the most important parameters which is required in many fields such as hydrological agricultural and climatological studies therefore its estimation via reliable and accurate techniques is a necessity the present study aims to estimate the monthly et0 time series of six stations located in iran to achieve this objective gene expression programming gep and support vector regression svr were used as standalone models a novel hybrid model was then introduced through coupling the classical svr with an optimization algorithm namely intelligent water drops iwd i e svr iwd two various types of scenarios were considered including the climatic data and antecedent et0 data based patterns in the climatic data based models the effective climatic

requirement etc is an essential task for optimizing water consumption irrigation planning and increasing water consumption efficiency güçlü et al 2017 gharbia et al 2018 adamala et al 2019 its computation for any particular crop is also required in many projects related to water resources irrigation and drainage agricultural water management etc direct measurement of this important parameter through the lysimeters is almost difficult time consuming and costly indirect measurements should be therefore taken into consideration practically reference evapotranspiration et0 is firstly computed and it is then converted to the etc by multiplying the et0 in crop coefficient kumar et al 2002 adamala et al 2019 various climatic data including temperature sunshine hours wind speed relative humidity etc are the most influential weather parameters on the rate of et0 adamala et al 2014 2019 mehdizadeh et al 2017a it can be therefore said that the evapotranspiration process includes a non linear and complex nature hence robust tools are needed to capture the et0 time series different approaches can be used to estimate the et0 comprising of the empirical models artificial intelligence ai techniques etc many empirical equations have been developed namely the temperature based mass transfer based and radiation based among them the popular penman monteith equation i e fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 is universally accepted as a reference approach to estimate the et0 and evaluate the performance of other models trajkovic 2009 valiantzas 2013 mossad and alazba 2016 güçlü et al 2017 mehdizadeh et al 2017b in recent years the application of ai models has been dramatically expanded to address issues in hydrology and water resources engineering gocić et al 2015 feng et al

support vector regression svr and so on in fact the gep is an advanced form of genetic programming which is initially proposed by ferreira 2001 the features of two techniques including genetic programming gp and genetic algorithm ga are merged in the gep svr is a popular technique for classification estimation regression and pattern recognition vapnik et al 1997 vapnik et al 1997 introduced svr for applying classification in the linear and non linear data set recently svr technique is used as a powerful tool for modeling of non linear systems such as evaporation moazenzadeh et al 2018 evapotranspiration mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 air temperature mehdizadeh 2018b aghelpour et al 2019 and streamflow tikhamarine et al 2019 in addition to the standalone ai models the hybrid models can also be developed indeed the aim of implementing the hybrid models is to improve the performance of standalone models when estimating the target parameter i e et0 in this study recently bio inspired optimization algorithms have received significant attention to develop the hybrid models in hydrological studies such as estimating the et0 literature review shows the ability of optimization algorithms as a boosting tool for predictor models like svr intelligent water drops iwd is an evolutionary and population based algorithm based on the mechanism of water droplets in rivers that encounter many obstacles to reach lakes and oceans but eventually find their way to their destination they are inspired recently iwd has tested in different applied engineering fields as an optimizer tool kamkar et al 2010 alijla et al 2014 hendrawan and murase 2011 hoang et al 2012 and it has also shown well performance in comparison with other nature inspired optimization algorithms shah hosseini 2007 2009a 2009b here some of the previous works published in literature on the et0 modeling are briefly reviewed the modeling performance of extreme learning machine elm was investigated by abdullah et al 2015 for modeling the et0 of three weather stations located in iraq the results illustrated that the elm provided better results than the feed forward back propagation ffbp kisi 2016 assessed the modeling performance of least square support vector machine lssvm multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and m5tree models in modeling the monthly et0 of two stations in turkey two data analysis approaches were considered namely the local and external methods the mars and m5 tree techniques illustrated superior performances in the local and external conditions respectively mehdizadeh 2018a applied the mars and gep approaches for estimating the daily et0 at six weather stations in iran and was found that the mars performed the best for the whole of the studied stations kisi and alizamir 2018 modeled the daily et0 time series of the ankara and kirikkale turkey they developed a hybrid model via coupling the wavelet w with the elm i e welm and then compared its performance with wavelet artificial neural networks i e wann standalone elm online sequential elm and standalone ann it was reported that the proposed welm performed the best a new machine learning model was proposed by fan et al 2019 named light gradient boosting machine lgbm for modeling the daily et0 of 49 meteorological stations located in china its performance was also compared with the m5tree random forests rf and four empirical models the lgbm was found to be the best model a comparative study was performed by saggi and jain 2019 to assess the performance of deep learning dl rf gradient boosting machine gbm and generalized linear model glm in daily et0 modeling of two stations located in india it was concluded that the dl showed superiority over the other models used huang et al 2019 evaluated the modeling accuracy of catboost svm and rf to estimate the daily et0 at 12 meteorological stations in china they reported that the svm and catboost models were the best models under the limited and full access to the climatic data respectively the gep and rf models were employed by wang et al 2019 to estimate daily et0 at 24 weather stations china the authors reported the reliable potential of both the mentioned methods malik et al 2019 investigated the applicability of co active neuro fuzzy inference system canfis for monthly et0 prediction of two stations located in india they concluded that the canfis presented reliable et0 estimates compared to the other applied ai techniques tikhamarine et al 2019 proposed five hybrid models through hybridizing the ann and five different types of optimization algorithms for modeling the monthly et0 of two sites in india and algeria the hybrid model of ann coupled with gray wolf optimizer i e ann gwo was found to perform the best del cerro et al 2020 compared the potential of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and some empirical equations for modeling the daily et0 of south india and reported the better performance of anfis than the empirical models the daily et0 time series at southeastern australia were estimated by shi et al 2020 using the rf and empirical models the rf was found to illustrate better results than the empirical equations used ferreira and da cunha 2020 proposed a novel method including the convolutional neural networks cnn for the daily et0 modeling of 53 locations in brazil its modeling performance was also compared with other techniques namely rf xgboost and ann the results revealed the higher accuracy of proposed cnn than the other models tikhamarine et al 2020 applied three various optimization algorithms to improve the accuracy of svr in modeling monthly et0 of three sites at algeria superior performance of the hybrid models than the standalone svr was reported by the authors heddam et al 2020 proposed two types of elm including optimally pruned elm opelm and online sequential elm oselm to predict daily et0 of a mediterranean region located in algeria they found out that the opelm outperformed the oselm the overall outcomes of literature review as mentioned above confirmed the reliable potential of ai models to capturing the et0 time series on various time scales on the other hand our literature review illustrated that pre processing techniques are rarely used by researchers to select the most important climatic inputs in developing the ai based models however pre processing methods can be a great help in choosing the correct input variables to feed the ai models when estimating the et0 time series and they can therefore increase the modeling accuracy suitable methods with dependable accuracy are needed to estimate the et0 due to its importance in the hydrological and climatological studies the main goals of the present study are therefore as follows to 1 apply standalone gep and svr considering the climatic data and antecedent et0 data based scenarios 2 employ two different pre processing techniques namely τ kendall and entropy for recognizing the most influential climatic parameters to feed the models 3 propose a novel hybrid model via coupling the svr and intelligent water drops iwd 4 use the empirical equations including the hargreaves samani h s and priestley taylor p t in their original and calibrated versions to do these six stations located in iran were chosen as the study areas it is worthwhile to note that the application of τ kendall and entropy pre processing methods in order to determine most effective climatic parameters on et0 as well as implementing the hybrid svr iwd are the novelties of this work which have received less attention in previous works on estimating the et0 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used the present study considered six stations located in iran as the study areas three of the six selected stations i e arak mashhad shiraz include semi arid climate and the other three ones i e bandar abbas tehran yazd have the arid climate it is worthwhile to mention that the climates of the studied stations were determined using the climatic classification proposed by de martonne 1925 table 1 tabulates the geographical coordinates of the study locations besides the spatial distribution of the locations is shown in fig 1 the weather data needed to accomplish the current work consist of the monthly minimum air temperature tmin maximum air temperature tmax mean air temperature t wind speed at 2 m height u2 sunshine duration n and relative humidity rh for the period of january 1973 to december 2018 which were compiled from the iranian meteorological organization imo the monthly statistical features of the weather data comprising of the minimum maximum average and standard deviation are summarized in table 2 in this table rs represents the mean monthly solar radiation the angstrom prescott equation angstrom 1924 prescott 1940 i e eq 1 was used in this study to compute the rs data since the observed mean monthly rs data were not available at the studied sites 1 r s a b n n r a where r s r a n and n denote the solar radiation extraterrestrial radiation actual sunshine duration and maximum possible sunshine duration respectively additionally a and b represent the coefficients of the angstrom prescott equation which are as a 0 25 and b 0 5 it is better to note that the ra and n parameters can be computed using the julian day i e 1 for 1 january and 365 for 31 december and latitude of each location it is clear that the mean daily values of ra and n at each month were considered as the mean monthly ra and n whole the weather data were divided into two categories including the train and test datasets in the applications the first 432 data between january 1973 and december 2008 were used when training the models and the remaining data from january 2009 to december 2018 were used to test the applied models fig 2 graphically demonstrates the time series of monthly et0 at the study regions for the train and test phases 2 2 pre processing techniques selecting the appropriate and most effective inputs on the investigated problem i e et0 in the current study is always of special importance in order to better recognize the nature of the mechanism governing phenomenon therefore two pre processing approaches namely τ kendall and entropy were used to discern the most influential weather parameters in estimating et0 2 2 1 τ kendall correlation coefficient one of the commonly used methods to determine the dependence of hydrological parameters is to use the pearson s correlation coefficient this is a parametric technique and therefore its application requires the conditions that must be respected in the data set one of the most important assumptions is that the statistical distribution is normal which is not always true in the hydrological data in addition the presence of outlier data could affect the results of modeling to solve this problem the non parametric method of τ kendall correlation coefficient can be used non parametric methods are not sensitive to the distribution of data and the presence of outlier data and are therefore more consistent with the hydrological data mehdizadeh et al 2020a the τ kendall is a rank correlation coefficient and varies in the range of 1 1 for a random sample including n pair observations x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n the τ kendall estimator is calculated through the following equations mehdizadeh et al 2020a mirabbasi et al 2012 2 τ ˆ n 2 1 1 i j n sgn x i x j y i y j 3 sgn ψ 1 i f ψ 0 0 i f ψ 0 1 i f ψ 0 where i j 1 2 n and sgn is the sign function 2 2 2 shannon s entropy entropy is a concept in information theory that refers to the amount of information received from each message the concept of entropy was firstly proposed by boltzmann and was then used by shannon and weaver 1949 as a tool to express uncertainty the measurement of this uncertainty can be presented as follows shannon 2001 4 e j s p 1 p 2 p n k i 1 m p i l n p i i 1 m where k is a constant value it is also called p i probability distribution entropy since the above mentioned equation is usually applied in the statistical calculations when p i is equal to each other for the given values of i j mukhopadhyay and khan 2015 we have 5 p i 1 n in a decision matrix p ij can be used to evaluate different options for example m option and n criteria are considered in the below decision matrix saray et al 2020 6 d a 11 a 1 n a m 1 a m n the results of the above matrix for the j criterion p ij are as follows saray et al 2020 7 p i j a i j i 1 m r i j j 1 n i j then e j entropy can be calculated as below saray et al 2020 8 e j k i 1 m p i j l n p i j i j and k as a constant term is computed as follows saray et al 2020 9 k 1 l n m next the amount of d j degree of deviation is calculated which indicates the amount of useful information j available to the decision maker saray et al 2020 10 d j 1 e j j finally the value of w j is calculated in which the best weight is selected shannon 2001 11 w j d j i 1 n d j j 2 3 estimation models 2 3 1 gene expression programming gene expression programming gep was initially proposed by ferreira 2001 which is a combined technique of two methods consisting of genetic programming gp and genetic algorithm ga linear and simple chromosomes with constant length similar to the ga are combined with branch structures consisting of different sizes and shapes similar to parse trees in the gp to build the gep structure since in the gep all the branch structures with different shapes are encoded in linear chromosomes with constant length it is equivalent to the fact that the phenotype and genotype are separated and the system can therefore benefit from all the evolutionary benefits of their existence the phenotype in gep includes the same type of branch structures used in gp while the branch structures also called expression trees that are inferred by the gep indicate all the independent genomes in summary it can be said that improvements in gep occur in a linear structure and are then expressed as a tree structure this allows only the modified genome to be passed on to the next generation and there is no need for heavy structures to reproduce and mutate ferreira 2004 in gep each gene is encoded as an expression tree in the case of multi gene chromosomes all the expression trees are connected to each other from their root nodes using the linking function each gene consists of a coding region called orf open reading framework or k expression which is expressed as a tree after decoding and represents a candidate solution to the problem the most important advantage of the gep over other ai techniques is its potential to provide relationships related to the issues under consideration this issue distinguishes this method from other ai based models and can be used to understand the mathematical relationships between the output i e et0 in this study and inputs introduced to the model i e weather data and lagged et0 data for more detailed information about the various steps and the numerical values of parameters applied when using the gep please refer to mehdizadeh et al 2019a 2019b 2 3 2 support vector regression a support vector regression svr theory is based on the classification technique which applies a linear model to divide the main data into a feature space through a nonlinear mapping function vapnik 1998 this technique maximizes the boundary between the two opposing classes and minimizes the risk of a structure svr can also be used in the regression relationships the regression method used in svr is different from the usual regression methods moazenzadeh and mohammadi 2019 aghelpour et al 2019 in general in order to reduce the number of errors in the training phase this model uses non linear machines to find the most suitable hyper plane guan et al 2020 mohammadi and aghashariatmadari 2020 in this case the inputs are mostly non linear and after being mapped to a large scale feature space they correlate with the outputs linearly the nonlinear part of the svr is the recognition of kernel functions and the simplest form of this function is the linear kernel mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 other types of kernels include the polynomial gaussian radial basis function rbf and sigmoid in every problem a lot of experiments are conducted to select the appropriate kernel if a kernel could not separate the points it would have to do so until it was properly segmented with other kernels in this study the kernel function of rbf type was selected 2 3 3 intelligent water drops the intelligent water drops iwd is a population based optimization algorithm the iwd is an algorithm that works as a group and is inspired by nature this algorithm is originally used for combinatorial optimization but it can also be used for continuous optimization this algorithm was firstly proposed in 2007 by shah hosseini 2007 since then several researchers have sought to improve and apply this algorithm to a variety of problems the iwd algorithm is based on water droplets that flow in nature so that each drop makes an answer by traversing the spacecraft s space and changing the environment around it in nature countless water trains work together to build an optimal route to reach the destination in other words this is a collective intelligence based mechanism the iwd algorithm uses this mechanism to generate data from populations of water trains iwds used to build different routes to optimize routes or close to optimal gradually and overtime shah hosseini 2009a each drop of water iwd which initially represents a blank answer completes its answer by starting from the source and selecting points from its surroundings and adding them to its answer and along the way to the destination in this algorithm an iwd always prefers a path with less soil to a path with more soil each iwd carries some soil and given its speed after selecting the path moving from one point of the river to another some of the soil washes the path and adds to the soil it carries so that an iwd the faster the soil the more soil you will get in turn the iwd soil velocity needs to be borne by the effect of the amount of soil that travels so that an iwd in a path with less soil will increase the speed more than the path with more soil shah hosseini 2009b in order for the iwd algorithm to be able to solve various optimization problems in addition to the above mentioned natural rules soil is defined as a revelation function called hud this function actually calculates the amount of undesirable movement from one point of the path to another point of that path according to the goal of optimizing the problem therefore moving to a node with a less undesirable amount will wash more soil out of that path and vice versa therefore the appropriate answers for a specific problem will be in the dirtier routes and after a while the iwds will be able to choose the soil of the low dirt route which will be the optimal route fig 3 shows flowchart of iwd algorithm alijla et al 2014 2 3 4 hybrid svr iwd development the proposed method aims at improving performance of the classic svr model for simulating of et0 in a monthly scale the iwd algorithm is as the meta heuristic algorithm in order for boosting parameters of the membership functions of svr and weights between layers of this model in the proposed method the iwd algorithm is coupled on svr i e svr iwd and the iwd optimizes the rbf parameter functions in order to use the iwd for svr weight updates training svr as a function should be highlighted and the problem aims to optimize it in a n dimensional space in the weight optimization process the weights are randomly assigned initially the initial weights are changed and modified in each repetition as long as the difference of svr output and the output related to the actual inputs is less than a specified limit fig 4 schematically illustrates inputs output and modeling process of the proposed hybrid svr iwd model 2 4 empirical models used in the current study three different empirical models were used consisting of the penman monteith provided in food and agricultural organization no 56 known as fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 hargreaves samani known as h s hargreaves and samani 1985 and priestly taylor known as p t priestly and taylor 1972 they

respectively which are c h s 0 0023 and c p t 1 26 the values of et0 time series calculated by the fao 56 pm equation were taken into consideration as the reference data to assess the performance of other techniques including the h s and p t empirical models standalone gep and svr as well as the hybrid svr iwd 2 5 performance evaluation statistics used the present study used three statistical metrics namely the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and co efficient of correlation r to measure the accuracy of all the applied models used i e the standalone gep and svr hybrid

time series of the considered stations to do this various approaches were employed such as standalone gep and svr hybrid svr iwd and two different empirical models the performance of all the developed models was evaluated by means of the rmse mae and r statistical metrics two pre processing techniques including the τ kendall and entropy were initially applied to recognize the most effective climatic parameters on the monthly et0 in the τ kendall method a correlation is assigned to each of the influential climatic parameters while weights in percent between 0 and 100 are assigned to the effective parameters for the shannon entropy figs 5 and 6 schematically demonstrate the results of the applied pre processing approaches in terms of heat map among the climatic data the rs and air temperature parameters including the tmin tmax and t represent the highest τ kendall correlations for all the stations in other hands u2 had the least correlation with the et0 for most of the studied sites except for the bandar abbas station in which the rh illustrated the weakest τ kendall correlation for the case of entropy technique different results were achieved at the arak and mashhad stations u2 and followed by tmax provided the highest weights in addition tmin and t at shiraz tmin and u2 at bandar abbas tmin t and tmax at tehran tmin rh and t at yazd station are the most effective climatic parameters generally n parameter presents the least impact on the et0 process due to the lowest entropy weight after evaluating the impacts of climatic data on the et0 through the τ kendall and entropy techniques the most effective variables were selected as inputs of the ai models when estimating the monthly et0 in this regard the climatic parameters with the τ kendall correlations higher than 0 70 were used as the predictors in the τ kendall pre processing method for the case of the entropy approach the climatic parameters were chosen that could justify a total of about 70 of the et0 phenomenon the considered inputs predictors in both the applied pre processing techniques are tabulated in table 3 as an example at the bandar abbas station tmax t and rs in the τ kendall method as well as tmin tmax u2 and rs in the entropy method were employed as inputs to feed the ai models under the climatic data based scenarios the performance of the standalone gep and svr models under the climatic data based pattern in terms of the rmse mae and r is provided in the first sections of tables 4 9 as seen the monthly et0 time series of the stations could be estimated considering the inputs introduced by both the pre processing techniques besides the application of standalone gep and svr a novel hybrid model was implemented in this study through coupling the svr and an optimization approach named the iwd i e svr iwd the statistical results of the hybrid model are provided in the tables 4 9 as can be seen in the tables the hybrid svr iwd outperformed the classical svr at whole the study locations to estimate monthly et0 due to the lower values of rmse and mae as well as higher values for the r statistic best performing hybrid models at the studied stations during the test phase are svr iwd τ kendall at the arak svr iwd entropy at the mashhad svr iwd τ kendall at the shiraz svr iwd entropy at the bandar abbas svr iwd τ kendall at the tehran svr iwd τ kendall at the yazd the values of rmse mae and r statistical parameters for the mentioned best models under the climatic data based scenarios are visible in boldface in tables 4 9 as mentioned above this study also applied the antecedent et0 data based scenarios along with the climatic data based models in this context the et0 data from the previous one i e gep1 and svr1 to five months i e gep5 and svr5 were used for estimating the et0 of the current month the results of antecedent et0 data based scenarios in terms of the rmse mae and r are given in the second parts of tables 4 9 for whole the study sites the gep1 and svr1 illustrated the weakest performances besides the performance of standalone gep and svr models was generally increased with increasing the inputs i e from gep1 to gep5 and svr1 to svr5 similar to the climatic data based svr models the hybrid svr iwd was also developed for the lagged et0 data based scenarios to achieve this the best performing svr models at the studied locations were selected to implement the hybrid svr iwd the results showed that the proposed hybrid svr iwd performed better than the classical svr the optimal hybrid models in the test phase are the svr5 iwd at the arak rmse 0 404 mm d 1 mae 0 303 mm d 1 r 0 980 svr4 iwd at the mashhad rmse 0 540 mm d 1 mae 0 414 mm d 1 r 0 983 svr4 iwd at the shiraz rmse 0 299 mm d 1 mae 0 219 mm d

d 1 r 0 986 the mentioned statistical values in the lagged et0 data based scenarios are highlighted in boldface in tables 4 9 the rmse distribution of the whole of ai based models developed under the climatic and antecedent et0 data based models for the test stage in terms of radar diagrams is illustrated in fig 7 as seen gep1 and svr1 models which use 1 month antecedent et0 data demonstrate the worst performance in terms of highest rmse values at the whole of the studied stations furthermore the hybrid svr iwd τ kendall and svr iwd entropy models presented lower rmse values than the corresponding standalone models i e svr τ kendall and svr entropy indicating the reliable potential of proposed hybrid models for estimating the monthly et0 time series of the studied locations in addition to developing the standalone gep and svr as well as hybrid svr iwd models two types of the empirical models comprising of the h s and p t were also used when estimating the monthly et0 of the studied locations it is worthwhile to mention that the empirical equations were applied in their original and calibrated versions the results of empirical equations in terms of the statistical metrics including the rmse mae and r are summarized in table 10 additionally the values of calibrated coefficients of h s and p t equations i e ch s and cp t are given in table 11 as seen in this table the values of ch s at the semi arid stations including the arak mashhad and shiraz are lower than the original value 0 0023 and vice versa higher than the original amount for the bandar abbas tehran and yazd arid stations for the case of calibrated cp t they are totally higher than the original cp t value 1 26 at whole the study sites it can be clearly observed that calibrated versions of h s and p t equations presented better results than their original versions to estimate the monthly et0 which confirms the need for calibrating before their using in addition fig 8 depicts the distribution of rmse metric attained for the original and calibrated empirical models in the test period as clear the calibrated versions of empirical equations provide improved performances than their original forms here the performance of all the techniques used in this study is compared with each other regarding the gep models under climatic data based scenarios it can be said that τ kendall is a reliable tool to discern the most effective parameters except for the bandar abbas and tehran stations where gep entropy model outperformed the gep τ kendall for the case of climatic data based svr models svr entropy illustrated better results compared to the svr τ kendall models at the mashhad bandar abbas and train phase of arak station however the svr τ kendall showed superiority over the svr entropy at the shiraz tehran yazd and test phase of arak station moreover the hybrid svr iwd presented better performances than the corresponding standalone svr at whole the studied stations the best hybrid models under the climatic data based patterns are svr iwd entropy at the mashhad bandar abbas and train stage of the arak station for other cases the hybrid svr τ kendall is the best performing model in general the gep models implemented under the antecedent et0 data based scenarios slightly illustrated better statistics in comparison to the svr ones however the best et0 estimations under the mentioned scenarios were obtained through the hybrid svr iwd at whole the study sites regarding the capabilities of the standalone and hybrid models it can be concluded that the climatic data based models generally outperformed the antecedent et0 data based models among the original versions of the h s and p t table 10 the performance of original h s is better than the original p t except for the training phase of the arak and bandar abbas stations as well as test phase of the shiraz station where the original p t slightly performed better than the original h s furthermore the calibrated h s generally outperformed the calibrated p t at the studied stations to accurately estimate the monthly et0 the performance assessment of the standalone and hybrid ai based models with the empirical equations reveals that the ai based models generally demonstrated better results than the original versions of used empirical models on the other hand the calibrated versions of the h s and p t specifically the h s equation could be considered as the competitive models with the ai based approaches 4 discussion as noted two pre processing techniques used in this study including the τ kendall and entropy introduced different input combinations to estimate the monthly et0 as is apparent the air temperature parameters tmin tmax t and solar radiation rs as the effective parameters can affect the et0 process the τ kendall method is a correlation based pre processing technique so that it introduces the high correlated weather parameters with the et0 as the most influential parameters it can be seen from the table 3 that the aforementioned parameters are generally considered as the predictors at all the stations when estimating the et0 among the climatic parameters affecting the et0 process wind speed u2 is an important parameter that is not considered and then introduced as an effective parameter in the τ kendall approach this is due to the low τ kendall correlation values among the wind speed and evapotranspiration therefore it can be taken into consideration as one of the weaknesses of this technique on the other hand the entropy is a weight based pre processing technique it assigns a weight to each of the influential climatic parameters similar to the τ kendall method temperature components for all the stations and also solar radiation for 4 of the 6 stations are introduced as effective parameters applying the entropy approach the main difference among the two employed pre processing methods is non considering the wind speed via the τ kendall method and considering it through the entropy approach at 3 stations arak mashhad bandar abbas previous studies have also justified the importance of wind speed on the et0 phenomenon in this context mehdizadeh et al 2017b and citakoglu et al 2014 concluded that wind speed could present weakest results as the sole input in the ai models however the et0 modeling performance can be significantly improved considering the wind speed along with the other climatic data hence it is necessary to be considered its role in estimating the et0 by using the different methods the literature review illustrated that the pre processing techniques had been rarely used to determine effective climatic parameters when estimating the et0 recently mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 used four approaches as the pre processing methods including the principal component analysis correlation coefficient random forests and relief to estimate the daily et0 of three stations located in iran it was reported that various input combinations were proposed by applying each of the mentioned methods however the random forest and relief were the best and worst pre processing methods respectively it is recommended that the performance of mentioned approaches could be compared with the methods applied in this study i e τ kendall and entropy as mentioned the standalone gep and svr were applied as the ai based models in the current study the gep is an evolutionary technique that has the potential to present the mathematical algebraic equations representing the relationship between the inputs climatic data and output et0 this feature distinguishes the gep from the other ai models so that the algebraic equations presented by the gep can be used to estimate the et0 by having an access to the climatic data of each region the algebraic equations provided by the superior gep models during the test phase are shown in table 12 one of the chief aims of this study was to propose a novel approach by coupling the svr and iwd optimization technique namely the svr iwd the performance comparison of the standalone svr and hybrid svr iwd models demonstrated that the hybrid model performed better than the classical svr to estimate the monthly et0 of the studied stations it can be verified considering the fact that optimization algorithms like iwd can be used as a boosting tool for improving svr abilities in et0 estimation for this aim iwd makes update the svr weights and it helps to svr for finding optimal parameters in other words iwd improves svr training phase and then svr can reach a better result when estimating the et0 in addition for more justification about this issue and by attending to the previous works there are some researches as they proved abilities of the optimization techniques for coupling via estimator tools mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 proved ability of whale optimization algorithm coupled by svr for et0 estimating guan et al 2020 showed new approach for evaporation modeling by krill herd algorithm coupling via svr model mohammadi et al 2020 used multi verse optimizer and coupling it by ann for river streamflow modeling mehdizadeh et al 2020b applied gravitational search algorithm and ant colony optimization to improve the performance of an elman neural network for soil temperature modeling the reliable potential of both the optimization algorithms was concluded to increase the accuracy of standalone elman neural networks safari et al 2020 tested ability of invasive weed optimization algorithm coupled via adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for sediment transporting simulation and they shown suitable abilities of optimization techniques for coupling by estimator tools in hydrological molding studies furthermore as concluded calibrating the empirical equations improved the monthly et0 estimations than their original versions this confirms the significance of calibrating the empirical equations in each particular region before their applications the calibrated versions of the empirical equations can compete with the ai based models consisting of the standalone and hybrid ones for an accurate estimation of et0 they are simple to use and require less time compared to the ai based techniques while the ai models need to be firstly trained and then tested which is a time consuming procedure however the ai models especially the hybrid ones could illustrate higher accuracies than the empirical equations to precisely estimate the target et0 parameter 5 conclusions in this study the monthly et0 time series of six stations situated in iran were estimated for the period from 1973 to 2018 to that end three different methods were used comprising of the standalone models i e gep and svr a novel hybrid model i e svr iwd and empirical models in their original and calibrated versions i e h s and p t the standalone and hybrid models were implemented considering the climatic data and antecedent et0 data based scenarios additionally τ kendall and entropy pre processing approaches were applied for determining the most influential climatic parameters as inputs of the models under the climatic data based models the outcomes achieved in the present study can be summarized as follows the pre processing methods applied in this study proposed different input combinations as the predictors of the models at the studied stations in general air temperatures tmin tmax t and solar radiation rs were the most effective climatic data to estimate the et0 through both the τ kendall and entropy techniques generally the standalone gep slightly showed better results compared to the standalone svr under the antecedent et0 data based scenarios however various results were obtained in the climatic data based models so that the standalone gep outperformed the svr for some cases and vice versa for other cases as a general conclusion the proposed hybrid svr iwd performed the best for whole the studied locations under both the climatic data and antecedent et0 data based scenarios furthermore the climatic data based scenarios in the standalone and hybrid models presented higher accuracy in comparison to the antecedent et0 data based models the results of estimating monthly et0 through the empirical models demonstrated that the original h s generally showed lower error statistics than the original p t besides the calibration of empirical equations led to improve their performances similarly the calibrated h s showed better results compared to the calibrated p t this study recognized the effective climatic data to feed the models by using the τ kendall and entropy methods it is suggested that other pre processing methods could be of use in future works to determine the inputs of the models such as correlation analysis random forest principal component analysis etc when estimating the et0 time series moreover it is recommended that the novel hybrid model i e svr iwd could be used in hydrological studies to estimate the hydrological parameters time series including evaporation precipitation streamflow and so on a hybrid svr iwd model was developed in this study via coupling the svr and iwd further works could be accomplished in future works to propose other types of the hybrid models by means of coupling the ai based ann and anfis models with the diverse types of optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso fruit fly algorithm ffa shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla etc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10361,water availability is a major constraint for crop production in the loess plateau of china thus improving water use efficiency wue is a main research target the impact of alfalfa medicago sativa l growing age on forage yield wue soil water storage and soil fertility were examined in a 15 yr study in the western loess plateau of china the results of this study indicate that long term continuous production of alfalfa aggravated the soil water deficit and reduced soil available phosphorus ap and the ratio of soil organic carbon to soil total nitrogen but increased soil organic carbon soil total nitrogen and the ratios of soil organic carbon to soil available phosphorus and soil total nitrogen to soil total phosphorus after the ninth year of alfalfa production the greatest soil water storage deficit degree was found in the 0 80 cm soil layer 63 followed by the 200 300 57 and 80 200 cm 55 soil layers forage yield and wue of alfalfa reached their greatest values following six to nine yr old stands and then decreased gradually these results suggest that the yield decline with long term stands of alfalfa may be related to reductions in soil water storage and ap and their interaction and the optimal alfalfa growing age should not extend beyond nine years in semiarid conditions keywords alfalfa growing age forage yield water use efficiency soil fertility 1 introduction the shortage of soil water seriously restricts crop yield in arid and semiarid environments all over the planet including the loess plateau of china fan et al 2010 the loess plateau of china is characterized by an extremely hilly loess landscape and a harsh climatic condition including erratic rainfall frequent drought and severe wind and water erosion liu et al 2013 in 1998 the chinese government implemented a program to reduce soil erosion and optimize continuous use of land resources the program entitled the grain to green works to convert cropland on steep slopes to forest and perennial vegetation by providing farmers with grain as well as cash subsidies fan et al 2010 alfalfa medicago sativa l a deep rooted perennial forage legume has been grown in crop rotation systems in the loess plateau of china for more than 2000 years and used as feed for livestock li and huang 2008 due to its high herbage yield and protein concentration tolerance to drought and cold and ability to protect against soil erosion alfalfa has become the preferred species for returning farmland to perennial vegetation in the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau fan et al 2010 fan et al 2014 li et al 2002 li and huang 2008 thus alfalfa plays an extremely important role in the fragile ecological restoration the alfalfa production area has gradually increased to meet demand for an increasing livestock population and to prevent soil erosion in this region fan et al 2010 fan et al 2014 fan et al 2016 li et al 2002 alfalfa has high evapotranspiration et compared to annual forage and grain crops because of the high forage yield and deep root distribution crawford and macfarlane 1995 li et al 2002 scott and sudmeyer 1993 continuous production of alfalfa can cause severe soil water deficit and soil desiccation over time in arid regions fan et al 2010 2014 huang et al 2018 jiang et al 2006 li and huang 2008 and depletion of shallow groundwater zheng et al 2012 previous research indicates that alfalfa can increase soil water consumption at least 50 mm compared to annual forage and grain crops during growing season latta et al 2001 li and huang 2008 ridley et al 2001 alfalfa growing age has significant inﬂuence on its aboveground productivity and belowground soil water storage it is feasible to restore soil water after long term alfalfa production jia et al 2006 2009 fan et al 2010 found that the depletion of soil water following a five year old stand of alfalfa was 200 mm greater compared to initial soil water storage wang et al 2012 reported that when the age of alfalfa stands reached 10 yr desiccation of the 0 6 m soil layer reached an extreme degree and restoration of soil water was difficult soil water storage and forage yield of alfalfa gradually degrade with time in drought regions ren et al 2011 li and huang 2008 reported that alfalfa yield decreased by 0 629 mg ha 1 yr 1 in semiarid regions and proposed that other factors besides insufficient soil water may be contributing to the decrease of forage yield in long term cultivation of alfalfa luo et al 2015 found that alfalfa yield peaked in the eighth to ninth year and then began to decline due to severe depletion of soil water storage in the western loess plateau soil fertility is a key factor determining alfalfa productivity fan et al 2016 jia et al 2009 many studies have shown that soil fertility is influenced by the introduction of forage legumes into cropping systems jia et al 2006 jiang et al 2006 wu et al 2003 alfalfa stand age has been shown to affect the ratios of soil organic carbon to soil total nitrogen c n and soil organic carbon to soil available phosphorus c p jia et al 2006 jiang et al 2006 considering all of the above factors we speculate that decreased yield in long term alfalfa production is due to the interaction of soil water and soil fertility proper use of soil water and nutrients is fundamental for the sustainability of agriculture especially in arid and semiarid regions to avoid a severe depletion of soil water and maintain high land productivity it is essential to determine the best cultivation ages for alfalfa based on the trade offs between alfalfa yield and soil water storage and soil fertility in water limited regions therefore the aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of soil water storage deficits and soil fertility under continuous alfalfa production it was hypothesized that alfalfa forage yield would decline after several years of production due to a reduction in soil water storage and changes in soil fertility 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site a long term field experiment was conducted from april 2003 until october 2017 at the rainfed agricultural experimental station of gansu

the long term average 1970 2003 compared with the long term average annual precipitation was similar in the 2003 2008 and 2012 seasons normal but was 49 81 mm greater in the 2004 2005 2009 2011 and 2013 seasons wet and 30 100 mm less in the 2006 2007 2010 and 2014 2017 seasons dry soil water content in the 0 300 cm soil layer had a significant decreasing trend with alfalfa growing age especially in the ninth year fig 1 the difference in soil water content among growing ages of alfalfa was greatest in the 30 300 cm soil layers the lowest level of soil water content was found in nine year old alfalfa compared to initial value soil water storage for 3 6 9 12 and 15 yr old alfalfa decreased by 10 19 39 33 and 28 mm in the 30 110 cm layer by 10 17 34 27 and 20 mm in the 110 200 cm layer and by 14 31 41 30 and 29 mm in the 200 300 cm layer respectively data not shown thus the depletion of soil water in the 0 300 cm soil layer at alfalfa growing ages of 3 6 9 12 and 15 yr reached 33 66 114 90 and 76 mm respectively compared to initial soil water storage table 1 the soil water depletion rate reached a peak in the ninth year and then declined on average soil water storage declined by 5 mm yr 1 in the 0 300 cm soil layer the deficit degree of soil water storage increased first and then gradually decreased fig 2 the most serious soil water deficit was found in the ninth year of alfalfa production table 1 the soil water deficit was most serious in the 0 80 cm soil layer 52 to 63 followed by the 200 300 cm soil layer 41 to 57 and 80 200 cm soil layer 41 to 55 3 2 soil organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus soil organic carbon and total nitrogen changed significantly with soil depth as the alfalfa growing age increased fig 3 a rapid increase in soc occurred in the 30 140 cm soil layers compared to the initial value soc was significantly increased from 9 7 to 12 1 g kg 1 in the 0 10 cm soil layer after the fifteenth year from 6 7 to 8 9 g kg 1 in the 10 110 cm soil layer after the sixth year and from 6 6 to 8 5 g kg 1 in 110 200 cm soil layer after the ninth year soil total nitrogen increased from 0 77 to 0 95 g kg 1 in the 0 170 cm soil layer after the first 9 yr of alfalfa production and from 0 72 to 0 94 g kg 1 in 170 200 cm soil layer after 15 yr of alfalfa production soil total phosphorus had a decreasing trend with alfalfa growing age in the 0 200 cm soil layer and was significantly reduced from 0 7 to 0 5 g kg 1 in the 30 50 cm soil layer after 15 yr the c n was first increased and then decreased table 2 after the first 9 yr of alfalfa production the c n increased in the 0 200 cm soil layer from the ninth to fifteenth years the c n decreased as alfalfa growing age increased the c p and n p values had a significant increasing trend with the increase of alfalfa growing age in the 0 200 cm soil layers the c p value was greater in the 10 110 cm soil layers than in the 0 10 and 110 200 cm soil layers compared to the initial value the c p value was significantly increased in the 10 110 cm soil layers as growing age increased but was not significantly different in the 0 10 and 110 200 cm soil layers soil available phosphorus decreased with soil depth in the 0 200 cm soil layers but soil mineral nitrogen was greater in the 0 10 cm soil layer than in the 10 200 cm soil layers fig 4 alfalfa growing age significantly affected soil mineral n and ap soil mineral n increased continuously with growing age of alfalfa and significant increases in soil mineral n appeared in the 0 80 and 110 200 cm soil layers after the fifteenth year soil ap decreased continuously with the increase of alfalfa growing age and significant changes in soil ap were observed in the 0 110 cm soil layers after the ninth year 3 3 yield evapotranspiration and water use efficiency annual alfalfa forage yield ranged from 0 7 to 11 2 mg ha 1 and varied with annual precipitation 291 to 472 mm fig 5 alfalfa yield first increased and then decreased and was greatest in the ninth year regardless of annual precipitation forage yield was the lowest during the first two years of production but it was 71 and 83 greater in the ninth year compared to the third and fifteenth years respectively from the ninth to twelfth years forage yield showed a significant decline but this decline did not persist beyond the twelfth year evapotranspiration and wue varied with alfalfa growing age table 3 evapotranspiration first increased and then decreased greatest et 424 mm occurred in the ninth year of alfalfa and et in 12 and 15 yr old alfalfa was less than that in 3 and 6 yr old alfalfa six year old alfalfa had the greatest wue which was 28 21 44 and 30 higher than that for 3 9 12 and 15 yr old alfalfa the relationship resulting from regression analysis of potential evapotranspiration of alfalfa on et is best described by a quadratic function as potential evapotranspiration of alfalfa increased alfalfa et first decreased and then increased and was lowest when potential evapotranspiration of alfalfa was 360 mm fig 6 evapotranspiration was not clearly associated with annual precipitation however alfalfa yield increased linearly with annual precipitation et and ks the relationship resulting from regression analysis of alfalfa wue and ks on growing age is best described by a cubic function wue and ks did not continuously increase when alfalfa growing age exceeded a critical value which in this study was about the sixth and tenth years for wue and ks respectively fig 7 alfalfa yield in the fourth to fifteenth years excluding young alfalfa was significantly positively correlated with soil ap and negatively correlated with soil n p in the 0 200 soil layers but was significantly positively correlated with soil c p in the 0 10 soil layer and negatively correlated with soil c p in the 10 200 soil layers table 4 water use efficiency exhibited a significant positive correlation with soil ap in the 0 200 cm soil layers and soil c p in the 0 50 cm soil layers but had a significant negative correlation with soil c n in the 10 110 soil layers and soil n p in the 0 200 soil layers table 4 4 discussion 4 1 soil water balance and water storage deficit alfalfa has deep roots that give it access to deeper soil water than annual forage and grain crops crawford and macfarlane 1995 fan et al 2010 2014 2016 huang et al 2018 li and huang 2008 ward et al 2002 during the first nine years of continuous alfalfa production soil water depletion gradually deepened and soil water storage deficit degree continuously intensified in all soil layers as alfalfa growing age increased which is in agreement with results from previous studies fan et al 2010 2014 2016 huang et al 2018 li and huang 2008 this was likely because the continuous increase in forage yield increased transpiration and water loss from the crop canopy which in turn caused soil water depletion in deep soil layers meanwhile although more than half of the precipitation was received during the fallow season from july to september soil water storage deficit degree continuously intensified in all soil layers as alfalfa growing age increased suggesting that the limited and erratic rainfall in this region was insufficient to fulfill alfalfa water requirements and then failed to replenish timely water loss in deep soil layers which is in agreement with results from previous research on the loess plateau fan et al 2010 2014 2016 huang et al 2018 li and huang 2008 in this study ks ranged from 0 47 to 0 91 which is in agreement with results from a previous study on the loess plateau yang 2008 these results demonstrate that 9 yr old alfalfa stands are optimal in this region which is in agreement with previous studies fan et al 2010 2016 huang et al 2018 li and huang 2008 although the rainfall was low in the years of 12 and 15 yr old alfalfa soil water storage was replenished and soil water storage deficit degree was mitigated it seems that decreased alfalfa yields reduced the amount of alfalfa transpiration thus resulting in less et 4 2 soil organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus soil organic carbon plays an important role in maintaining the availability of soil nutrients jiang et al 2006 li et al 2004 and long term ecosystem productivity collins et al 2000 gelaw et al 2014 wang et al 2016 soil organic carbon increased continuously as alfalfa growing age increased this is in agreement with previous studies which found an increasing trend in soc after conversion of annual cropland to alfalfa in canada and northwestern china su 2007 wu et al 2003 in contrast jiang et al 2006 found that soc was decreased as alfalfa growing age increased in northwestern china this discrepancy may be associated with differences in study methods as the present study and those reported by su 2007 and wu et al 2003 were conducted under continuous alfalfa production while the study by jiang et al 2006 was conducted in farmers fields of different alfalfa growing age in the same year with different growing conditions and soil nutrients at the time of alfalfa establishment among sites thereby confounding the effects of alfalfa growing age on soc stocks the ratio of soil organic c to total soil n is important in evaluating the ability of soil microorganisms to assimilate and mineralize n jia et al 2006 cultivation of leguminous crops can be a renewable and eco friendly source of n due to their ability to fix atmospheric n oldroyd and dixon 2014 the present study reveals that soil total n and mineral n increased continuously as alfalfa growing age increased this result is consistent with the study by su 2007 and is attributed to n fixation of the legume li et al 2018 however the c n ratio decreased continuously from the ninth to fifteenth years with alfalfa growing age presumably because the input of organic material to the soil by alfalfa was low due to the low productivity and residue of alfalfa after the first 9 yr of alfalfa production jia et al 2006 and greater loss in soc than in soil n jia et al 2006 jiang et al 2006 wang et al 1999 legume crops have more demand for p compared to non nodulating plants such as cereals because p plays a crucial role in nodule energetic transformations mitran et al 2018 the deficiency of p in soil has an adverse impact on legume yield mitran et al 2018 jia 1998 reported that the output of soil p doubled with the output of forage yield through mowing in artificial sweet clover melilotus suaveolens ledeb and astragalus adsurgens pall grasslands in the present study soil total p and ap decreased continuously with alfalfa growing age likely because soil ap was absorbed by alfalfa and removed from the system through forage harvesting which is in agreement with results from previous studies jia 1998 2006 jiang et al 2006 huang 2000 further reported that when soil c p was greater than 300 the microbial biomass c rapidly increased which caused soil available p to be absorbed by microorganisms and organic p to be immobilized in this study soil c p was always greater than 300 in all growing ages showing that the soil available p was very low and indicating that soil microorganisms were competing with alfalfa for soil available p which is in agreement with results from previous studies jia et al 2006 jiang et al 2006 our study also found that the reduction of c p mainly occurred in the 10 110 cm soil layers the c p in the 0 10 cm soil layer was not obviously changed as alfalfa growing age increased mainly because the decomposition of aboveground litter supplemented timely soil p some studies found that continuous production of alfalfa greatly reduced shoot p concentration but increased shoot n p ratio in this region fan et al 2016 gu et al 2018 lu et al 2020 suggesting that alfalfa plant experienced increasing p limitation with the increase of growing age however p fertilization can significantly increase shoot p uptake and reduce shoot n p ratio and subsequently enhanced yield and wue of alfalfa in semiarid areas fan et al 2016 gu et al 2018 lu et al 2020 li 2002 also showed that fertilization with long term alfalfa production can lengthen the duration of high forage yield and slow the decline of forage yield due to improved balance of soil nutrients this indicates the importance of soil nutrients particularly p in maintaining alfalfa production 4 3 yield and water use efficiency du et al 1994 reported that the life of an alfalfa stand should be no more than three years in arid regions due to decreases in forage yield after the third year similarly ren et al 2011 found that alfalfa yield gradually decreased as the growing age increased in semiarid and semiarid prone to droughty areas however in this study annual alfalfa forage yield increased during the first six years and then remained stable until the ninth year this discrepancy was likely because high annual precipitation during the initial years increased water use meanwhile increased root biomass and root length improved its ability to extract more water from deeper soil layers palta et al 2011 wang et al 2018 thus enhancing forage yield fan et al 2010 huang et al 2018 li et al 2010 after the ninth year annual forage yield gradually declined as growing age increased likely because the higher degree of soil water storage deficit and lower ap after ninth years of alfalfa production drive declines in alfalfa productivity which is in agreement with results from previous studies brookshire and weaver 2015 fan et al 2010 hou et al 2020 li et al 2010 mitran et al 2018 vitousek et al 2010 as a result forage yield is high during the initial years of alfalfa production due to its ability to extract more water from deeper soil layers as its roots grow but eventually decreased as a result of a severe soil dryness and p deficiency it has been proposed that alfalfa should be rotated with another crop or natural grassland for soil moisture recovery after 5 to 10 yr in the semiarid areas fan et al 2010 hou et al 2020 huang et al 2018 li 2002 li and huang 2008 li and shao 2005 vitousek et al 2010 the highest wue occurred in the sixth year of alfalfa production and then decreased with increasing growing age presumably because the increased soil water deficit degree and p deficiency have caused an adverse effect on alfalfa yield after sixth year table 4 for example although annual rainfall was relatively greater in the ninth to eleventh years alfalfa yield was gradually reduced as alfalfa growing age increased which is in agreement with results from previous studies fan et al 2016 gu et al 2018 hou et al 2020 huang et al 2018 jia et al 2006 li 2002 lu et al 2020 the results of this study highlight that decreased yield and wue of alfalfa after the sixth year was related to the depletion of soil water and ap and their interaction 5 conclusions long term continuous production of alfalfa in this study aggravated soil water deficits increased ks and reduced p availability leading to a decline in alfalfa yield after several years of production considering the aforementioned factors the optimal alfalfa growing age should not extend beyond nine years in semiarid conditions declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements we

10361,water availability is a major constraint for crop production in the loess plateau of china thus improving water use efficiency wue is a main research target the impact of alfalfa medicago sativa l growing age on forage yield wue soil water storage and soil fertility were examined in a 15 yr study in the western loess plateau of china the results of this study indicate that long term continuous production of alfalfa aggravated the soil water deficit and reduced soil available phosphorus ap and the ratio of soil organic carbon to soil total nitrogen but increased soil organic carbon soil total nitrogen and the ratios of soil organic carbon to soil available phosphorus and soil total nitrogen to soil total phosphorus after the ninth year of alfalfa production the greatest soil water storage deficit degree was found in the 0 80 cm soil layer 63 followed by the 200 300 57 and 80 200 cm 55 soil layers forage yield and wue of alfalfa reached their greatest values following six to nine yr old stands and then decreased gradually these results suggest that the yield decline with long term stands of alfalfa may be related to reductions in soil water storage and ap and their interaction and the optimal alfalfa growing age should not extend beyond nine years in semiarid conditions keywords alfalfa growing age forage yield water use efficiency soil fertility 1 introduction the shortage of soil water seriously restricts crop yield in arid and semiarid environments all over the planet including the loess plateau of china fan et al 2010 the loess plateau of china is characterized by an extremely hilly loess landscape and a harsh climatic condition including erratic rainfall frequent drought and severe wind and water erosion liu et al 2013 in 1998 the chinese government implemented a program to reduce soil erosion and optimize continuous use of land resources the program entitled the grain to green works to convert cropland on steep slopes to forest and perennial vegetation by providing farmers with grain as well as cash subsidies fan et al 2010 alfalfa medicago sativa l a deep rooted perennial forage legume has been grown in crop rotation systems in the loess plateau of china for more than 2000 years and used as feed for livestock li and huang 2008 due to its high herbage yield and protein concentration tolerance to drought and cold and ability to protect against soil erosion alfalfa has become the preferred species for returning farmland to perennial vegetation in the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau fan et al 2010 fan et al 2014 li et al 2002 li and huang 2008 thus alfalfa plays an extremely important role in the fragile ecological restoration the alfalfa production area has gradually increased to meet demand for an increasing livestock population and to prevent soil erosion in this region fan et al 2010 fan et al 2014 fan et al 2016 li et al 2002 alfalfa has high evapotranspiration et compared to annual forage and grain crops because of the high forage yield and deep root distribution crawford and macfarlane 1995 li et al 2002 scott and sudmeyer 1993 continuous production of alfalfa can cause severe soil water deficit and soil desiccation over time in arid regions fan et al 2010 2014 huang et al 2018 jiang et al 2006 li and huang 2008 and depletion of shallow groundwater zheng et al 2012 previous research indicates that alfalfa can increase soil water consumption at least 50 mm compared to annual forage and grain crops during growing season latta et al 2001 li and huang 2008 ridley et al 2001 alfalfa growing age has significant inﬂuence on its aboveground productivity and belowground soil water storage it is feasible to restore soil water after long term alfalfa production jia et al 2006 2009 fan et al 2010 found that the depletion of soil water following a five year old stand of alfalfa was 200 mm greater compared to initial soil water storage wang et al 2012 reported that when the age of alfalfa stands reached 10 yr desiccation of the 0 6 m soil layer reached an extreme degree and restoration of soil water was difficult soil water storage and forage yield of alfalfa gradually degrade with time in drought regions ren et al 2011 li and huang 2008 reported that alfalfa yield decreased by 0 629 mg ha 1 yr 1 in semiarid regions and proposed that other factors besides insufficient soil water may be contributing to the decrease of forage yield in long term cultivation of alfalfa luo et al 2015 found that alfalfa yield peaked in the eighth to ninth year and then began to decline due to severe depletion of soil water storage in the western loess plateau soil fertility is a key factor determining alfalfa productivity fan et al 2016 jia et al 2009 many studies have shown that soil fertility is influenced by the introduction of forage legumes into cropping systems jia et al 2006 jiang et al 2006 wu et al 2003 alfalfa stand age has been shown to affect the ratios of soil organic carbon to soil total nitrogen c n and soil organic carbon to soil available phosphorus c p jia et al 2006 jiang et al 2006 considering all of the above factors we speculate that decreased yield in long term alfalfa production is due to the interaction of soil water and soil fertility proper use of soil water and nutrients is fundamental for the sustainability of agriculture especially in arid and semiarid regions to avoid a severe depletion of soil water and maintain high land productivity it is essential to determine the best cultivation ages for alfalfa based on the trade offs between alfalfa yield and soil water storage and soil fertility in water limited regions therefore the aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of soil water storage deficits and soil fertility under continuous alfalfa production it was hypothesized that alfalfa forage yield would decline after several years of production due to a reduction in soil water storage and changes in soil fertility 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site a long term field experiment was conducted from april 2003 until october 2017 at the rainfed agricultural experimental station of gansu

conducted to monitor forage yield soil water storage and soil fertility under long term continuous production of alfalfa alfalfa was planted in three replicate plots of 12 m 15 m in april 2003 and maintained until october 2017 each plot was bordered to prevent runoff and managed in a similar way alfalfa cultivar longdong seed was broadcast at a rate of 18 kg ha 1 i e 350 plants m 2 during the experimental period alfalfa was manually harvested twice per year once during 20 to 25 june and again during 1 to 5 october aboveground plant biomass was sampled from an area of 1 m2 at five random locations within each plot the plant samples were dried at 75 c for 72 h and then weighed annual forage yield of alfalfa was the cumulative total of aboveground biomass sampled from both harvests 2 3 sampling and measurements daily precipitation wet and dry bulb air temperature wind speed and class a pan evaporation were obtained from an automatic weather station located at the experimental site

based on the weight of the samples immediately after sampling and the dry weight after drying in a forced air oven at 105 until constant mass volumetric soil water content from the 30 300 cm soil depth layer increments was measured with a trime pico iph precise soil moisture measurement imko micromodul technik gmbh ettlingen germany which is considered sufficient given the homogeneity of the water retention characteristics of loess plateau soils li and huang 2008 previous studies conducted at the study site reported no significant runoff or drainage during the growing season peng et al

the long term average 1970 2003 compared with the long term average annual precipitation was similar in the 2003 2008 and 2012 seasons normal but was 49 81 mm greater in the 2004 2005 2009 2011 and 2013 seasons wet and 30 100 mm less in the 2006 2007 2010 and 2014 2017 seasons dry soil water content in the 0 300 cm soil layer had a significant decreasing trend with alfalfa growing age especially in the ninth year fig 1 the difference in soil water content among growing ages of alfalfa was greatest in the 30 300 cm soil layers the lowest level of soil water content was found in nine year old alfalfa compared to initial value soil water storage for 3 6 9 12 and 15 yr old alfalfa decreased by 10 19 39 33 and 28 mm in the 30 110 cm layer by 10 17 34 27 and 20 mm in the 110 200 cm layer and by 14 31 41 30 and 29 mm in the 200 300 cm layer respectively data not shown thus the depletion of soil water in the 0 300 cm soil layer at alfalfa growing ages of 3 6 9 12 and 15 yr reached 33 66 114 90 and 76 mm respectively compared to initial soil water storage table 1 the soil water depletion rate reached a peak in the ninth year and then declined on average soil water storage declined by 5 mm yr 1 in the 0 300 cm soil layer the deficit degree of soil water storage increased first and then gradually decreased fig 2 the most serious soil water deficit was found in the ninth year of alfalfa production table 1 the soil water deficit was most serious in the 0 80 cm soil layer 52 to 63 followed by the 200 300 cm soil layer 41 to 57 and 80 200 cm soil layer 41 to 55 3 2 soil organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus soil organic carbon and total nitrogen changed significantly with soil depth as the alfalfa growing age increased fig 3 a rapid increase in soc occurred in the 30 140 cm soil layers compared to the initial value soc was significantly increased from 9 7 to 12 1 g kg 1 in the 0 10 cm soil layer after the fifteenth year from 6 7 to 8 9 g kg 1 in the 10 110 cm soil layer after the sixth year and from 6 6 to 8 5 g kg 1 in 110 200 cm soil layer after the ninth year soil total nitrogen increased from 0 77 to 0 95 g kg 1 in the 0 170 cm soil layer after the first 9 yr of alfalfa production and from 0 72 to 0 94 g kg 1 in 170 200 cm soil layer after 15 yr of alfalfa production soil total phosphorus had a decreasing trend with alfalfa growing age in the 0 200 cm soil layer and was significantly reduced from 0 7 to 0 5 g kg 1 in the 30 50 cm soil layer after 15 yr the c n was first increased and then decreased table 2 after the first 9 yr of alfalfa production the c n increased in the 0 200 cm soil layer from the ninth to fifteenth years the c n decreased as alfalfa growing age increased the c p and n p values had a significant increasing trend with the increase of alfalfa growing age in the 0 200 cm soil layers the c p value was greater in the 10 110 cm soil layers than in the 0 10 and 110 200 cm soil layers compared to the initial value the c p value was significantly increased in the 10 110 cm soil layers as growing age increased but was not significantly different in the 0 10 and 110 200 cm soil layers soil available phosphorus decreased with soil depth in the 0 200 cm soil layers but soil mineral nitrogen was greater in the 0 10 cm soil layer than in the 10 200 cm soil layers fig 4 alfalfa growing age significantly affected soil mineral n and ap soil mineral n increased continuously with growing age of alfalfa and significant increases in soil mineral n appeared in the 0 80 and 110 200 cm soil layers after the fifteenth year soil ap decreased continuously with the increase of alfalfa growing age and significant changes in soil ap were observed in the 0 110 cm soil layers after the ninth year 3 3 yield evapotranspiration and water use efficiency annual alfalfa forage yield ranged from 0 7 to 11 2 mg ha 1 and varied with annual precipitation 291 to 472 mm fig 5 alfalfa yield first increased and then decreased and was greatest in the ninth year regardless of annual precipitation forage yield was the lowest during the first two years of production but it was 71 and 83 greater in the ninth year compared to the third and fifteenth years respectively from the ninth to twelfth years forage yield showed a significant decline but this decline did not persist beyond the twelfth year evapotranspiration and wue varied with alfalfa growing age table 3 evapotranspiration first increased and then decreased greatest et 424 mm occurred in the ninth year of alfalfa and et in 12 and 15 yr old alfalfa was less than that in 3 and 6 yr old alfalfa six year old alfalfa had the greatest wue which was 28 21 44 and 30 higher than that for 3 9 12 and 15 yr old alfalfa the relationship resulting from regression analysis of potential evapotranspiration of alfalfa on et is best described by a quadratic function as potential evapotranspiration of alfalfa increased alfalfa et first decreased and then increased and was lowest when potential evapotranspiration of alfalfa was 360 mm fig 6 evapotranspiration was not clearly associated with annual precipitation however alfalfa yield increased linearly with annual precipitation et and ks the relationship resulting from regression analysis of alfalfa wue and ks on growing age is best described by a cubic function wue and ks did not continuously increase when alfalfa growing age exceeded a critical value which in this study was about the sixth and tenth years for wue and ks respectively fig 7 alfalfa yield in the fourth to fifteenth years excluding young alfalfa was significantly positively correlated with soil ap and negatively correlated with soil n p in the 0 200 soil layers but was significantly positively correlated with soil c p in the 0 10 soil layer and negatively correlated with soil c p in the 10 200 soil layers table 4 water use efficiency exhibited a significant positive correlation with soil ap in the 0 200 cm soil layers and soil c p in the 0 50 cm soil layers but had a significant negative correlation with soil c n in the 10 110 soil layers and soil n p in the 0 200 soil layers table 4 4 discussion 4 1 soil water balance and water storage deficit alfalfa has deep roots that give it access to deeper soil water than annual forage and grain crops crawford and macfarlane 1995 fan et al 2010 2014 2016 huang et al 2018 li and huang 2008 ward et al 2002 during the first nine years of continuous alfalfa production soil water depletion gradually deepened and soil water storage deficit degree continuously intensified in all soil layers as alfalfa growing age increased which is in agreement with results from previous studies fan et al 2010 2014 2016 huang et al 2018 li and huang 2008 this was likely because the continuous increase in forage yield increased transpiration and water loss from the crop canopy which in turn caused soil water depletion in deep soil layers meanwhile although more than half of the precipitation was received during the fallow season from july to september soil water storage deficit degree continuously intensified in all soil layers as alfalfa growing age increased suggesting that the limited and erratic rainfall in this region was insufficient to fulfill alfalfa water requirements and then failed to replenish timely water loss in deep soil layers which is in agreement with results from previous research on the loess plateau fan et al 2010 2014 2016 huang et al 2018 li and huang 2008 in this study ks ranged from 0 47 to 0 91 which is in agreement with results from a previous study on the loess plateau yang 2008 these results demonstrate that 9 yr old alfalfa stands are optimal in this region which is in agreement with previous studies fan et al 2010 2016 huang et al 2018 li and huang 2008 although the rainfall was low in the years of 12 and 15 yr old alfalfa soil water storage was replenished and soil water storage deficit degree was mitigated it seems that decreased alfalfa yields reduced the amount of alfalfa transpiration thus resulting in less et 4 2 soil organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus soil organic carbon plays an important role in maintaining the availability of soil nutrients jiang et al 2006 li et al 2004 and long term ecosystem productivity collins et al 2000 gelaw et al 2014 wang et al 2016 soil organic carbon increased continuously as alfalfa growing age increased this is in agreement with previous studies which found an increasing trend in soc after conversion of annual cropland to alfalfa in canada and northwestern china su 2007 wu et al 2003 in contrast jiang et al 2006 found that soc was decreased as alfalfa growing age increased in northwestern china this discrepancy may be associated with differences in study methods as the present study and those reported by su 2007 and wu et al 2003 were conducted under continuous alfalfa production while the study by jiang et al 2006 was conducted in farmers fields of different alfalfa growing age in the same year with different growing conditions and soil nutrients at the time of alfalfa establishment among sites thereby confounding the effects of alfalfa growing age on soc stocks the ratio of soil organic c to total soil n is important in evaluating the ability of soil microorganisms to assimilate and mineralize n jia et al 2006 cultivation of leguminous crops can be a renewable and eco friendly source of n due to their ability to fix atmospheric n oldroyd and dixon 2014 the present study reveals that soil total n and mineral n increased continuously as alfalfa growing age increased this result is consistent with the study by su 2007 and is attributed to n fixation of the legume li et al 2018 however the c n ratio decreased continuously from the ninth to fifteenth years with alfalfa growing age presumably because the input of organic material to the soil by alfalfa was low due to the low productivity and residue of alfalfa after the first 9 yr of alfalfa production jia et al 2006 and greater loss in soc than in soil n jia et al 2006 jiang et al 2006 wang et al 1999 legume crops have more demand for p compared to non nodulating plants such as cereals because p plays a crucial role in nodule energetic transformations mitran et al 2018 the deficiency of p in soil has an adverse impact on legume yield mitran et al 2018 jia 1998 reported that the output of soil p doubled with the output of forage yield through mowing in artificial sweet clover melilotus suaveolens ledeb and astragalus adsurgens pall grasslands in the present study soil total p and ap decreased continuously with alfalfa growing age likely because soil ap was absorbed by alfalfa and removed from the system through forage harvesting which is in agreement with results from previous studies jia 1998 2006 jiang et al 2006 huang 2000 further reported that when soil c p was greater than 300 the microbial biomass c rapidly increased which caused soil available p to be absorbed by microorganisms and organic p to be immobilized in this study soil c p was always greater than 300 in all growing ages showing that the soil available p was very low and indicating that soil microorganisms were competing with alfalfa for soil available p which is in agreement with results from previous studies jia et al 2006 jiang et al 2006 our study also found that the reduction of c p mainly occurred in the 10 110 cm soil layers the c p in the 0 10 cm soil layer was not obviously changed as alfalfa growing age increased mainly because the decomposition of aboveground litter supplemented timely soil p some studies found that continuous production of alfalfa greatly reduced shoot p concentration but increased shoot n p ratio in this region fan et al 2016 gu et al 2018 lu et al 2020 suggesting that alfalfa plant experienced increasing p limitation with the increase of growing age however p fertilization can significantly increase shoot p uptake and reduce shoot n p ratio and subsequently enhanced yield and wue of alfalfa in semiarid areas fan et al 2016 gu et al 2018 lu et al 2020 li 2002 also showed that fertilization with long term alfalfa production can lengthen the duration of high forage yield and slow the decline of forage yield due to improved balance of soil nutrients this indicates the importance of soil nutrients particularly p in maintaining alfalfa production 4 3 yield and water use efficiency du et al 1994 reported that the life of an alfalfa stand should be no more than three years in arid regions due to decreases in forage yield after the third year similarly ren et al 2011 found that alfalfa yield gradually decreased as the growing age increased in semiarid and semiarid prone to droughty areas however in this study annual alfalfa forage yield increased during the first six years and then remained stable until the ninth year this discrepancy was likely because high annual precipitation during the initial years increased water use meanwhile increased root biomass and root length improved its ability to extract more water from deeper soil layers palta et al 2011 wang et al 2018 thus enhancing forage yield fan et al 2010 huang et al 2018 li et al 2010 after the ninth year annual forage yield gradually declined as growing age increased likely because the higher degree of soil water storage deficit and lower ap after ninth years of alfalfa production drive declines in alfalfa productivity which is in agreement with results from previous studies brookshire and weaver 2015 fan et al 2010 hou et al 2020 li et al 2010 mitran et al 2018 vitousek et al 2010 as a result forage yield is high during the initial years of alfalfa production due to its ability to extract more water from deeper soil layers as its roots grow but eventually decreased as a result of a severe soil dryness and p deficiency it has been proposed that alfalfa should be rotated with another crop or natural grassland for soil moisture recovery after 5 to 10 yr in the semiarid areas fan et al 2010 hou et al 2020 huang et al 2018 li 2002 li and huang 2008 li and shao 2005 vitousek et al 2010 the highest wue occurred in the sixth year of alfalfa production and then decreased with increasing growing age presumably because the increased soil water deficit degree and p deficiency have caused an adverse effect on alfalfa yield after sixth year table 4 for example although annual rainfall was relatively greater in the ninth to eleventh years alfalfa yield was gradually reduced as alfalfa growing age increased which is in agreement with results from previous studies fan et al 2016 gu et al 2018 hou et al 2020 huang et al 2018 jia et al 2006 li 2002 lu et al 2020 the results of this study highlight that decreased yield and wue of alfalfa after the sixth year was related to the depletion of soil water and ap and their interaction 5 conclusions long term continuous production of alfalfa in this study aggravated soil water deficits increased ks and reduced p availability leading to a decline in alfalfa yield after several years of production considering the aforementioned factors the optimal alfalfa growing age should not extend beyond nine years in semiarid conditions declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements we

10362,sodicity where a high proportion of cation exchange sites are occupied by monovalent na ions relative to divalent cations ca2 and mg2 is a widespread and serious problem globally as this can result in soil dispersion low hydraulic conductivity and poor aeration it has been increasingly recognized that the presence of potassium k can also be a contributor to soil structural stability problems the aim of this research was to investigate the long term 15 years effects of irrigating treated winery wastewater on soil structural stability for which k comprises a high proportion of total cation concentrations at a vineyard trial site in the barossa valley australia analysis of the long term soil dataset was undertaken along with laboratory experiments to determine the current or future impacts of high exchangeable k on soil hydraulic conductivity and dispersion field results showed build up of k in subsoils and a corresponding decline in mg2 this appears due to the higher selectivity and exchange of k relative to na and higher k na ratio in the wastewater the potential dispersibility of the subsoils was demonstrated via a high turbidity of soil suspensions and high values of the emerson dispersion index declining relative hydraulic conductivity occurred for subsoils leached with winery wastewater followed by low ionic strength water flocculation measurements were performed in which aliquots of cacl2 were added to determine the amount of ca2 needed to overcome dispersion we conclude that the long term use of winery wastewater irrigation has potential to negatively impact soil structural stability via increasing exchangeable k further field research is required but ca or mg based amendments could be used to reduce dispersion risks keywords soil dispersion sodicity winery wastewater irrigation recycled water gypsum 1 introduction the volume of wastewater that is recycled and used for irrigation is increasing world wide raschid sally and jayakody 2009 water recycling is an important means to relieve water shortages and conserve water resources particularly as climate change is increasing water scarcity dai et al 2018 re utilization of wastewater for irrigation is now a common practice in agricultural lands wastewater sources can be from both municipal water treatment and industry including wineries laurenson et al 2012 using wastewaters for irrigation is environmentally and economically valuable because it can lessen the extent of serious water shortages while preventing surface waters being polluted from the discharge of wastewater bond 1998 arienzo et al 2012 wastewaters generally have a greater concentration of dissolved salt compared with most traditional water supplies and hence cause additional salt loading during land application usually much of this salt is nacl rengasamy 2018 however winery wastewater also has a high concentration of k which emanates from cleaning products koh leaves of grapes and the wastes produced by the procedure of grape fermentation laurenson et al 2012 since winery wastewater recycling is capable of reducing off site environmental effects and disposal costs most wineries are keen to use their winery wastewater within sustainable vineyard operations hirzel et al 2017 there have been several studies showing that when winery wastewater is used for irrigation the na present can be harmful to soil structural stability levy and torrento 1995 garcía orenes et al 2005 odeh and onus 2008 although k has similar atomic properties to na i e they are monovalent cations with similar ionic radius less is reported of its potential deleterious effects on soil structure laurenson et al 2012 some researchers have suggested there is potential for long term re utilization of winery wastewater to cause structural stability problems to soils during land irrigation hirzel et al 2017 rengasamy 2018 due to the presence of elevated na and k concentrations long term irrigation with winery wastewater in vineyards might lower the infiltration rates of water and oxygen due to swelling and dispersion rengasamy and olsson 1991 which results in a serious deficiency of oxygen that restricts the growth of roots additionally the high concentration of na 800 to 1000 mg l and potentially k in winery wastewater increases osmotic pressure around roots and may cause specific ion toxicity in vine tissues hirzel et al 2017 the soil structural stability problems commonly associated with na reflect decreased forces of attraction between clay particles when a substantial proportion of exchange cations are monovalent the problem is often referred to as sodicity and soils with a high relative proportion of exchangeable na are termed sodic the sodicity of a soil is commonly represented by calculating the exchangeable sodium percentage esp which is the percent proportion of exchangeable na relative to total cation exchange capacity or the sodium adsorption ratio sar which involves measurement of major cation concentrations in a water extract of soil rengasamy and marchuk 2011 although sar is often a useful parameter for predicting risks of soil structural problems its use has been criticised for ignoring the potential role of k and over simplifying the relative effects of ca2 and mg2 marchuk and rengasamy 2011 2012 in many soils this can be justified on the basis that na and ca2 are the dominant cations however some natural australian soils have relatively high concentrations of k and or mg2 the high concentration of k in recycled winery wastewater poses a particular problem for soil irrigated with this water a more holistic treatment of the influence of exchangeable cations on soil structural stability is incorporated in the cation ratio of structural stability cross rengasamy and marchuk 2011 as well as incorporating k cross scales k versus na as well as mg2 versus ca2 this scaling reflects the ratio of the dispersive powers of na and k and the ratio of flocculating powers of ca2 and mg2 these are related with dispersive powers being the reciprocal of flocculating powers marchuk et al 2013 a potassium adsorption ration par can also be calculated in an analogous way to sar the incorporation of the k coefficient of cross and par could be useful to understand potential k related harm in comparison with na smith et al 2015a b mosley et al 2017 the application of winery wastewater with elevated k concentration has become increasingly widespread in australia it is not only applied to vineyards but also in other agricultural areas for example mosse et al 2011 have estimated that a large winery in south australia would have an annual wastewater production of approximately 5 10 million litres viticulturalists pay attention to k behaviour during grape cultivation as it participates in sucrose translocation and other assimilate transformation from vines to ripening fruit potassium is viewed as essential because it can maintain the balance of ph through the displacement of protons in malate and tartrate acid mpelasoka et al 2003 ruhl 1989 laurenson 2010 however it becomes harmful to the quality of wine when the concentration of k is too high because it can produce insoluble potassium bitartrate and can further cause low availability of tartaric acid which could increase berry ph mpelasoka et al 2003 laurenson 2010 increased ph benefits wine quality under cool conditions but it becomes harmful under hot conditions which results in a flat winery taste in addition the hue of red wines could become brown which is not a desirable trait in wine quality gladstones 1992 ruhl 1989 laurenson 2010 it is important to determine if the long term use of winery wastewater high in k could have negative effects on soil structural stability the aim of this study was to i analyse long term soil data from a winery wastewater reuse trial site in the barossa valley south australia to assess changes in exchangeable cation concentration and ii conduct laboratory investigations to determine whether there are any current or likely future problems in relation to soil structural stability associated with long term irrigation with winery wastewater at the site the findings are relevant to other soils receiving similar winery wastewater or other irrigation water with high k levels 2 material and methods 2 1 site characteristics and soil sampling a long term dataset of soil analyses from a vineyard in the barossa valley 34 5333 s 138 9500 e was obtained from the manager of the north para environmental control npec scheme this soil is classified as a calcic red sodosol chromi calcic abruptic luvisol laurenson et al 2011 this vineyard was irrigated with river murray water termed normal irrigation water hereafter sourced from barossa irrigation ltd bil from 2004 2010 and then was irrigated with treated winery wastewater provided from the npec since 2010 this dataset included 42 samples in total collected annually from 2004 2018 soil analyses were not carried out in 2017 from sites bil npec 0 10 cm bil npec 10 30 cm and bil npec 30 60 cm soil layers this dataset includes exchangeable cations determined via extraction with a mixture of 0 1 m ammonium chloride and barium chloride at a ratio of 1 10 and subsequent icp oes analysis of displaced cation concentrations electrical conductivity ec and ph on a 1 5 soil water extract using calibrated electrodes and dispersion index di supplied by npec the di concept and calculation developed by loveday and pyle 1973 is score dispersion from 0 4 on the basis of the dispersion degree for both time intervals of 2 and 20 h where aggregates showed no obvious dispersion or only slight dispersion they were worked and remoulded into 5 mm balls at field capacity water content and re measured for dispersion because dispersibility of soil can increase following disturbance the possible range of values is 0 8 for those air dry soil aggregates without dispersion as the 2 and 20 h scores after remoulding at 100 cm water content are added together for those with dispersion the 2 and 20 h scores are added together and then added to 8 hence the range of possible values is 9 16 emerson 2002 the mann whitney u test was used to test for statistically significant differences in the composition of exchangeable cations both before and after the change in water source in the long term dataset these analyses were performed using genstat 19th edition at the start of this project in november 2018 soil samples were collected from the vineyard for the purpose of laboratory experimentation at two locations hereafter these locations are referred to as bil 2 and bil 4 these locations coincide with two of five locations from which the long term dataset soils were sampled at these two locations soil was collected from four depths 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 50 cm five out of eight of these soils were used in the experiments described here and are denoted as bil 2 0 10 cm bil 2 10 20 cm bil 2 20 30 cm bil 4 0 10 cm and bil 4 30 50 cm these soils were prepared for the subsequent experiments by air drying at 40 for 3 days grinding and sieving 2 mm 2 2 irrigation water composition the long term average winery wastewater composition average from 2004 to 2018 was ph 8 0 ec 1287 μs cm cation concentrations k 126 mg l na 162 mg l mg2 8 mg l and ca2 30 mg l sar par and cross were 6 8 3 1 and 12 9 respectively the water composition of normal bil irrigation water recorded in january 2018 was ph 7 3 ec 508 μs cm cation concentrations k 3 mg l na 57 mg l mg2 11 mg l and ca2 13 mg l sar par and cross were 2 8 0 1 and 4 6 respectively for laboratory experiments treated winery wastewater was obtained from npec on the 7th of november 2018 and the measured cation concentrations were k 117 mg l na 152 mg l mg2 7 mg l and ca2 26 mg l based on those cation concentrations sar par and cross were calculated sar 6 9 par 3 1 and cross 13 0 ph 7 9 and ec 1453 μs cm were also similar to the average values from npec 2 3 column experiments initial testing indicated that the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of subsoil samples was too low to measure in laboratory column experiments hence in order to assess relative ks values soil samples were mixed with pure sand 3 parts sand 1 part soil and placed in acrylic leaching columns with three replicates of each treatment soil sand mixes in the columns were saturated overnight with either treated winery water or ro water saturated soil columns were mounted vertically on a retort stand for each subsoil sample a 250 ml volumetric flask was filled with treated winery water or ro water and installed as a mariotte bottle to maintain a constant head of liquid in the tubes quirk and schofield 1955 for the topsoil samples the same procedure was followed except 500 ml volumetric flasks were used in each tube the height of the liquid column above the soil h was 80 mm and the length of the soil column l was 50 mm the flow rates of liquid through the saturated soil columns were measured by weighing the leachate collected in small dry pre weighed plastic containers in intervals of 10 min the procedure of ks measurement was carried twice for each column the first leaching used treated winery wastewater while the second leaching was with ro water to investigate whether dispersion occurs when salinity is lowered each leaching measurement was carried out with three replicate columns topsoil did not show any change in hydraulic conductivity so results are not presented the hydraulic conductivity was calculated based on darcy s law eq 4 4 q k s h l l where q is the flux density or volume of liquid delivered per unit time per unit cross sectional area of soil in the tube l is the length of the soil column and h is the height of the liquid column above soil due to the sand soil mixing procedure the results are expressed as relative hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity at time t initial hydraulic conductivity at time 0 x 100 the soils were pre equilibrated with winery wastewater overnight prior to beginning the experiment so were saturated at time zero inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes was used to measure major cation concentrations na k ca2 and mg2 in the leachate from the column experiments normally a volume of 10 ml solution was collected and used for measurement for those samples for which there was 10 ml due to insufficient leachate 10 times dilution was used for treated winery wastewater leachates while 2 times dilution was used for ro water leachates an agilent axial icp optical emission spectrometer was used to determine the concentrations of dissolved major cations following instrumental calibration 2 4 turbidity dispersion measurements to assess soil spontaneous dispersion potential turbidity of mildly disturbed soil suspensions was determined using the method of rengasamy 2002 a 20 g sample of soil from each site was placed into a 250 ml transparent measuring cylinder and 100 ml of distilled water was added slowly down the inside of the cylinder to minimise mechanical disturbance after approximately 5 h the dispersive clay particles adjacent to the soil were uniformly mixed again taking care to avoid disturbing the bulk soil layer this was achieved by placing a glass rod mid way into the suspension and then gently stirring for 30 s thereafter the cylinders were left to stand for a further 2 h a 20 ml sample of the suspension was taken by pipette from the top 10 cm of the solution and placed into a glass tube in which turbidity was measured using a hach ratio tm xr turbidimeter and expressed in nephelometric turbidity units ntu rengasamy et al 2016 2 5 flocculation experiment because of the role played by soil ph in determining the charge on particles it is necessary to estimate the exchangeable cations and soluble cations at a given soil ph to calculate dispersive potential however as this is very tedious rengasamy 2018 developed a procedure to measure flocculating charge in 1 5 soil water suspensions in which known amounts of flocculants such as cacl2 are added to the dispersed suspension step by step until complete flocculation is achieved from the amount of cacl2 added to achieve flocculation gypsum amendment rates can also be estimated see supplementary material s1 for details following the protocol of rengasamy 2018 1 5 soil water suspensions were prepared flocculation measurements were only carried out on subsoil samples because topsoils had low dispersibility following measurement of turbidity on subsoil suspensions a series of aliquots of 0 1 m cacl2 solution delivered using a calibrated pipette were added to the suspensions the solution left for at least 2 h and the turbidity re measured the volume of cacl2 added into the suspensions from soil bil 2 20 30 cm was 110 μl per aliquot while 500 600 μl aliquots were added to soil bil 4 30 50 cm aliquots were added to each suspension until turbidity values reached very low values 5 ntu 3 results 3 1 effect of long term winery wastewater irrigation on exchangeable cations exchangeable k concentrations showed large and statistically significant p 0 001 increases approximately doubled at the trial site since switching from normal irrigation to treated winery wastewater table 1 and fig 1 for the most recent sampling 2018 the exchangeable k percentage was approximately 12 14 and 8 in the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers respectively exchangeable k concentrations increased in the 0 10 cm and 10 30 cm layers from the beginning of measurement while a large increase in the 30 60 cm layer was only recorded in the most recent 2018 analysis this suggests the adsorption of k initially happened in the shallower layers 0 10 cm and 10 30 cm before leaching and exchanging into the deeper layer 30 60 cm exchangeable mg2 percentage also significantly declined after use of winery wastewater but only in the 10 30 cm layer table 1 and fig 1 differences in exchangeable na and ca2 concentration pre and post use of winery wastewater were not statistically significant table 1 3 2 dispersion and flocculation properties of soil dispersion measurements were made on soils collected in two parts of the irrigated vineyard and for both topsoils and subsoils table 2 to assess whether spontaneous dispersion occurs for these soils table 2 shows that gentle addition of water to subsoils bil 2 20 30 cm and bil 4 30 50 cm resulted in high turbidity compared to other layers indicating that these deeper soil layers have potential for spontaneous dispersion relative to topsoils these results are also consistent with the loveday pyle dispersion index being 9 for the subsoils loveday and pyle 1973 fig 2 3 3 flocculation experiments the results from the flocculation experiments are shown in fig 3 for the subsoils with the ca requirement to achieve flocculation listed in table 3 for the bil 2 20 30 cm soil suspension low turbidity values 5 ntu were achieved when approximately 550 μl of cacl2 was added this corresponds to 1 38 10 5 moles g mean value of ca addition to achieve flocculation table 3 in contrast for the bil 4 30 50 cm soil suspension low turbidity values were achieved when 2000 2500 μl of cacl2 was added this corresponded to a mean value of 5 63 10 5 moles ca added to achieve flocculation table 3 table 3 also shows the calculated gypsum treatment rate t ha see supplementary material s1 for calculation details in the subsoil layer at sites bil 2 and bil 4 approximately 4 and 15 t ha of gypsum respectively is estimated to be required the calculated gypsum rate of bil 2 is similar to typical gypsum application rates of 1 5 t ha in saline sodic soils prone to dispersion baldock et al 1994 clark 2004 however the gypsum rate of bil 4 is above this range which is similar to the finding by greene and ford 1985 in red duplex soils their results showed a significant decline of the exchangeable na in the top layer of 0 25 cm only when 15 t ha was used assessment of flocculation testing results to field gypsum application effects also requires further research 3 4 soil column leaching experiments the high concentration of exchangeable monovalent na and k cations section 3 1 and the indications of readily dispersible clay in the subsoils at the site section 3 2 indicate that soil structural stability may be a problem either currently or in the future to further assess this possibility a series of leaching experiments were carried out on repacked soil columns in which relative hydraulic conductivity was directly assessed for both topsoil and subsoil samples using both treated winery waste water and ultrapure reverse osmosis ro water this also enabled direct assessment of cation exchange processes with the aim of simulating what may be occurring in the field soils two leaching regimes were investigated in the columns the first involved leaching with the treated winery wastewater and then in the second switching to ro water it is well established that while irrigation with water with a high concentration of monovalent cations is a cause of soil sodicity dispersion does not occur if higher salinity water is present rengasamy and mehanni 1988 the leaching regime was designed to mimic this effect with the winery wastewater potentially increasing the concentration of exchangeable monovalent na and k cations and soil salinity on exchange and the switch to ro water representing a worst case scenario for clay dispersion if lower salinity water was applied e g rainwater or a switch back to normal irrigation water as dispersion only occurred in subsoils only results of hydraulic conductivity from bil 2 20 30 cm and bil 4 30 50 cm were determined table 4 shows the calculated relative hydraulic conductivity for these selected samples with winery wastewater treatment only see supplementary material 4 for details the relative hydraulic conductivity from bil 2 20 30 cm and bil 4 30 50 cm decreased significantly with time during leaching as a result of enhanced dispersion which is consistent with the results of turbidity measurement the change in concentrations of the cations na k ca2 and mg2 in the leachate with time for the winery wastewater leaching regime for the subsoil bil 2 20 30 cm is shown in fig 4 for this subsoil only the k concentration in the leachate was below the winery wastewater input water concentration see horizontal line on fig 4 during the wastewater application phase indicating adsorption of k and exchange desorption of na mg2 and ca2 leachate concentrations of na and to a lesser extent mg2 and ca2 were initially higher and declined over time then tended to plateau during the leaching experiment this likely indicates some initial flushing of soluble salt from the soil 4 discussion long term soil analyses showed that exchangeable k has accumulated in the subsoils of the barossa valley trial site that has received recycled winery wastewater application over the last decade the winery wastewater has a higher dissolved k content relative to normal irrigation water exchangeable mg2 appears to be displaced from the soil cation exchange sites by k this indicates that irrigation of winery wastewater or other recycled water elevated in k could cause potential risks related to build up of monovalent cations other than na column leaching experiments also showed k preferentially adsorbing and other cations being leached fig 4 consistent with the observed field exchangeable k accumulation fig 1 this was similar to some previous studies robbins and carter 1983 robbins 1984 christen et al 2010 that have reported that k is more likely to exchange with na rather than ca2 and mg2 in our case this is not due to the treated wastewater having a higher k concentration relative to na in fact the na is over two times the k concentration on a moles per charge basis however the k na ratio is much higher in the winery wastewater the ionicity index concept has previously been proposed to explain how metal cation affinities for soil adsorbents decrease with increasing ionicity index na k mg2 ca2 marchuk and rengasamy 2011 sposito 2016 however as na has a higher ionicity index than k this also cannot explain the observed effects hence the reason k is accumulating in the soils appears due to a higher selectivity of k for soil exchange sites than na robbins and carter 1983 marchuk and rengasamy 2011 sposito 2016 page 158 robbins and carter 1983 found that the relative k selective preference was 8 21 times that of na some soils are more soils susceptible to k adsorption in particular those with higher 2 1 layer clay content illite in particular has been shown to have a high affinity for k and potassium rich wastewater application can drive illitisation of other clay minerals marchuk et al 2016 overall the combination of na and k competing for cation exchange sites is a complex process and warrants further study with different soils and wastewaters turbidity measurements and high emersion dispersion index values suggested the subsoils have already experienced some dispersion and or are at risk of potential dispersion in the future other studies have found exchangeable k accumulation can lead to dispersion and reduction in hydraulic conductivity arienzo et al 2009 rengasamy and marchuk 2011 smith et al 2015a b dang et al 2018 our column leaching experiments suggest that if irrigation water with low ionic strength was used in the future enhanced dispersion and reduced hydraulic conductivity could occur arienzo et al 2012 laurenson et al 2012 howell et al 2018 howell and myburgh 2018 the potential role exchangeable na is playing in combination with k in influencing dispersion is still unclear it is also reiterated our repacked soil column experiments only measured relative hydraulic conductivity and field hydraulic measurements would be beneficial the dynamics of exchangeable cations will vary with different wastewater composition and soil types how these changes impact on soil structure typically depends on the amount of clay dispersed as indicated by the net dispersive charge rengasamy 2019 that is only a positive net dispersive charge can lead to clay dispersion when the net dispersive charge is zero or negative clay dispersion will not happen dispersive charge and turbidity in the soil suspension reduces as divalent ions replace monovalent ions but there can be differences due to soil type and surface charge marchuk and rengasamy 2011 results from our cacl2 addition experiments showed that ca2 input caused flocculation of the soils presumably by replacing the monovalent na and k ion in the soil exchange complex and increasing the soil electrolyte concentration if applied effectively to the barossa trial site soils ca2 and or mg2 could decrease sodicity potassicity problems promoting infiltration and water holding capacity clark 2004 gypsum caso4 2h2o is a commonly applied soil amendment to lower the dispersion in saline sodic soils which increases leaching as well as hydraulic conductivity and maintains the stability of soil aggregation clark 2004 given a wastewater treatment process is involved prior to irrigation of winery wastewater in the barossa use of ca or mg amendments in that process could be explored 5 conclusion analysis of a long term soil dataset from the barossa valley has provided important information that exchangeable k increased following application of treated winery wastewater for irrigation in contrast exchangeable mg2 decreased these field results were consistent with observations of k absorption in laboratory column leaching experiments this can be explained by the higher k na ratio in the wastewater and selectivity of k for soil exchange sites compared to other cations particularly na which had a higher molar charge concentration in the wastewater dispersion tests suggest that there are potential impacts on soil stability and water flow arising from high exchangeable k concentrations the results are consistent with other recent research findings showing that the soil samples including topsoils and subsoils are being exposed to k from

10362,sodicity where a high proportion of cation exchange sites are occupied by monovalent na ions relative to divalent cations ca2 and mg2 is a widespread and serious problem globally as this can result in soil dispersion low hydraulic conductivity and poor aeration it has been increasingly recognized that the presence of potassium k can also be a contributor to soil structural stability problems the aim of this research was to investigate the long term 15 years effects of irrigating treated winery wastewater on soil structural stability for which k comprises a high proportion of total cation concentrations at a vineyard trial site in the barossa valley australia analysis of the long term soil dataset was undertaken along with laboratory experiments to determine the current or future impacts of high exchangeable k on soil hydraulic conductivity and dispersion field results showed build up of k in subsoils and a corresponding decline in mg2 this appears due to the higher selectivity and exchange of k relative to na and higher k na ratio in the wastewater the potential dispersibility of the subsoils was demonstrated via a high turbidity of soil suspensions and high values of the emerson dispersion index declining relative hydraulic conductivity occurred for subsoils leached with winery wastewater followed by low ionic strength water flocculation measurements were performed in which aliquots of cacl2 were added to determine the amount of ca2 needed to overcome dispersion we conclude that the long term use of winery wastewater irrigation has potential to negatively impact soil structural stability via increasing exchangeable k further field research is required but ca or mg based amendments could be used to reduce dispersion risks keywords soil dispersion sodicity winery wastewater irrigation recycled water gypsum 1 introduction the volume of wastewater that is recycled and used for irrigation is increasing world wide raschid sally and jayakody 2009 water recycling is an important means to relieve water shortages and conserve water resources particularly as climate change is increasing water scarcity dai et al 2018 re utilization of wastewater for irrigation is now a common practice in agricultural lands wastewater sources can be from both municipal water treatment and industry including wineries laurenson et al 2012 using wastewaters for irrigation is environmentally and economically valuable because it can lessen the extent of serious water shortages while preventing surface waters being polluted from the discharge of wastewater bond 1998 arienzo et al 2012 wastewaters generally have a greater concentration of dissolved salt compared with most traditional water supplies and hence cause additional salt loading during land application usually much of this salt is nacl rengasamy 2018 however winery wastewater also has a high concentration of k which emanates from cleaning products koh leaves of grapes and the wastes produced by the procedure of grape fermentation laurenson et al 2012 since winery wastewater recycling is capable of reducing off site environmental effects and disposal costs most wineries are keen to use their winery wastewater within sustainable vineyard operations hirzel et al 2017 there have been several studies showing that when winery wastewater is used for irrigation the na present can be harmful to soil structural stability levy and torrento 1995 garcía orenes et al 2005 odeh and onus 2008 although k has similar atomic properties to na i e they are monovalent cations with similar ionic radius less is reported of its potential deleterious effects on soil structure laurenson et al 2012 some researchers have suggested there is potential for long term re utilization of winery wastewater to cause structural stability problems to soils during land irrigation hirzel et al 2017 rengasamy 2018 due to the presence of elevated na and k concentrations long term irrigation with winery wastewater in vineyards might lower the infiltration rates of water and oxygen due to swelling and dispersion rengasamy and olsson 1991 which results in a serious deficiency of oxygen that restricts the growth of roots additionally the high concentration of na 800 to 1000 mg l and potentially k in winery wastewater increases osmotic pressure around roots and may cause specific ion toxicity in vine tissues hirzel et al 2017 the soil structural stability problems commonly associated with na reflect decreased forces of attraction between clay particles when a substantial proportion of exchange cations are monovalent the problem is often referred to as sodicity and soils with a high relative proportion of exchangeable na are termed sodic the sodicity of a soil is commonly represented by calculating the exchangeable sodium percentage esp which is the percent proportion of exchangeable na relative to total cation exchange capacity or the sodium adsorption ratio sar which involves measurement of major cation concentrations in a water extract of soil rengasamy and marchuk 2011 although sar is often a useful parameter for predicting risks of soil structural problems its use has been criticised for ignoring the potential role of k and over simplifying the relative effects of ca2 and mg2 marchuk and rengasamy 2011 2012 in many soils this can be justified on the basis that na and ca2 are the dominant cations however some natural australian soils have relatively high concentrations of k and or mg2 the high concentration of k in recycled winery wastewater poses a particular problem for soil irrigated with this water a more holistic treatment of the influence of exchangeable cations on soil structural stability is incorporated in the cation ratio of structural stability cross rengasamy and marchuk 2011 as well as incorporating k cross scales k versus na as well as mg2 versus ca2 this scaling reflects the ratio of the dispersive powers of na and k and the ratio of flocculating powers of ca2 and mg2 these are related with dispersive powers being the reciprocal of flocculating powers marchuk et al 2013 a potassium adsorption ration par can also be calculated in an analogous way to sar the incorporation of the k coefficient of cross and par could be useful to understand potential k related harm in comparison with na smith et al 2015a b mosley et al 2017 the application of winery wastewater with elevated k concentration has become increasingly widespread in australia it is not only applied to vineyards but also in other agricultural areas for example mosse et al 2011 have estimated that a large winery in south australia would have an annual wastewater production of approximately 5 10 million litres viticulturalists pay attention to k behaviour during grape cultivation as it participates in sucrose translocation and other assimilate transformation from vines to ripening fruit potassium is viewed as essential because it can maintain the balance of ph through the displacement of protons in malate and tartrate acid mpelasoka et al 2003 ruhl 1989 laurenson 2010 however it becomes harmful to the quality of wine when the concentration of k is too high because it can produce insoluble potassium bitartrate and can further cause low availability of tartaric acid which could increase berry ph mpelasoka et al 2003 laurenson 2010 increased ph benefits wine quality under cool conditions but it becomes harmful under hot conditions which results in a flat winery taste in addition the hue of red wines could become brown which is not a desirable trait in wine quality gladstones 1992 ruhl 1989 laurenson 2010 it is important to determine if the long term use of winery wastewater high in k could have negative effects on soil structural stability the aim of this study was to i analyse long term soil data from a winery wastewater reuse trial site in the barossa valley south australia to assess changes in exchangeable cation concentration and ii conduct laboratory investigations to determine whether there are any current or likely future problems in relation to soil structural stability associated with long term irrigation with winery wastewater at the site the findings are relevant to other soils receiving similar winery wastewater or other irrigation water with high k levels 2 material and methods 2 1 site characteristics and soil sampling a long term dataset of soil analyses from a vineyard in the barossa valley 34 5333 s 138 9500 e was obtained from the manager of the north para environmental control npec scheme this soil is classified as a calcic red sodosol chromi calcic abruptic luvisol laurenson et al 2011 this vineyard was irrigated with river murray water termed normal irrigation water hereafter sourced from barossa irrigation ltd bil from 2004 2010 and then was irrigated with treated winery wastewater provided from the npec since 2010 this dataset included 42 samples in total collected annually from 2004 2018 soil analyses were not carried out in 2017 from sites bil npec 0 10 cm bil npec 10 30 cm and bil npec 30 60 cm soil layers this dataset includes exchangeable cations determined via extraction with a mixture of 0 1 m ammonium chloride and barium chloride at a ratio of 1 10 and subsequent icp oes analysis of displaced cation concentrations electrical conductivity ec and ph on a 1 5 soil water extract using calibrated electrodes and dispersion index di supplied by npec the di concept and calculation developed by loveday and pyle 1973 is score dispersion from 0 4 on the basis of the dispersion degree for both time intervals of 2 and 20 h where aggregates showed no obvious dispersion or only slight dispersion they were worked and remoulded into 5 mm balls at field capacity water content and re measured for dispersion because dispersibility of soil can increase following disturbance the possible range of values is 0 8 for those air dry soil aggregates without dispersion as the 2 and 20 h scores after remoulding at 100 cm water content are added together for those with dispersion the 2 and 20 h scores are added together and then added to 8 hence the range of possible values is 9 16 emerson 2002 the mann whitney u test was used to test for statistically significant differences in the composition of exchangeable cations both before and after the change in water source in the long term dataset these analyses were performed using genstat 19th edition at the start of this project in november 2018 soil samples were collected from the vineyard for the purpose of laboratory experimentation at two locations hereafter these locations are referred to as bil 2 and bil 4 these locations coincide with two of five locations from which the long term dataset soils were sampled at these two locations soil was collected from four depths 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 50 cm five out of eight of these soils were used in the experiments described here and are denoted as bil 2 0 10 cm bil 2 10 20 cm bil 2 20 30 cm bil 4 0 10 cm and bil 4 30 50 cm these soils were prepared for the subsequent experiments by air drying at 40 for 3 days grinding and sieving 2 mm 2 2 irrigation water composition the long term average winery wastewater composition average from 2004 to 2018 was ph 8 0 ec 1287 μs cm cation concentrations k 126 mg l na 162 mg l mg2 8 mg l and ca2 30 mg l sar par and cross were 6 8 3 1 and 12 9 respectively the water composition of normal bil irrigation water recorded in january 2018 was ph 7 3 ec 508 μs cm cation concentrations k 3 mg l na 57 mg l mg2 11 mg l and ca2 13 mg l sar par and cross were 2 8 0 1 and 4 6 respectively for laboratory experiments treated winery wastewater was obtained from npec on the 7th of november 2018 and the measured cation concentrations were k 117 mg l na 152 mg l mg2 7 mg l and ca2 26 mg l based on those cation concentrations sar par and cross were calculated sar 6 9 par 3 1 and cross 13 0 ph 7 9 and ec 1453 μs cm were also similar to the average values from npec 2 3 column experiments initial testing indicated that the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of subsoil samples was too low to measure in laboratory column experiments hence in order to assess relative ks values soil samples were mixed with pure sand 3 parts sand 1 part soil and placed in acrylic leaching columns with three replicates of each treatment soil sand mixes in the columns were saturated overnight with either treated winery water or ro water saturated soil columns were mounted vertically on a retort stand for each subsoil sample a 250 ml volumetric flask was filled with treated winery water or ro water and installed as a mariotte bottle to maintain a constant head of liquid in the tubes quirk and schofield 1955 for the topsoil samples the same procedure was followed except 500 ml volumetric flasks were used in each tube the height of the liquid column above the soil h was 80 mm and the length of the soil column l was 50 mm the flow rates of liquid through the saturated soil columns were measured by weighing the leachate collected in small dry pre weighed plastic containers in intervals of 10 min the procedure of ks measurement was carried twice for each column the first leaching used treated winery wastewater while the second leaching was with ro water to investigate whether dispersion occurs when salinity is lowered each leaching measurement was carried out with three replicate columns topsoil did not show any change in hydraulic conductivity so results are not presented the hydraulic conductivity was calculated based on darcy s law eq 4 4 q k s h l l where q is the flux density or volume of liquid delivered per unit time per unit cross sectional area of soil in the tube l is the length of the soil column and h is the height of the liquid column above soil due to the sand soil mixing procedure the results are expressed as relative hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity at time t initial hydraulic conductivity at time 0 x 100 the soils were pre equilibrated with winery wastewater overnight prior to beginning the experiment so were saturated at time zero inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes was used to measure major cation concentrations na k ca2 and mg2 in the leachate from the column experiments normally a volume of 10 ml solution was collected and used for measurement for those samples for which there was 10 ml due to insufficient leachate 10 times dilution was used for treated winery wastewater leachates while 2 times dilution was used for ro water leachates an agilent axial icp optical emission spectrometer was used to determine the concentrations of dissolved major cations following instrumental calibration 2 4 turbidity dispersion measurements to assess soil spontaneous dispersion potential turbidity of mildly disturbed soil suspensions was determined using the method of rengasamy 2002 a 20 g sample of soil from each site was placed into a 250 ml transparent measuring cylinder and 100 ml of distilled water was added slowly down the inside of the cylinder to minimise mechanical disturbance after approximately 5 h the dispersive clay particles adjacent to the soil were uniformly mixed again taking care to avoid disturbing the bulk soil layer this was achieved by placing a glass rod mid way into the suspension and then gently stirring for 30 s thereafter the cylinders were left to stand for a further 2 h a 20 ml sample of the suspension was taken by pipette from the top 10 cm of the solution and placed into a glass tube in which turbidity was measured using a hach ratio tm xr turbidimeter and expressed in nephelometric turbidity units ntu rengasamy et al 2016 2 5 flocculation experiment because of the role played by soil ph in determining the charge on particles it is necessary to estimate the exchangeable cations and soluble cations at a given soil ph to calculate dispersive potential however as this is very tedious rengasamy 2018 developed a procedure to measure flocculating charge in 1 5 soil water suspensions in which known amounts of flocculants such as cacl2 are added to the dispersed suspension step by step until complete flocculation is achieved from the amount of cacl2 added to achieve flocculation gypsum amendment rates can also be estimated see supplementary material s1 for details following the protocol of rengasamy 2018 1 5 soil water suspensions were prepared flocculation measurements were only carried out on subsoil samples because topsoils had low dispersibility following measurement of turbidity on subsoil suspensions a series of aliquots of 0 1 m cacl2 solution delivered using a calibrated pipette were added to the suspensions the solution left for at least 2 h and the turbidity re measured the volume of cacl2 added into the suspensions from soil bil 2 20 30 cm was 110 μl per aliquot while 500 600 μl aliquots were added to soil bil 4 30 50 cm aliquots were added to each suspension until turbidity values reached very low values 5 ntu 3 results 3 1 effect of long term winery wastewater irrigation on exchangeable cations exchangeable k concentrations showed large and statistically significant p 0 001 increases approximately doubled at the trial site since switching from normal irrigation to treated winery wastewater table 1 and fig 1 for the most recent sampling 2018 the exchangeable k percentage was approximately 12 14 and 8 in the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers respectively exchangeable k concentrations increased in the 0 10 cm and 10 30 cm layers from the beginning of measurement while a large increase in the 30 60 cm layer was only recorded in the most recent 2018 analysis this suggests the adsorption of k initially happened in the shallower layers 0 10 cm and 10 30 cm before leaching and exchanging into the deeper layer 30 60 cm exchangeable mg2 percentage also significantly declined after use of winery wastewater but only in the 10 30 cm layer table 1 and fig 1 differences in exchangeable na and ca2 concentration pre and post use of winery wastewater were not statistically significant table 1 3 2 dispersion and flocculation properties of soil dispersion measurements were made on soils collected in two parts of the irrigated vineyard and for both topsoils and subsoils table 2 to assess whether spontaneous dispersion occurs for these soils table 2 shows that gentle addition of water to subsoils bil 2 20 30 cm and bil 4 30 50 cm resulted in high turbidity compared to other layers indicating that these deeper soil layers have potential for spontaneous dispersion relative to topsoils these results are also consistent with the loveday pyle dispersion index being 9 for the subsoils loveday and pyle 1973 fig 2 3 3 flocculation experiments the results from the flocculation experiments are shown in fig 3 for the subsoils with the ca requirement to achieve flocculation listed in table 3 for the bil 2 20 30 cm soil suspension low turbidity values 5 ntu were achieved when approximately 550 μl of cacl2 was added this corresponds to 1 38 10 5 moles g mean value of ca addition to achieve flocculation table 3 in contrast for the bil 4 30 50 cm soil suspension low turbidity values were achieved when 2000 2500 μl of cacl2 was added this corresponded to a mean value of 5 63 10 5 moles ca added to achieve flocculation table 3 table 3 also shows the calculated gypsum treatment rate t ha see supplementary material s1 for calculation details in the subsoil layer at sites bil 2 and bil 4 approximately 4 and 15 t ha of gypsum respectively is estimated to be required the calculated gypsum rate of bil 2 is similar to typical gypsum application rates of 1 5 t ha in saline sodic soils prone to dispersion baldock et al 1994 clark 2004 however the gypsum rate of bil 4 is above this range which is similar to the finding by greene and ford 1985 in red duplex soils their results showed a significant decline of the exchangeable na in the top layer of 0 25 cm only when 15 t ha was used assessment of flocculation testing results to field gypsum application effects also requires further research 3 4 soil column leaching experiments the high concentration of exchangeable monovalent na and k cations section 3 1 and the indications of readily dispersible clay in the subsoils at the site section 3 2 indicate that soil structural stability may be a problem either currently or in the future to further assess this possibility a series of leaching experiments were carried out on repacked soil columns in which relative hydraulic conductivity was directly assessed for both topsoil and subsoil samples using both treated winery waste water and ultrapure reverse osmosis ro water this also enabled direct assessment of cation exchange processes with the aim of simulating what may be occurring in the field soils two leaching regimes were investigated in the columns the first involved leaching with the treated winery wastewater and then in the second switching to ro water it is well established that while irrigation with water with a high concentration of monovalent cations is a cause of soil sodicity dispersion does not occur if higher salinity water is present rengasamy and mehanni 1988 the leaching regime was designed to mimic this effect with the winery wastewater potentially increasing the concentration of exchangeable monovalent na and k cations and soil salinity on exchange and the switch to ro water representing a worst case scenario for clay dispersion if lower salinity water was applied e g rainwater or a switch back to normal irrigation water as dispersion only occurred in subsoils only results of hydraulic conductivity from bil 2 20 30 cm and bil 4 30 50 cm were determined table 4 shows the calculated relative hydraulic conductivity for these selected samples with winery wastewater treatment only see supplementary material 4 for details the relative hydraulic conductivity from bil 2 20 30 cm and bil 4 30 50 cm decreased significantly with time during leaching as a result of enhanced dispersion which is consistent with the results of turbidity measurement the change in concentrations of the cations na k ca2 and mg2 in the leachate with time for the winery wastewater leaching regime for the subsoil bil 2 20 30 cm is shown in fig 4 for this subsoil only the k concentration in the leachate was below the winery wastewater input water concentration see horizontal line on fig 4 during the wastewater application phase indicating adsorption of k and exchange desorption of na mg2 and ca2 leachate concentrations of na and to a lesser extent mg2 and ca2 were initially higher and declined over time then tended to plateau during the leaching experiment this likely indicates some initial flushing of soluble salt from the soil 4 discussion long term soil analyses showed that exchangeable k has accumulated in the subsoils of the barossa valley trial site that has received recycled winery wastewater application over the last decade the winery wastewater has a higher dissolved k content relative to normal irrigation water exchangeable mg2 appears to be displaced from the soil cation exchange sites by k this indicates that irrigation of winery wastewater or other recycled water elevated in k could cause potential risks related to build up of monovalent cations other than na column leaching experiments also showed k preferentially adsorbing and other cations being leached fig 4 consistent with the observed field exchangeable k accumulation fig 1 this was similar to some previous studies robbins and carter 1983 robbins 1984 christen et al 2010 that have reported that k is more likely to exchange with na rather than ca2 and mg2 in our case this is not due to the treated wastewater having a higher k concentration relative to na in fact the na is over two times the k concentration on a moles per charge basis however the k na ratio is much higher in the winery wastewater the ionicity index concept has previously been proposed to explain how metal cation affinities for soil adsorbents decrease with increasing ionicity index na k mg2 ca2 marchuk and rengasamy 2011 sposito 2016 however as na has a higher ionicity index than k this also cannot explain the observed effects hence the reason k is accumulating in the soils appears due to a higher selectivity of k for soil exchange sites than na robbins and carter 1983 marchuk and rengasamy 2011 sposito 2016 page 158 robbins and carter 1983 found that the relative k selective preference was 8 21 times that of na some soils are more soils susceptible to k adsorption in particular those with higher 2 1 layer clay content illite in particular has been shown to have a high affinity for k and potassium rich wastewater application can drive illitisation of other clay minerals marchuk et al 2016 overall the combination of na and k competing for cation exchange sites is a complex process and warrants further study with different soils and wastewaters turbidity measurements and high emersion dispersion index values suggested the subsoils have already experienced some dispersion and or are at risk of potential dispersion in the future other studies have found exchangeable k accumulation can lead to dispersion and reduction in hydraulic conductivity arienzo et al 2009 rengasamy and marchuk 2011 smith et al 2015a b dang et al 2018 our column leaching experiments suggest that if irrigation water with low ionic strength was used in the future enhanced dispersion and reduced hydraulic conductivity could occur arienzo et al 2012 laurenson et al 2012 howell et al 2018 howell and myburgh 2018 the potential role exchangeable na is playing in combination with k in influencing dispersion is still unclear it is also reiterated our repacked soil column experiments only measured relative hydraulic conductivity and field hydraulic measurements would be beneficial the dynamics of exchangeable cations will vary with different wastewater composition and soil types how these changes impact on soil structure typically depends on the amount of clay dispersed as indicated by the net dispersive charge rengasamy 2019 that is only a positive net dispersive charge can lead to clay dispersion when the net dispersive charge is zero or negative clay dispersion will not happen dispersive charge and turbidity in the soil suspension reduces as divalent ions replace monovalent ions but there can be differences due to soil type and surface charge marchuk and rengasamy 2011 results from our cacl2 addition experiments showed that ca2 input caused flocculation of the soils presumably by replacing the monovalent na and k ion in the soil exchange complex and increasing the soil electrolyte concentration if applied effectively to the barossa trial site soils ca2 and or mg2 could decrease sodicity potassicity problems promoting infiltration and water holding capacity clark 2004 gypsum caso4 2h2o is a commonly applied soil amendment to lower the dispersion in saline sodic soils which increases leaching as well as hydraulic conductivity and maintains the stability of soil aggregation clark 2004 given a wastewater treatment process is involved prior to irrigation of winery wastewater in the barossa use of ca or mg amendments in that process could be explored 5 conclusion analysis of a long term soil dataset from the barossa valley has provided important information that exchangeable k increased following application of treated winery wastewater for irrigation in contrast exchangeable mg2 decreased these field results were consistent with observations of k absorption in laboratory column leaching experiments this can be explained by the higher k na ratio in the wastewater and selectivity of k for soil exchange sites compared to other cations particularly na which had a higher molar charge concentration in the wastewater dispersion tests suggest that there are potential impacts on soil stability and water flow arising from high exchangeable k concentrations the results are consistent with other recent research findings showing that the soil samples including topsoils and subsoils are being exposed to k from the winery wastewater and high concentration of exchangeable k can have potentially negative effects on soil structural stability experiments on the subsoils provided another consistent line of evidence for the cation exchange effects that were observed in the field dataset however other parameters such as microbes and organic matter in the winery wastewater might also potentially affect soil properties under long term wastewater irrigation further field measurements e g field hydraulic conductivity would be beneficial along with study of how to effectively apply ca or mg based amendments consideration of potential effects of increasing exchangeable potassium on yield and wine quality should also be considered the benefits of winery wastewater recycling in particular at times of irrigation water scarcity need to be balanced against long term risks of soil dispersion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10363,the aim of this study was to assess eleven mediterranean pomegranate cultivars for drought tolerance based on their responses to severe water stress the experiment was performed under field conditions in sais plain nw morocco on twelve year old pomegranate trees punica granatum l under drip irrigation for each cultivar two treatments were applied from fruit set to harvest a control treatment irrigated at 100 of seasonal etc fi and a continuous deficit treatment irrigated at 50 of etc cdi the measurements concerned fruit yield fruit weight aril content aril weight seed weight juice content shoot length leaf area foliage density wood density and concentration of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b results showed clear differences among pomegranate cultivars in response to water stress the most frequent effects of water stress were recorded on yield fruit weight and chlorophyll pigment contents fruit yield was not affected in zheri automne cultivar while it was significantly decreased under cdi in all other cultivars by 14 in bzou to 51 in ounk hmam a significant decrease of fruit weight was observed in six cultivars with a rate of 13 in gordo de jativa cultivar to 24 in average for grenade jaune grenade rouge and ounk hmam these last cultivars were the only ones affected in juice content by 9 11 regarding cdi effect on vegetative growth it was recorded a high decrease of shoot length in the cultivars gjeibi 78 sefri 64 and mollar osin hueso 38 the cultivars ranking for drought tolerance based on mean ratios of all traits between cdi and fi treatments was drawn according to cluster analysis combined to a scoring method it was thus retained that the most drought tolerant cultivar was zheri automne followed by djebali and bzou while grenade rouge cultivar was the most sensitive keywords climate change punica granatum l drought stress tolerance productive potential vegetative growth 1 introduction the mediterranean basin is among the most vulnerable regions to drought stress both currently and in future years as predicted by climate change scenarios senatore et al 2010 some investigations in this area warn of significant impacts on both mean precipitation and variability of hydrological systems with a predicting decrease of 20 in water availability brouzyine et al 2018 amengual et al 2012 mariotti et al 2008 in morocco as an integral country in this area the main temperature has increased by 0 42 c per decade since 1990 and the rainfall has decreased by more than 20 between 1961 and 2005 climate predictions indicate that the increased aridity will continue in morocco by an additional rise in temperature of 1 5 c by 2050 following the climate change scenario rcp4 5 or 2 c for rcp8 5 associated to a decrease in precipitation of about 15 woillez 2019 the low water availability combined with a high demand for water forced the moroccan farmers to adopt deficit irrigation programs whose severity could increase in future years according to climate change predictions el jaouhari et al 2018 therefore the moroccan agricultural stakeholders are called to develop reflections for the adoption of sustainable strategies to save water especially for the most water demanding crops such as fruit trees research works are focused on two main strategies to cope with water scarcity i the use of improved innovative and precise deficit irrigation management practices able to minimize the impact on productive potential and ii the use of plant materials less water demanding or able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality galindo et al 2018 in relation to these plant materials it is also important to underline for the case of fruit trees that it is essential to take into account the crops chill requirements in addition to the water needs to cope with global warming gratacos and cortes 2007 in relation with this last aspect pomegranate punica granatum l could be one of the interesting species to promote in arid areas due to its broad spectrum of environmental adaptation holland et al 2009 pomegranate is fairly drought tolerant although it requires regular irrigation throughout the season for commercial production especially when it is cultivated in arid and semiarid areas to reach optimal growth yield and fruit quality intrigliolo et al 2013 it requires low winter chill hours for breaking bud dormancy and can withstand temperatures of 12 c in winter and 42 c in summer rodríguez et al 2012 aseri et al 2008 for these reasons in addition to its tolerance to many soil types and high levels of water salinity this species is cultivated in different regions of the world in asia mediterranean countries and america blumenfeld et al 2000 in morocco pomegranate is produced in different areas from north to southwest with an overall production of 113 500 tons for an area around 12 700 ha mapmdref 2018 two groups of cultivars are grown in morocco i local ecotypes with soft seeds consumed fresh including mainly sefri grenade rouge grenade jaune bzou mesri laroussi as well as zheri automne and zheri precoce originating from tunisia and ii foreign varieties with hard seeds and acid juice generally destined for processing such as wonderful negro monstruoso and dwarf semi evergreen haddioui 2012 studies regarding drought stress tolerance in the moroccan pomegranate germplasm remain very limited some works carried out on the local cultivar sefri in tadla plain concluded that it is sensitive to water stress even moderate of 80 etc having reduced yield by 33 and fruit weight by 20 compared to full irrigation treatment 100 etc but without significant negative effect on shoot growth messaoudi et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge there have been no studies assessing drought stress tolerance in the other local cultivars the adoption of findings regarding the introduced foreign varieties obtained in other countries is not justified because they are not conclusive probably due to differences in soil proprieties and climate conditions for example in mollar de elche variety growing on sandy clay loam soil in spain similar yield levels were obtained in sustained deficit irrigation of 50 etc and control trees watered at 100 etc martínez nicolas et al 2019 however in sandy loam soil a significant decrease in fruit yield of this variety was observed originating from a decrease of fruit weight intrigliolo et al 2012 the studies on pomegranate drought stress tolerance are therefore specific to a particular ecosystem therefore the aim of this work was to investigate water stress tolerance in various moroccan cultivars and introduced foreign varieties of pomegranate in sais plain nw morocco to the best of our knowledge this is the first report to assess drought tolerance in pomegranate germplasm growing in morocco in this manuscript we report the results of trees responses related to vegetative growth yield and its

deficit was marked from february to october with a peak between may and september the plant material consisted of 11 twelve year old pomegranate cultivars of which 7 were local clones and 4 were imported varieties table 2 these cultivars were gathered into a collection following a randomized complete block rbc design with six replicates for each cultivar all trees received the same fertilization 100 kg of n 60 kg of p2o5 and 120 kg of k2o per hectare pest control was according to local commercial practice and weeds were fully controlled crop water requirements etc were estimated as product of daily et0 recorded at the weather station located at less than 1 km distance from the orchard crop coefficient kc and reduction coefficient kr the kc values employed were based on results reported by intrigliolo et al 2011 and the kr value was used to take into account tree canopy cover calculated by the formula as in fereres et al 1981 kr 2 sc 100 with sc π d2 n 100 where d is the average of canopy diameters and n is planting density in rainy days it was considered the effective rainfall equivalent to 80 of the recorded rainfall the trees were irrigated daily from flowering stage early april to harvest end october by drip system with two emitters delivering 16 l h 1 per tree located in a single line parallel to the tree row since fruit set stage in early mai the emitters have been changed in three neighboring trees of each cultivar by other emitters delivering 8 l h 1 to give two water treatments during fruit growth period 100 etc fi and 50 etc cdi 2 2 yield and fruit traits in october fruit from each experimental tree n 30 were harvested to determine average fruit weight of cultivars under fi and cdi treatments fruit yield was calculated as product of fruit weight and fruit number counted per tree fruit traits were determined in three replicates of 10 fruits each per tree fruit juice content was determined on six fruit of each sample previously weighted by pressure using a commercial pomegranate juicer the other six sampled pomegranates were hand peeled and the arils weighed to determine fruit arils content on subsamples of 10 arils each aril and seed weights were measured by digital balance of precision at least 0 001 g 2 3 vegetative growth and chlorophyll content two months after applying deficit irrigation in early july shoot length number of leaves per 10 cm of shoot leaf area wood density and contents of chlorophylls a and b were measured in all trees of each cultivar under fi and cdi treatments shoot length was measured in all tree by summing lengths of all shoots growing on 12 two years old branches per treatment 4 per each tree in each branch the sum of shoot lengths was transformed to have an average of shoot length in cm m 1 to eliminate variability that may due to branch vigor on the selected shoots leaves were counted and their number per 10 cm of shoot was calculated leaf area was measured on 10 most developed leaves per tree selected from shoots with similar length using a leaf area meter adc bioscientific ltd the samples of two years old branches were used for wood density determination based on the water displacement method as described by chave 2005 indeed a burette capable of holding the sample was filled with water and placed on a digital balance of precision at least 0 001 g the balance was then re zeroed a portion of 10 cm in length cut from the basal part of each branch sample was then carefully sunk in the water such that it was completely underwater the measured weight of displaced water was considered equal to the sample s volume v in cm3 since water has a density of 1 oven dry weight dw in g was measured from the same sample by drying it at 105 c for 48 h and branch wood density wd in g cm 3 was then calculated according to the formula wd dw v contents of chlorophylls a and b were determined on young leaves following the method of singh et al 1975 after lyophilization and grinding of leaf samples 5 mg of the ground product was agitated in 1 ml of 80 acetone in eppendorf tubes for 1 h 30 min to extract all chlorophyll pigments the extract was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min under 4 c the optical density od of supernatant was measured at 645 nm and 663 nm the concentration of chlorophyll a cha and chlorophyll b chb are given by the formulas cha 12 7 od663 2

between the irrigation treatments effects on each trait student newman and keuls test snk was done to compare trait means between the irrigation treatments for each cultivar the results were presented as mean of ratio between cdi and fi treatments calculated for each trait a ratio significantly equal or close to 1 indicated drought tolerance for this trait correlation coefficients and their levels of significance were calculated using pearson correlation on mean ratios to identify the relationships between water stress effects the hierarchical clustering of cultivars was done using mean ratios according to the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic average upgma 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield and fruit traits water stress effects on yield and fruit traits of the eleven pomegranate cultivars are shown in table 3 the cdi treatment did not affect these parameters in zheri automne cultivar however in the others cultivars fruit yield was significantly reduced with or without effects on fruit traits in bzou djebali and gjeibi cultivars the cdi treatment caused a lowest reduction of fruit yield by respective averages of 14 18 and 22 while their fruit traits remained unaffected the highest reduction of fruit yield was recorded in ounk hmam cultivar where water stress decreased fruit yield by 51 as well as fruit weight and juice content by respective rates of 25 and 9 a high reduction of fruit yield was also observed in grenade jaune cultivar by an average of 44 associated to a fruit weight decrease of 27 in addition for this cultivar the cdi treatment reduced aril weight and fruit juice content by an average of 11 and increased seed weight by 12 the other five cultivars gordo de jativa zheri precoce sefri grenade rouge and mollar osin hueso showed intermediate effects of water stress on fruit yield with reduction rates ranging from 23 in gordo de jativa cultivar to 40 in mollar osin hueso compared to control trees fruit weight was also significantly reduced in these cultivars expect zheri precoce by an average of 13 in gordo de jativa and mollar osin hueso to 21 in grenade rouge cultivar however in zheri precoce and likewise in grenade rouge cultivars aril weight was significantly decreased by an average of 10 with an increase of seed weight by about 11 the results presented clearly show differences between pomegranate cultivars regarding fruit yield and physical fruit traits under water stress applied during fruit growth period to the best of our knowledge the results presented are of the first study conducted in order to explore water stress effects on the cultivars included in this work the studies on other pomegranate cultivars mention ambiguous results concerning the effect of drought stress on yield and physical fruit traits galindo et al 2018 in this sense a significant decrease of yield and fruit weight was observed in mollar de elche cultivar under sustained deficit irrigation sdi at 33 etc and likewise in rabab cultivar under sdi at 50 etc galindo et al 2014 parvizi et al 2016 that is in agreement with our results recorded in the studied cultivars except zheri automne cultivar in contrast centofanti et al 2017 found that in wonderful cultivar a severe water stress of 35 etc applied continuously during two years had no significant effect on yield and fruit weight as recorded in zheri automne cultivar similar results have been recorded by intrigliolo et al 2013 in mollar de elche cultivar with sdi at 50 etc over three consecutive years mechanisms responsible for maintaining yield and fruit weight in pomegranate under water stress remain until now understood however some researchers reported some avoidance and tolerance mechanisms involved in drought stress tolerance in pomegranate indeed aseri et al 2008 reported that from the beginning of water deficit conditions leaf conductance decreases in order to control water loss via transpiration and to avoid leaf turgor loss when sever water stress levels are reached active osmotic adjustment is triggered contributing to the maintenance of leaf turgor which can ensure normal photosynthetic activity thereby maintaining yield and fruit weight in addition other drought tolerance characteristics commonly seen in xeromorphic plants can be also observed in pomegranate such as a high relative apoplastic water content 42 58 which would contribute to the retention of water at low leaf water potentials rodríguez et al 2012 the contradictory results may be explained by differences not only in the cultivars used but also in environmental conditions soil and climate since contrary results are recorded for a similar cultivar in different areas the recorded reduction in fruit yield under water stress was linked to a decrease of fruit weight as indicated by the significant correlation between them table 4 however for the four cultivars bzou djebali gjeibi and zheri precoce the yield reduction resulted in addition to fruit drop since their fruit weight did not change under cdi treatment in this sense mills et al 1996 reported that in fruit trees subjected to water stress some fruits act as strong sinks of photosynthates and end up falling thereby maintaining the final fruit weight with a probably reduction of total yield that may result from fruit drop in addition it is important to emphasize that the decrease in fruit weight recorded in some cultivars was originating from proportional reduction of peel and aril weights likely because there was no significant effect of cdi treatment on aril content similar result was recorded in mollar de elche cultivar by mellisho et al 2012 who added that the decrease in peel content impacts more fruit quality by increasing fruit splitting incidence 3 2 vegetative growth the results regarding cdi effects on vegetative traits of the eleven cultivars are shown in table 5 no significant effect was observed on all vegetative traits in gordo de jativa grenade jaune zheri automne and zheri precoce cultivars while the others were differently affected by cdi treatment shoot length was highly reduced in response to water stress in gjeibi and sefri cultivars by respective rates of 78 and 64 followed by mollar osin hueso cultivar with a decrease of 38 compared to the control trees in gjeibi and sefri cultivars leaf area was also reduced by 15 and 10 respectively which was similar for ounk hmam 18 bzou 31 and grenade rouge cultivars 34 the number of leaves per shoot was reduced only in djebali cultivar by an average of 14 while wood density remains unchanged in all cultivars the observed reductions in vegetative traits were anticipated as other researchers have reported similar negative cdi effects on various fruits including pomegranate nasrabadi et al 2020 khattab et al 2012 wu et al 2013 however the no significant effect on vegetative growth of gordo de jativa grenade jaune zheri automne and zheri precoce cultivars indicates a triggering of particular mechanisms making them more drought tolerant intrigliolo et al 2013 observed a similar result on mollar de elche cultivar but which became significant after two years of water stress application this observation may imply that these cultivars respond late to water stress given to particular specificities possibly linked to differences in root growth or shoot growth kinetic in this sense it was observed in sefri cultivar that shoot growth reaches about 80 during the flowering period and begins to slow down since fruit set outghouliast et al 2019 thereby explaining the low sensitivity of vegetative growth observed in some cultivars to water stress applied during fruit growth period 3 3 chlorophyll content deficit irrigation induced a significant decrease of both the chlorophyll a cha and chlorophyll b chb contents in all cultivars except zheri precoce and particularly in grenade rouge cultivar the effect was only significant on cha content table 5 depending on the affected cultivars water stress effect on cha content was higher or similar than on chb content the cdi treatment reduced cha content by 27 in djebali cultivar to 66 in gordo de jativa and chb content by 10 in mollar osin hueso cultivar to 61 in ounk hmam the decrease of chlorophyll pigments concentration in response to water stress is often observed in various plants including pomegranate particularly under severe regime pourghayoumi et al 2017 it is mainly related to a reduction in nutrient uptake especially nitrogen and magnesium which are the main minerals in chlorophyll hepaksoy et al 2016 it is well known that a reduction in chlorophyll content reduce the interception of light energy required to photosynthesis thereby negatively affecting the productive potential of the plants however reduced leaf chlorophyll content may be of advantage in the search for drought stress tolerance possible reasons include better light distribution in the crop canopy and less photochemical damage to leaves absorbing more light energy than required for maximum photosynthesis reduced chlorophyll may also reduce the heat load at the top of canopy reducing water requirements to cool leaves in addition chloroplasts are nutrient rich and reducing their number may increase available nutrients for growth and development hamblin et al 2014 3 4 cluster analysis multivariate analysis based on mean ratios between cdi and fi treatments regarding all the measured traits showed high variation in drought stress tolerance among the studied pomegranate cultivars unweighted pair group method upgma cluster analysis using euclidean distance coefficient was performed to highlight the similarities and differences between these cultivars based on their response to water stress the cultivars were divided into three main clusters fig 2 cluster c1 included 4 cultivars subdivided into two distinctive and homogeneous subgroups c1 1 and c1 2 the first subgroup c1 1 contained 2 cultivars gjeibi and sefri on which water stress reduced fruit yield by an average of 24 shoot length was severely affected in these cultivars with a significant decrease in leaf area and chlorophyll concentration the second subgroup c1 2 contains gordo de jativa and ounk hmam cultivars discriminated by reduction of more than 50 in cha and chb contents under water stress associated with a significant decrease in yield and fruit weight the second cluster c2 included 6 cultivars subdivided into two subgroups c2 1 and c2 2 the first subgroup c2 1 contained bzou and djebali cultivars which respond similarly to water stress regarding fruit yield and chlorophyll pigments content their yield decreased by about 16 in response to cdi treatment compared to control trees the second subgroup c2 2 included the four cultivars grenade jaune zheri precoce mollar osin hueso and grenade rouge these cultivars were distinguished by significant changes in aril and seed weights in response to water stress they showed significant reduction in fruit yield by 24 40 fruit weight and chlorophyll pigments content were also affected in these cultivars however the last cluster included only zheri automne cultivar on which water stress affected only cha and chb contents with no significant effect on yield fruit and other vegetative traits the most discriminant water stress effects in this clustering concerned mainly fruit yield aril weight seed weight and cha content the high variation revealed by cluster analysis indicated the existence of different genetic pools within the pomegranate cultivars involved in this study in terms of drought stress tolerance analysis at the molecular biochemical and physiological levels is certainly needed to confirm the final clustering of the cultivars for drought tolerance however based on the measured traits the obtained clustering is of a great importance for farmers since it highlights similarities and differences between the studied cultivars for commercial patterns in arid areas the pools also may be used in molecular studies regarding the mechanisms involved and in pomegranate breeding programs to combine desirable traits under drought conditions 3 5 scoring method a scoring method based on transformed mean ratios between cdi and fi treatments was used to classify the studied cultivars for drought tolerance and to give more precision to cluster analysis the transformation of the mean ratios of each trait was done to obtain scores ranging from 1 to 10 within cultivars by assigning a score of 10 for highest or not significant ratio according to anova the highest total score indicated a high level of drought tolerance and vice versa except aril content and wood density on which water stress effect was not significant all other traits were included in this ranking method this method was usually used to determine the most drought tolerant genotypes in various crops according to the stability indexes of all traits since the identification of drought tolerant genotypes based on a single trait is often contradictory karipcin et al 2008 guerfel et al 2007 farshadfar et al 2012 according to the obtained scores shown in table 6 the most drought tolerant cultivar was zheri automne with a total score value of 93 followed by djebali and bzou cultivars with respective total score values of 86 and 80 however the less drought tolerant cultivars were grenade jaune ounk hmam and grenade rouge with total score values of 56 55 and 52 the obtained ranking of cultivars for drought tolerance according to this method was globally in agreement with cluster analysis results and added more precision with regard to the cultivars ranking within clusters c1 and c2 in addition the both methods raised a distinction of zheri automne cultivar from the others 4 conclusion the studied pomegranate cultivars exhibited wide variations for yield physical fruit traits and vegetative growth in response to water stress applied during fruit growth period each cultivar was affected in different traits except fruit aril content and wood density on which water stress effect was not significant in all cultivars the most frequent water stress effects were recorded on yield fruit weight and chlorophyll pigment contents ranking cultivars for drought tolerance based on a single trait was contradictory however using unweighted pair group method cluster analysis upgma based on mean ratios between cdi and fi treatments the cultivars were divided into three main clusters in terms of drought tolerance with regard to all measured traits the scoring method having been broadly consistent with cluster analysis classified zheri automne as the most drought tolerant cultivar followed by djebali and bzou while grenade jaune ounk hmam and grenade rouge were rather ranked as the less drought tolerant cultivar declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was supported by mcrdv project the authors would like to

10363,the aim of this study was to assess eleven mediterranean pomegranate cultivars for drought tolerance based on their responses to severe water stress the experiment was performed under field conditions in sais plain nw morocco on twelve year old pomegranate trees punica granatum l under drip irrigation for each cultivar two treatments were applied from fruit set to harvest a control treatment irrigated at 100 of seasonal etc fi and a continuous deficit treatment irrigated at 50 of etc cdi the measurements concerned fruit yield fruit weight aril content aril weight seed weight juice content shoot length leaf area foliage density wood density and concentration of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b results showed clear differences among pomegranate cultivars in response to water stress the most frequent effects of water stress were recorded on yield fruit weight and chlorophyll pigment contents fruit yield was not affected in zheri automne cultivar while it was significantly decreased under cdi in all other cultivars by 14 in bzou to 51 in ounk hmam a significant decrease of fruit weight was observed in six cultivars with a rate of 13 in gordo de jativa cultivar to 24 in average for grenade jaune grenade rouge and ounk hmam these last cultivars were the only ones affected in juice content by 9 11 regarding cdi effect on vegetative growth it was recorded a high decrease of shoot length in the cultivars gjeibi 78 sefri 64 and mollar osin hueso 38 the cultivars ranking for drought tolerance based on mean ratios of all traits between cdi and fi treatments was drawn according to cluster analysis combined to a scoring method it was thus retained that the most drought tolerant cultivar was zheri automne followed by djebali and bzou while grenade rouge cultivar was the most sensitive keywords climate change punica granatum l drought stress tolerance productive potential vegetative growth 1 introduction the mediterranean basin is among the most vulnerable regions to drought stress both currently and in future years as predicted by climate change scenarios senatore et al 2010 some investigations in this area warn of significant impacts on both mean precipitation and variability of hydrological systems with a predicting decrease of 20 in water availability brouzyine et al 2018 amengual et al 2012 mariotti et al 2008 in morocco as an integral country in this area the main temperature has increased by 0 42 c per decade since 1990 and the rainfall has decreased by more than 20 between 1961 and 2005 climate predictions indicate that the increased aridity will continue in morocco by an additional rise in temperature of 1 5 c by 2050 following the climate change scenario rcp4 5 or 2 c for rcp8 5 associated to a decrease in precipitation of about 15 woillez 2019 the low water availability combined with a high demand for water forced the moroccan farmers to adopt deficit irrigation programs whose severity could increase in future years according to climate change predictions el jaouhari et al 2018 therefore the moroccan agricultural stakeholders are called to develop reflections for the adoption of sustainable strategies to save water especially for the most water demanding crops such as fruit trees research works are focused on two main strategies to cope with water scarcity i the use of improved innovative and precise deficit irrigation management practices able to minimize the impact on productive potential and ii the use of plant materials less water demanding or able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality galindo et al 2018 in relation to these plant materials it is also important to underline for the case of fruit trees that it is essential to take into account the crops chill requirements in addition to the water needs to cope with global warming gratacos and cortes 2007 in relation with this last aspect pomegranate punica granatum l could be one of the interesting species to promote in arid areas due to its broad spectrum of environmental adaptation holland et al 2009 pomegranate is fairly drought tolerant although it requires regular irrigation throughout the season for commercial production especially when it is cultivated in arid and semiarid areas to reach optimal growth yield and fruit quality intrigliolo et al 2013 it requires low winter chill hours for breaking bud dormancy and can withstand temperatures of 12 c in winter and 42 c in summer rodríguez et al 2012 aseri et al 2008 for these reasons in addition to its tolerance to many soil types and high levels of water salinity this species is cultivated in different regions of the world in asia mediterranean countries and america blumenfeld et al 2000 in morocco pomegranate is produced in different areas from north to southwest with an overall production of 113 500 tons for an area around 12 700 ha mapmdref 2018 two groups of cultivars are grown in morocco i local ecotypes with soft seeds consumed fresh including mainly sefri grenade rouge grenade jaune bzou mesri laroussi as well as zheri automne and zheri precoce originating from tunisia and ii foreign varieties with hard seeds and acid juice generally destined for processing such as wonderful negro monstruoso and dwarf semi evergreen haddioui 2012 studies regarding drought stress tolerance in the moroccan pomegranate germplasm remain very limited some works carried out on the local cultivar sefri in tadla plain concluded that it is sensitive to water stress even moderate of 80 etc having reduced yield by 33 and fruit weight by 20 compared to full irrigation treatment 100 etc but without significant negative effect on shoot growth messaoudi et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge there have been no studies assessing drought stress tolerance in the other local cultivars the adoption of findings regarding the introduced foreign varieties obtained in other countries is not justified because they are not conclusive probably due to differences in soil proprieties and climate conditions for example in mollar de elche variety growing on sandy clay loam soil in spain similar yield levels were obtained in sustained deficit irrigation of 50 etc and control trees watered at 100 etc martínez nicolas et al 2019 however in sandy loam soil a significant decrease in fruit yield of this variety was observed originating from a decrease of fruit weight intrigliolo et al 2012 the studies on pomegranate drought stress tolerance are therefore specific to a particular ecosystem therefore the aim of this work was to investigate water stress tolerance in various moroccan cultivars and introduced foreign varieties of pomegranate in sais plain nw morocco to the best of our knowledge this

15 and 10 respectively which was similar for ounk hmam 18 bzou 31 and grenade rouge cultivars 34 the number of leaves per shoot was reduced only in djebali cultivar by an average of 14 while wood density remains unchanged in all cultivars the observed reductions in vegetative traits were anticipated as other researchers have reported similar negative cdi effects on various fruits including pomegranate nasrabadi et al 2020 khattab et al 2012 wu et al 2013 however the no significant effect on vegetative growth of gordo de jativa grenade jaune zheri automne and zheri precoce cultivars indicates a triggering of particular mechanisms making them more drought tolerant intrigliolo et al 2013 observed a similar result on mollar de elche cultivar but which became significant after two years of water stress application this observation may imply that these cultivars respond late to water stress given to particular specificities possibly linked to differences in root growth or shoot growth kinetic in this sense it was observed in sefri cultivar that shoot growth reaches about 80 during the flowering period and begins to slow down since fruit set outghouliast et al 2019 thereby explaining the low sensitivity of vegetative growth observed in some cultivars to water stress applied during fruit growth period 3 3 chlorophyll content deficit irrigation induced a significant decrease of both the chlorophyll a cha and chlorophyll b chb contents in all cultivars except zheri precoce and particularly in grenade rouge cultivar the effect was only significant on cha content table 5 depending on the affected cultivars water stress effect on cha content was higher or similar than on chb content the cdi treatment reduced cha content by 27 in djebali cultivar to 66 in gordo de jativa and chb content by 10 in mollar osin hueso cultivar to 61 in ounk hmam the decrease of chlorophyll pigments concentration in response to water stress is often observed in various plants including pomegranate particularly under severe regime pourghayoumi et al 2017 it is mainly related to a reduction in nutrient uptake especially nitrogen and magnesium which are the main minerals in chlorophyll hepaksoy et al 2016 it is well known that a reduction in chlorophyll content reduce the interception of light energy required to photosynthesis thereby negatively affecting the productive potential of the plants however reduced leaf chlorophyll content may be of advantage in the search for drought stress tolerance possible reasons include better light distribution in the crop canopy and less photochemical damage to leaves absorbing more light energy than required for maximum photosynthesis reduced chlorophyll may also reduce the heat load at the top of canopy reducing water requirements to cool leaves in addition chloroplasts are nutrient rich and reducing their number may increase available nutrients for growth and development hamblin et al 2014 3 4 cluster analysis multivariate analysis based on mean ratios between cdi and fi treatments regarding all the measured traits showed high variation in drought stress tolerance among the studied pomegranate cultivars unweighted pair group method upgma cluster analysis using euclidean distance coefficient was performed to highlight the similarities and differences between these cultivars based on their response to water stress the cultivars were divided into three main clusters fig 2 cluster c1 included 4 cultivars subdivided into two distinctive and homogeneous subgroups c1 1 and c1 2 the first subgroup c1 1 contained 2 cultivars gjeibi and sefri on which water stress reduced fruit yield by an average of 24 shoot length was severely affected in these cultivars with a significant decrease in leaf area and chlorophyll concentration the second subgroup c1 2 contains gordo de jativa and ounk hmam cultivars discriminated by reduction of more than 50 in cha and chb contents under water stress associated with a significant decrease in yield and fruit weight the second cluster c2 included 6 cultivars subdivided into two subgroups c2 1 and c2 2 the first subgroup c2 1 contained bzou and djebali cultivars which respond similarly to water stress regarding fruit yield and chlorophyll pigments content their yield decreased by about 16 in response to cdi treatment compared to control trees the second subgroup c2 2 included the four cultivars grenade jaune zheri precoce mollar osin hueso and grenade rouge these cultivars were distinguished by significant changes in aril and seed weights in response to water stress they showed significant reduction in fruit yield by 24 40 fruit weight and chlorophyll pigments content were also affected in these cultivars however the last cluster included only zheri automne cultivar on which water stress affected only cha and chb contents with no significant effect on yield fruit and other vegetative traits the most discriminant water stress effects in this clustering concerned mainly fruit yield aril weight seed weight and cha content the high variation revealed by cluster analysis indicated the existence of different genetic pools within the pomegranate cultivars involved in this study in terms of drought stress tolerance analysis at the molecular biochemical and physiological levels is certainly needed to confirm the final clustering of the cultivars for drought tolerance however based on the measured traits the obtained clustering is of a great importance for farmers since it highlights similarities and differences between the studied cultivars for commercial patterns in arid areas the pools also may be used in molecular studies regarding the mechanisms involved and in pomegranate breeding programs to combine desirable traits under drought conditions 3 5 scoring method a scoring method based on transformed mean ratios between cdi and fi treatments was used to classify the studied cultivars for drought tolerance and to give more precision to cluster analysis the transformation of the mean ratios of each trait was done to obtain scores ranging from 1 to 10 within cultivars by assigning a score of 10 for highest or not significant ratio according to anova the highest total score indicated a high level of drought tolerance and vice versa except aril content and wood density on which water stress effect was not significant all other traits were included in this ranking method this method was usually used to determine the most drought tolerant genotypes in various crops according to the stability indexes of all traits since the identification of drought tolerant genotypes based on a single trait is often contradictory karipcin et al 2008 guerfel et al 2007 farshadfar et al 2012 according to the obtained scores shown in table 6 the most drought tolerant cultivar was zheri automne with a total score value of 93 followed by djebali and bzou cultivars with respective total score values of 86 and 80 however the less drought tolerant cultivars were grenade jaune ounk hmam and grenade rouge with total score values of 56 55 and 52 the obtained ranking of cultivars for drought tolerance according to this method was globally in agreement with cluster analysis results and added more precision with regard to the cultivars ranking within clusters c1 and c2 in addition the both methods raised a distinction of zheri automne cultivar from the others 4 conclusion the studied pomegranate cultivars exhibited wide variations for yield physical fruit traits and vegetative growth in response to water stress applied during fruit growth period each cultivar was affected in different traits except fruit aril content and wood density on which water stress effect was not significant in all cultivars the most frequent water stress effects were recorded on yield fruit weight and chlorophyll pigment contents ranking cultivars for drought tolerance based on a single trait was contradictory however using unweighted pair group method cluster analysis upgma based on mean ratios between cdi and fi treatments the cultivars were divided into three main clusters in terms of drought tolerance with regard to all measured traits the scoring method having been broadly consistent with cluster analysis classified zheri automne as the most drought tolerant cultivar followed by djebali and bzou while grenade jaune ounk hmam and grenade rouge were rather ranked as the less drought tolerant cultivar declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10364,poplar populus xiaozhuanica plantations play an important role in controlling desertification in semiarid sandy regions of northeast china but their dieback occurs frequently in extreme drought years due to greater water loss by transpiration than water uptake however little is known about dynamics of canopy transpiration in poplar plantations which limits our understanding of dieback mechanisms and proper management of these poplar plantations here canopy transpiration and canopy conductance in 18 year old poplar plantations were quantified by sap flow measurements in combination with monitoring of concurrent environmental variables during two consecutive growing seasons in normal and wet years 2018 and 2019 results showed that daily canopy transpiration averaged 1 2 mm d 1 between 0 3 and 1 9 mm d 1 and 1 5 mm d 1 between 0 2 and 2 4 mm d 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively solar radiation explained more variability of daily canopy transpiration than vapor pressure deficit vpd in both years indicating that canopy transpiration was more controlled by radiation than by vpd total canopy transpiration during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 was 184 1 mm and 235 9 mm respectively accounting for 47 1 and 44 2 of precipitation over the same period sum of canopy transpiration soil evaporation and change in soil water storage was higher than precipitation in most months indicating that trees took up water from deep soil layer 1 0 m and groundwater additionally canopy conductance averaged 1 4 m s 1 and 1 9 m s 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively and decreased significantly with increasing vpd however sensitivity of canopy conductance to vpd decreased from 0 62 in 2018 to 0 27 in 2019 indicating a shift from more to less strict stomatal regulation these findings indicate that poplar plantations are vulnerable to dieback during extreme drought years with decline in groundwater level due to utilization of groundwater for higher canopy transpiration rate keywords sap flow solar radiation vapor pressure deficit groundwater canopy conductance 1 introduction water availability is the most limiting factor for tree survival and growth in semiarid and arid regions where evaporative demand exceeds precipitation and available water resources are very scarce ayyoub et al 2017 wang et al 2019 climate models have predicted increases in air temperature together with increases in the frequency and severity of drought events in most arid and semiarid regions gao et al 2018 matusick et al 2018 as a consequence the water available for trees is likely to decrease which will influence the tree physiological processes such as transpiration and related water use strategies that allow for tree growth and survival in semiarid and arid regions muñoz villers et al 2018 as shown in recent studies forest dieback and mortality worldwide are associated with global change induced drought and heat anderegg et al 2019 flake and weisberg 2019 ji et al 2020 therefore it is urgently necessary to assess tree transpiration and how it shifts from its normal function in the semiarid and arid regions such an assessment is essential for an understanding of tree survival strategies and water management moreover understanding tree transpiration will also contribute to providing more mechanistic insights into tree responses to drought under global change scenario leo et al 2013 ungar et al 2013 sánchez costa et al 2015 tree transpiration is a fundamental factor in understanding the ecophysiology of plantations and plays a crucial role in water budget in the arid and semiarid regions because it is the main component of evapotranspiration ungar et al 2013 tu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 tsuruta et al 2019 the accurate quantification of tree transpiration is thus significant for tree physiology ecohydrology and other fields of study zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b muñoz villers et al 2018 the thermal dissipation method granier 1987 is a commonly used method for measuring tree transpiration in various types of forests because it is easy to perform and is not limited by complex terrain or spatial heterogeneity hoelscher et al 2018 rana et al 2020 in addition the sap flux density measured by the thermal dissipation method can be scaled from representative individual trees to the stand level throughout the growing season bosch et al 2014 pasqualotto et al 2019 therefore the sap flow method has been widely applied to quantify tree and stand transpiration tree transpiration is regulated by the behavioural responses of stomata to environmental drivers such as the vapor pressure deficit solar radiation soil water availability and precipitation mcdowell et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 tie et al 2017 stomatal control of transpiration exerts an important influence on the balance between carbon uptake and water losses which influences tree survival and growth in arid and semiarid regions wieser et al 2014 urban et al 2017 muñoz villers et al 2018 for instance tree transpiration increases exponentially with the air vapor pressure deficit until a certain threshold at which the stomata close to maintain the water potential above a critical level this constraint contributes to avoiding embolism which jeopardizes the water conducting system in trees zhang et al 2017 additionally reduced soil water availability increases the hydraulic resistance between the soil and the root system preventing water movement from soil to plant leaves and triggers stomatal closure avoiding or postponing hydraulic failure manzoni et al 2014 ghimire et al 2018 under such conditions trees apply conservative water use strategies and appear to take up water from deeper soil layers and even from groundwater therefore a better understanding of the impact of environmental drivers on tree transpiration is critical for revealing mechanisms of transpiration control and water use strategies in forests tie et al 2017 the keerqin sandy land is one of the harshest desert areas in northern china and is also one of the key areas of the three north afforestation programme great green wall in china li et al 2020 song et al 2020a poplar populus xiaozhuanica a hybrid of populus simonii carr and populus nigra l var italica koehne is a common tree species that is widely used to grow protective forests to control desertification in keerqin sandy land because of its fast growth and high adaptability song et al 2020a these poplar plantations play an important role in controlling desertification and improving the local environment zheng et al 2012 song et al 2020a however canopy dieback and mortality often occur in poplar plantations during drought years which severely jeopardizes their ecological service functions previous studies have indicated that the water loss from transpiration being greater than the water uptake is the main cause of the canopy dieback and mortality in poplar plantations song et al 2020a however the dynamics of transpiration in poplar plantations are still unknown in addition precipitation exhibits strong interannual variations in the kereqin sandy land and warming trends will continue song et al 2016 song et al 2020a nevertheless the effects of environmental drivers on transpiration in poplar plantations are still not fully understood therefore it is vital to quantify canopy transpiration in poplar plantations and its response to environmental variables to provide some suggestions for water management in these plantations to avoid dieback and mortality the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify canopy transpiration and canopy conductance in a poplar plantation in a semiarid sandy region during two consecutive growing seasons in normal and wet years 2018 and 2019 2 determine the environmental and stomatal mechanisms of canopy transpiration control and 3 determine the water use strategies adopted by poplars 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region

semiarid climatic zone the mean annual temperature is approximately 6 7 c mean value for 1954 2010 the annual mean precipitation and the annual mean pan evaporation is 474 mm and 1500 mm mean value for 1954 2010 respectively song et al 2020b the major soil type is arenosols in which soil particles with diameters 0 06 mm accounts for 94 0 of the soil and those with diameters 0 06 mm account for 6

respectively the field capacity of sandy soil is 17 5 zhu et al 2008 the groundwater levels were approximately 7 4 and 6 7 m in 2018 and 2019 respectively the main tree species in the study region include pinus sylvestris var mongolica pinus tabuliformis p xiaozhuanica and ulmus pumila the area of poplar plantations occupies approximately 20 of the total area of the zhanggutai region 257 km2 zheng et al 2012 the species under the canopy of the plantations are annual grasses and herbs such as potentilla anserina cleistogenes chinensis artemisia frigida and setaria viridis song et al 2016 a 30 m by 30 m 900 m2 plot within the poplar plantation approximately 6 0 ha was selected for the sap flow measurements the poplar plantation was 18 years old in 2018 the tree density at the study site was 433 trees ha 1 in 2018 and 411 trees ha 1 in 2019 due to tree mortality the mean stem diameter at breast height dbh was 16 7 cm in 2018 and increased to 17 3 cm in 2019 the mean tree height was 11 6 m in 2018 and 12 0 m in 2019 the mean leaf area index lai was 0 56 m2 m 2 and 0 60 m2 m 2 during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 respectively lai was estimated by hemispherical photographs using a nikon coolpix 995 fitted with an fc e8 fisheye lens song et al 2020b five images in the plot were taken monthly using automatic exposure and upward looking images 1 0 m from the ground avoiding midday hours 2 2 meteorological variable measurement meteorological variables including the air temperature ta c relative humidity rh precipitation p mm wind speed ws m s 1 and solar radiation rs w m 2 were measured and recorded continuously every 1 h in an automatic zhanggutai weather station approximately 3 0 km apart from the studied plot during the measurement period in addition to the above measurements the air temperature and air relative humidity were also measured by a thermosensor 3688wd1 spectrum technologies inc aurora usa at 2 0 m height solar radiation was measured using a silicon pyranometer sensor 3670i spectrum technologies inc aurora usa at 2 0 m height these measurements were recorded every 10 min as averages by watchdog 1000 series data loggers campbell scientific logan ut usa near the studied plot the air vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from the air temperature and the relative humidity according to campbell and norman 1998 the volumetric soil water content θ was continuously monitored at a single location with ec 5 sensors decagon inc decagon usa within the plot the ec 5 sensors were installed at depths of 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm and 80 cm below the ground surface which represented the soil layers of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 100 cm respectively however θ data during the period from july 8 to july 29 in 2018 are missing due to equipment failure to reflect the interactive effects of climate drives on tree transpiration the daily reference evapotranspiration eto an integrated indicator involving radiation wind speed temperature and vapor pressure deficit was estimated by the penman monteith equation in fao 56 as follows based on the measured meteorological variables allen et al 1998 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t

september 30 in 2018 and 2019 using granier type thermal dissipation probes tdps granier 1987 each sensor consisted of a pair of probes 20 mm long and 2 mm in diameter and a copper constant thermocouple was placed in each probe based on the distribution of dbh fig 1 a seven and eight trees were selected as sample trees in april 2018 and 2019 respectively table 1 all probes were inserted into the north facing side of the trunk at a height of 1 3 m above the ground to minimize sun exposure song et al 2020b to install the probes the bark of the sample tree was removed until the cambium was exposed the distance between the two probes was approximately 15 cm the probes were mounted with waterproof silicone and covered with an aluminium box cover to avoid physical damage and solar radiation and to reduce the effects of ambient temperature fluctuation and rainfall shen et al 2015 tie et al 2017 song et al 2020b the temperature difference data between the heated and reference probes were recorded at 10 min intervals on a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa the sap flux density js can be calculated according to the standard calibration for the tdp method granier 1987 2 j s 0 0119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where js g cm 2 s 1 is the sap flux density δt c is the temperature difference between the two probes at any given time and δtm c is the maximum temperature difference between probes which was determined as the maximum value of daily δtm over a 7 10 day period to avoid underestimation of the night time sap flow lu et al 2004 the thermal dissipation method has been demonstrated to be highly reliable for sap flow measurements of populus spp di et al 2019 therefore it is believed to be valid for the poplars in the present study as there was only one probe per sample tree the azimuthal and radial variations in sap flux within the trees were not taken into account in this study we assumed that these variations were low di et al 2019 although we did not directly measure the circumferential and radial variations in sap flux density for poplar populus xiaozhuanica in the present study su et al 2010 measured the sap flux density at four depth in the xylem i e 10 20 30 and 40 mm of populus xiaozhuanica at the study site and found that there was no significant difference between the estimations of tree transpiration made from a single sensor at 20 mm and from the four integrated sensors at different depths to accurately quantify tree transpiration in poplar populus xiaozhuanica the circumferential and radial variations in sap flux density should be investigated in the future based on the above assumption the tree water consumption twc can then be calculated as 3 twc j s a s where as is the sapwood area cm2 to determine the sapwood area the staining method was applied to 12 trees outside the plot within the plantation chang et al 2014 in each tree increment cores were drilled at a height of 1 3 m using an increment borer 5 15 mm and water soluble red dye 0 5 acid fuchsin was then injected into the drilled hole using a plastic pipette after approximately 3 4 h an increment core at approximately 3 4 cm above the initial hole in each tree was collected the difference in color is clearly discernible e g sapwood appears pink and wetter than heartwood the sapwood thickness was measured with a ruler precision of 1 0 mm and the relationship between the sapwood area as and dbh was established fig 1b the canopy transpiration per unit of ground area ec mm d 1 was calculated by multiplying the mean js for all the sample trees javg and the total sapwood area of the studied plot per unit of ground area ag otieno et al 2014 song et al 2020b 4 j a v g i 1 n 7 o r 8 j s i a s i i 1 n 7 o r 8 a s i 5 e c j a v g a t

and 2019 respectively and ag is the area of the studied plot 900 m2 during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the sap flux was measured in the same trees except that one sample tree was added in 2019 table 1 the quality of the sensor readings was regularly controlled and if necessary sensors were replaced however the power was failure during the period of september 11 and september 30 in 2019 the missing data accounted for approximately 6 9 of all sap flow data across two years multiple linear regression between ec and eto was applied to fill the missing gap zheng and wang 2014 2 4 canopy conductance the canopy conductance gc m s 1 was calculated from the inverted penman monteith equation as follows zhang et al 2016 xu et al 2018 6 g c γ λ e c g a δ r n ρ c p v p d g a λ δ γ e c where

5 42 4 87 u 2 to quantify the decoupling extent of stomata from the atmosphere the decoupling coefficient ω was estimated in the present study ω ranges from zero to one when ω approaches zero stomatal control of the canopy transpiration is strong and a fractional change in canopy conductance leads to an equal fractional change in transpiration stomata exert less control on canopy transpiration as ω approaches one as a result the canopy transpiration is controlled more by solar radiation and is less dependent on the atmospheric humidity deficit jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 xu et al 2018 the ω can be calculated following kumagai et al 2004 and fu et al 2020 9 ω 1 1 γ δ γ g a g c 2 5 measurement of changes in soil water storage and soil evaporation to determine the water use strategies of the

soil water content of the ith layer di is the thickness of the ith soil layer cm and n is the number of soil layers considered n 4 the change in soil water storage δs at a monthly scale was calculated as follows 11 δ s s 1 s 2 where s1 is the soil water storage at the final stage the last day of each month during the growing season across the soil layer and s2 is the soil water storage at the beginning stage the first day of each month during the growing season across the soil layers in addition soil evaporation was measured by a microlysimeter which is a simple but effective method liu et al 2017a the microlysimeters were made of pvc material 10 cm in internal diameter and 30 cm in height the bottom of each micro lysimeter was capped with a nylon net to allow the free drainage of water five microlysimeters were installed uniformly in the studied plot the microlysimeters were weighed at the same time every day i e approximately 19 00 pm using an electronic balance with a precision of 0 1 g for each lysimeter the difference in the weights measured every 24 h one day is regarded as the daily evaporation from the soil the soil in the microlysimeter was replaced with soil from the surrounding area every 5 7 days to prevent any interference from the cessation of water exchange with the subsoil caused by root activities liu et al 2017a 2 6 data analysis significant differences in the micrometeorological variables ta vpd rs eto θ between the two growing seasons were tested using a paired samples t test to avoid the effect of stem capacitance on the analysis of transpiration responses to variations in environmental conditions the 10 min average values of ec and the environmental variables were averaged to the daily means wieser et al 2014 the significant of differences in ec gc and ω between the two years were tested using the paired samples t test the relationship between ec and θ was analysed by linear regression whereas the relationships between ec and vpd rs and eto were analysed by an exponential threshold model as below 12 e c a 1 e b x where a and b are the fitting parameters ec is the daily canopy transpiration and x is the corresponding meteorological

sensitivity to vpd and gcref is the reference canopy stomatal conductance for vpd 1 kpa ewers et al 2001 ancova was used to test for significant differences in m and gcref between the two years all statistical analyses were performed with spss 16 0 software package spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 microclimate and soil moisture the total precipitation during the growing season may september in 2018 and 2019 was 391 2 mm and 533 2 mm respectively accounting for 98 and 133 of the long term average precipitation over the same period 401 mm 1954 2010 fig 2 this indicated that 2018 was a normal year while 2019 was a wet year since the topsoil was exposed to precipitation and evaporation the θ in the upper layer increased quickly after precipitation events but decreased rapidly thereafter as a result the θ of shallow layers tended to be highly variable in both observed years however the θ of deeper soil layers was seasonally stable in 2018 whereas it exhibited similar changes to those in the shallow layers in 2019 the θ averaged 3 1 and 5 2 weight average during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 respectively ranging from 2 0 to 11 7 and from 2 2 to 11 9 fig 2 a significant difference in θ was observed between the two years t 11 3 p 0 001 with a higher value in 2019 the air temperature ta ranged from 8 3 to 34 8 c in the growing season of 2018 and from 10 3 to 31 3 c in the growing season in 2019 with the mean values of 23 8 and 23 0 c respectively fig 3 a significant differences in the daily mean ta were observed in both years t 2 13 p 0 05 with a higher value in 2018 the vapor pressure deficit vpd averaged 1 4 kpa and 1 2 kpa in the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 respectively ranging between 0 2 and 2 9 kpa and between 0 4 and 3 2 kpa fig 3b significant differences in the daily mean vpd were observed in both observed years t 2 90 p 0 01 with a higher value in 2018 the solar radiation rs varied between 37 8 and 365 5 w m 2 and between 15 5 and 374 3 w m 2 in the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 respectively with mean values of 227 8 and 238 0 w m 2 fig 3c there was no significant difference in the daily mean rs between two observed years t 1 10 p 0 05 the reference evapotranspiration eto averaged 6 0 mm d 1 in both growing seasons ranging from 0 9 to 11 3 mm d 1 in 2018 and from 1 2 to 12 0 mm d 1 in 2019 fig 3d no significant difference in mean daily eto was found between the two observed years t 0 33 p 0 05 these data suggest that the weather was warmer and drier in 2018 than in 2019 3 2 sap flux density and canopy transpiration the diurnal js during five representative days mean values for seven sample trees in 2018 and the corresponding environmental variables are shown in fig 4 on sunny days the sap flow generally increased from approximately 6 00 am reached a peak value at approximately 9 00 am and gradually decreased thereafter daily variations in js seemed to be associated with variations in ta vpd and rs e g js increased rapidly in the morning as the air temperature vpd and rs increased and reached a maximum and js subsequently decreased the daily ec reached an average of approximately 1 2 mm d 1 with a maximum of approximately 1 9 mm d 1 and a minimum of approximately 0 3 mm d 1 during the growing season in 2018 fig 5 during the growing season in 2019 the daily ec was between 0 2 and 2 4 mm d 1 with a mean value of approximately 1 5 mm d 1 fig 5 there was a similar monthly ec change pattern between the two growing seasons the maximum monthly ec was 41 5 mm and 51 1 mm in may of 2018 and 2019 respectively whereas the minimum monthly ec was 31 2 mm and 41 4 mm in august of 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 5 and table 2 the accumulated ec was 184 1 and 235 9 mm during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 respectively accounting for 47 1 and 44 2 of the precipitation over the same period table 2 in addition the precipitation was less than the sum of ec δs and soil evaporation in may june july and september of 2018 and june july and september of 2019 but this trend was reversed in the other months irrespective of canopy interception and understory transpiration table 2 3 3 relationships between environmental variables and canopy transpiration the daily ec exhibited an exponentially saturating response to vpd and tended to level off at higher values of vpd e g 1 5 kpa during the measurement period fig 6 a in addition the daily ec significantly increased with increasing rs in both years and rs explained 53 and 73 of the variation in daily ec in the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 6b the daily ec increased with increasing eto in both years and eto explained 50 and 74 of the variation in ec in the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 respectively

reached maximum values approximately 8 00 local time as the ta rs and vpd increased and subsequently decreased until night peaking before ta vpd and rs the daily gc averaged 1 4 and 1 9 m s 1 during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 respectively ranging from 0 6 to 4 0 m s 1 and from 0 8 to 3 9 m s 1 fig 8 a in addition the gc differed significantly between the two years with a higher value in 2019 t 7 65 p 0 001 the ω value ranged from 0 4 and 0 8 in both growing seasons with mean values of 0 6 in 2018 and 0 7 in 2019 respectively fig 8b additionally the ω value was significantly lower in 2018 than in 2019 t 7 46 p 0 001 the daily gc was significantly negatively correlated with vpd in both years and vpd explained approximately 62 and 17 of the variation in gc in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 9 a in addition the slope of the stomatal response to lnvpd m was significantly higher in 2018 than in 2019 but the reference stomatal conductance gcref was significantly higher in 2019 than in 2018 fig 9a furthermore the ratio of the stomatal sensitivity to the reference canopy stomatal conductance m gcref was 0 62 and 0 27 in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 9a moreover gc significantly linearly increased with increasing θ in both years and θ explained approximately 8 and 13 of the variation in gc in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 9b 4 discussion 4 1 canopy transpiration in the poplar plantation in the present study the mean daily ec for poplar plantations was 1 37 mm d 1 during the measurement period ranging from 0 21 to 2 35 mm d 1 which was within the range reported for other populus spp plantations 6 7 mm d 1 in other regions chang et al 2006 petzold et al 2011 shen et al 2015 bloemen et al 2017 however the mean daily ec of this study was high compared to the values reported for a pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation at the study site dbh of 17 1 cm with a density of 404 tree ha 1 0 75 mm d 1 han et al 2015 in fact the water availability in the pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation was higher than that in poplar plantation in this study e g the 8 mean θ at the 0 100 cm soil depth and 5 0 m groundwater level for the pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation therefore the higher mean daily canopy transpiration in the present study relative to that in the pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation was likely due to the higher average sap flux density and sapwood area of poplar figs 1 and 4 in addition the total ec during the growing season was higher in 2019 than in 2018 fig 5 indicating that poplar plantations could significantly increase their ec in response to increasing precipitation this finding was consistent with those of other studies showing that increases in canopy transpiration in plants were associated with increasing precipitation in semiarid and arid regions and vice versa chen et al 2011 brito et al 2015 fang et al 2019 however we observed that there was a 28 1 increase in the total ec 51 8 mm in response to a 36 increase in precipitation 142 mm in the present study table 2 in contrast to our findings zheng and wang 2014 observed only a 13 increase in ec in a haloxylon ammodendron plantation in response to a nearly 85 increase in precipitation during the growing season at the southern edge of the gurbantünggüt desert china song et al 2018 reported that a 61 precipitation increase brought only a 10 increase in the ec of pinus sylvestris var mongolica in a sparse wood grassland in the southern keerqin sandy land the high magnitude of the increase in ec in response to an increase in precipitation in this study may indicate a variable water use strategy in poplar trees that is possibly related to stomatal regulation gu et al 2017 this was supported by the response of canopy conductance to environmental variables at the hourly scale fig 7 the stoma opened gradually after sunrise and canopy transpiration increased rapidly because of the decreasing stomatal control on transpiration i e increasing ω fig 7 after the peak in gc the vpd increased continuously up to a certain value and the stomatal conductance and transpiration decreased as stomatal control gradually increased i e decreasing ω fig 7 this physiological process imposed a hydraulic limitation on the sap flow path in poplar trees and prevented excessive water losses under high evaporative demands chen et al 2011 fu et al 2020 irrespective of canopy interception and understory transpiration water output exceeded water input in most months during the measurement period table 2 indicating that trees took up water from the deep soil layer 1 m and or groundwater our results were consistent with the findings of other studies which reported that trees have the ability to tap water from deeper soil layers and or groundwater to maintain their transpiration when the topsoil moisture is exhausted brito et al 2015 fang et al 2019 most of the roots of poplar trees in the keerqin sandy land are distributed within a soil depth range of 100 cm but the maximum depth of the taproot can reach the groundwater level song et al 2020a therefore poplar trees can take up water from the deep soil layer and or groundwater when the upper soil water becomes insufficient in the study region in the same study site an isotope deuterium and oxygen analysis in xylem soil precipitation and groundwater also indicated that the poplar trees used deep soil water 1 m and groundwater in addition to shallow soil water and the contribution of groundwater to transpiration reached 37 4 in normal years song et al 2020a therefore poplar trees take up water from the capillary fringe or directly from groundwater which is an important strategy for coping with soil drought in semiarid sandy environments zhang et al 1999 fang et al 2019 4 2 environmental control of canopy transpiration in the poplar plantation in the present study the daily canopy transpiration increased sharply with increasing vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation and tended to level off at high levels of vapor pressure deficit in both years fig 6a and b these findings were consistent with those reported for populus spp trees and other tree species in other regions zhang et al 1999 chang et al 2006 wieser et al 2014 shen et al 2015 tie et al 2017 the saturation of canopy transpiration at high vapor pressure deficit levels is an important adaptive strategy evolved by poplar trees in semiarid sandy environments wieser et al 2014 brito et al 2015 liu et al 2015 song et al 2020b in addition more of the variability in the daily canopy transpiration was explained by solar radiation than by the vapor pressure deficit indicating that canopy transpiration was more controlled by solar radiation than by the vapor pressure deficit on a daily scale a similar phenomenon was reported by shen et al 2015 for populus gansuensis plantations in an arid inland river basin of northwest china and by zhang et al 2013 for populus alba l p talassica plantation in the arid desert area this may be because the canopy was partly decoupled from the atmosphere and as a result canopy transpiration became increasingly dependent on solar radiation and less dependent on atmospheric vapor pressure deficit wullschleger et al 1998 this was demonstrated by the ω values in both years fig 8b 0 6 and 0 7 in 2018 and 2019 respectively which approached one xu et al 2018 the extent of the ec variation explained by eto was no higher than that explained by rs fig 6 which further verified that solar radiation is the main driver of canopy transpiration for poplar furthermore clear relationships between the daily canopy transpiration and soil moisture were not found in either year fig 6d that is consistent with other studies in which there was no significant relationship between canopy transpiration in plantations and soil moisture on a daily scale jiao et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a the lack of a significant relationship between soil moisture and canopy transpiration on a daily scale might be because seasonal variation weakened the effect of soil moisture on stomatal conductance during the growing seasons liu et al 2017b song et al 2020b in addition the utilization of deep soil water 1 0 m and or groundwater by poplar trees also contributes to weakening this effect brito et al 2015 song et al 2020b tree transpiration was regulated by stomatal conductance the lower gc in 2018 than in 2019 fig 8a indicated that trees reduced gc in response to a decrease in precipitation and soil moisture this was because the hydraulic resistance between soil and root systems increased as soil water availability decreased which prevented water movement from the soil to the plant leaves and subsequently resulted in stomatal closure tognetti et al 2009 li et al 2016 this was also supported by the positive relationships between gc and θ in both years fig 9b in addition we found that the ratio of stomatal sensitivity to reference canopy stomatal conductance m gcref for the poplar trees decreased from 0 62 in 2018 to 0 27 in 2019 generally the ratio of stomatal sensitivity to reference canopy stomatal conductance m gcref is approximately 0 6 across a large range of species and environmental conditions indicating the stomatal regulation of water potential to prevent xylem cavitation isohydric strategy nevertheless the ratio is lower than 0 6 as a result of trees that exhibit less strict water potential regulation oren et al 1999 ewers et al 2005 naithani et al 2012 therefore our results indicate that the poplar trees showed relatively strict stomatal regulation in 2018 igarashi et al 2015 whereas they showed relatively less strict stomatal regulation of water loss more anisohydric in 2019 oren et al 1999 ogle and reynolds 2002 the shift from relatively more to less strict stomatal regulation from normal to wet years in poplar trees in the present study may indicate that the trees showed flexible stomatal regulation of transpiration domec and johnson 2012 this was also demonstrated by ω values which changed from 0 6 in 2018 to 0 7 in 2019 fig 8b 4 3 implications for forest and water management in the present study precipitation could not satisfy the high transpiration demand of the poplar plantation therefore trees took up water from the deep soil layer 1 0 m and from groundwater however in the study region precipitation exhibits strong interannual variations and extremely low precipitation approximately half of the long term mean value occurrs at an interval of 15 years in addition the groundwater level has gradually declined since the 1950s with a rate of decrease of 0 7 m every 10 years in a drought year the decline in the groundwater level can be especially precipitous song et al 2020a e g it decreased from 6 5 m to 8 3 m during the growing season in 2018 at the study site data not shown most studies have shown that severe and abrupt groundwater level declines may lead to severe water stress for trees casuing crown dieback or even tree death david et al 2013 therefore poplar plantations are vulnerable to dieback during extreme drought years with a sharp decline in the groundwater level our findings have important implications for afforestation forest and water management in this semiarid sandy region reforestation with poplar is undoubtedly the most practical means of immobilizing shifting sand dunes due to the fast growth of poplar zheng et al 2012 song et al 2020a however the poplar trees should be planted where the groundwater level is shallow so that the groundwater or capillary water will be directly utilized by the trees and thus contribute to maintaining higher transpiration to maintain the stability of poplar plantations the tree density should be reduced to lower canopy transpiration and interception and to increase the soil water availability for the remaining trees and thus reduce their dependence on groundwater giuggiola et al 2013 song et al 2016 furthermore zheng et al 2012 reported that the decline in groundwater level in the study region was mainly due to the increase in water use for the expansion of agricultural land and broadleaved forests therefore to maintain the local water balance and the stability of poplar plantations the area covered by agricultural land and poplar plantations should be reduced or transformed into coniferous forests shrublands and grasslands with low water consumption zheng et al 2012 song et al 2016 5 conclusions daily canopy transpiration averaged 1 2 mm d 1 and 1 5 mm d 1 during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 daily canopy transpiration was more controlled by solar radiation than by the vapor pressure deficit the trees used deep soil water 1 0 m and groundwater to maintain higher canopy transpiration in most months during the measurement period canopy conductance decreased significantly with increasing vpd in both years however the sensitivity of canopy conductance to vpd decreased from 0 62 in 2018 to 0 27 in 2019 indicating a shift from more to less strict stomatal regulation therefore poplar plantations are vulnerable to dieback during extreme drought years with the decline in the groundwater level becasue the trees utilized groundwater to maintain higher canopy transpiration rates to maintain the stability of poplar plantations in this semiarid sandy region suitable afforestation site selection thinning and land use type transformation practices should be adopted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10364,poplar populus xiaozhuanica plantations play an important role in controlling desertification in semiarid sandy regions of northeast china but their dieback occurs frequently in extreme drought years due to greater water loss by transpiration than water uptake however little is known about dynamics of canopy transpiration in poplar plantations which limits our understanding of dieback mechanisms and proper management of these poplar plantations here canopy transpiration and canopy conductance in 18 year old poplar plantations were quantified by sap flow measurements in combination with monitoring of concurrent environmental variables during two consecutive growing seasons in normal and wet years 2018 and 2019 results showed that daily canopy transpiration averaged 1 2 mm d 1 between 0 3 and 1 9 mm d 1 and 1 5 mm d 1 between 0 2 and 2 4 mm d 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively solar radiation explained more variability of daily canopy transpiration than vapor pressure deficit vpd in both years indicating that canopy transpiration was more controlled by radiation than by vpd total canopy transpiration during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 was 184 1 mm and 235 9 mm respectively accounting for 47 1 and 44 2 of precipitation over the same period sum of canopy transpiration soil evaporation and change in soil water storage was higher than precipitation in most months indicating that trees took up water from deep soil layer 1 0 m and groundwater additionally canopy conductance averaged 1 4 m s 1 and 1 9 m s 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively and decreased significantly with increasing vpd however sensitivity of canopy conductance to vpd decreased from 0 62 in 2018 to 0 27 in 2019 indicating a shift from more to less strict stomatal regulation these findings indicate that poplar plantations are vulnerable to dieback during extreme drought years with decline in groundwater level due to utilization of groundwater for higher canopy transpiration rate keywords sap flow solar radiation vapor pressure deficit groundwater canopy conductance 1 introduction water availability is the most limiting factor for tree survival and growth in semiarid and arid regions where evaporative demand exceeds precipitation and available water resources are very scarce ayyoub et al 2017 wang et al 2019 climate models have predicted increases in air temperature together with increases in the frequency and severity of drought events in most arid and semiarid regions gao et al 2018 matusick et al 2018 as a consequence the water available for trees is likely to decrease which will influence the tree physiological processes such as transpiration and related water use strategies that allow for tree growth and survival in semiarid and arid regions muñoz villers et al 2018 as shown in recent studies forest dieback and mortality worldwide are associated with global change induced drought and heat anderegg et al 2019 flake and weisberg 2019 ji et al 2020 therefore it is urgently necessary to assess tree transpiration and how it shifts from its normal function in the semiarid and arid regions such an assessment is essential for an understanding of tree survival strategies and water management moreover understanding tree transpiration will also contribute to providing more mechanistic insights into tree responses to drought under global change scenario leo et al 2013 ungar et al 2013 sánchez costa et al 2015 tree transpiration is a fundamental factor in understanding the ecophysiology of plantations and plays a crucial role in water budget in the arid and semiarid regions because it is the main component of evapotranspiration ungar et al 2013 tu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 tsuruta et al 2019 the accurate quantification of tree transpiration is thus significant for tree physiology ecohydrology and other fields of study zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b muñoz villers et al 2018 the thermal dissipation method granier 1987 is a commonly used method for measuring tree transpiration in various types of forests because it is easy to perform and is not limited by complex terrain or spatial heterogeneity hoelscher et al 2018 rana et al 2020 in addition the sap flux density measured by the thermal dissipation method can be scaled from representative individual trees to the stand level throughout the growing season bosch et al 2014 pasqualotto et al 2019 therefore the sap flow method has been widely applied to quantify tree and stand transpiration tree transpiration is regulated by the behavioural responses of stomata to environmental drivers such as the vapor pressure deficit solar radiation soil water availability and precipitation mcdowell et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 tie et al 2017 stomatal control of transpiration exerts an important influence on the balance between carbon uptake and water losses which influences tree survival and growth in arid and semiarid regions wieser et al 2014 urban et al 2017 muñoz villers et al 2018 for instance tree transpiration increases exponentially with the air vapor pressure deficit until a certain threshold at which the stomata close to maintain the water potential above a critical level this constraint contributes to avoiding embolism which jeopardizes the water conducting system in trees zhang et al 2017 additionally reduced soil water availability increases the hydraulic resistance between the soil and the root system preventing water movement from soil to plant leaves and triggers stomatal closure avoiding or postponing hydraulic failure manzoni et al 2014 ghimire et al 2018 under such conditions trees apply conservative water use strategies and appear to take up water from deeper soil layers and even from groundwater therefore a better understanding of the impact of environmental drivers on tree transpiration is critical for revealing mechanisms of transpiration control and water use strategies in forests tie et al 2017 the keerqin sandy land is one of the harshest desert areas in northern china and is also one of the key areas of the three north afforestation programme great green wall in china li et al 2020 song et al 2020a poplar populus xiaozhuanica a hybrid of populus simonii carr and populus nigra l var italica koehne is a common tree species that is widely used to grow protective forests to control desertification in keerqin sandy land because of its fast growth and high adaptability song et al 2020a these poplar plantations play an important role in controlling desertification and improving the local environment zheng et al 2012 song et al 2020a however canopy dieback and mortality often occur in poplar plantations during drought years which severely jeopardizes their ecological service functions previous studies have indicated that the water loss from transpiration being greater than the water uptake is the main cause of the canopy dieback and mortality in poplar plantations song et al 2020a however the dynamics of transpiration in poplar plantations are still unknown in addition precipitation exhibits strong interannual variations in the kereqin sandy land and warming trends will continue song et al 2016 song et al 2020a nevertheless the effects of environmental drivers on transpiration in poplar plantations are still not fully understood therefore it is vital to quantify canopy transpiration in poplar plantations and its response to environmental variables to provide some suggestions for water management in these plantations to avoid dieback and mortality the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify canopy transpiration and canopy conductance in a poplar plantation in a semiarid sandy region during two consecutive growing seasons in normal and wet years 2018 and 2019 2 determine the environmental and stomatal mechanisms of canopy transpiration control and 3 determine the water use strategies adopted by poplars 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region this study was conducted in the zhanggutai region 42 43 n 122 22 e 226 m a s l liaoning province china which is located in the southeastern part of the keerqin sandy land this region is part of the semiarid climatic zone the mean annual temperature is approximately 6 7 c mean value for 1954 2010 the annual mean precipitation and the annual mean pan evaporation is 474 mm and 1500 mm mean value for 1954 2010 respectively song et al 2020b the major soil type is arenosols in which soil particles with diameters 0 06 mm accounts for 94 0 of the soil and those with diameters 0 06 mm account for 6 0 the average depth of the soil in the study region is approximately 107 cm zhu et al 2003 the noncapillary porosity capillary porosity and total porosity of the sandy soil are 0 02 0 32 and 0 34 respectively the field capacity of sandy soil is 17 5 zhu et al 2008 the groundwater levels were approximately 7 4 and 6 7 m in 2018 and 2019 respectively the main tree species in the study region include pinus sylvestris var mongolica pinus tabuliformis p xiaozhuanica and ulmus pumila the area of poplar plantations occupies approximately 20 of the total area of the zhanggutai region 257 km2 zheng et al 2012 the species under the canopy of the plantations are annual grasses and herbs such as potentilla anserina cleistogenes chinensis artemisia frigida and setaria viridis song et al 2016 a 30 m by 30 m 900 m2 plot within the poplar plantation approximately 6 0 ha was selected for the sap flow measurements the poplar plantation was 18 years old in 2018 the tree density at the study site was 433 trees ha 1 in 2018 and 411 trees ha 1 in 2019 due to tree mortality the mean stem diameter at breast height dbh was 16 7 cm in 2018 and increased to 17 3 cm in 2019 the mean tree height was 11 6 m in 2018 and 12 0 m in 2019 the mean leaf area index lai was 0 56 m2 m 2 and 0 60 m2 m 2 during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 respectively lai was estimated by hemispherical photographs using a nikon coolpix 995 fitted with an fc e8 fisheye lens song et al 2020b five images in the plot were taken monthly using automatic exposure and upward looking images 1 0 m from the ground avoiding midday hours 2 2 meteorological variable measurement meteorological variables including the air temperature ta c relative humidity rh precipitation p mm wind speed ws m s 1 and solar radiation rs w m 2 were measured and recorded continuously every 1 h in an automatic zhanggutai weather station approximately 3 0 km apart from the studied plot during the measurement period in addition to the above measurements the air temperature and air relative humidity were also measured by a thermosensor 3688wd1 spectrum technologies inc aurora usa at 2 0 m height solar radiation was measured using a silicon pyranometer sensor 3670i spectrum technologies inc aurora usa at 2 0 m height these measurements were recorded every 10 min as averages by watchdog 1000 series data loggers campbell scientific logan ut usa near the studied plot the air vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from the air temperature and the relative humidity according to campbell and norman 1998 the volumetric soil water content θ was continuously monitored at a single location with ec 5 sensors decagon inc decagon usa within the plot the ec 5 sensors were installed at depths of 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm and 80 cm below the ground surface which represented the soil layers of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 100 cm respectively however θ data during the period from july 8 to july 29 in 2018 are missing due to equipment failure to reflect the interactive effects of climate drives on tree transpiration the daily reference evapotranspiration eto an integrated indicator involving radiation wind speed temperature and vapor pressure deficit was estimated by the penman monteith equation in fao 56 as follows based on the measured meteorological variables allen et al 1998 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t

september 30 in 2018 and 2019 using granier type thermal dissipation probes tdps granier 1987 each sensor consisted of a pair of probes 20 mm long and 2 mm in diameter and a copper constant thermocouple was placed in each probe based on the distribution of dbh fig 1 a seven and eight trees were selected as sample trees in april 2018 and 2019 respectively table 1 all probes were inserted into the north facing side of the trunk at a height of 1 3 m above the ground to minimize sun exposure song et al 2020b to install the probes the bark of the sample tree was removed until the cambium was exposed the distance between the two probes was approximately 15 cm the probes were mounted with waterproof silicone and covered with an aluminium box cover to avoid physical damage and solar radiation and to reduce the effects of ambient temperature fluctuation and rainfall shen et al 2015 tie et al 2017 song et al 2020b the temperature difference data between the heated and reference probes were recorded at 10 min intervals on a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa the sap flux density js can be calculated according to the standard calibration for the tdp method granier 1987 2 j s 0 0119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where js g cm 2 s 1 is the sap flux density δt c is the temperature difference between the two probes at any given time and δtm c is the maximum temperature difference between probes which was determined as the maximum value of daily δtm over a 7 10 day period to avoid underestimation of the night time sap flow lu et al 2004 the thermal dissipation method has been demonstrated to be highly reliable for sap flow measurements of populus spp di et al 2019 therefore it is believed to be valid for the poplars in the present study as there was only one probe per sample tree the azimuthal and radial variations in sap flux within the trees were not taken into account in this study we assumed that these variations were low di et al 2019 although we did not directly measure the circumferential and radial variations in sap flux density for poplar populus xiaozhuanica in the present study su et al 2010 measured the sap flux density at four depth in the xylem i e 10 20 30 and 40 mm of populus xiaozhuanica at the study site and found that there was no significant difference between the estimations of tree transpiration made from a single sensor at 20 mm and from the four integrated sensors at different depths to accurately quantify tree transpiration in poplar populus xiaozhuanica the circumferential and radial variations in sap flux density should be investigated in the future based on the above assumption the tree water consumption twc can then be calculated as 3 twc j s a s where as is the sapwood area cm2 to determine the sapwood area the staining method was applied to 12 trees outside the plot within the plantation chang et al 2014 in each tree increment cores were drilled at a height of 1 3 m using an increment borer 5 15 mm and water soluble red dye 0 5 acid fuchsin was then injected into the drilled hole using a plastic pipette after approximately 3 4 h an increment core at approximately 3 4 cm above the initial hole in each tree was collected the difference in color is clearly discernible e g sapwood appears pink and wetter than heartwood the sapwood thickness was measured with a ruler precision of 1

table 1 the quality of the sensor readings was regularly controlled and if necessary sensors were replaced however the power was failure during the period of september 11 and september 30 in 2019 the missing data accounted for approximately 6 9 of all sap flow data across two years multiple linear regression between ec and eto was applied to fill the missing gap zheng and wang 2014 2 4 canopy conductance the canopy conductance gc m s 1 was calculated from the inverted penman monteith equation as follows zhang et al 2016 xu et al 2018 6 g c γ λ e c g a δ r n ρ c p v p d g a λ δ γ e c where λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water 2 45 mj kg 1 ec is the canopy transpiration per unit of ground area mm d 1 δ is the ratio of the saturated vapor pressure to temperature kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 which was derived from the measured solar radiation at 2 0 m height using the formula rn 0 7965rs 57 64 zeppel et al 2008 ρ is the air density kg m 3 cp is the specific heat

fu et al 2020 7 g a 1 0 54 u z ln z d z o 2 where uz is the wind speed above the canopy m s 1 z is the wind speed measurement height canopy height m zo is the roughness height usually 0 1 h and h are the canopy heights and d is the displacement height 0 75 h sommer et al 2002 xu et al 2018 uz was calculated from the measured wind speed at 2 0 m height based on eq 8 allen et al 1998 8 u z ln 67 8 z 5 42 4 87 u 2 to quantify the decoupling extent of stomata from the atmosphere the decoupling coefficient ω was estimated in the present study ω ranges from zero to one when ω approaches zero stomatal control of the canopy transpiration is strong and a fractional change in canopy conductance leads to an equal fractional change in transpiration stomata exert less control on canopy transpiration as ω approaches one as a result the canopy transpiration is controlled more by solar radiation and is less dependent on the atmospheric humidity deficit jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 xu et al 2018 the ω can be calculated following kumagai et al 2004 and fu et al 2020 9 ω 1 1 γ δ γ g a g c 2 5 measurement of changes in soil water storage and soil evaporation to determine the water use strategies of the plantation trees the changes in soil water storage and soil evaporation were also measured in the present study soil water storage s mm is calculated as 10 s i 1 n θ i d i where θi is the volumetric soil water content of the ith layer di is the thickness of the ith soil layer cm and n is the number of soil layers considered n 4 the change in soil water storage δs at a monthly scale was calculated as follows 11 δ s s 1 s 2 where s1 is the soil water storage at the final stage the last day of each month during the growing season across the soil layer and s2 is the soil water storage at the beginning stage the first day of each month during the growing season across the soil layers in addition soil evaporation was measured by a microlysimeter which is a simple but effective method liu et al 2017a the microlysimeters were made of pvc material 10 cm in internal diameter and 30 cm in height the bottom of each micro lysimeter was capped with a nylon net to allow the free drainage of water five microlysimeters were installed uniformly in the studied plot the microlysimeters were weighed at the same time every day i e approximately 19 00 pm using an electronic balance with a precision of 0 1 g for each lysimeter the difference in the weights measured every 24 h one day is regarded as the daily evaporation from the soil the soil in the microlysimeter was replaced with soil from the surrounding area every 5 7 days to prevent any interference from the cessation of water exchange with the subsoil caused by root activities liu et al 2017a 2 6 data analysis significant differences in the micrometeorological variables ta vpd rs eto θ between the two growing seasons were tested using a paired samples t test to avoid the effect of stem capacitance on the analysis of transpiration responses to variations in environmental conditions the 10 min average values of ec and the environmental variables were averaged to the daily means wieser et al 2014 the significant of differences in ec gc and ω between the two years were tested using the paired samples t test the relationship between ec and θ was analysed by linear regression whereas the relationships between ec and vpd rs and eto were analysed by an exponential threshold model as below 12 e c a 1 e b x where a and b are the fitting parameters ec is the daily canopy transpiration and x is the corresponding meteorological variable the responses of gc to vpd were examined using the following a linear logarithmic function oren et al 1999 13 g c m ln v p d g cref where gc is the canopy conductance m is the stomatal sensitivity to vpd and gcref is the reference canopy stomatal conductance for vpd 1 kpa ewers et al 2001 ancova was used to test for significant differences in m and gcref between the two years all statistical analyses were performed with spss 16 0 software package spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 microclimate and soil moisture the total precipitation during the growing season may september in 2018 and 2019 was 391 2 mm and 533 2 mm respectively accounting for 98 and 133 of the long term average precipitation over the same period 401 mm 1954 2010 fig 2 this indicated that 2018 was a normal year while 2019 was a wet year since the topsoil was exposed to precipitation and evaporation the θ in the upper layer increased quickly after precipitation events but decreased rapidly thereafter as a result the θ of shallow layers tended to be highly variable in both observed years however the θ of deeper soil layers was seasonally stable in 2018 whereas it exhibited similar changes to those in the shallow layers in 2019 the θ averaged 3 1 and 5 2 weight average during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 respectively ranging from 2 0 to 11 7 and from 2 2 to 11 9 fig 2 a significant difference in θ was observed between the two years t 11 3 p 0 001 with a higher value in 2019 the air temperature ta ranged from 8 3 to 34 8 c in the growing season of 2018 and from 10 3 to 31 3 c in the growing season in 2019 with the mean values of 23 8 and 23 0 c respectively fig 3 a significant differences in the daily mean ta were observed in both years t 2 13 p 0 05 with a higher value in 2018 the vapor pressure deficit vpd averaged 1 4 kpa and 1 2 kpa in the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 respectively ranging between 0 2 and 2 9 kpa and between 0 4 and 3 2 kpa fig 3b significant differences in the daily mean vpd were observed in both observed years t 2 90 p 0 01 with a higher value in 2018 the solar radiation rs varied between 37 8 and 365 5 w m 2 and between 15 5 and 374 3 w m 2 in the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 respectively with mean values of 227 8 and 238 0 w m 2 fig 3c there was no significant difference in the daily mean rs between two observed years t 1 10 p 0 05 the reference evapotranspiration eto averaged 6 0 mm d 1 in both growing seasons ranging from 0 9 to 11 3 mm d 1 in 2018 and from 1 2 to 12 0 mm d 1 in 2019 fig 3d no significant difference in mean daily eto was found between the two observed years t 0 33 p 0 05 these data suggest that the weather was warmer and drier in 2018 than in 2019 3 2 sap flux density and canopy transpiration the diurnal js during five representative days mean values for seven sample trees in 2018 and the corresponding environmental variables are shown in fig 4 on sunny days the sap flow generally increased from approximately 6 00 am reached a peak value at approximately 9 00 am and gradually decreased thereafter daily variations in js seemed to be associated with variations in ta vpd and rs e g js increased rapidly in the morning as the air temperature vpd and rs increased and reached a maximum and js subsequently decreased the daily ec reached an average of approximately 1 2 mm d 1 with a maximum of approximately 1 9 mm d 1 and a minimum of approximately 0 3 mm d 1 during the growing season in 2018 fig 5 during the growing season in 2019 the daily ec was between 0 2 and 2 4 mm d 1 with a mean value of approximately 1 5 mm d 1 fig 5 there was a similar monthly ec change pattern between the two growing seasons the maximum monthly ec was 41 5 mm and 51 1 mm in may of 2018 and 2019 respectively whereas the minimum monthly ec was 31 2 mm and 41 4 mm in august of 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 5 and table 2 the accumulated ec was 184 1 and 235 9 mm during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 respectively accounting for 47 1 and 44 2 of the precipitation over the same period table 2 in addition the precipitation was less than the sum of ec δs and soil evaporation in may june july and september of 2018 and june july and september of 2019 but this trend was reversed in the other months irrespective of canopy interception and understory transpiration table 2 3 3 relationships between environmental variables and canopy transpiration the daily ec exhibited an exponentially saturating response to vpd and tended to level off at higher values of vpd e g 1 5 kpa during the measurement period fig 6 a in addition the daily ec significantly increased with increasing rs in both years and rs explained 53 and 73 of the variation in daily ec in the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 6b the daily ec increased with increasing eto in both years and eto explained 50 and 74 of the variation in ec in the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 6c however there were no significant relationships between the daily ec and θ in either years fig 6d 3 4 canopy conductance and its relationship with vpd diurnal variations in the hourly canopy conductance gc decoupling coefficient ω corresponding hourly air temperature ta vapor pressure deficit vpd and solar radiation rs on typical sunny days are shown in fig 7 the diurnal variations in hourly gc and ω followed a unimodal pattern fig 7a which was closely related to the changes in hourly ta vpd and rs fig 7b c and d the gc and ω began to rise after sunrise increased sharply and reached maximum values approximately 8 00 local time as the ta rs and vpd increased and subsequently decreased until night peaking before ta vpd and rs the daily gc averaged 1 4 and 1 9 m s 1 during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 respectively ranging from 0 6 to 4 0 m s 1 and from 0 8 to 3 9 m s 1 fig 8 a in addition the gc differed significantly between the two years with a higher value in 2019 t 7 65 p 0 001 the ω value ranged from 0 4 and 0 8 in both growing seasons with mean values of 0 6 in 2018 and 0 7 in 2019 respectively fig 8b additionally the ω value was significantly lower in 2018 than in 2019 t 7 46 p 0 001 the daily gc was significantly negatively correlated with vpd in both years and vpd explained approximately 62 and 17 of the variation in gc in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 9 a in addition the slope of the stomatal response to lnvpd m was significantly higher in 2018 than in 2019 but the reference stomatal conductance gcref was significantly higher in 2019 than in 2018 fig 9a furthermore the ratio of the stomatal sensitivity to the reference canopy stomatal conductance m gcref was 0 62 and 0 27 in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 9a moreover gc significantly linearly increased with increasing θ in both years and θ explained approximately 8 and 13 of the variation in gc in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 9b 4 discussion 4 1 canopy transpiration in the poplar plantation in the present study the mean daily ec for poplar plantations was 1 37 mm d 1 during the measurement period ranging from 0 21 to 2 35 mm d 1 which was within the range reported for other populus spp plantations 6 7 mm d 1 in other regions chang et al 2006 petzold et al 2011 shen et al 2015 bloemen et al 2017 however the mean daily ec of this study was high compared to the values reported for a pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation at the study site dbh of 17 1 cm with a density of 404 tree ha 1 0 75 mm d 1 han et al 2015 in fact the water availability in the pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation was higher than that in poplar plantation in this study e g the 8 mean θ at the 0 100 cm soil depth and 5 0 m groundwater level for the pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation therefore the higher mean daily canopy transpiration in the present study relative to that in the pinus sylvestris var mongolica plantation was likely due to the higher average sap flux density and sapwood area of poplar figs 1 and 4 in addition the total ec during the growing season was higher in 2019 than in 2018 fig 5 indicating that poplar plantations could significantly increase their ec in response to increasing precipitation this finding was consistent with those of other studies showing that increases in canopy transpiration in plants were associated with increasing precipitation in semiarid and arid regions and vice versa chen et al 2011 brito et al 2015 fang et al 2019 however we observed that there was a 28 1 increase in the total ec 51 8 mm in response to a 36 increase in precipitation 142 mm in the present study table 2 in contrast to our findings zheng and wang 2014 observed only a 13 increase in ec in a haloxylon ammodendron plantation in response to a nearly 85 increase in precipitation during the growing season at the southern edge of the gurbantünggüt desert china song et al 2018 reported that a 61 precipitation increase brought only a 10 increase in the ec of pinus sylvestris var mongolica in a sparse wood grassland in the southern keerqin sandy land the high magnitude of the increase in ec in response to an increase in precipitation in this study may indicate a variable water use strategy in poplar trees that is possibly related to stomatal regulation gu et al 2017 this was supported by the response of canopy conductance to environmental variables at the hourly scale fig 7 the stoma opened gradually after sunrise and canopy transpiration increased rapidly because of the decreasing stomatal control on transpiration i e increasing ω fig 7 after the peak in gc the vpd increased continuously up to a certain value and the stomatal conductance and transpiration decreased as stomatal control gradually increased i e decreasing ω fig 7 this physiological process imposed a hydraulic limitation on the sap flow path in poplar trees and prevented excessive water losses under high evaporative demands chen et al 2011 fu et al 2020 irrespective of canopy interception and understory transpiration water output exceeded water input in most months during the measurement period table 2 indicating that trees took up water from the deep soil layer 1 m and or groundwater our results were consistent with the findings of other studies which reported that trees have the ability to tap water from deeper soil layers and or groundwater to maintain their transpiration when the topsoil moisture is exhausted brito et al 2015 fang et al 2019 most of the roots of poplar trees in the keerqin sandy land are distributed within a soil depth range of 100 cm but the maximum depth of the taproot can reach the groundwater level song et al 2020a therefore poplar trees can take up water from the deep soil layer and or groundwater when the upper soil water becomes insufficient in the study region in the same study site an isotope deuterium and oxygen analysis in xylem soil precipitation and groundwater also indicated that the poplar trees used deep soil water 1 m and groundwater in addition to shallow soil water and the contribution of groundwater to transpiration reached 37 4 in normal years song et al 2020a therefore poplar trees take up water from the capillary fringe or directly from groundwater which is an important strategy for coping with soil drought in semiarid sandy environments zhang et al 1999 fang et al 2019 4 2 environmental control of canopy transpiration in the poplar plantation in the present study the daily canopy transpiration increased sharply with increasing vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation and tended to level off at high levels of vapor pressure deficit in both years fig 6a and b these findings were consistent with those reported for populus spp trees and other tree species in other regions zhang et al 1999 chang et al 2006 wieser et al 2014 shen et al 2015 tie et al 2017 the saturation of canopy transpiration at high vapor pressure deficit levels is an important adaptive strategy evolved by poplar trees in semiarid sandy environments wieser et al 2014 brito et al 2015 liu et al 2015 song et al 2020b in addition more of the variability in the daily canopy transpiration was explained by solar radiation than by the vapor pressure deficit indicating that canopy transpiration was more controlled by solar radiation than by the vapor pressure deficit on a daily scale a similar phenomenon was reported by shen et al 2015 for populus gansuensis plantations in an arid inland river basin of northwest china and by zhang et al 2013 for populus alba l p talassica plantation in the arid desert area this may be because the canopy was partly decoupled from the atmosphere and as a result canopy transpiration became increasingly dependent on solar radiation and less dependent on atmospheric vapor pressure deficit wullschleger et al 1998 this was demonstrated by the ω values in both years fig 8b 0 6 and 0 7 in 2018 and 2019 respectively which approached one xu et al 2018 the extent of the ec variation explained by eto was no higher than that explained by rs fig 6 which further verified that solar radiation is the main driver of canopy transpiration for poplar furthermore clear relationships between the daily canopy transpiration and soil moisture were not found in either year fig 6d that is consistent with other studies in which there was no significant relationship between canopy transpiration in plantations and soil moisture on a daily scale jiao et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a the lack of a significant relationship between soil moisture and canopy transpiration on a daily scale might be because seasonal variation weakened the effect of soil moisture on stomatal conductance during the growing seasons liu et al 2017b song et al 2020b in addition the utilization of deep soil water 1 0 m and or groundwater by poplar trees also contributes to weakening this effect brito et al 2015 song et al 2020b tree transpiration was regulated by stomatal conductance the lower gc in 2018 than in 2019 fig 8a indicated that trees reduced gc in response to a decrease in precipitation and soil moisture this was because the hydraulic resistance between soil and root systems increased as soil water availability decreased which prevented water movement from the soil to the plant leaves and subsequently resulted in stomatal closure tognetti et al 2009 li et al 2016 this was also supported by the positive relationships between gc and θ in both years fig 9b in addition we found that the ratio of stomatal sensitivity to reference canopy stomatal conductance m gcref for the poplar trees decreased from 0 62 in 2018 to 0 27 in 2019 generally the ratio of stomatal sensitivity to reference canopy stomatal conductance m gcref is approximately 0 6 across a large range of species and environmental conditions indicating the stomatal regulation of water potential to prevent xylem cavitation isohydric strategy nevertheless the ratio is lower than 0 6 as a result of trees that exhibit less strict water potential regulation oren et al 1999 ewers et al 2005 naithani et al 2012 therefore our results indicate that the poplar trees showed relatively strict stomatal regulation in 2018 igarashi et al 2015 whereas they showed relatively less strict stomatal regulation of water loss more anisohydric in 2019 oren et al 1999 ogle and reynolds 2002 the shift from relatively more to less strict stomatal regulation from normal to wet years in poplar trees in the present study may indicate that the trees showed flexible stomatal regulation of transpiration domec and johnson 2012 this was also demonstrated by ω values which changed from 0 6 in 2018 to 0 7 in 2019 fig 8b 4 3 implications for forest and water management in the present study precipitation could not satisfy the high transpiration demand of the poplar plantation therefore trees took up water from the deep soil layer 1 0 m and from groundwater however in the study region precipitation exhibits strong interannual variations and extremely low precipitation approximately half of the long term mean value occurrs at an interval of 15 years in addition the groundwater level has gradually declined since the 1950s with a rate of decrease of 0 7 m every 10 years in a drought year the decline in the groundwater level can be especially precipitous song et al 2020a e g it decreased from 6 5 m to 8 3 m during the growing season in 2018 at the study site data not shown most studies have shown that severe and abrupt groundwater level declines may lead to severe water stress for trees casuing crown dieback or even tree death david et al 2013 therefore poplar plantations are vulnerable to dieback during extreme drought years with a sharp decline in the groundwater level our findings have important implications for afforestation forest and water management in this semiarid sandy region reforestation with poplar is undoubtedly the most practical means of immobilizing shifting sand dunes due to the fast growth of poplar zheng et al 2012 song et al 2020a however the poplar trees should be planted where the groundwater level is shallow so that the groundwater or capillary water will be directly utilized by the trees and thus contribute to maintaining higher transpiration to maintain the stability of poplar plantations the tree density should be reduced to lower canopy transpiration and interception and to increase the soil water availability for the remaining trees and thus reduce their dependence on groundwater giuggiola et al 2013 song et al 2016 furthermore zheng et al 2012 reported that the decline in groundwater level in the study region was mainly due to the increase in water use for the expansion of agricultural land and broadleaved forests therefore to maintain the local water balance and the stability of poplar plantations the area covered by agricultural land and poplar plantations should be reduced or transformed into coniferous forests shrublands and grasslands with low water consumption zheng et al 2012 song et al 2016 5 conclusions daily canopy transpiration averaged 1 2 mm d 1 and 1 5 mm d 1 during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 daily canopy transpiration was more controlled by solar radiation than by the vapor pressure deficit the trees used deep soil water 1 0 m and groundwater to maintain higher canopy transpiration in most months during the measurement period canopy conductance decreased significantly with increasing vpd in both years however the sensitivity of canopy conductance to vpd decreased from 0 62 in 2018 to 0 27 in 2019 indicating a shift from more to less strict stomatal regulation therefore poplar plantations are vulnerable to dieback during extreme drought years with the decline in the groundwater level becasue the trees utilized groundwater to maintain higher canopy transpiration rates to maintain the stability of poplar plantations in this semiarid sandy region suitable afforestation site selection thinning and land use type transformation practices should be adopted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
