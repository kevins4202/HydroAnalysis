11270,realistic simulations of saline field conditions and effective monitoring of phenotyping parameters in an expeditious non destructive manner are imperative to successful breeding of genotypes for salinity stress tolerance this study aimed to spectrally assess the growth water relations and ion contents of wheat under simulated saline field conditions using the subsurface water retention technique swrt and three salinity water levels control 6 and 12 ds m 1 phenotypic parameters and hyperspectral signatures of the canopy within the 350 2500 nm range were measured at the flowering stage multivariate analysis including correlation partial least squares regression simultaneous b coefficient and variable importance for projection vip and stepwise multiple linear regression were used in the same order to extract sensitive wavebands and effective singular wavelengths binary effective wavelengths as normalized spectral indices ndsis were constructed and related to phenotypic parameters for pooled data and for each salinity level and cultivar the results confirmed that the shoot dry weight sdw water relations and ion contents parameters were effective as screening criteria for evaluating the salt tolerance of wheat cultivars under simulated saline field conditions it was possible to assess the phenotypic parameters by using hyperspectral canopy signatures over a broad spectrum range all parameters exhibited stronger relationships with the wavelengths extracted in the visible infrared vis and red edge regions than those extracted in the near infrared nir and shortwave infrared swir regions six wavelengths within the vis region five within the red edge and swir 1 regions eleven within the nir region and nine within the swir 2 region were extracted as effective bands the ndsis based on vis vis red edge red edge red edge vis nir vis nir red edge and nir nir were more appropriate for assessing the phenotypic parameters than indices based on swir swir and swir nir except for the sdw k and ca2 contents which showed strong correlations with the latter ndsis the close relationship between sdw and the water relations and ion contents parameters on one side and the high predictive power of the ndsis based on the vis red edge and nir wavelengths in the assessment of phenotypic parameters on the other side indicates that the hyperspectral reflectance data and band selection techniques could be used for the indirect assessment of water relations and ion content of wheat under saline field conditions keywords leaf water potential multivariate analysis phenomics phenotyping salinity stress subsurface water retention technique 1 introduction salinity problems are unavoidable in the agricultural sector under arid and semi arid conditions low precipitation and river flows high temperature and evaporation and the frequent incidence of drought exacerbate salinity problems in this sector most importantly the rise in shortages of fresh water in countries with arid and semi arid climates necessitates an increase in the use of alternative water sources to bridge the gap between production and consumption of food crops in the central part of saudi arabia for example saline groundwater with an electrical conductivity of about 5 0 ds m 1 is employed to supplement irrigation shortfalls el hendawy et al 2017a the use of saline groundwater for irrigation without adequate management strategies impacts the sustainability of agriculture including the production capacity for food crops the cultivation of salt tolerant genotypes is the most effective and feasible strategy to sustain crop production in saline conditions it is inexpensive for farmers and easily applicable on a large scale requires little skills to apply and provides a sustainable solution relative to other strategies such as leaching and addition and mixed of gypsum to the soil numerous attempts to improve the salt tolerance of genotypes were advanced through traditional breeding programs and genetic engineering with few salt tolerant genotypes has been released the growth conditions growth platform and evaluation methods for assessment of parameters associated with salinity tolerance are the major constraints to improving the salt tolerance of genotypes in breeding programs tavakkoli et al 2010 hackl et al 2013 hu et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017b majority of studies on salinity aimed at evaluating the genetic variation in salt tolerance and assessing plant parameters as screening criteria were performed under ideal controlled conditions greenhouse and growth chamber in small scale pot or uniform growth media such as the hydroponic system the salt tolerance of genotypes observed under controlled conditions in small scale pot is inconsistent with most studies conducted in saline field conditions consequently plant parameters derived from controlled conditions are often re assessed under natural saline field conditions el hendawy et al 2009 tavakkoli et al 2010 oyiga et al 2016 the evaluation of the salt tolerance of genotypes and the identification of plant parameters as screening criteria under natural saline field conditions is also limited by the spatial temporal heterogeneity of soil properties in the single field and between plots even at short distances munns and james 2003 in this study the saline field conditions were simulated using the subsurface water retention technique swrt this technique utilizes a representative sample size a large measuring area and exposes genotypes to fluctuations in parameters humidity and temperature that control the rate of evapotranspiration el hendawy et al 2017a 2017b the technique also enables uniform distribution of the water content and salt concentrations in the root zone for all genotypes which is difficult to achieve under natural saline field conditions the success of improving the salt tolerance of genotypes in breeding program requires also rapid cost effective and non destructive evaluation methods for the assessment of plant parameters associated with salinity tolerance although there are various desirable plant parameters exist as screening criteria to evaluate and improve the salt tolerance of genotypes plant breeders are reluctant to use them routinely this is because their assessment using traditional evaluation methods involves sampling that is destructive time intensive and expensive this is often the case for genomics assisted plant breeding which involves a large number of genotypes and a large geographic area for example although the leaf water relations parameters water and osmotic potential and parameters related to the accumulation of toxic ions na and cl and essential ions k and ca2 have been established in various crops as effective screening criteria for discriminating salt tolerance among genotypes el hendawy et al 2005a 2005b nawaz et al 2010 zhang et al 2014a 2014b ashraf and ashraf 2015 oyiga et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017b the assessment of such parameters in large scale evaluation using traditional evaluation methods and devices are expensive destructive and time intensive these methods require high sampling densities and repeated measurements at different growth stages several phenotyping tools have recently been developed to solve problems associated with traditional evaluation methods in the plant breeding process hyperspectral reflectance sensing is an important high throughput phenotyping tool for simultaneous indirect assessment of multiple plant parameters under different environmental conditions this tool is based on that the spectral reflectance of the canopy in the visible vis 400 700 nm the near infrared nir 700 1300 nm and the shortwave infrared swir 1300 2500 nm bands carries several information associated with diverse biophysical and biochemical characteristics of plants which can be to some extent cultivar specific and therefore an effective tool for detecting salt tolerance of the wide range of genotypes gutierrez et al 2010 winterhalter et al 2011 cabrera bosquet et al 2012 erdle et al 2013 kipp et al 2014 lobos et al 2014 elsayed et al 2015 attia and rajan 2016 hu et al 2016 rischbeck et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017a c garriga et al 2017 however because the hyperspectral reflectance of canopy and proper band features depends on environmental and atmospheric conditions as well as crop types there is still need for testing in different diverse environmental conditions in order to further validate known spectral reflectance indices sri to derive new and simpler sri s and to develop monitoring models with wider applicability for indirectly assessment of stress related plant parameters plant water relations parameters expressed as leaf water and osmotic potential and leaf turgor pressure are routinely used as screening criteria for evaluating and improving the salt tolerance of genotypes in various crops under salt stress conditions vysotskaya et al 2010 razzaghi et al 2011 zhang et al 2014a 2014b ashraf and ashraf 2015 oyiga et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017b there is paucity of investigations on the relationship between hyperspectral reflectance data and these components of plant water relations at different intensities of salt stress under simulated saline field conditions however several studies have assessed absolute leaf water content relative water content and whole canopy water content especially under water stress conditions using several sri s several spectral reflectance regions are suitable for the estimation of plant water status under different stresses hackl et al 2013 indicated that the simple spectral reflectance ratio indices derived from the combination of the vis and nir regions showed significant correlation with the leaf water potential in wheat under salinity stress pe√±uelas et al 1996 proposed the simple ratio water index based on the nir region to assess crop water status of barley under salinity stress zhang et al 2012 2014a b modeled the normalized difference spectral indices ndsi and ratios of spectral indices from the swir region to evaluate the fuel moisture content fmc the equivalent water thickness ewt and the relative water content rwc of cotton at different salinity levels these studies demonstrate that several wavelengths are useful for assessment of plant water status of cotton under salinity stress conditions parameters related to specific ion toxicities na and cl and essential ions k and ca2 cannot be ruled out as key screening criteria for evaluating salt tolerance of genotypes under salinity stress conditions several sri are promising for the assessment of many biochemical compounds in leaves including chlorophylls carotenoids anthocyanin flavonoids crude protein and total nitrogen under normal and stress conditions major and minor elements including na ca k mg p mn b fe cu and zn have been assessed from sensor based measurements however restricted to non saline conditions clark et al 1987 ward et al 2011 the use of sri for assessment of mineral contents under salinity stress has received little attention the accumulation of na and cl in leaves to toxic levels and low uptake of k and ca2 under salinity stress alter the spectral signature of the canopy which can be exploited for assessment these elements using different sri s according to zhang et al 2014a 2014b sri s based on swir nir and swir swir wavelengths are suitable for effective monitoring of na cl k mg2 and ca2 contents in cotton grown in saline soil methods for extraction of optimal and effective wavelengths from hyperspectral reflectance data for indirect assessment of plant parameters are rapidly increasing these methods such as vegetation indices partial least squares regression plsr and stepwise multiple linear regression smlr are predicated on minimizing background and spectral noise to enhance utilization of the spectral information dorigo et al 2007 wu et al 2009 lee et al 2009 the plsr and smlr efficiently deal with large datasets containing noisy collinear and highly correlated variables therefore both approaches enable extraction of effective and suitable wavelengths for assessment of different biophysical and biochemical characteristics of a canopy the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the potential of growth water relations and ion contents as screening criteria for evaluating the salt tolerance of wheat genotypes under simulated saline field conditions 2 compare the spectral signature of the canopy using the three regions of the spectrum vis nir and swir for different salinity levels and wheat cultivars 3 sequentially extract optimal and effective wavelengths of the three regions of the spectrum and construct new dual band normalized spectral reflectance indices ndsis for indirect assessment of water relations and ion contents parameters and 4 quantify the reliable relationship between ndsis and tested parameters for pooled data and for each salinity level and cultivar 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site and conditions field experiments were carried out at the experimental research station of the college of food and agriculture sciences king saud university riyadh saudi arabia 24 25 n 46 34 e elevation 400 m during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 growing seasons the study area is characterized by a typical arid climate with the temperature and precipitation during the wheat growth period ranged from 7 0 to 41 0 c and 8 to 25 mm respectively the experiments were conducted in a sandy soil 90 4 sand 5 4 silt and 4 2 clay with a bulk density of 1 48 g cm 3 an electrical conductivity of 0 59 ds m 1 a ph of 7 84 a field capacity of 0 101 m3 m 3 and a wilting point of 0 038 m3 m 3 2 2 setup of subsurface water retention technique swrt plant materials salinity treatments agronomic practices and experimental design the swrt was setup according to el hendawy et al 2017a 2017b an impermeable polyethylene pe membrane with a 0 03 mm thick was installed in a u shaped with a 3 1 width depth aspect ratio the width of the base of the membrane sheet was kept at 60 cm at a soil depth of 40 cm the right and left sides of the membrane sheet were uplifted by 20 cm with no membrane was present from the edge of the sides of the membrane sheet up to the soil surface to allow drainage the soil was irrigated using fresh water following the setup of the swrt to enable rearrangement of the particles and to arrive at the desired soil bulk density after the soil dries the seeds of two wheat cultivars differing in their salt tolerance triticum aestivum l cvv sakha 93 and sakha 61 were sown in a four row plot with the latter being the more salt sensitive one el hendawy et al 2005a the rows were 6 m long with 0 15 m spacing and seeds were planted on december 10th 2015 and december 5th 2016 at a seeding rate of 16 g m 2 the plots were irrigated with fresh water for 25 days to avoid an osmotic shock during germination and at the early seedling stage thereafter the control plots continued to be irrigated with fresh water about 0 35 ds m 1 while the moderate and high salinity plots were irrigated with artificial saline water containing 3 51 and 7 02 g nacl l 1 to reach salinity levels of 6 and 12 0 ds m 1 respectively during the growing season irrigation was initiated when 50 of the total available water at depths from 0 to 40 cm was depleted the quantity of irrigation water for each treatment was calculated based on the soil water content at depths of 0 40 cm using the equation smd Œ∏fc Œ∏i d bd where smd is the soil moisture deficit mm d is the depth of the roots 40 cm bd is the bulk density of the soil layer g cm 3 and Œ∏fc and Œ∏i are the volumetric soil water contents m 3 m 3 at field capacity and before irrigation respectively to deliver constant and equal amounts of water to each plot the main line of the irrigation system which delivered water from plastic water storage tanks to the specific treatment plots was distributed to the sub main hoses at each plot and equipped with manual control valves a water meter was installed at the location where the main line contacted with plastic tanks to facilitate the measurement of the amount of water for each treatment prior to each treatment soil samples at depth of 0 40 cm were collected from moderate and high salinity plots to monitor accumulation of salt in the root zone the electrical conductivity ec of soil samples was measured using the soil water extraction method with water to soil suspension ratio of 2 1 the ec of the moderate and the high salinity plots at the grain dough stage reached 8 9 and 14 3 ds m 1 respectively the plots were fertilized using 120 90 and 60 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 and k2o respectively nitrogen fertilizer was applied in three equal doses at seeding stem elongation and booting stages as ammonium nitrate 33 5 n phosphorus was applied prior to seeding as calcium superphosphate 15 5 p2o5 while potassium was added at booting stage as potassium chloride 60 k2o other field management was based on high efficiency cultivation procedures the experiments were laid out in a randomized complete block split plot design in triplicate with the three levels of salinity treatments and the two wheat cultivars retained in the main and subplots respectively each subplot was 0 6 m wide and 6 m long yielding an area of 3 6 m2 2 3 measurements of phenotypic parameters shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents ten plants from each subplot were collected randomly at the flowering stage dried at 70 c for 72 h and weighed to obtain the dry weight of shoot per plant three leaves were also collected from each subplot at the flowering stage to measure the leaf water potential lwp measurement was conducted from 12 00 to 15 00 h using a scholander pressure chamber scholander et al 1965 the leaves used for measuring lwp were immediately kept in dry ice and then transported to the laboratory for leaf osmotic potential lop measurements leaf sap was extracted from the leaf samples under pressure at room temperature and lop determined from 10 Œºl aliquots using a vapor pressure osmometer wescor 5100c wescor inc logan ut usa the lop was calculated as lop 0 00832 t m where t denotes the temperature kin kelvin and m is the concentration osmol of the sample wyn jones and gorham 1983 the leaf turgor potential ltp was calculated as the difference between lwp and lop values approximately 0 4 g of pulverized leaf samples collected at the flowering stage was digested using 3 ml of perchloric acid and 8 ml of concentrated nitric acid for 12 h followed by burning at 300 c for 3 h the digested samples were transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flask and distilled water added to attain a final volume of 50 ml the concentrations of na k and ca2 were determined using a flame photometer elex 6361 eppendorf ag hamburg germany about 0 1 g of each ground sample was extracted using 100 ml of distilled water followed by shaking for 1 h and filtering to determine the concentration of cl the concentration of cl contents was measured using an ion chromatography analyzer dionex x 300 sunnyvale ca 94086 usa 2 4 canopy hyperspectral reflectance measurements canopy hyperspectral reflectance was determined synchronously with the phenotypic parameters using a portable backpack asd fieldspec pro spectroradiometer analytical spectral devices inc boulder co usa under cloudless conditions within 2 h of solar noon the device captures solar radiation reflecting from plant canopy between 350 to 2500 nm using a probe with a 25 field of view and delivers data in 1 nm width continuous bands the probe was held vertically at about 0 80 m above the wheat canopy in nadir orientation in order to achieve an approximately 28 cm2 sensing area and minimize influence of soil background a white reflectance panel of barium sulfate was used to correct interference from ambient noise before and after reflectance measurements for each sub plot as well as to generate reflected light percentages to eliminate border effects five replicated canopy hyperspectral measurements were taken for each sub plot on rows 2 and 3 excluding the first meter of the two rows an average of 10 scans calculated automatically was used for each measurement and the average of five measurements was considered a measured spectrum for a sub plot 2 5 sequence for obtaining spectral band regions and wavelengths to estimate water relations and ion contents the optimal spectral band regions and wavelengths for assessment of measured parameters were obtained following the sequence correlation analysis partial least square regression plsr simultaneous b coefficient and variable importance for projection vip resulting from the plsr method and stepwise multiple linear regression smlr the correlation analysis as the simplest method was used to calculate the correlation coefficient between original spectral reflectance of wavelengths in the 400 2500 nm range and the target parameter the values of correlation coefficient provided a complete image of the relationship between the target parameters and the spectral reflectance based on thenkabail et al 2014 and wang et al 2016 the spectral band regions showing high correlation with the target parameter were retained while those showing low or no correlation were eliminated the plsr is a multivariate statistical analysis method dealing efficiently with data containing a large set of multi collinear and noisy independent variables wavelengths data and relating them to the target dependent variables growth water relations and ion contents parameters it is used to predict the target parameters from a large dataset of independent variables without losing hyperspectral information schreiber 1993 fu et al 2013 the plsr method is therefore important for relating hyperspectral reflectance data to target parameters the optimal relationship between two variables wavelengths and target parameters without under or over fitting problems was tested through the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse after plsr modeling the optimal spectral band regions for target dependent variables assessment were identified using the plsr coefficients b coefficients and the variable importance on projection vip the b coefficients express the correlation between independent variables original spectral reflectance values and dependent variables target parameters the independent variables with larger b coefficients contribute largely to the regression model the vip is another parameter representing the contribution of each independent variable in fitting the plsr model for both predictors and response variables since the b coefficients values are unusable in isolation for selecting the sensitive spectral band regions lee et al 2009 the spectral band regions were retained when the b coefficient value was above the standard deviation and the threshold for vip scores set to 1 0 simultaneously wold et al 2001 the selected wavelengths regions obtained from the plsr analysis were further analyzed through smlr method to extract the most influential wavelengths for estimation of target parameters the smlr method is a systematic approach of removing and adding terms in a multi linear model based on the influence distribution and the significance of a target parameter as affected by independent variables wavelengths in optimal spectral band regions the wavelengths in the spectral band regions selected by plsr analysis were inputted into the smlr process and checked to discern wavelengths that will be eliminated based on a significant probability level which is generally set to 0 05 in each step vasques et al 2008 the process of smlr analysis terminates if no more wavelengths can be entered or eliminated therefore the predictive models for target parameters are constructed based on the influential wavelengths selected by the smlr method 2 6 construction of two band normalized difference spectral indices ndsis to remotely assess growth water relations and ion contents the sensitive wavelengths obtained from the smlr analysis were used to create all possible combinations between pairs of wavelengths as ndsis the ndsis were calculated based on the following corresponding formula ndsi rŒª1 r Œª2 r Œª1 r Œª2 where rŒª1 and rŒª2 represent the spectral reflectance of sensitive wavelengths Œª1 and Œª2 obtained from the smlr analysis to test the efficiency of the ndsis for assessment of growth water relations and ion contents parameters linear and non linear statistical analysis were employed and coefficients of determination r2 calculated using the pooled data of replications salinity levels and cultivars and individual data of each salinity level and cultivar 2 7 statistical analysis data for plant dry weight water relations and ion contents parameters were tested using anova s appropriate for a randomized complete block split plot design with the salinity level and cultivar considered as the main factor and the split factor respectively combined analyses of variance using mean squares values were done across two years the differences between the mean values of salinity levels and cultivars were compared through duncan s test using the sas software vers 9 2 sas institute inc cary north carolina united states a pearson s correlation coefficient matrix was used to determine the relationship between all parameters for high and moderate salinity levels n 12 and for each cultivar n 18 the plsr and smlr analysis were performed with xlstat statistical package vers 2017 4 excel add ins soft sarl new york ny usa the relationships between different ndsis as independent variables and plant dry weight water relations and ion contents parameters as dependent variables were fitted using linear and non linear curve fitting and the relations with the highest r2 were considered as the best fit relationships the relationships were fitted using the sas software vers 9 2 sas institute inc cary north carolina united states 3 results 3 1 variation in shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents parameters between different salinity levels and cultivars mean squares from the analysis of variance combined over years and variation between treatments for shoot dry weight sdw leaf water relations leaf water potential lwp leaf osmotic potential lop and leaf turgor pressure ltp ion contents in leaves na cl k and ca2 and k na ratio are presented in table 1 the salinity level and cultivar main effect in the combined analysis was significant for all parameters the cultivar salinity level interaction was significant for all parameters with the exception of the ltp and k na ratio the cultivar year interaction was not significant for all parameters with the exception of the sdw and k na ratio no salinity level year interaction occurred for na cl and k contents in leaves the cultivar salinity level year interaction was significant for sdw k and ca2 contents in leaves and k na ratio table 1 both salinity levels 6 0 and 12 0 ds m 1 resulted in a significant decrease in the lwp and lop both became more negative sdw k and ca2 contents in leaves and the k na ratio relative to the control treatment the salinity levels led to a significant increase in the ltp and na and cl contents in leaves the effects of salinity were more pronounced for the salt sensitive cultivar sakha 61 than for the less sensitive cultivar sakha 93 table 1 3 2 correlation of parameters related to salinity levels and cultivars the relationships among parameters were evaluated for high and moderate salinity levels n 12 and for each cultivar n 18 table 2 for the high salinity level 12 ds m 1 only the ltp did not show a significant correlation with the other parameters except na lower left of table 2 for the moderate salinity level 6 ds m 1 all parameters were strongly correlated to each other with the exception of the lwp which showed no correlation with the sdw ltp cl and ca2 as well as lop which showed no correlation with cl upper right of table 2 all parameters were strongly correlated to each other for both cultivars with the exception of k which showed no correlation with the sdw ltp cl ca2 and k na ratio for sakha 93 upper right of table 2 3 3 responses of spectral reflectance signatures of canopy for salinity levels and cultivars the spectral reflectance signatures of the canopy between 400 and 2500 nm for various salinity levels and cultivars are shown in fig 1 in the visible region vis 400 700 nm which is related to leaf chlorophyll content or leaf senescence and in the shortwave infrared region swir 1300 2500 nm which the magnitude of reflectance is related to the absorption characteristics of water and other compounds the two salinity levels 6 and 12 ds m 1 and salt sensitive cultivar sakha 61 had higher canopy reflectance in the both regions relative to the control treatment and salt tolerant cultivar sakha 93 in the near infrared region nir 700 1300 nm which the magnitude of reflectance in this region is related to the internal structural discontinuities encountered in the leaf the canopy reflectance for sakha 93 was higher than those for sakha 61 the spectral reflectance curves for salinity levels are distinct and the canopy reflectance of the moderate 6 ds m 1 and the high 12 ds m 1 salinity levels were higher than that for the control treatment overall the spectral reflectance curves in fig 1 shows that there are obvious differences in the shape of the canopy reflectance curves among the two cultivars and across the three salinity levels in the three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir the spectral reflectance curves for the two cultivars and three salinity levels were similar in shape with evident reflectance troughs around 680 1200 1450 and 1950 nm and minor troughs around 950 1025 and 1760 nm the green peak around 550 nm was expanded and distorted in the spectral reflectance curves of sakha 61 and occasionally for the two salinity levels 6 and 12 ds m 1 fig 1 3 4 sequence for obtaining the sensitive spectral band regions and wavelengths for estimating the shoot dry weight leaf water relations and ion contents parameters the correlation coefficients between the original spectral reflectance of the entire wavelengths 400 to 2500 nm and the parameters of shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents are displayed in fig 2 these correlations were determined based on pooled data of years replications salinity levels and cultivars the parameters of water relations lwp lop and ltp and na and cl contents were positively correlated with the original spectral reflectance in the vis and swir regions while sdw k and ca2 contents and the k na ratio display opposite relations the correlations between the parameters and the 750 840 nm intervals of the nir regions are inverse to correlations in the vis and swir regions but it is back again after 840 nm fig 2 generally the wavelengths in the vis and swir regions had moderate to strong correlation with all parameters while strong and moderate correlations between all parameters and wavelengths in the nir region were observed at the range from 700 to 740 nm red edge region and at 1100 1300 nm respectively the wavelength region 745 961 nm showed no significant correlation with all parameters with the exception of ca2 which showed a low correlation with the wavelength region of 758 784 nm the wavelength region of 961 1000 nm showed also no significant correlations with all parameters with the exception of lwp and cl content for which correlations were moderate r 0 33 0 40 the response in the swir region showed a few minor peaks at 1400 1450 1650 1680 1830 and 2220 nm the peaks with the strongest positive correlations were found around 540 and 710 nm fig 2 table 3 lists the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse of the partial least square regression plsr model between the original spectral reflectance data of the visible vis near infrared nir and short wave infrared swir and the parameters of shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents the results revealed that all parameters have displayed strong positive correlations with wavelengths in the vis region r2 0 64 0 88 and were better than with wavelengths in the nir 0 40 0 80 and swir 0 35 0 75 regions the contents of k and ca2 exhibited the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 74 0 83 for k and 0 72 0 88 for ca2 in the vis nir and swir regions of the original spectral reflectance followed by cl content r2 0 65 0 82 and sdw r2 0 57 0 80 the ltp and k na ratio were least correlated with the original spectral reflectance in the nir r2 0 40 0 43 and the swir r2 0 35 0 37 regions table 3 the regression coefficients b coefficient and the variable importance in projection vip derived from the plsr analysis were used simultaneously to obtain the sensitive waveband regions in different parts of the spectrum figs 3 and 4 the sensitive waveband regions for each parameter are listed in table 4 the regions for each parameter were selected when a b coefficient above the standard deviation coincided with a vip greater than 1 0 figs 3 and 4 based on this basis one region in the vis spectrum around 500 to 632 nm except sdw and two regions in nir spectrum located around 695 to 743 nm and 1124 to 1298 nm were identified as the most sensitive waveband regions for all parameters table 4 the two regions of swir 1 spectrum located around 1382 to 1631 nm and 1706 to 1898 nm also emerged for various parameters excluding the lwp and k na ratio for the two regions and sdw for the first region with the exception of sdw and k the region in the swir 2 spectrum located around 2108 to 2498 nm was recognized as the most sensitive waveband region for all parameters the waveband regions in the vis spectrum located around 434 to 488 nm and in the swir 2 spectrum located around 1901 to 2072 nm were important for sdw lwp and na and ca2 respectively table 4 the waveband regions selected based on the b coefficient and vip as independent variables were further analyzed by stepwise multiple linear regression smlr to identify the most influential wavelengths that contributed the most variation for each parameter the sensitive wavelengths in different parts of the spectrum and a summary of the relationship between the selected wavelengths and each parameter are presented in table 5 the wavelengths of blue 488 509 and 524 nm wavelength of green 542 nm and wavelengths of red 596 and 614 nm were the most sensitive in the vis region for the assessment of the tested parameters in the red edge region the most informative wavelengths were 719 710 716 701 and 722 nm for assessment of the three parameters of water relations lwp lop and ltp na sdw and cl k and ca2 and k na ratio respectively table 5 in the nir region the combination of 1136 nm with 1142 nm fitted the relationships of sdw the combination of 1193 nm with 1223 1232 1250 and 1256 nm correlated well with lop cl and ca2 na lwp and k respectively the combination of 1190 nm with 1211 nm and 1187 nm with 1214 nm fitted the relationships of ltp and k na ratio respectively no wavelengths in the swir 1 region 1300 1900 nm was suitable for assessment the lwp and k na ratio while the wavelengths 1832 1868 1883 1889 and 1898 nm were significantly correlated with na lop and cl sdw ltp and k and ca2 contents respectively all wavelengths in the swir 2 region 1900 2500 nm failed to assess k and ca2 contents while three combined wavelengths 2309 2321 and 2351 nm two combined wavelengths 2261 and 2288 nm and individual wavelength 2024 2297 2324 2309 and 2303 nm were recognized through the smlr methods as the most informative wavelengths for assessment of lop ltp and sdw lwp na cl and k na ratio respectively table 5 the results presented in table 5 also reveal that all parameters exhibit stronger relationships with the wavelengths extracted in the vis and red edge regions than the wavelengths in the nir and swir region the combination of two wavelengths from the nir region and occasionally from the swir region fitted the relationships with parameters more precisely than individual wavelengths 3 5 relationship of the growth water relation and ion content parameters with derived normalized difference spectral indices ndsis the ndsis of all possible combinations of wavelengths pairs obtained by smlr were further regressed with each parameter the coefficients of determination r2 and the type of regressions of these relationships which obtained after the data for the two years three replications three salinity levels and two cultivars were pooled together are presented in tables 6 10 exponential and quadratic polynomial equations were the best model describing the relationships between most of the 136 ndsi s and the sdw lop na and k na ratios while linear and quadratic polynomial equations were the most models providing the highest r2 for the relationships between these ndsi s and the other parameters tables 6 10 the lwp displayed poor correlations with the 136 ndsi s tested displaying 63 moderate 0 50 r2 0 69 and 58 weak 0 30 r2 0 49 correlations with lwp no ndsis showed its strongest with lwp whereas 75 34 40 29 58 82 88 and 43 of the 136 ndsis showed strongest correlations colored green r2 0 70 with sdw lop ltp na cl k ca2 and k na ratio respectively tables 6 10 the strongest correlations are mostly from ndsis based on nir vs vis red edge vs red edge nir vs red edge and nir vs nir wavelengths for all parameters in addition of swir vs nir and swir vs swir wavelengths for sdw k and ca2 contents and partly for cl content the weakest relationships between ndsis and the parameters colored yellow are 24 15 15 31 15 17 17 19 and 23 of the 136 ndsis displayed by sdw lwp lop ltp na cl k ca2 and k na

content table 7 and k na ratio table 9 respectively these moderate relationships were observed when the ndsis were based on combinations of any two of the three vis nir and swir parts of the spectrum the best models of the regressions and coefficients of determination for the relationships between ndsis which selected from the previous 136 ndsi s to cover the vis vis red edge vis nir red edge swir swir swir vis and swir red edge wavelengths of the spectrum and the tested parameters for each salinity level and cultivar are presented in table 11 the quadratic polynomial equation adequately models the relationships between ndsis and the tested parameters for the three salinity levels with a few linear and exponential relationships the exponential equation best modeled the relationships between ndsis and the lwp the lop and na and cl contents for sakha 61 the quadratic polynomial equation was suitable for relationships between ndsis and the other parameters for sakha 61 and most parameters for sakha 93 table 11 the selected ndsis commonly estimated the sdw ion contents parameters and ratios better than the water relations parameters the ndsis that incorporate vis vs vis such as ndsi 614 542 red edge vs vis such as ndsi 722 542 or nir vs red edge such as ndsi 1193 701 were more effective to estimate the tested parameters for two salinity levels 6 and 12 ds m 1 than those incorporating swir vs swir such as ndsi 2309 2261 swir vs vis such as ndsi 2309 614 or swir vs red edge such as ndsi 2261 701 the ndsis that incorporate swir vs vis and swir vs red edge showed strongest relationships r2 0 70 with ca2 content only for the 6 ds m 1 salinity level the ndsis that incorporate swir vs swir also displayed the highest r2 values colored green r2 0 70 with the sdw lop k content and k na ratio for 6 ds m 1 salinity level and the sdw lop cl content and k content for 12 ds m 1 salinity level the ndsis that incorporate all regions of the spectrum vis red edge nir and swir were comparable in estimating the tested parameters for the two cultivars especially for sakha 61 colored green table 11 the ndsi 2309 2261 was the only index with insignificant relationships with all parameters for sakha 93 colored yellow table 11 4 discussion 4 1 growth water relations and ion contents as important parameters in salinity studies osmotic stress specific ion toxicities and nutritional deficits for essential ions k and ca2 are confirmed as the main factors inhibiting the growth and production of plants under salinity stress conditions these factors interact to exhibit a range of phenomena at various levels of plant canopies therefore these phenomena are measured as the mor physiological parameters in order to use them as screening criteria for evaluating the salt tolerance of genotypes understanding of salt tolerance mechanisms and consequently understanding of how salinity stress inhibit the growth and productivity of plants for instance a significant reduction in the water and osmotic potentials of leaves both become more negative with increasing salinity levels and the dramatic changes in the leaf turgor pressure are due to osmotic stress which decreases the absorption capacity of roots to water the accumulation of na and cl to toxic levels in leaves and the hampered uptake of essential ions by na are ultimate phenomena of ion toxicities and imbalance of salinity stress in addition the effects of osmotic and ionic stresses can be translated into significant decreases in shoot dry weight sdw this is because the sdw is a function of various physiological processes and reflects the response of plants to these two components of salinity at the whole plant level therefore parameters related to the sdw leaf water relations the accumulation of toxic ions na and the ratios with essential ions k have been advanced attention as important screening criteria in salinity studies nawaz et al 2010 zhang et al 2014a 2014b ashraf and ashraf 2015 oyiga et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017b the results of this study also fully confirmed this statement and found that sdw all parameters of the leaf water relations leaf water potential lwp leaf osmotic potential lop and leaf turgor pressure ltp ion contents in leaves na cl k and ca2 and the k na ratio demonstrated significant variations between salinity levels and cultivars table 1 and strongest inter correlations for each salinity level and cultivar table 2 interestingly these parameters are confirmed in this study as effective screening criteria for evaluating the salt tolerance under simulated saline field conditions using the subsurface water retention technique swrt the merits of the technique are that it exposes plants to fluctuating soil water content and salt concentrations in the root zone and high variability in macro environmental conditions diurnal temperature and humidity during different growth stages it also associated with a large area and plant numbers and the latter has a significant impact on the physiological plant parameters due to the degree of intra and inter plant competition 4 2 interpretation the behavior of canopy spectral reflectance for salinity levels and cultivars in different parts of the spectrum the parameters of water relations and ion contents are very important in understanding of how plants response to osmotic and ionic stresses of salinity this raises the need for rapid non destructive methods for the assessment of these parameters especially for genomics assisted plant breeding which involves a large number of genotypes and a large geographic area substantial variations in the spectral reflectance of canopy in the full range of the spectrum 400 2500 nm are related to substantial changes in biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the canopy that are induced by osmotic and ionic stresses from salinity pe√±uelas et al 1993 zhang et al 2012 serbin et al 2014 lara et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017a therefore interpreting the behavior of canopy spectral reflectance has the potential to rapidly assess multiple parameters from a single measurement for example changes in the internal leaf or mesophyll structure and increase in the leaf thickness and density lead to an increase in reflectance in the near infrared region nir 700 1300 nm such changes in response to salinity stress due to changes in mineral availability especially k accumulation of toxic ions na and decrease of water and osmotic potentials of the leaves have been reported zhao et al 2001 battie laclau et al 2014 rapaport et al 2015 these changes influence the scattering of light which induces a multiplicative effect on the spectra in the nir region lara et al 2016 necrosis chlorosis and tip burn are typical foliar symptoms in plants suffering from salinity stress due to imbalance in concentrations of ions like na ca2 mg2 cl and k these symptoms indicate a significant decrease in chlorophylls and carotenoids contents when the contents of both components decrease the spectral reflectance in the range of the visible spectrum vis 400 700 nm increases mainly in the blue and red regions of the vis spectrum blackburn 2007 garrity et al 2011 salinity stress rapidly changes the osmotic potential of the soil solution which leads to changes in the leaf water status due to decreased water absorption capacity of the plant these changes in plant water status could be detected before symptoms of salinity damages become visible munns and james 2003 a change in plant water status results in a broad spectral change in the range of the nir and swir wavelengths the swir region is however more sensitive to changes in plant water status and less sensitive to noise caused by the internal leaf structure than the nir region ceccato et al 2002 eitel et al 2006 the spectral reflectance in the swir region therefore increases when plant water contents decrease this study demonstrates clear differences in the canopy spectral reflectance between three salinity levels and two cultivars in various parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir fig 1 these differences among treatments are attributed to the various effects of osmotic and ionic stresses of salinity on the photosynthetic pigments leaf structure and vegetation water status this study also reveals that it is possible to assess the parameters of sdw water relations and ion contents in terms of their spectral signatures over a broad range of the spectrum results in table 3 further confirm this and reveal that the parameters of sdw water relations and ion contents showed significant correlations with the original spectral reflectance data in the three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir however the tested parameters exhibited stronger correlation with the wavelengths in the vis region r2 0 64 to 0 88 than those in the nir r2 0 43 to 0 80 and swir regions r2 0 35 to 0 75 with the exception of sdw which showed also a strong correlation with the nir region r2 0 80 such as vis an increase in spectral reflectance in the vis region especially near 550 nm in response to salinity stress due to osmotic and ionic stresses from salinity has been reported and suggested to be associated with an induced multiplicative effect on chlorophylls and carotenoids contents wang et al 2002 li et al 2010 hamzeh et al 2013 a decrease in the contents of both components is reflected by a decrease in the height of the peak near 550 nm causing the reflectance near this band to become distorted and flattened lara et al 2016 in this study the spectral reflectance curves of sakha 61 and salinity treatments 6 0 and 12 0 ds m 1 around 550 nm were distorted broad relative to that of the control treatment and sakha 93 fig 1 4 3 extraction of the sensitive spectral bands and wavelengths for assessment of the shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents parameters to our knowledge very few studies have estimated water relations and ion contents under simulated saline field growth conditions using the full spectrum this study employed multivariate methods to extract the optimal spectral band regions and most influential wavelengths associated with plant growth water relations and ion contents parameters the methods included the same sequence of correlation analysis partial least square regression plsr and stepwise multiple linear regression smlr results in fig 2 indicate that the vis red edge and swir wavebands are reliable portions for the assessment of the measured parameters the green region 520 592 nm was the most significant followed by the red edge 701 731 nm red 601 645 nm and 690 700 nm and swir regions this confirmed that salinity stress primarily influences photosynthetic pigment content where the green and the red wavelengths in the vis region were found to be very sensitive to losses of chlorophyll b and a respectively curran et al 2001 however the nir wavebands from 740 to 1300 nm showed a moderate to weak correlation with the measured parameters fig 2 the results of the correlation analysis indicate that the optimal spectral wavebands for estimating sdw water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity stress conditions are those in green red red edge and swir ranges while most of correlations associated with the nir spectra are weak to moderate some studies have reported higher and consistent relations between wavelengths in the red edge nir and swir regions and the ions and water contents under salinity stress conditions with no significant difference in reflectance in the vis region between the control and salinity treatments wang et al 2002 zhang et al 2012 2014a 2014b however li et al 2010 found the wavelengths in the vis region to be effective for the assessment of the response of castor bean plants to salt stress with little relationships observed for the wavelengths in the nir region the ambiguity of the spectrum in the nir region for the assessment of water relations and ion contents under salinity stress may be attributable to genotypic differences in the degree of changes in leaf anatomy leaf structure and mesophyll structure induced by salinity stress and this region is very sensitive to the presence of some elements such as calcium which are connected to organic complexes of plant tissues moron and cozzolino 2002 the extraction of the sensitive waveband regions containing hyperspectral information for plant variables is the basis for formulating the spectral reflectance indices stroppiana et al 2009 previous studies selected the sensitive waveband regions based on b coefficients and variable importance in projection vip that were derived from the plsr analysis the combination of the two variables eliminates invalid wavelengths with low predictive potential from the full spectrum data in this study the valuable waveband regions were selected when a b coefficient higher than the standard deviation coincided with a vip greater than 1 table 4 and figs 3 and 4 the plsr analysis demonstrated that the valuable waveband regions for the assessment of tested parameters were located around 500 630 nm 695 743 nm and 2108 2498 nm table 4 these results indicate that the plsr analysis also supported the relevance of the vis red edge and swir regions of the spectra for the assessment of water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity stress conditions the plsr analysis also revealed that the waveband ranges from 1124 to 1298 nm for all tested parameters and 1380 to 1631 nm with the exception of sdw lwp and k na ratio and 1706 to 1898 nm with the exception of lwp and k na ratio were found to be particularly important to identify the response of sdw water relations and ion contents parameters to salinity stress table 4 and figs 3 and 4 these waveband regions of the spectrum have been proved useful for detecting the water status of plant under either normal or stress conditions as well as ion contents under salinity stress zarco tejada et al 2001 ceccato et al 2002 zhang et al 2012 2014a 2014b the plsr analysis retained the waveband regions of the spectrum that correspond to variations in the photosynthetic pigments and capacity plant water status and leaf structure which always reflects the full response of plants to both osmotic and ionic stresses of salinity therefore the waveband range from 1380 to 1898 nm requires more attention in salinity stress studies the selection of these sensitive waveband regions is an indication of the reliability of the plsr analysis since the bands are known to be directly or indirectly related to common physiological parameters in many plant species rapaport et al 2015 the data shows that the plsr analysis was superior and more accurate than correlation analysis for extraction of the sensitive waveband regions for assessment tested parameters shi et al 2013 indicated that data from plsr analysis are not easily interpretable particularly with a high number of variables the combination of the plsr and smlr methods was advanced for selection of target influential wavelengths reduction of the multicollinearity problem prediction of the parameters of interest and to simplification of results interpretation sharabian et al 2014 the smlr analysis was performed to select the target wavelengths for each parameter from the waveband regions generated from the plsr analysis data from the smlr analysis demonstrated that the wavelengths selected in the vis and red edge regions were strongly correlated to and accounted better for the most variation in all measured parameters than those selected in either the nir or swir regions table 5 this finding is consistent with previous studies that indicate the canopy reflectance is altered by many common stressors at the vis and red edge wavelengths 400 730 nm than in other regions of the spectrum 730 2500 nm and therefore those wavelengths are earlier stress indicators carter and knapp 2001 garriga et al 2014 the wavelengths 542 614 and 596 nm in the vis region and 716 701 and 701 nm in the red edge region explained up to 80 of the variability found in cl k and ca2 respectively in this study about 62 and 74 of the variability in the sdw was detected by wavelengths at 488 and 716 nm respectively the wavelengths 542 and 719 nm were effective in estimating the water relations status especially the lop about 67 and 59 of the variability in the na content was detected by wavelengths at 524 and 710 nm respectively the dynamic responses of plants to salinity stress through alteration of ion contents in leaves either by accumulation of toxic ions or deficiency of essential ions and changes in the water status of leaves are accompanied by a strong reduction in pigment contents and photosynthetic activities zhang et al 2014a 2014b el hendawy et al 2017b therefore the results of this study showed that most wavelengths located around 500 and 720 nm were retained in the smlr models and accounted for most of the variation in sdw water relations and ion contents caused by salinity stress these findings indicate that the spectral regions associated with photosynthetic pigments and capacity and leaf structure could be used as indirect indicator for the spectral assessment of water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity conditions in a rapid and non destructive manner elvidge and chen 1995 detected plant stress at red edge bands centered at 705 and 735 nm stein et al 2014 detected k and ca2 contents by wavelengths in the green and red edge regions the wavelengths in the vis region which are known to indicate the deficiency of k have been widely used to predict k zhai et al 2013 lara et al 2016 revealed a strong correlation between the salt concentrations of lettuce leaves and the wavelengths located at approximately 500 600 nm and 710 nm osmotic and ionic components of salinity stress cause substantial changes in various leaf anatomical biochemical and biophysical properties such as structure thickness size specific mass equivalent water thickness fuel moisture content and contents of lignin cellulose or sugar for instance deficit in k which is the results of the antagonism between na and k at the site uptake of ions in the roots leads to substantial changes in the mesophyll structure and thickness battie laclau et al 2014 sufficient k in leaves plays distinct roles in maintaining plant cell turgor and increase the leaf intercellular air space under abiotic stress lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 found that the specific leaf weight and equivalent water thickness of cotton leaves were increased with increasing soil salinity levels in addition cellulose lignin content of cell walls is significantly correlated with ca2 content under salinity stress kafkafi and bernstein 1996 because the canopy reflectance in the nir and swir regions are very sensitive to the abovementioned changes which induced by k and ca2 deficiency the wavelengths in the both regions cannot be ruled out as necessary bands for indirect assessment of the water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity stress conditions the results of the present study show that more than 70 of the variation in k and ca2 contents can be detected by the combination of two wavelengths 1193 and 1256 nm for k and 1193 and 1223 nm for ca2 in the nir region and 1898 nm for both ions in the swir 1 region 1300 1900 nm the combination of two wavelengths 1193 and 1223 nm in the nir region 1868 nm in the swir 1 region and 2309 nm in the swir 2 region 1900 2500 nm explained more than 63 of the variation in cl content the wavelengths selected by the smlr model in the nir combination of 1193 and 1232 nm swir 1 1832 nm and swir 2 2324 nm regions explained 59 53 and 58 of the variability in na contents respectively the wavelengths selected by the smlr model in the swir 2 regions combination of 2309 2321 and 2351 nm better explain the variability in lop than those selected in the nir region combination of 1193 and 1223 and vice versa for lwp table 5 the smlr model identified a series of sensitive wavelengths in nir and swir regions for detecting the growth leaf water status and ion contents of wheat under simulated saline field growth conditions the wavelengths 1136 1142 1187 1190 1193 1211 1214 1223 1232 1250 and 1256 nm in the nir region 1832 1862 1883 1889 and 1898 nm in the swir 1 region and 2024 2261 2288 2297 2303 2309 2321 2324 and 2351 nm in the swir 2 were extracted as the most important individual wavelengths for tracking changes in growth leaf water relations and ion contents in previous studies the wavelengths centered at 970 1200 1240 1400 1450 1650 1920 1950 and 2250 nm have been proposed as water absorption bands pe√±uelas et al 1993 ceccato et al 2002 imanishi et al 2004 gutierrez et al 2010 yao et al 2014a 2014b curran et al 2001 also showed that the wavelengths centered at 1182 1216 1920 and 1936 nm were of valuable for plant water absorption the weak absorption band 1222 nm and the band in the swir 2 2264 nm have been proposed as reliable bands for remote sensing of plant water status gao 1996 pe√±uelas et al 1996 danson et al 1992 reported that the wavelengths located at 1450 1650 and 2250 nm were significantly correlated with specific water density whereas the relationship of this parameter with wavelengths at 975 and 1175 nm was insignificant the wavelengths 2264 2276 and 2306 nm were used to construct new simple spectral reflectance indices for monitoring ion contents na cl k ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in cotton grown under saline soil conditions zhang et al 2014a 2014b previous and the current study demonstrate that changes in growth leaf water status and ion contents result in broad spectral changes in the nir and swir regions this confirms earlier suggestions that the expression reference wavelength which features in some studies cannot be universally applied for the effective evaluation of the water status and ion contents of plants this may be related to the variability in the growth conditions of plants level of stress plant species and growth stages of measurements therefore there is still need to further discover reference wavelengths which can be used to construct new simple spectral reflectance indices for monitoring water status and ion contents of plants under varied stress conditions 4 4 formulation of novel normalized difference spectral indices ndsis to remotely assess growth water relations and ion contents seventeen individual wavelengths extracted by the smlr model with 2 4 4 3 and 4 wavelengths within the vis red edge nir swir 1 and swir 2 regions respectively were selected and the possible combinations between them were computed as normalized difference spectral indices ndsis and regressed with each parameter the results of the regression analysis revealed the best fit equations that yielded the highest coefficient of determination r2 for k and ca2 contents were linear and quadratic while other parameters fitted through quadratic and or exponential curves colored green in tables 6 9 these curvilinear relationships suggest the two cultivars exhibited different responses to salinity levels in the growth water relations and ion contents the relationships also imply the efficiency of ndsis to monitor canopy characteristics might be dependent on the degree of changes in these characteristics under different salinity levels the most ndsis which are based on the possible combinations between the selected singular wavelengths from the vis red edge nir swir 1 and swir 2 regions yielded very significant relationships with sdw k and ca2 contents the r2 of the relationships of these ndsis with sdw k and ca2 contents ranged from 0 70 to 0 90 from 0 70 to 0 81 and from 0 70 to 0 88 respectively colored green in tables 8 9 and 10 consequently these results indicate that the ndsis that track the changes in photosynthetic pigment contents photosynthetic efficiency leaf tissue structure and plant water status may all have coincided with symptoms that are correlated with growth reduction and k and ca2 deficiency at least under salinity stress conditions it is well known that potassium k and calcium ca2 ions play indispensable roles in many physiological and biochemical processes in plants potassium participates in the stimulation of cell expansion the regulation of stomatal movement the preservation of osmoregulation the synthesis of soluble nitrogen containing compounds and the phloem transport of photosynthesis from source to sink organs and energy transfer siddique et al 2012 zorb et al 2014 in addition k could contribute to greater water retention in plant tissue under salinity stress conditions via the decrease of the ratio of cortex to stele in stem karimia et al 2009 as well as through its pivotal role in the osmotic adjustment and regulation of turgor during stomatal movement which indirectly affects the photosynthesis and transpiration rates tuna et al 2010 oyiga et al 2016 calcium plays also important roles in the structure and permeability of cell membranes the stabilization of cell wall and stimulation of plant cell division and elongation el beltagi and mohamed 2013 both ions regulate chlorophyll levels with k preventing its decomposition and ca2 acts as a secondary messenger in cytokinin mediated chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway umar et al 2011 it is therefore possible that alterations in the abovementioned physiological and biochemical processes of plants due to deficit of k and ca2 contents under salinity stress in turn lead to dramatic changes in the spectral reflectance properties that can be detected in the full range of the spectrum therefore the ndsis that were formulated in this study and yielded maximum r2 with k and ca2 contents and sdw incorporate wavelengths from vis red edge nir and swir regions colored green in tables 8 10 the study of zhang et al 2014a 2014b indicate strong correlations between the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the nir and the swir regions and the ion contents in cotton k ca2 and mg2 under salinity stress conditions whereas the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the vis region failed to track changes in the ion contents since the loss of activity and the degradation of chlorophyll under salinity stress can be related not only to k and ca2 deficiency but also to the accumulation of toxic ions na the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the vis region in this study and yielded the highest r2 with k and ca2 may not reflect only the negative effects of k and ca2 deficiency on photosynthetic pigment content but may also reflect the negative effects of ion toxicity as well these results indicate that the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the vis region are generally not unique to assess k and ca2 contents under salinity conditions consequently the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the vis region may be suitable also for estimating toxic ions contents na and cl and growth reduction as well in this study the ndsis that yielded very significant relationships with na and cl contents and k na ratio incorporate wavelengths from the vis red edge and nir regions colored green in tables 7 9 it is therefore possible that the ndsis that track photosynthetic pigment content photosynthetic efficiency and tissue leaf structure can be useful for the simultaneous assessment of various ion contents and growth reduction under salinity conditions in this study very few ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the swir had highly significant relationships with na and cl contents and k na ratio r2 0 7 see green color in tables 7 9 this result indicates that the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the vis the red edge and the nir regions are more accurate than those incorporating wavelengths from the swir region in the assessment of toxic ion contents na and cl contents and k na ratio these observations are an indication of the early response of photosynthetic pigment contents photosynthetic efficiency and leaf structure to stress of ion toxicity and imbalance accumulation of na and or cl to toxic levels in leaves appears as chlorotic toxicity necrosis and precocious leaf senescence due to chlorophyll degradation munns and tester 2008 additionally ion toxicity and imbalance of salinity stress causes noticeable alterations in the anatomical structures of leaf like specific leaf area specific leaf weight mesophyll thickness epidermal thickness spongy mesophyll cell size and epidermis cell number hu and schmidhalter 2001 hussein et al 2012 these changes in leaf structures provide additional space for efficient sequestration of na in the leaf epidermis shabala et al 2012 maintaining a high ratio of k na in leaf tissue under salinity stress provides an ideal osmotic pressure and membrane potential for cell volume regulation oyiga et al 2016 a strong relationship between the reduction in growth sdw and toxic contents of na and cl for either salinity levels or cultivars has been observed in this study table 2 these observations may explain why the ndsis constructed in this study and incorporating wavelengths from the vis the red edge and the nir regions which were found to be more effective than those incorporating wavelengths from swir region display a higher predictive power in the assessment of toxic ion contents na and cl contents and ion imbalance k na ratio it has been reported that most of spectral reflectance indices sri based on vis vs vis and or red edge vs vis are strongly influenced by variation in photosynthetic pigment contents and photosynthetic activity under either normal and stress conditions the sri based on nir vs red edge and or nir vs nir are found to be highly affected by leaf structure filella and penuelas 1994 wu et al 2009 4 5 assessment of growth water relations and ion contents for each salinity level and cultivar we selected numerous ndsis from 136 ndsis presented in tables 6 10 to show the functional relationship between these ndsis and the growth water relations and ion contents for each salinity level and cultivar these ndsis were chosen so that the possible combinations of two wavelengths cover the vis vs vis red edge vs vis nir vs red edge swir vs swir swir vs vis and swir vs red edge wavelengths of the spectrum such ndsis are found to be closely related with photosynthetic pigment contents photosynthetic efficiency internal leaf structure and canopy water status in previous studies however the dramatic changes in these components which may depend on salinity level and degree of salt tolerance of the cultivar may also determine the closest associations between these ndsis and growth water relations and ion contents parameters regarding the relationships between the selected ndsis and sdw water relations and ion contents parameters it is noteworthy that these relationships delivered closer fits for two salinity levels 6 and 12 ds m 1 and the salt sensitive cultivar sakha 61 than the control treatment and the salt tolerant cultivar sakha 93 and this was more evident for sdw and ion contents and their ratios than the water relations table 11 this indicates that the efficiency of ndsis for tracking changes in growth water status and ion contents under salinity stress may depend on a combination of the magnitude effect of salinity levels and the degree of salt tolerance of cultivars hu et al 2016 reaffirmed this conclusion by showing that the significant variation in growth behavior of plants that occur between the salinity levels and cultivars may also influence the canopy spectral reflectance pattern which finally led to differences in the qualities of the spectral assessments of water relations and ion contents for each salinity level and cultivar the results of this study also indicate that the ndsis that were constructed based on vis vs vis red edge vs vis and nir vs red edge wavelengths showed higher predictive power in the assessment of sdw water relations and ion contents under moderate and high salinity levels 6 and 12 ds m 1 than the ndsis that are based on swir vs swir swir vs vis and swir vs red edge with the exception of sdw lop and k content which the ndsis that are based on swir vs swir showed also higher predictive power in the assessment of these parameters see green color in table 11 these findings indicate that the ndsis that track leaf photosynthetic pigment concentrations photosynthetic efficiency and internal leaf structure can be very good estimators of growth water relations and ion contents under moderate and high salinity levels the utility of ndsis that incorporate wavelengths from vis red edge and nir regions to improve the accuracy in estimating especially growth ion contents and ratios may be related to the fact that decreases in chlorophyll contents necrosis and senescence of leaves as well as changes in tissue structure are a logical consideration and real phenomenon of osmotic and ionic stresses of salinity zhang et al 2014 el hendawy et al 2017a in this sense clevers et al 2002 reported that the nir red edge indices are related to tissue pigment contents as well as the crop nutrition status zhang et al 2011 also reported that the indices based on the nir region and chlorophyll absorption bands vis region gave good indicators for soil salinity effects this was explained by the close association of the indices with chlorophyll retention photosynthetic capacity and internal leaf structure which are a logical consideration for the negative effects of high salinity soils on plant growth miller et al 1991 reported that the vis region is fundamentally linked to the photosynthetic pigment content while the red edge and nir regions are associated with leaf structural changes and water statutes of plants kriston vizi et al 2008 reported that the reflectance in the green and the red regions displayed moderate correlations with leaf water potential under water stress conditions hackl et al 2013 also reported that the vis nir based indices have high stability for assessment of the water statues of wheat plants under salinity conditions 5 conclusions and outlook this study provides further support for the use of shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents parameters as screening criteria for evaluating the salt tolerance of wheat genotypes under simulate close to saline field growth conditions spectral signatures of the canopy in the 350 2500 nm range enable to spectrally assess the growth water relations and ion contents of wheat cultivars under the simulated saline field conditions in an expeditious non destructive manner sequential multivariate analysis resulted in the identification of sensitive spectral waveband regions and effective wavelengths related to sdw water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity stress these multivariate analyses were successful in reducing the spectral datasets to a manageable size and allowed to derive new and simple normalized spectral reflectance indices ndsis for tracking growth water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity conditions six wavelengths in the vis five in the red edge regions elven in the nir region five in the swir 1 region and nine wavelengths in the swir 2 region were extracted through the smlr as effective bands for assessing the tested parameters with the wavelengths in the vis and the red edge regions were more appropriate than those in the nir and the swir regions the ndsis that incorporate wavelengths from the vis the red edge and the nir regions better explain the variability in growth leaf water relations and ion contents than those incorporating wavelengths from the swir this study the type of which has rarely been conducted indicates that the hyperspectral reflectance sensing technique is a rapid non destructive and cost efficient alternative tool for the assessment of salt tolerance of wheat genotypes based on the status of water relations and ion contents of leaves under a realistic simulation of saline field conditions salinity results in increased accumulations of potentially toxic ions which impair the growth of plants as well as cause disturbances in plant water relations as consequence of lowered soil water potentials which leading to decreases in plant water relationships the effect of salinity is reflected in decreased biomass as well as the build up of ions in plants which again lead to changes in spectral reflectance resulting from different pigment or biomass properties hence it also possible to indirectly assess changes in plants ionic concentrations and water relations as long as they are causally contributing to such changes although the findings of this study cannot be generally extrapolated to any combination of salinity type and level as well as crop and genotype specific differences in salt tolerance they offer a highly interesting potential for optimizing cultivar selection for given site conditions and genotype panels by allowing to minimize the laborious costly and time consuming destructive calibration for ions and water relations hence a reduced data set could be destructively analyzed with the potential to predict parameters of growth ionic and water relations for the remaining larger part of an increased set of cultivars this will allow for substantial savings in cost and time which are a key to the adoption of high throughput phenotyping in the selection process in breeding further studies augmenting the possible impacts of these findings will be highly rewarding acknowledgments the authors extend their appreciation to the deanship of scientific research at king saud university for funding this

11270,realistic simulations of saline field conditions and effective monitoring of phenotyping parameters in an expeditious non destructive manner are imperative to successful breeding of genotypes for salinity stress tolerance this study aimed to spectrally assess the growth water relations and ion contents of wheat under simulated saline field conditions using the subsurface water retention technique swrt and three salinity water levels control 6 and 12 ds m 1 phenotypic parameters and hyperspectral signatures of the canopy within the 350 2500 nm range were measured at the flowering stage multivariate analysis including correlation partial least squares regression simultaneous b coefficient and variable importance for projection vip and stepwise multiple linear regression were used in the same order to extract sensitive wavebands and effective singular wavelengths binary effective wavelengths as normalized spectral indices ndsis were constructed and related to phenotypic parameters for pooled data and for each salinity level and cultivar the results confirmed that the shoot dry weight sdw water relations and ion contents parameters were effective as screening criteria for evaluating the salt tolerance of wheat cultivars under simulated saline field conditions it was possible to assess the phenotypic parameters by using hyperspectral canopy signatures over a broad spectrum range all parameters exhibited stronger relationships with the wavelengths extracted in the visible infrared vis and red edge regions than those extracted in the near infrared nir and shortwave infrared swir regions six wavelengths within the vis region five within the red edge and swir 1 regions eleven within the nir region and nine within the swir 2 region were extracted as effective bands the ndsis based on vis vis red edge red edge red edge vis nir vis nir red edge and nir nir were more appropriate for assessing the phenotypic parameters than indices based on swir swir and swir nir except for the sdw k and ca2 contents which showed strong correlations with the latter ndsis the close relationship between sdw and the water relations and ion contents parameters on one side and the high predictive power of the ndsis based on the vis red edge and nir wavelengths in the assessment of phenotypic parameters on the other side indicates that the hyperspectral reflectance data and band selection techniques could be used for the indirect assessment of water relations and ion content of wheat under saline field conditions keywords leaf water potential multivariate analysis phenomics phenotyping salinity stress subsurface water retention technique 1 introduction salinity problems are unavoidable in the agricultural sector under arid and semi arid conditions low precipitation and river flows high temperature and evaporation and the frequent incidence of drought exacerbate salinity problems in this sector most importantly the rise in shortages of fresh water in countries with arid and semi arid climates necessitates an increase in the use of alternative water sources to bridge the gap between production and consumption of food crops in the central part of saudi arabia for example saline groundwater with an electrical conductivity of about 5 0 ds m 1 is employed to supplement irrigation shortfalls el hendawy et al 2017a the use of saline groundwater for irrigation without adequate management strategies impacts the sustainability of agriculture including the production capacity for food crops the cultivation of salt tolerant genotypes is the most effective and feasible strategy to sustain crop production in saline conditions it is inexpensive for farmers and easily applicable on a large scale requires little skills to apply and provides a sustainable solution relative to other strategies such as leaching and addition and mixed of gypsum to the soil numerous attempts to improve the salt tolerance of genotypes were advanced through traditional breeding programs and genetic engineering with few salt tolerant genotypes has been released the growth conditions growth platform and evaluation methods for assessment of parameters associated with salinity tolerance are the major constraints to improving the salt tolerance of genotypes in breeding programs tavakkoli et al 2010 hackl et al 2013 hu et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017b majority of studies on salinity aimed at evaluating the genetic variation in salt tolerance and assessing plant parameters as screening criteria were performed under ideal controlled conditions greenhouse and growth chamber in small scale pot or uniform growth media such as the hydroponic system the salt tolerance of genotypes observed under controlled conditions in small scale pot is inconsistent with most studies conducted in saline field conditions consequently plant parameters derived from controlled conditions are often re assessed under natural saline field conditions el hendawy et al 2009 tavakkoli et al 2010 oyiga et al 2016 the evaluation of the salt tolerance of genotypes and the identification of plant parameters as screening criteria under natural saline field conditions is also limited by the spatial temporal heterogeneity of soil properties in the single field and between plots even at short distances munns and james 2003 in this study the saline field conditions were simulated using the subsurface water retention technique swrt this technique utilizes a representative sample size a large measuring area and exposes genotypes to fluctuations in parameters humidity and temperature that control the rate of evapotranspiration el hendawy et al 2017a 2017b the technique also enables uniform distribution of the water content and salt concentrations in the root zone for all genotypes which is difficult to achieve under natural saline field conditions the success of improving the salt tolerance of genotypes in breeding program requires also rapid cost effective and non destructive evaluation methods for the assessment of plant parameters associated with salinity tolerance although there are various desirable plant parameters exist as screening criteria to evaluate and improve the salt tolerance of genotypes plant breeders are reluctant to use them routinely this is because their assessment using traditional evaluation methods involves sampling that is destructive time intensive and expensive this is often the case for genomics assisted plant breeding which involves a large number of genotypes and a large geographic area for example although the leaf water relations parameters water and osmotic potential and parameters related to the accumulation of toxic ions na and cl and essential ions k and ca2 have been established in various crops as effective screening criteria for discriminating salt tolerance among genotypes el hendawy et al 2005a 2005b nawaz et al 2010 zhang et al 2014a 2014b ashraf and ashraf 2015 oyiga et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017b the assessment of such parameters in large scale evaluation using traditional evaluation methods and devices are expensive destructive and time intensive these methods require high sampling densities and repeated measurements at different growth stages several phenotyping tools have recently been developed to solve problems associated with traditional evaluation methods in the plant breeding process hyperspectral reflectance sensing is an important high throughput phenotyping tool for simultaneous indirect assessment of multiple plant parameters under different environmental conditions this tool is based on that the spectral reflectance of the canopy in the visible vis 400 700 nm the near infrared nir 700 1300 nm and the shortwave infrared swir 1300 2500 nm bands carries several information associated with diverse biophysical and biochemical characteristics of plants which can be to some extent cultivar specific and therefore an effective tool for detecting salt tolerance of the wide range of genotypes gutierrez et al 2010 winterhalter et al 2011 cabrera bosquet et al 2012 erdle et al 2013 kipp et al 2014 lobos et al 2014 elsayed et al 2015 attia and rajan 2016 hu et al 2016 rischbeck et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017a c garriga et al 2017 however because the hyperspectral reflectance of canopy and proper band features depends on environmental and atmospheric conditions as well as crop types there is still need for testing in different diverse environmental conditions in order to further validate known spectral reflectance indices sri to derive new and simpler sri s and to develop monitoring models with wider applicability for indirectly assessment of stress related plant parameters plant water relations parameters expressed as leaf water and osmotic potential and leaf turgor pressure are routinely used as screening criteria for evaluating and improving the salt tolerance of genotypes in various crops under salt stress conditions vysotskaya et al 2010 razzaghi et al 2011 zhang et al 2014a 2014b ashraf and ashraf 2015 oyiga et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017b there is paucity of investigations on the relationship between hyperspectral reflectance data and these components of plant water relations at different intensities of salt stress under simulated saline field conditions however several studies have assessed absolute leaf water content relative water content and whole canopy water content especially under water stress conditions using several sri s several spectral reflectance regions are suitable for the estimation of plant water status under different stresses hackl et al 2013 indicated that the simple spectral reflectance ratio indices derived from the combination of the vis and nir regions showed significant correlation with the leaf water potential in wheat under salinity stress pe√±uelas et al 1996 proposed the simple ratio water index based on the nir region to assess crop water status of barley under salinity stress zhang et al 2012 2014a b modeled the normalized difference spectral indices ndsi and ratios of spectral indices from the swir region to evaluate the fuel moisture content fmc the equivalent water thickness ewt and the relative water content rwc of cotton at different salinity levels these studies demonstrate that several wavelengths are useful for assessment of plant water status of cotton under salinity stress conditions parameters related to specific ion toxicities na and cl and essential ions k and ca2 cannot be ruled out as key screening criteria for evaluating salt tolerance of genotypes under salinity stress conditions several sri are promising for the assessment of many biochemical compounds in leaves including chlorophylls carotenoids anthocyanin flavonoids crude protein and total nitrogen under normal and stress conditions major and minor elements including na ca k mg p mn b fe cu and zn have been assessed from sensor based measurements however restricted to non saline conditions clark et al 1987 ward et al 2011 the use of sri for assessment of mineral contents under salinity stress has received little attention the accumulation of na and cl in leaves to toxic levels and low uptake of k and ca2 under salinity stress alter the spectral signature of the canopy which can be exploited for assessment these elements using different sri s according to zhang et al 2014a 2014b sri s based on swir nir and swir swir wavelengths are suitable for effective monitoring of na cl k mg2 and ca2 contents in cotton grown in saline soil methods for extraction of optimal and effective wavelengths from hyperspectral reflectance data for indirect assessment of plant parameters are rapidly increasing these methods such as vegetation indices partial least squares regression plsr and stepwise multiple linear regression smlr are predicated on minimizing background and spectral noise to enhance utilization of the spectral information dorigo et al 2007 wu et al 2009 lee et al 2009 the plsr and smlr efficiently deal with large datasets containing noisy collinear and highly correlated variables therefore both approaches enable extraction of effective and suitable wavelengths for assessment of different biophysical and biochemical characteristics of a canopy the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the potential of growth water relations and ion contents as screening criteria for evaluating the salt tolerance of wheat genotypes under simulated saline field conditions 2 compare the spectral signature of the canopy using the three regions of the spectrum vis nir and swir for different salinity levels and wheat cultivars 3 sequentially extract optimal and effective wavelengths of the three regions of the spectrum and construct new dual band normalized spectral reflectance indices ndsis for indirect assessment of water relations and ion contents parameters and 4 quantify the reliable relationship between ndsis and tested parameters for pooled data and for each salinity level and cultivar 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site and conditions field experiments were carried out at the experimental research station of the college of food and agriculture sciences king saud university riyadh saudi arabia 24 25 n 46 34 e elevation 400 m during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 growing seasons the study area is characterized by a typical arid climate with the temperature and precipitation during the wheat growth period ranged from 7 0 to 41 0 c and 8 to 25 mm respectively the experiments were conducted in a sandy soil 90 4 sand 5 4 silt and 4 2 clay with a bulk density of 1 48 g cm 3 an electrical conductivity of 0 59 ds m 1 a ph of 7 84 a field capacity of 0 101 m3 m 3 and a wilting point of 0 038 m3 m 3 2 2 setup of subsurface water retention technique swrt plant materials salinity treatments agronomic practices and experimental design the swrt was setup according to el hendawy et al 2017a 2017b an impermeable polyethylene pe membrane with a 0 03 mm thick was installed in a u shaped with a 3 1 width depth aspect ratio the width of the base of the membrane sheet was kept at 60 cm at a soil depth of 40 cm the right and left sides of the membrane sheet were uplifted by 20 cm with no membrane was present from the edge of the sides of the membrane sheet up to the soil surface to allow drainage the soil was irrigated using fresh water following the setup of the swrt to enable rearrangement of the particles and to arrive at the desired soil bulk density after the soil dries the seeds of two wheat cultivars differing in their salt tolerance triticum aestivum l cvv sakha 93 and sakha 61 were sown in a four row plot with the latter being the more salt sensitive one el hendawy et al 2005a the rows were 6 m long with 0 15 m spacing and seeds were planted on december 10th 2015 and december 5th 2016 at a seeding rate of 16 g m 2 the plots were irrigated with fresh water for 25 days to avoid an osmotic shock during germination and at the early seedling stage thereafter the control plots continued to be irrigated with fresh water about 0 35 ds m 1 while the moderate and high salinity plots were irrigated with artificial saline water containing 3 51 and 7 02 g nacl l 1 to reach salinity levels of 6 and 12 0 ds m 1 respectively during the growing season irrigation was initiated when 50 of the total available water at depths from 0 to 40 cm was depleted the quantity of irrigation water for each treatment was calculated based on the soil water content at depths of 0 40 cm using the equation smd Œ∏fc Œ∏i d bd where smd is the soil moisture deficit mm d is the depth of the roots 40 cm bd is the bulk density of the soil layer g cm 3 and Œ∏fc and Œ∏i are the volumetric soil water contents m 3 m 3 at field capacity and before irrigation respectively to deliver constant and equal amounts of water to each plot the main line of the irrigation system which delivered water from plastic water storage tanks to the specific treatment plots was distributed to the sub main hoses at each plot and equipped with manual control valves a water meter was installed at the location where the main line contacted with plastic tanks to facilitate the measurement of the amount of water for each treatment prior to each treatment soil samples at depth of 0 40 cm were collected from moderate and high salinity plots to monitor accumulation of salt in the root zone the electrical conductivity ec of soil samples was measured using the soil water extraction method with water to soil suspension ratio of 2 1 the ec of the moderate and the high salinity plots at the grain dough stage reached 8 9 and 14 3 ds m 1 respectively the plots were fertilized using 120 90 and 60 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 and k2o respectively nitrogen fertilizer was applied in three equal doses at seeding stem elongation and booting stages as ammonium nitrate 33 5 n phosphorus was applied prior to seeding as calcium superphosphate 15 5 p2o5 while potassium was added at booting stage as potassium chloride 60 k2o other field management was based on high efficiency cultivation procedures the experiments were laid out in a randomized complete block split plot design in triplicate with the three levels of salinity treatments and the two wheat cultivars retained in the main and subplots respectively each subplot was 0 6 m wide and 6 m long yielding an area of 3 6 m2 2 3 measurements of phenotypic parameters shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents ten plants from each subplot were collected randomly at the flowering stage dried at 70 c for 72 h and weighed to obtain the dry weight of shoot per plant three leaves were also collected from each subplot at the flowering stage to measure the leaf water potential lwp measurement was conducted from 12 00 to 15 00 h using a scholander pressure chamber scholander et al 1965 the leaves used for measuring lwp were immediately kept in dry ice and then transported to the laboratory for leaf osmotic potential lop measurements leaf sap was extracted from the leaf samples under pressure at room temperature and lop determined from 10 Œºl aliquots using a vapor pressure osmometer wescor 5100c wescor inc logan ut usa the lop was calculated as lop 0 00832 t m where t denotes the temperature kin kelvin and m is the concentration osmol of the sample wyn jones and gorham 1983 the leaf turgor potential ltp was calculated as the difference between lwp and lop values approximately 0 4 g of pulverized leaf samples collected at the flowering stage was digested using 3 ml of perchloric acid and 8 ml of concentrated nitric acid for 12 h followed by burning at 300 c for 3 h the digested samples were transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flask and distilled water added to attain a final volume of 50 ml the concentrations of na k and ca2 were determined using a flame photometer elex 6361 eppendorf ag hamburg germany about 0 1 g of each ground sample was extracted using 100 ml of distilled water followed by shaking for 1 h and filtering to determine the concentration of cl the concentration of cl contents was measured using an ion chromatography analyzer dionex x 300 sunnyvale ca 94086 usa 2 4 canopy hyperspectral reflectance measurements canopy hyperspectral reflectance was determined synchronously with the phenotypic parameters using a portable backpack asd fieldspec pro spectroradiometer analytical spectral devices inc boulder co usa under cloudless conditions within 2 h of solar noon the device captures solar radiation reflecting from plant canopy between 350 to 2500 nm using a probe with a 25 field of view and delivers data in 1 nm width continuous bands the probe was held vertically at about 0 80 m above the wheat canopy in nadir orientation in order to achieve an approximately 28 cm2 sensing area and minimize influence of soil background a white reflectance panel of barium sulfate was used to correct interference from ambient noise before and after reflectance measurements for each sub plot as well as to generate reflected light percentages to eliminate border effects five replicated canopy hyperspectral measurements were taken for each sub plot on rows 2 and 3 excluding the first meter of the two rows an average of 10 scans calculated automatically was used for each measurement and the average of five measurements was considered a measured spectrum for a sub plot 2 5 sequence for obtaining spectral band regions and wavelengths to estimate water relations and ion contents the optimal spectral band regions and wavelengths for assessment of measured parameters were obtained following the sequence correlation analysis partial least square regression plsr simultaneous b coefficient and variable importance for projection vip resulting from the plsr method and stepwise multiple linear regression smlr the correlation analysis as the simplest method was used to calculate the correlation coefficient between original spectral reflectance of wavelengths in the 400 2500 nm range and the target parameter the values of correlation coefficient provided a complete image of the relationship between the target parameters and the spectral reflectance based on thenkabail et al 2014 and wang et al 2016 the spectral band regions showing high correlation with the target parameter were retained while those showing low or no correlation were eliminated the plsr is a multivariate statistical analysis method dealing efficiently with data containing a large set of multi collinear and noisy independent variables wavelengths data and relating them to the target dependent variables growth water relations and ion contents parameters it is used to predict the target parameters from a large dataset of independent variables without losing hyperspectral information schreiber 1993 fu et al 2013 the plsr method is therefore important for relating hyperspectral reflectance data to target parameters the optimal relationship between two variables wavelengths and target parameters without under or over fitting problems was tested through the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse after plsr modeling the optimal spectral band regions for target dependent variables assessment were identified using the plsr coefficients b coefficients and the variable importance on projection vip the b coefficients express the correlation between independent variables original spectral reflectance values and dependent variables target parameters the independent variables with larger b coefficients contribute largely to the regression model the vip is another parameter representing the contribution of each independent variable in fitting the plsr model for both predictors and response variables since the b coefficients values are unusable in isolation for selecting the sensitive spectral band regions lee et al 2009 the spectral band regions were retained when the b coefficient value was above the standard deviation and the threshold for vip scores set to 1 0 simultaneously wold et al 2001 the selected wavelengths regions obtained from the plsr analysis were further analyzed through smlr method to extract the most influential wavelengths for estimation of target parameters the smlr method is a systematic approach of removing and adding terms in a multi linear model based on the influence distribution and the significance of a target parameter as affected by independent variables wavelengths in optimal spectral band regions the wavelengths in the spectral band regions selected by plsr analysis were inputted into the smlr process and checked to discern wavelengths that will be eliminated based on a significant probability level which is generally set to 0 05 in each step vasques et al 2008 the process of smlr analysis terminates if no more wavelengths can be entered or eliminated therefore the predictive models for target parameters are constructed based on the influential wavelengths selected by the smlr method 2 6 construction of two band normalized difference spectral indices ndsis to remotely assess growth water relations and ion contents the sensitive wavelengths obtained from the smlr analysis were used to create all possible combinations between pairs of wavelengths as ndsis the ndsis were calculated based on the following corresponding formula ndsi rŒª1 r Œª2 r Œª1 r Œª2 where rŒª1 and rŒª2 represent the spectral reflectance of sensitive wavelengths Œª1 and Œª2 obtained from the smlr analysis to test the efficiency of the ndsis for assessment of growth water relations and ion contents parameters linear and non linear statistical analysis were employed and coefficients of determination r2 calculated using the pooled data of replications salinity levels and cultivars and individual data of each salinity level and cultivar 2 7 statistical analysis data for plant dry weight water relations and ion contents parameters were tested using anova s appropriate for a randomized complete block split plot design with the salinity level and cultivar considered as the main factor and the split factor respectively combined analyses of variance using mean squares values were done across two years the differences between the mean values of salinity levels and cultivars were compared through duncan s test using the sas software vers 9 2 sas institute inc cary north carolina united states a pearson s correlation coefficient matrix was used to determine the relationship between all parameters for high and moderate salinity levels n 12 and for each cultivar n 18 the plsr and smlr analysis were performed with xlstat statistical package vers 2017 4 excel add ins soft sarl new york ny usa the relationships between different ndsis as independent variables and plant dry weight water relations and ion contents parameters as dependent variables were fitted using linear and non linear curve fitting and the relations with the highest r2 were considered as the best fit relationships the relationships were fitted using the sas software vers 9 2 sas institute inc cary north carolina united states 3 results 3 1 variation in shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents parameters between different

leaf osmotic potential lop and leaf turgor pressure ltp ion contents in leaves na cl k and ca2 and k na ratio are presented in table 1 the salinity level and cultivar main effect in the combined analysis was significant for all parameters the cultivar salinity level interaction was significant for all parameters with the exception of the ltp and k na ratio the cultivar year interaction was not significant for all parameters with the exception of the sdw and k na ratio no salinity level year interaction occurred for na cl and k contents in leaves the cultivar salinity level year interaction was significant for sdw k and ca2 contents in leaves and k na ratio table 1 both salinity levels 6 0 and 12 0 ds m 1 resulted in a significant decrease in the lwp and lop both became more negative sdw k and ca2 contents in leaves and the k na ratio relative to the control treatment the salinity levels led to a significant increase in the ltp and na and cl contents in leaves the effects of salinity were more pronounced for the salt sensitive cultivar sakha 61 than for the less sensitive cultivar sakha 93 table 1 3 2 correlation of parameters related to salinity levels and cultivars the relationships among parameters were evaluated for high and moderate salinity levels n 12 and for each cultivar n 18 table 2 for the high salinity level 12 ds m 1 only the ltp did not show a significant correlation with the other parameters except na lower left of table 2 for the moderate salinity level 6 ds m 1 all parameters were strongly correlated to each other with the exception of the lwp which showed no correlation with the sdw ltp cl and ca2 as well as lop which showed no correlation with cl upper right of table 2 all parameters were strongly correlated to each other for both cultivars with the exception of k which showed no correlation with the sdw ltp cl ca2 and k na ratio for sakha 93 upper right of table 2 3 3 responses of spectral reflectance signatures of canopy for salinity levels and cultivars the spectral reflectance signatures of the canopy between 400 and 2500 nm for various salinity levels and cultivars are shown in fig 1 in the visible region vis 400 700 nm which is related to leaf chlorophyll content or leaf senescence and in the shortwave infrared region swir 1300 2500 nm which the magnitude of reflectance is related to the absorption characteristics of water and other compounds the two salinity levels 6 and 12 ds m 1 and salt sensitive cultivar sakha 61 had higher canopy reflectance in the both regions relative to the control treatment and salt tolerant cultivar sakha 93 in the near infrared region nir 700 1300 nm which the magnitude of reflectance in this region is related to the internal structural discontinuities encountered in the leaf the canopy reflectance for sakha 93 was higher than those for sakha 61 the spectral reflectance curves for salinity levels are distinct and the canopy reflectance of the moderate 6 ds m 1 and the high 12 ds m 1 salinity levels were higher than that for the control treatment overall the spectral reflectance curves in fig 1 shows that there are obvious differences in the shape of the canopy reflectance curves among the two cultivars and across the three salinity levels in the three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir the spectral reflectance curves for the two cultivars and three salinity levels were similar in shape with evident reflectance troughs around 680 1200 1450 and 1950 nm and minor troughs around 950 1025 and 1760 nm the green peak around 550 nm was expanded and distorted in the spectral reflectance curves of sakha 61 and occasionally for the two salinity levels 6 and 12 ds m 1 fig 1 3 4 sequence for obtaining the sensitive spectral band regions and wavelengths for estimating the shoot dry weight leaf water relations and ion contents parameters the correlation coefficients between the original spectral reflectance of the entire wavelengths 400 to 2500 nm and the parameters of shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents are displayed in fig 2 these correlations were determined based on pooled data of years replications salinity levels and cultivars the parameters of water relations lwp lop and ltp and na and cl contents were positively correlated with the original spectral reflectance in the vis and swir regions while sdw k and ca2 contents and the k na ratio display opposite relations the correlations between the parameters and the 750 840 nm intervals of the nir regions are inverse to correlations in the vis and swir regions but it is back again after 840 nm fig 2 generally the wavelengths in the vis and swir regions had moderate to strong correlation with all parameters while strong and moderate correlations between all parameters and wavelengths in the nir region were observed at the range from 700 to 740 nm red edge region and at 1100 1300 nm respectively the wavelength region 745 961 nm showed no significant correlation with all parameters with the exception of ca2 which showed a low correlation with the wavelength region of 758 784 nm the wavelength region of 961 1000 nm showed also no significant correlations with all parameters with the exception of lwp and cl content for which correlations were moderate r 0 33 0 40 the response in the swir region showed a few minor peaks at 1400 1450 1650 1680 1830 and 2220 nm the peaks with the strongest positive correlations were found around 540 and 710 nm fig 2 table 3 lists the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse of the partial least square regression plsr model between the original spectral reflectance data of the visible vis near infrared nir and short wave infrared swir and the parameters of shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents the results revealed that all parameters have displayed strong positive correlations with wavelengths in the vis region r2 0 64 0 88 and were better than with wavelengths in the nir 0 40 0 80 and swir 0 35 0 75 regions the contents of k and ca2 exhibited the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 74 0 83 for k and 0 72 0 88 for ca2 in the vis nir and swir regions of the original spectral reflectance followed by cl content r2 0 65 0 82 and sdw r2 0 57 0 80 the ltp and k na ratio were least correlated with the original spectral reflectance in the nir r2 0 40 0 43 and the swir r2 0 35 0 37 regions table 3 the regression coefficients b coefficient and the variable importance in projection vip derived from the plsr analysis were used simultaneously to obtain the sensitive waveband regions in different parts of the spectrum figs 3 and 4 the sensitive waveband regions for each parameter are listed in table 4 the regions for each parameter were selected when a b coefficient above the standard deviation coincided with a vip greater than 1 0 figs 3 and 4 based on this basis one region in the vis spectrum around 500 to 632 nm except sdw and two regions in nir spectrum located around 695 to 743 nm and 1124 to 1298 nm were identified as the most sensitive waveband regions for all parameters table 4 the two regions of swir 1 spectrum located around 1382 to 1631 nm and 1706 to 1898 nm also emerged for various parameters excluding the lwp and k na ratio for the two regions and sdw for the first region with the exception of sdw and k the region in the swir 2 spectrum located around 2108 to 2498 nm was recognized as the most sensitive waveband region for all parameters the waveband regions in the vis spectrum located around 434 to 488 nm and in the swir 2 spectrum located around 1901 to 2072 nm were important for sdw lwp and na and ca2 respectively table 4 the waveband regions selected based on the b coefficient and vip as independent variables were further analyzed by stepwise multiple linear regression smlr to identify the most influential wavelengths that contributed the most variation for each parameter the sensitive wavelengths in different parts of the spectrum and a summary of the relationship between the selected wavelengths and each parameter are presented in table 5 the wavelengths of blue 488 509 and 524 nm wavelength of green 542 nm and wavelengths of red 596 and 614 nm were the most sensitive in the vis region for the assessment of the tested parameters in the red edge region the most informative wavelengths were 719 710 716 701 and 722 nm for assessment of the three parameters of water relations lwp lop and ltp na sdw and cl k and ca2 and k na ratio respectively table 5 in the nir region the combination of 1136 nm with 1142 nm fitted the relationships of sdw the combination of 1193 nm with 1223 1232 1250 and 1256 nm correlated well with lop cl and ca2 na lwp and k respectively the combination of 1190 nm with 1211 nm and 1187 nm with 1214 nm fitted the relationships of ltp and k na ratio respectively no wavelengths in the swir 1 region 1300 1900 nm was suitable for assessment the lwp and k na ratio while the wavelengths 1832 1868 1883 1889 and 1898 nm were significantly correlated with na lop and cl sdw ltp and k and ca2 contents respectively all wavelengths in the swir 2 region 1900 2500 nm failed to assess k and ca2 contents while three combined wavelengths 2309 2321 and 2351 nm two combined wavelengths 2261 and 2288 nm and individual wavelength 2024 2297 2324 2309 and 2303 nm were recognized through the smlr methods as the most informative wavelengths for assessment of lop ltp and sdw lwp na cl and k na ratio respectively table 5 the results presented in table 5 also reveal that all parameters exhibit stronger relationships with the wavelengths extracted in the vis and red edge regions than the wavelengths in the nir and swir region the combination of two wavelengths from the nir region and occasionally from the swir region fitted the relationships with parameters more precisely than individual wavelengths 3 5 relationship of the growth water relation and ion content parameters with derived normalized difference spectral indices ndsis the ndsis of all possible combinations of wavelengths pairs obtained by smlr were further regressed with each parameter the coefficients of determination r2 and the type of regressions of these relationships which obtained after the data for the two years three replications three salinity levels and two cultivars were pooled together are presented in tables 6 10 exponential and quadratic polynomial equations were the best model describing the relationships between most of the 136 ndsi s and the sdw lop na and k na ratios while linear and quadratic polynomial equations were the most models providing the highest r2 for the relationships between these ndsi s and the other parameters tables 6 10 the lwp displayed poor correlations with the 136 ndsi s tested displaying 63 moderate 0 50 r2 0 69 and 58 weak 0 30 r2 0 49 correlations with lwp no ndsis showed its strongest with lwp whereas 75 34 40 29 58 82 88 and 43 of the 136 ndsis showed strongest correlations colored green r2 0 70 with sdw lop ltp na cl k ca2 and k na ratio respectively tables 6 10 the strongest correlations are mostly from ndsis based on nir vs vis red edge vs red edge nir vs red edge and nir vs nir wavelengths for all parameters in addition of swir vs nir and swir vs swir wavelengths for sdw k and ca2 contents and partly for cl content the weakest relationships between ndsis and the parameters colored yellow are 24 15 15 31 15 17 17 19 and 23 of the 136 ndsis displayed by sdw lwp lop ltp na cl k ca2 and k na

content table 7 and k na ratio table 9 respectively these moderate relationships were observed when the ndsis were based on combinations of any two of the three vis nir and swir parts of the spectrum the best models of the regressions and coefficients of determination for the relationships between ndsis which selected from the previous 136 ndsi s to cover the vis vis red edge vis nir red edge swir swir swir vis and swir red edge wavelengths of the spectrum and the tested parameters for each salinity level and cultivar are presented in table 11 the quadratic polynomial equation adequately models the relationships between ndsis and the tested parameters for the three salinity levels with a few linear and exponential relationships the exponential equation best modeled the relationships between ndsis and the lwp the lop and na and cl contents for sakha 61 the quadratic polynomial equation was suitable for relationships between ndsis and the other parameters for sakha 61 and most parameters for sakha 93 table 11 the selected ndsis commonly estimated the sdw ion contents parameters and ratios better than the water relations parameters the ndsis that incorporate vis vs vis such as ndsi 614 542 red edge vs vis such as ndsi 722 542 or nir vs red edge such as ndsi 1193 701 were more effective to estimate the tested parameters for two salinity levels 6 and 12 ds m 1 than those incorporating swir vs swir such as ndsi 2309 2261 swir vs vis such as ndsi 2309 614 or swir vs red edge such as ndsi 2261 701 the ndsis that incorporate swir vs vis and swir vs red edge showed strongest relationships r2 0 70 with ca2 content only for the 6 ds m 1 salinity level the ndsis that incorporate swir vs swir also displayed the highest r2 values colored green r2 0 70 with the sdw lop k content and k na ratio for 6 ds m 1 salinity level and the sdw lop cl content and k content for 12 ds m 1 salinity level the ndsis that incorporate all regions of the spectrum vis red edge nir and swir were comparable in estimating the tested parameters for the two cultivars especially for sakha 61 colored green table 11 the ndsi 2309 2261 was the only index with insignificant relationships with all parameters for sakha 93 colored yellow table 11 4 discussion 4 1 growth water relations and ion contents as important parameters in salinity studies osmotic stress specific ion toxicities and nutritional deficits for essential ions k and ca2 are confirmed as the main factors inhibiting the growth and production of plants under salinity stress conditions these factors interact to exhibit a range of phenomena at various levels of plant canopies therefore these phenomena are measured as the mor physiological parameters in order to use them as screening criteria for evaluating the salt tolerance of genotypes understanding of salt tolerance mechanisms and consequently understanding of how salinity stress inhibit the growth and productivity of plants for instance a significant reduction in the water and osmotic potentials of leaves both become more negative with increasing salinity levels and the dramatic changes in the leaf turgor pressure are due to osmotic stress which decreases the absorption capacity of roots to water the accumulation of na and cl to toxic levels in leaves and the hampered uptake of essential ions by na are ultimate phenomena of ion toxicities and imbalance of salinity stress in addition the effects of osmotic and ionic stresses can be translated into significant decreases in shoot dry weight sdw this is because the sdw is a function of various physiological processes and reflects the response of plants to these two components of salinity at the whole plant level therefore parameters related to the sdw leaf water relations the accumulation of toxic ions na and the ratios with essential ions k have been advanced attention as important screening criteria in salinity studies nawaz et al 2010 zhang et al 2014a 2014b ashraf and ashraf 2015 oyiga et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017b the results of this study also fully confirmed this statement and found that sdw all parameters of the leaf water relations leaf water potential lwp leaf osmotic potential lop and leaf turgor pressure ltp ion contents in leaves na cl k and ca2 and the k na ratio demonstrated significant variations between salinity levels and cultivars table 1 and strongest inter correlations for each salinity level and cultivar table 2 interestingly these parameters are confirmed in this study as effective screening criteria for evaluating the salt tolerance under simulated saline field conditions using the subsurface water retention technique swrt the merits of the technique are that it exposes plants to fluctuating soil water content and salt concentrations in the root zone and high variability in macro environmental conditions diurnal temperature and humidity during different growth stages it also associated with a large area and plant numbers and the latter has a significant impact on the physiological plant parameters due to the degree of intra and inter plant competition 4 2 interpretation the behavior of canopy spectral reflectance for salinity levels and cultivars in different parts of the spectrum the parameters of water relations and ion contents are very important in understanding of how plants response to osmotic and ionic stresses of salinity this raises the need for rapid non destructive methods for the assessment of these parameters especially for genomics assisted plant breeding which involves a large number of genotypes and a large geographic area substantial variations in the spectral reflectance of canopy in the full range of the spectrum 400 2500 nm are related to substantial changes in biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the canopy that are induced by osmotic and ionic stresses from salinity pe√±uelas et al 1993 zhang et al 2012 serbin et al 2014 lara et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2017a therefore interpreting the behavior of canopy spectral reflectance has the potential to rapidly assess multiple parameters from a single measurement for example changes in the internal leaf or mesophyll structure and increase in the leaf thickness and density lead to an increase in reflectance in the near infrared region nir 700 1300 nm such changes in response to salinity stress due to changes in mineral availability especially k accumulation of toxic ions na and decrease of water and osmotic potentials of the leaves have been reported zhao et al 2001 battie laclau et al 2014 rapaport et al 2015 these changes influence the scattering of light which induces a multiplicative effect on the spectra in the nir region lara et al 2016 necrosis chlorosis and tip burn are typical foliar symptoms in plants suffering from salinity stress due to imbalance in concentrations of ions like na ca2 mg2 cl and k these symptoms indicate a significant decrease in chlorophylls and carotenoids contents when the contents of both components decrease the spectral reflectance in the range of the visible spectrum vis 400 700 nm increases mainly in the blue and red regions of the vis spectrum blackburn 2007 garrity et al 2011 salinity stress rapidly changes the osmotic potential of the soil solution which leads to changes in the leaf water status due to decreased water absorption capacity of the plant these changes in plant water status could be detected before symptoms of salinity damages become visible munns and james 2003 a change in plant water status results in a broad spectral change in the range of the nir and swir wavelengths the swir region is however more sensitive to changes in plant water status and less sensitive to noise caused by the internal leaf structure than the nir region ceccato et al 2002 eitel et al 2006 the spectral reflectance in the swir region therefore increases when plant water contents decrease this study demonstrates clear differences in the canopy spectral reflectance between three salinity levels and two cultivars in various parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir fig 1 these differences among treatments are attributed to the various effects of osmotic and ionic stresses of salinity on the photosynthetic pigments leaf structure and vegetation water status this study also reveals that it is possible to assess the parameters of sdw water relations and ion contents in terms of their spectral signatures over a broad range of the spectrum results in table 3 further confirm this and reveal that the parameters of sdw water relations and ion contents showed significant correlations with the original spectral reflectance data in the three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir however the tested parameters exhibited stronger correlation with the wavelengths in the vis region r2 0 64 to 0 88 than those in the nir r2 0 43 to 0 80 and swir regions r2 0 35 to 0 75 with the exception of sdw which showed also a strong correlation with the nir region r2 0 80 such as vis an increase in spectral reflectance in the vis region especially near 550 nm in response to salinity stress due to osmotic and ionic stresses from salinity has been reported and suggested to be associated with an induced multiplicative effect on chlorophylls and carotenoids contents wang et al 2002 li et al 2010 hamzeh et al 2013 a decrease in the contents of both components is reflected by a decrease in the height of the peak near 550 nm causing the reflectance near this band to become distorted and flattened lara et al 2016 in this study the spectral reflectance curves of sakha 61 and salinity treatments 6 0 and 12 0 ds m 1 around 550 nm were distorted broad relative to that of the control treatment and sakha 93 fig 1 4 3 extraction of the sensitive spectral bands and wavelengths for assessment of the shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents parameters to our knowledge very few studies have estimated water relations and ion contents under simulated saline field growth conditions using the full spectrum this study employed multivariate methods to extract the optimal spectral band regions and most influential wavelengths associated with plant growth water relations and ion contents parameters the methods included the same sequence of correlation analysis partial least square regression plsr and stepwise multiple linear regression smlr results in fig 2 indicate that the vis red edge and swir wavebands are reliable portions for the assessment of the measured parameters the green region 520 592 nm was the most significant followed by the red edge 701 731 nm red 601 645 nm and 690 700 nm and swir regions this confirmed that salinity stress primarily influences photosynthetic pigment content where the green and the red wavelengths in the vis region were found to be very sensitive to losses of chlorophyll b and a respectively curran et al 2001 however the nir wavebands from 740 to 1300 nm showed a moderate to weak correlation with the measured parameters fig 2 the results of the correlation analysis indicate that the optimal spectral wavebands for estimating sdw water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity stress conditions are those in green red red edge and swir ranges while most of correlations associated with the nir spectra are weak to moderate some studies have reported higher and consistent relations between wavelengths in the red edge nir and swir regions and the ions and water contents under salinity stress conditions with no significant difference in reflectance in the vis region between the control and salinity treatments wang et al 2002 zhang et al 2012 2014a 2014b however li et al 2010 found the wavelengths in the vis region to be effective for the assessment of the response of castor bean plants to salt stress with little relationships observed for the wavelengths in the nir region the ambiguity of the spectrum in the nir region for the assessment of water relations and ion contents under salinity stress may be attributable to genotypic differences in the degree of changes in leaf anatomy leaf structure and mesophyll structure induced by salinity stress and this region is very sensitive to the presence of some elements such as calcium which are connected to organic complexes of plant tissues moron and cozzolino 2002 the extraction of the sensitive waveband regions containing hyperspectral information for plant variables is the basis for formulating the spectral reflectance indices stroppiana et al 2009 previous studies selected the sensitive waveband regions based on b coefficients and variable importance in projection vip that were derived from the plsr analysis the combination of the two variables eliminates invalid wavelengths with low predictive potential from the full spectrum data in this study the valuable waveband regions were selected when a b coefficient higher than the standard deviation coincided with a vip greater than 1 table 4 and figs 3 and 4 the plsr analysis demonstrated that the valuable waveband regions for the assessment of tested parameters were located around 500 630 nm 695 743 nm and 2108 2498 nm table 4 these results indicate that the plsr analysis also supported the relevance of the vis red edge and swir regions of the spectra for the assessment of water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity stress conditions the plsr analysis also revealed that the waveband ranges from 1124 to 1298 nm for all tested parameters and 1380 to 1631 nm with the exception of sdw lwp and k na ratio and 1706 to 1898 nm with the exception of lwp and k na ratio were found to be particularly important to identify the response of sdw water relations and ion contents parameters to salinity stress table 4 and figs 3 and 4 these waveband regions of the spectrum have been proved useful for detecting the water status of plant under either normal or stress conditions as well as ion contents under salinity stress zarco tejada et al 2001 ceccato et al 2002 zhang et al 2012 2014a 2014b the plsr analysis retained the waveband regions of the spectrum that correspond to variations in the photosynthetic pigments and capacity plant water status and leaf structure which always reflects the full response of plants to both osmotic and ionic stresses of salinity therefore the waveband range from 1380 to 1898 nm requires more attention in salinity stress studies the selection of these sensitive waveband regions is an indication of the reliability of the plsr analysis since the bands are known to be directly or indirectly related to common physiological parameters in many plant species rapaport et al 2015 the data shows that the plsr analysis was superior and more accurate than correlation analysis for extraction of the sensitive waveband regions for assessment tested parameters shi et al 2013 indicated that data from plsr analysis are not easily interpretable particularly with a high number of variables the combination of the plsr and smlr methods was advanced for selection of target influential wavelengths reduction of the multicollinearity problem prediction of the parameters of interest and to simplification of results interpretation sharabian et al 2014 the smlr analysis was performed to select the target wavelengths for each parameter from the waveband regions generated from the plsr analysis data from the smlr analysis demonstrated that the wavelengths selected in the vis and red edge regions were strongly correlated to and accounted better for the most variation in all measured parameters than those selected in either the nir or swir regions table 5 this finding is consistent with previous studies that indicate the canopy reflectance is altered by many common stressors at the vis and red edge wavelengths 400 730 nm than in other regions of the spectrum 730 2500 nm and therefore those wavelengths are earlier stress indicators carter and knapp 2001 garriga et al 2014 the wavelengths 542 614 and 596 nm in the vis region and 716 701 and 701 nm in the red edge region explained up to 80 of the variability found in cl k and ca2 respectively in this study about 62 and 74 of the variability in the sdw was detected by wavelengths at 488 and 716 nm respectively the wavelengths 542 and 719 nm were effective in estimating the water relations status especially the lop about 67 and 59 of the variability in the na content was detected by wavelengths at 524 and 710 nm respectively the dynamic responses of plants to salinity stress through alteration of ion contents in leaves either by accumulation of toxic ions or deficiency of essential ions and changes in the water status of leaves are accompanied by a strong reduction in pigment contents and photosynthetic activities zhang et al 2014a 2014b el hendawy et al 2017b therefore the results of this study showed that most wavelengths located around 500 and 720 nm were retained in the smlr models and accounted for most of the variation in sdw water relations and ion contents caused by salinity stress these findings indicate that the spectral regions associated with photosynthetic pigments and capacity and leaf structure could be used as indirect indicator for the spectral assessment of water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity conditions in a rapid and non destructive manner elvidge and chen 1995 detected plant stress at red edge bands centered at 705 and 735 nm stein et al 2014 detected k and ca2 contents by wavelengths in the green and red edge regions the wavelengths in the vis region which are known to indicate the deficiency of k have been widely used to predict k zhai et al 2013 lara et al 2016 revealed a strong correlation between the salt concentrations of lettuce leaves and the wavelengths located at approximately 500 600 nm and 710 nm osmotic and ionic components of salinity stress cause substantial changes in various leaf anatomical biochemical and biophysical properties such as structure thickness size specific mass equivalent water thickness fuel moisture content and contents of lignin cellulose or sugar for instance deficit in k which is the results of the antagonism between na and k at the site uptake of ions in the roots leads to substantial changes in the mesophyll structure and thickness battie laclau et al 2014 sufficient k in leaves plays distinct roles in maintaining plant cell turgor and increase the leaf intercellular air space under abiotic stress lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 found that the specific leaf weight and equivalent water thickness of cotton leaves were increased with increasing soil salinity levels in addition cellulose lignin content of cell walls is significantly correlated with ca2 content under salinity stress kafkafi and bernstein 1996 because the canopy reflectance in the nir and swir regions are very sensitive to the abovementioned changes which induced by k and ca2 deficiency the wavelengths in the both regions cannot be ruled out as necessary bands for indirect assessment of the water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity stress conditions the results of the present study show that more than 70 of the variation in k and ca2 contents can be detected by the combination of two wavelengths 1193 and 1256 nm for k and 1193 and 1223 nm for ca2 in the nir region and 1898 nm for both ions in the swir 1 region 1300 1900 nm the combination of two wavelengths 1193 and 1223 nm in the nir region 1868 nm in the swir 1 region and 2309 nm in the swir 2 region 1900 2500 nm explained more than 63 of the variation in cl content the wavelengths selected by the smlr model in the nir combination of 1193 and 1232 nm swir 1 1832 nm and swir 2 2324 nm regions explained 59 53 and 58 of the variability in na contents respectively the wavelengths selected by the smlr model in the swir 2 regions combination of 2309 2321 and 2351 nm better explain the variability in lop than those selected in the nir region combination of 1193 and 1223 and vice versa for lwp table 5 the smlr model identified a series of sensitive wavelengths in nir and swir regions for detecting the growth leaf water status and ion contents of wheat under simulated saline field growth conditions the wavelengths 1136 1142 1187 1190 1193 1211 1214 1223 1232 1250 and 1256 nm in the nir region 1832 1862 1883 1889 and 1898 nm in the swir 1 region and 2024 2261 2288 2297 2303 2309 2321 2324 and 2351 nm in the swir 2 were extracted as the most important individual wavelengths for tracking changes in growth leaf water relations and ion contents in previous studies the wavelengths centered at 970 1200 1240 1400 1450 1650 1920 1950 and 2250 nm have been proposed as water absorption bands pe√±uelas et al 1993 ceccato et al 2002 imanishi et al 2004 gutierrez et al 2010 yao et al 2014a 2014b curran et al 2001 also showed that the wavelengths centered at 1182 1216 1920 and 1936 nm were of valuable for plant water absorption the weak absorption band 1222 nm and the band in the swir 2 2264 nm have been proposed as reliable bands for remote sensing of plant water status gao 1996 pe√±uelas et al 1996 danson et al 1992 reported that the wavelengths located at 1450 1650 and 2250 nm were significantly correlated with specific water density whereas the relationship of this parameter with wavelengths at 975 and 1175 nm was insignificant the wavelengths 2264 2276 and 2306 nm were used to construct new simple spectral reflectance indices for monitoring ion contents na cl k ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in cotton grown under saline soil conditions zhang et al 2014a 2014b previous and the current study demonstrate that changes in growth leaf water status and ion contents result in broad spectral changes in the nir and swir regions this confirms earlier suggestions that the expression reference wavelength which features in some studies cannot be universally applied for the effective evaluation of the water status and ion contents of plants this may be related to the variability in the growth conditions of plants level of stress plant species and growth stages of measurements therefore there is still need to further discover reference wavelengths which can be used to construct new simple spectral reflectance indices for monitoring water status and ion contents of plants under varied stress conditions 4 4 formulation of novel normalized difference spectral indices ndsis to remotely assess growth water relations and ion contents seventeen individual wavelengths extracted by the smlr model with 2 4 4 3 and 4 wavelengths within the vis red edge nir swir 1 and swir 2 regions respectively were selected and the possible combinations between them were computed as normalized difference spectral indices ndsis and regressed with each parameter the results of the regression analysis revealed the best fit equations that yielded the highest coefficient of determination r2 for k and ca2 contents were linear and quadratic while other parameters fitted through quadratic and or exponential curves colored green in tables 6 9 these curvilinear relationships suggest the two cultivars exhibited different responses to salinity levels in the growth water relations and ion contents the relationships also imply the efficiency of ndsis to monitor canopy characteristics might be dependent on the degree of changes in these characteristics under different salinity levels the most ndsis which are based on the possible combinations between the selected singular wavelengths from the vis red edge nir swir 1 and swir 2 regions yielded very significant relationships with sdw k and ca2 contents the r2 of the relationships of these ndsis with sdw k and ca2 contents ranged from 0 70 to 0 90 from 0 70 to 0 81 and from 0 70 to 0 88 respectively colored green in tables 8 9 and 10 consequently these results indicate that the ndsis that track the changes in photosynthetic pigment contents photosynthetic efficiency leaf tissue structure and plant water status may all have coincided with symptoms that are correlated with growth reduction and k and ca2 deficiency at least under salinity stress conditions it is well known that potassium k and calcium ca2 ions play indispensable roles in many physiological and biochemical processes in plants potassium participates in the stimulation of cell expansion the regulation of stomatal movement the preservation of osmoregulation the synthesis of soluble nitrogen containing compounds and the phloem transport of photosynthesis from source to sink organs and energy transfer siddique et al 2012 zorb et al 2014 in addition k could contribute to greater water retention in plant tissue under salinity stress conditions via the decrease of the ratio of cortex to stele in stem karimia et al 2009 as well as through its pivotal role in the osmotic adjustment and regulation of turgor during stomatal movement which indirectly affects the photosynthesis and transpiration rates tuna et al 2010 oyiga et al 2016 calcium plays also important roles in the structure and permeability of cell membranes the stabilization of cell wall and stimulation of plant cell division and elongation el beltagi and mohamed 2013 both ions regulate chlorophyll levels with k preventing its decomposition and ca2 acts as a secondary messenger in cytokinin mediated chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway umar et al 2011 it is therefore possible that alterations in the abovementioned physiological and biochemical processes of plants due to deficit of k and ca2 contents under salinity stress in turn lead to dramatic changes in the spectral reflectance properties that can be detected in the full range of the spectrum therefore the ndsis that were formulated in this study and yielded maximum r2 with k and ca2 contents and sdw incorporate wavelengths from vis red edge nir and swir regions colored green in tables 8 10 the study of zhang et al 2014a 2014b indicate strong correlations between the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the nir and the swir regions and the ion contents in cotton k ca2 and mg2 under salinity stress conditions whereas the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the vis region failed to track changes in the ion contents since the loss of activity and the degradation of chlorophyll under salinity stress can be related not only to k and ca2 deficiency but also to the accumulation of toxic ions na the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the vis region in this study and yielded the highest r2 with k and ca2 may not reflect only the negative effects of k and ca2 deficiency on photosynthetic pigment content but may also reflect the negative effects of ion toxicity as well these results indicate that the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the vis region are generally not unique to assess k and ca2 contents under salinity conditions consequently the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the vis region may be suitable also for estimating toxic ions contents na and cl and growth reduction as well in this study the ndsis that yielded very significant relationships with na and cl contents and k na ratio incorporate wavelengths from the vis red edge and nir regions colored green in tables 7 9 it is therefore possible that the ndsis that track photosynthetic pigment content photosynthetic efficiency and tissue leaf structure can be useful for the simultaneous assessment of various ion contents and growth reduction under salinity conditions in this study very few ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the swir had highly significant relationships with na and cl contents and k na ratio r2 0 7 see green color in tables 7 9 this result indicates that the ndsis incorporating wavelengths from the vis the red edge and the nir regions are more accurate than those incorporating wavelengths from the swir region in the assessment of toxic ion contents na and cl contents and k na ratio these observations are an indication of the early response of photosynthetic pigment contents photosynthetic efficiency and leaf structure to stress of ion toxicity and imbalance accumulation of na and or cl to toxic levels in leaves appears as chlorotic toxicity necrosis and precocious leaf senescence due to chlorophyll degradation munns and tester 2008 additionally ion toxicity and imbalance of salinity stress causes noticeable alterations in the anatomical structures of leaf like specific leaf area specific leaf weight mesophyll thickness epidermal thickness spongy mesophyll cell size and epidermis cell number hu and schmidhalter 2001 hussein et al 2012 these changes in leaf structures provide additional space for efficient sequestration of na in the leaf epidermis shabala et al 2012 maintaining a high ratio of k na in leaf tissue under salinity stress provides an ideal osmotic pressure and membrane potential for cell volume regulation oyiga et al 2016 a strong relationship between the reduction in growth sdw and toxic contents of na and cl for either salinity levels or cultivars has been observed in this study table 2 these observations may explain why the ndsis constructed in this study and incorporating wavelengths from the vis the red edge and the nir regions which were found to be more effective than those incorporating wavelengths from swir region display a higher predictive power in the assessment of toxic ion contents na and cl contents and ion imbalance k na ratio it has been reported that most of spectral reflectance indices sri based on vis vs vis and or red edge vs vis are strongly influenced by variation in photosynthetic pigment contents and photosynthetic activity under either normal and stress conditions the sri based on nir vs red edge and or nir vs nir are found to be highly affected by leaf structure filella and penuelas 1994 wu et al 2009 4 5 assessment of growth water relations and ion contents for each salinity level and cultivar we selected numerous ndsis from 136 ndsis presented in tables 6 10 to show the functional relationship between these ndsis and the growth water relations and ion contents for each salinity level and cultivar these ndsis were chosen so that the possible combinations of two wavelengths cover the vis vs vis red edge vs vis nir vs red edge swir vs swir swir vs vis and swir vs red edge wavelengths of the spectrum such ndsis are found to be closely related with photosynthetic pigment contents photosynthetic efficiency internal leaf structure and canopy water status in previous studies however the dramatic changes in these components which may depend on salinity level and degree of salt tolerance of the cultivar may also determine the closest associations between these ndsis and growth water relations and ion contents parameters regarding the relationships between the selected ndsis and sdw water relations and ion contents parameters it is noteworthy that these relationships delivered closer fits for two salinity levels 6 and 12 ds m 1 and the salt sensitive cultivar sakha 61 than the control treatment and the salt tolerant cultivar sakha 93 and this was more evident for sdw and ion contents and their ratios than the water relations table 11 this indicates that the efficiency of ndsis for tracking changes in growth water status and ion contents under salinity stress may depend on a combination of the magnitude effect of salinity levels and the degree of salt tolerance of cultivars hu et al 2016 reaffirmed this conclusion by showing that the significant variation in growth behavior of plants that occur between the salinity levels and cultivars may also influence the canopy spectral reflectance pattern which finally led to differences in the qualities of the spectral assessments of water relations and ion contents for each salinity level and cultivar the results of this study also indicate that the ndsis that were constructed based on vis vs vis red edge vs vis and nir vs red edge wavelengths showed higher predictive power in the assessment of sdw water relations and ion contents under moderate and high salinity levels 6 and 12 ds m 1 than the ndsis that are based on swir vs swir swir vs vis and swir vs red edge with the exception of sdw lop and k content which the ndsis that are based on swir vs swir showed also higher predictive power in the assessment of these parameters see green color in table 11 these findings indicate that the ndsis that track leaf photosynthetic pigment concentrations photosynthetic efficiency and internal leaf structure can be very good estimators of growth water relations and ion contents under moderate and high salinity levels the utility of ndsis that incorporate wavelengths from vis red edge and nir regions to improve the accuracy in estimating especially growth ion contents and ratios may be related to the fact that decreases in chlorophyll contents necrosis and senescence of leaves as well as changes in tissue structure are a logical consideration and real phenomenon of osmotic and ionic stresses of salinity zhang et al 2014 el hendawy et al 2017a in this sense clevers et al 2002 reported that the nir red edge indices are related to tissue pigment contents as well as the crop nutrition status zhang et al 2011 also reported that the indices based on the nir region and chlorophyll absorption bands vis region gave good indicators for soil salinity effects this was explained by the close association of the indices with chlorophyll retention photosynthetic capacity and internal leaf structure which are a logical consideration for the negative effects of high salinity soils on plant growth miller et al 1991 reported that the vis region is fundamentally linked to the photosynthetic pigment content while the red edge and nir regions are associated with leaf structural changes and water statutes of plants kriston vizi et al 2008 reported that the reflectance in the green and the red regions displayed moderate correlations with leaf water potential under water stress conditions hackl et al 2013 also reported that the vis nir based indices have high stability for assessment of the water statues of wheat plants under salinity conditions 5 conclusions and outlook this study provides further support for the use of shoot dry weight water relations and ion contents parameters as screening criteria for evaluating the salt tolerance of wheat genotypes under simulate close to saline field growth conditions spectral signatures of the canopy in the 350 2500 nm range enable to spectrally assess the growth water relations and ion contents of wheat cultivars under the simulated saline field conditions in an expeditious non destructive manner sequential multivariate analysis resulted in the identification of sensitive spectral waveband regions and effective wavelengths related to sdw water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity stress these multivariate analyses were successful in reducing the spectral datasets to a manageable size and allowed to derive new and simple normalized spectral reflectance indices ndsis for tracking growth water relations and ion contents of wheat under salinity conditions six wavelengths in the vis five in the red edge regions elven in the nir region five in the swir 1 region and nine wavelengths in the swir 2 region were extracted through the smlr as effective bands for assessing the tested parameters with the wavelengths in the vis and the red edge regions were more appropriate than those in the nir and the swir regions the ndsis that incorporate wavelengths from the vis the red edge and the nir regions better explain the variability in growth leaf water relations and ion contents than those incorporating wavelengths from the swir this study the type of which has rarely been conducted indicates that the hyperspectral reflectance sensing technique is a rapid non destructive and cost efficient alternative tool for the assessment of salt tolerance of wheat genotypes based on the status of water relations and ion contents of leaves under a realistic simulation of saline field conditions salinity results in increased accumulations of potentially toxic ions which impair the growth of plants as well as cause disturbances in plant water relations as consequence of lowered soil water potentials which leading to decreases in plant water relationships the effect of salinity is reflected in decreased biomass as well as the build up of ions in plants which again lead to changes in spectral reflectance resulting from different pigment or biomass properties hence it also possible to indirectly assess changes in plants ionic concentrations and water relations as long as they are causally contributing to such changes although the findings of this study cannot be generally extrapolated to any combination of salinity type and level as well as crop and genotype specific differences in salt tolerance they offer a highly interesting potential for optimizing cultivar selection for given site conditions and genotype panels by allowing to minimize the laborious costly and time consuming destructive calibration for ions and water relations hence a reduced data set could be destructively analyzed with the potential to predict parameters of growth ionic and water relations for the remaining larger part of an increased set of cultivars this will allow for substantial savings in cost and time which are a key to the adoption of high throughput phenotyping in the selection process in breeding further studies augmenting the possible impacts of these findings will be highly rewarding acknowledgments the authors extend their appreciation to the deanship of scientific research at king saud university for funding this

11271,a field hydrology survey was conducted to determine spatial variations in regional water yield and use intensity and clarify the main causes of the variation in upstream hutuo river basin uhtb the study showed that 1 the spatial distribution of flow salt and stable isotopes reflected variations in regional water yield and use intensity total dissolved solids tds in river water were lower in qingshui tributary and the headwater region of hutuo river htr the distributions of Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o of river water were nearly parallel to the local meteoric water line lmwl except for the middle reach intensive agricultural activities were responsible for the deviation of spatially stable isotopes from lmwl the highest tds and 0 85 evaporation fraction in the middle reach 2 the spatial flow indicated that almost all the river water was used in agriculture especially in the middle reach of uhtb before inflow from qingshui tributary based on the balance in monitored flow rate and isotopes about 67 9 of the water flow 11 66 m3 s was from upstream shanxi province and discharged into the downstream of hebei province 91 9 of which was from qingshui tributary 3 irrigation function of upstream reservoirs was not fully reflected due to less storage of water along with low recharge and discharge events given the declining water yield and high water requirement there was the need to overhaul agricultural water use strategies to ensure cross border water availability the research could lay the basis for designing cross border agricultural water use strategies in uhtb and other basins with similar hydro climatic conditions keywords hydrochemistry runoff agricultural water use hutuo river basin china 1 introduction river runoff is a vital hydrological process especially in headwater catchments the volume of runoff influences the degree of water availability vegetation distribution and land cover change in the runoff producing area runoff is also directly related with lateral flow surface and subsurface from mountains to downstream regions there is an increasing trend of runoff decline in terrestrial ecosystems around the world with increasing scarcity of water hydrologists and policy makers have increasingly focused on the factors that influence runoff decline in river catchments generally climate variability and human activities have emerged as the two important factors influencing runoff decline buendia et al 2016 gao et al 2016 while the effect of the variation in climate is mainly in form of decreasing precipitation human activities through land use cover change reservoir operation and direct surface water extraction affect spatio temporal distribution of streamflow wang and hejazi 2011 xu et al 2014 the above conditions are generally studied through analysis of long term data which are turn strongly dependent on the time period hutuo river basin hrb is a typical headwater basin in north china plain ncp that is the main source of groundwater for the entire central region of the plain hutuo river htr flow has been declining in the last half century and runoff during non flood season since the early 2000s has decreased to one third of that in the 1950s cheng et al 2014 the decline in inflow from upstream catchment during non flood season is the main cause of significant environmental deterioration in downstream regions human activity has the highest impact on runoff decline and agricultural water use is the dominant factor tian et al 2009 yang and tian 2009 furthermore there are no disturbances in evapotranspiration and precipitation in hrb headwater region also evapotranspiration in the region is strongly influenced by precipitation which has been decreasing in the past half century zhang et al 2012 long term monitoring points of runoff are generally scarce in mountain catchments there are only three such national monitoring points in the 15 915 km2 upstream of hrb which does not provide sufficient data on river water quality and quantity in this region this is not enough for hydrological and meteorological analysis in space but also for analysis of runoff processes and regional water use in complex mountain catchments environmental isotopes and chemical studies of the hydrogeology along with dense field survey is an excellent way of depicting spatial correlations of hydrological processes water chemistry and water use the evaluation of the main factors of specific hydrological processes has been the center of hydrological research as environmental isotopes are not significantly affected by transpiration stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen can be used to differentiate between evaporation which fractionates isotopes and non fractionating process of transpiration cartwright et al 2012 the combined assessment of oxygen hydrogen and major ion chemistry can be used to determine the primary processes by which evaporation and transpiration control solute concentration moya et al 2016 this can in turn be used to evaluate the relative importance of evaporation and transpiration in the build up of salinity sun et al 2016 in basins with dominant native vegetation and efficient use of available precipitation cartwright et al 2012 noted that 18o is not correlated with groundwater tds and that transpiration is a more important process in solute concentration in sambhar lake in rajasthan india yadav 1997 observed that 18o in the lake water varied linearly with salt content which phenomenon was dominantly driven by evaporation stable isotope fractionation during evaporation from open water bodies is described by rayleigh evaporation model as isotope ratio increases with increasing evaporation rate evaporation of open water bodies can be estimated using isotope count dreybrodt and deininger 2014 wang et al 2014b by estimating the remaining fraction and salt content of water bodies it is possible to isolate the contributions of evapo driven concentration and mineral dissolution and or transpiration to total salinity of a given water sample huang and pang 2012 wang and guo 2015 isotope mass balance is widely used to evaluate water balance and transformation in hydrological processes especially in estimating inflow outflow and interaction of surface water and groundwater zhang et al 2013 estimated inflow outflow and evaporation of bosten lake in china gibson et al 2017 evaluated the trends in regional evaporation loss and water yield based on stable isotope mass balance in lakes of precambrian shield drainages in ontario canada fan et al 2016 quantified the ratio of ice snowmelt rain and groundwater flow into tarim river the largest inland river in china yang et al 2012 estimated groundwater composition at 60 70 river water after the wet season period shaw et al 2017 estimated groundwater inflow and outflow for georgetown lake a lake with structurally complex geology in montana usa against the declining runoff and degrading environment in hutuo river basin htb there is the need for spatial hydrology data and improved hydrological characterization of surface water systems in htb the use of environmental isotopes and hydro chemical methods can deepen our understanding of spatial water consumption in various land use conditions this can in turn lead to more accurate determination of the root cause of runoff decline and to develop guidelines for scientific water use and management also the isotope and salinity of stream water sampled before the rainy season that is not mixed with the present day rainwater characterized by relative low ion and isotope concentration can reasonably reflect true spatial water use and yield of native vegetation and crops in this study several surface water systems including rivers and reservoirs were sampled before the rainy season and river flow rates estimated along mainstream and tributaries of htr in upstream hutuo river basin uhtb the objective of the study was to assess spatial variation in water use and yield depict spatial correlation of hydrological processes and agricultural activities and to quantify inflow from upstream shanxi province to the downstream region of hebei province using environmental isotope and hydro chemical analysis the results of the research can be used in design overhaul of cross border agricultural water use strategies for sustainable development of river basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area htr originates in fansi county in shanxi province and flows across hebei province before joining haihe river in north china uhtb is approximately 15 915 km2 in area and lies between longitudes 112 25 114 10 e and latitudes 38 00 39 46 n it stretches over an elevation range of 127 3059 m above mean sea level and has the most vegetation cover in the upstream region around gangnan reservoir with over 70 of its area located in shanxi province there are four long tributaries in uhtb which are qingshui river and e river in the north of htr and then muma river and wu river in the south of htr fig 1 both qingshui and e rivers originate in wutai mountains and are recharged by snowmelt and rainfall there is rich fissure water in the metamorphic clastic and limestone rocks in the mountain and hilly areas song et al 2013 the study area has a temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate with cold dry winter and hot rainy summer about 70 80 of the annual precipitation of 400 700 mm occurs during the rainy summer from july through september the main land use types include woodland shrub e g vitex negundo and zizyphus jujuba herbs e g themed japonica and bothriochloa ischaemum and farmland e g wheat and maize the woodland is mainly deciduous broad leaved e g quercus genus and coniferous e g pinus tabulaeformis platycladus orientalis forests tian et al 2009 based on 2014 statistical data from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn the area sown with grain crops mainly maize and millet account for some 90 of total cultivated area in the seven upstream counties in shanxi province then the maize millet ratio is 65 with winter wheat and summer maize as the main grain crops for the continuous crop rotation system in the downstream county of pingshan in hebei province maize in shanxi province is generally planted from late april to early may before the start of rainy season and harvested before or after the 1st of october millet is generally planted in may and harvested in october summer maize in hebei province is generally planted at the end of june and harvested before or after the 1st of october followed by winter wheat in the next season which is harvested at the end of june in the year after irrigation is necessary before sowing or germination especially for maize due to the little rainfall at sowing any subsequent irrigation during the growing season is dependent on the mode of the rainfall winter wheat grows across the whole dry season and irrigation is done to guarantee high yield the amount is 60 90 mm per irrigation event htr runoff is the main source of water and it is delivered through irrigation ditches rubber dam sand gate and intake gate ma et al 2018 groundwater withdrawal is another water source especially when surface water is scare in the winter wheat growth season organic or chemical n and p fertilizer is normally broadcasted followed by plowing by turning over the soil prior to sowing additional fertilizer is broadcasted on the soil surface before irrigation or the start of the rains and at least one round of fertilization for maize and wheat during the growing season 2 2 field survey and sampling a field survey was conducted along the rivers and riparian areas in upstream htb in june 2016 before the rains it was mostly at jointing stage of maize in the upstream and middle reaches and at seedling stage in the downstream of uhtb and just after one or two irrigation events for maize runoff samples were collected from the mainstream and tributaries using 150 ml wide mouth plastic bottles and each sample duplicated once the bottles were completely filled slowly to minimize alteration of isotopic composition of the water samples a total of 38 water samples were collected from htr and its tributaries and 6 from reservoirs fig 1 furthermore 8 dry tributaries were discussed under flow rate analysis although each sample site was visited only once the spatial distribution of the sample sites was quite representative in terms of water quality and quantity of the entire uhtb all the water samples were passed through 0 22 Œºm filter before analysis stable isotopes Œ¥d Œ¥ 18o are reported in standard Œ¥ notion relative to nist iaea vsmow reference document the values are measured using picarro l2120 i liquid water isotope analyzer which has an accuracy of Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d of less than 0 1 and 0 5 respectively total dissolved solids tds were measured by traditional oven dried method flow rate was roughly calculated by multiplying flow velocity with discharge cross section where flow velocity was determined by the float method the area of discharge cross section was calculated by multiplying water depth and river width and the depth and width visually estimated when measurement with ruler was impossible 2 3 rayleigh evaporation model for stable isotopes the theory of rayleigh distillation on Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o isotopic components was used to calculate the remaining fraction of open and evaporated water body in general rayleigh distillation equation states that isotope ratio r in a diminishing reservoir of reactants is a function of its initial isotopic ratio r0 the remaining fraction of that reservoir f and the fractionation factor Œ± v w for the following reaction clark and fritz 1997 wang et al 2014b 1 r r 0 f Œ± v w 1 where Œ± v w is generally calculated from an enrichment factor Œµ of the relationship of Œµ Œ± v w 1 which incorporates both equilibrium Œµ v w and kinetic enrichment Œ¥ Œµ v b l and Œµ Œµ v w Œ¥ Œµ v b l factors the equilibrium enrichment factor Œµ v w is calculated using the relationship Œµ Œ± 1 and the equilibrium isotope fractionation factor Œ± w v which is strongly dependent on the temperature t in kelvin degree of the reaction the following equations are used to calculate the equilibrium fractionation factors of 18o and 2h between water and vapor majoube 1971 2 10 3 l n Œ± o 118 w v 1 137 10 6 t 2 0 4156 10 3 t 2 0667 3 10 3 l n Œ± h 12 w v 24 844 10 6 t 2 76 248 10 3 t 52 612 the following equations are used to calculate the kinetic

factors of 18o and 2h between vapor and boundary layer in the evaporation interface after converting the isotope ratios to Œ¥ values eq 1 is then replaced by eq 6 the f for reservoir and river water is calculated as wang et al 2014b 6 Œ¥ exp ln f Œµ 1000 Œ¥ 0 1000 1000 2 4 isotope mass balance the isotope mass balance imb in combination with water balance was used to estimate ungauged groundwater inflow from shanxi province and pingshan county to htr the total water resources and percent flow from upstream shanxi province into downstream hebei province was estimated and the boundary section shown in fig 3 the water balance and imb are written respectively as 7 f d s f u s f u g f l s f l g 8 f d s Œ¥ d s f u s Œ¥ u s f u g Œ¥ u g f l s Œ¥ l s f l g Œ¥ l g where f ds is gauged mainstream flow rate in the downstream section of pingshan county f us is gauged flow rate of mainstream inflow in upstream yuxian county shanxi province f ug is ungauged flow rate of groundwater inflow from upstream yuxian county f ls is gauged flow rate of local tributary inflow in pingshan region and f lg is ungauged flowrate of local tributary inflow as groundwater all in m3 s Œ¥ ds Œ¥ us Œ¥ ug Œ¥ ls and Œ¥ lg are the isotope compositions of downstream mainstream upstream mainstream upstream groundwater inflow local tributary inflow and local groundwater inflow respectively given that Œ¥ us Œ¥ ug and Œ¥ ls Œ¥ lg only f ug and f lg remain unknown which are then estimated from gauged flow rates and isotope values the isotope hypothesis is rational because the difference in Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o values between river and groundwater systems is not obvious in upstream htb zhang et al 2008 also the transitions of groundwater and surface water are common hydrological processes in mountain regions the unit of Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o is and the estimated f ug and f lg are the average of two values respectively calculated from the known values of Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o balance 2 5 statistical data collection the data on agriculture for the eight counties in the study area were acquired from national meteorological information center http data cma cn including land area area under crop vegetable and fruit and yield 3 results 3 1 spatial flow rate the flow rates of htr and its tributaries are illustrated in fig 2 the basin wide flow rate showed clear spatial differences relatively high in the upper middle and lower reaches of the mainstream and qingshui and e tributaries figs 2 and 3 flow rate in the mainstream headwater region in fansi county was lowest with an average of 0 24 m3 s it was highest 6 46 m3 s in yuanping county in the middle reach which gradually declined along flow direction up to the point of inflow from qingshui tributary the highest mainstream runoff 22 5 m3 s occurred at the cross section near the entrance to gangnan reservoir followed by 17 0 m3 s and 12 0 m3 s at the other two cross sections along the flow direction close to gangnan reservoir compared with the mainstream tributary flow rates were lower there were three higher tributary runoffs before discharge into htr two of which were at the end of qingshui tributary and e tributary with respective flow rates of 3 08 m3 s and 2 36 m3 s the highest tributary runoff with 3 86 m3 s flow rate was at the upstream of qingshui tributary with the exception of qingshui and e tributaries almost all the tributaries in the catchment were drying up with flow generally less than 0 13 m3 s 3 2 spatial salt to clearly depict the spatial variation the salt contents of tributary waters were classified into 5 grades of equal intervals and the same intervals adopted in the classification of salt contents of the mainstream and reservoir waters salt concentrations in htr mainstream the tributaries and the reservoirs are illustrated in fig 4 when combined together the spatial distribution of the basin wide tds was relatively high in the middle reach and low in the upper and lower reaches of uhtb fig 4 salt content in the middle reach of mainstream htr was high average of 0 57 g l and was highest 0 72 g l at the meeting point of yuanping and xinzhou counties inversely salt content was low in the headwater and downstream reaches of htr with respective averages of 0 35 g l and 0 39 g l with the exception of the 0 81 g l salt concentration in a small tributary with only 0 01 m3 s flow in dingxiang county the salt content of almost all the tributaries was less than 0 4 g l there was low 0 27 g l salt content in qingshui tributary salt content of reservoirs in the headwater region in fansi county was higher than that in reservoirs in the middle and downstream regions the range of salt content was 0 17 0 40 g l in reservoirs in the headwater region and only 0 12 g l in gangnan reservoir in the downstream region 3 3 spatially stable isotopes while the global meteoric water line gmwl is related as Œ¥d 8Œ¥ 18o 10 the local meteoric water line lmwl of isotopic data in htb is reported as Œ¥d 6 42Œ¥ 18o 4 66 jia et al 2015 fig 5 illustrates gmwl lmwl Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d of rivers and reservoirs in the study area in the left plot in fig 5 the apparent deviation of lmwl from gmwl was due to evaporation during precipitation the Œ¥ 18o range of 7 08 to 0 59 and Œ¥d range of 58 05 to 20 56 for reservoirs were much higher than in rivers and with high deviations from lmwl the ranges of Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d for tributary runoff were wider than for the mainstream with Œ¥ 18o range of 11 0 to 6 01 for tributaries and 9 84 to 7 59 for mainstream the corresponding ranges of Œ¥d were 76 81 to 46 35 for tributaries and 2 77 to 57 38 for mainstream the average Œ¥ 18o for tributary runoff 9 67 was less than that for the mainstream 8 50 also the average Œ¥d for tributary runoff 68 41 was less than that for the mainstream 62 20 the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d for reservoirs were most enriched with average values of 4 21 and 41 3 respectively two water samples from two reservoirs in upstream of uhtb had extremely enriched isotopic compositions 0 59 and 1 11 for Œ¥ 18o and then 20 56 and 24 69 for Œ¥d the middle plot fig 5 depicts stable isotopes along the river flow from upstream to downstream in uhtb the sections of the upstream middle stream and downstream of uhtb are depicted in fig 3 the isotope value for water rich qingshui tributary was also separately presented it was obvious that Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d gradually increased along flow direction of htr with some overlapping areas in the middle reach compared with others the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d trend line for the middle reach of uhtb deviated more from lmwl the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d concentration was much lower for water rich qingshui tributary and the flow of the tributary into htr decreased isotope concentration of mainstream runoff the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d for qingshui tributary were within lmwl and some isotope measures even lied outside the water line the low value was due to elevation wutai mountain is located at the roof of north china with the highest elevation of 3058 m thus the cyclic local generation of moisture is characterized by specific isotope composition of precipitation in the region compared with isotope values of gangnan reservoir in downstream uhtb Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d of reservoirs in upstream uhtb were much higher with higher deviation from lmwl right plot in fig 5 3 4 stable isotope correlation with tds fig 6 shows the correlations of Œ¥d and tds of the various water bodies Œ¥d and tds and then f and tds along the flow direction from the left plot Œ¥d was positive for rivers with increasing tds and smaller gradient for the mainstream then there was no relationship between the stable isotopes and tds for reservoir water in the region the middle and right plots in fig 6 suggest the existence of a relationship among Œ¥d f and tds for rivers along the flow direction the respective relationships in water rich qingshui tributary were also separately illustrated the sections of the upstream middle stream and downstream uhtb are shown in fig 3 the Œ¥d and tds for river water in the middle reach were relatively high and with Œ¥d and tds trend line nearly horizontal then most of the values for the other reaches were relatively low and with positive correlation between Œ¥d and tds for all of the other reaches as a whole concurrently f for river water in the middle reach was low with an average value of 0 85 and f and tds trend line also nearly horizontal in contrast most of the f values for the other reaches were 0 85 and with negative correlation between f and tds for all of the other reaches as a whole the Œ¥d and tds for river water were much lower in water rich qingshui tributary while f for the tributary was much higher with some values close to 1 0 the flow of this tributary into htr decreased the Œ¥d and tds and increased f for mainstream runoff middle and right plots of fig 6 4 discussions 4 1 spatial difference in evaporation while evaporative processes lead to the enrichments of stable isotopes and dissolved ions transpiration process do not significantly affect environmental isotopes cartwright et al 2012 moya et al 2016 the high Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d values for reservoir water in upstream uhtb suggested that evaporation was the dominant process of static water loss left plot in fig 5 then the non relationship between Œ¥d and tds indicated that the contribution of evaporation to tds concentration was limited when reservoir salt content was low left plot in fig 6 from combined f and tds for reservoirs water huang and pang 2012 the estimated contributions of evaporation driven concentration and mineral dissolution and or transpiration to total salinity of reservoirs were 17 8 and 48 0 respectively there was a wider range of Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d for tributary runoff than for mainstream runoff some tributary runoff values of Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d were richer than mainstream runoff which indicated that tributaries with low flows endured much stronger evaporation than tributaries with high flows left plot in fig 5 the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d gradients for various reaches except the middle reach of river water were nearly parallel to lmwl this suggested evaporation only slightly enriched river water isotope content middle plot of fig 5 and that rivers were continuously recharged by groundwater river recharge by groundwater was a common hydrological process in the study area especially in dry seasons zhang 1979 zhang et al 2008 the estimated contributions of evaporation driven concentration and mineral dissolution and or transpiration to total salinity of river were 2 0 and 73 8 respectively in the reaches except the middle reaches compared with other trend lines the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d trend line for rivers in middle reach of uhtb deviated more from lmwl middle plot of fig 5 indicating significant Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d isotope fractionation and strong surface water evaporation in the reach the low f for river water in the middle reach also indicated high evaporation right plot in fig 6 the estimated contributions of evaporation driven concentration and dissolution and or transpiration to total salinity were 2 6 and 83 6 respectively for the middle reach this indicated that higher evapotranspiration i e high agricultural water use intensity in the reach than in other reaches the high intensity exploitation and pumping of groundwater mainly for agriculture caused decline in groundwater and river runoff in the middle reach of uhtb zhao et al 2015b which enhanced water surface evaporation and isotope concentration 4 2 spatial differences in agricultural activities htr flow rates fails to reflect spatial differences in agricultural activities due to the spatial variability of water yield and precipitation assuming that the spatial variation of soil and rock materials was negligible the spatial variation of tds was strongly driven by the degree of agricultural activities in upstream uhtb in the headwater region in fansi county there was low agricultural efficiency with only 25 6 of the farmland area irrigated yield output of 1 9 t ha zhao et al 2015a grain crops yield of 2 3 t ha 15 sown area of grain crops as percent of land area table 1 responding to the low agricultural efficiency i e weak soil mineral dissolution and or transpiration led to low flow and tds mean of 0 29 g l in the mainstream in qingshui tributary sub basin where percent irrigated area was only 24 6 and farmland productivity was 3 3 t ha which was moderate agricultural efficiency the flow rate was relatively high the corresponding tds average of 0 31 g l was low and was similar to that of river water in the headwater region in fansi county figs 2 4 the different flow rates in the two regions were mainly driven by precipitation which was low 350 mm yr in fansi county and high 530 mm yr in wutai county the higher farmland productivity in qingshui tributary sub basin was attributed to the rich precipitation and rich surface water resources while the small irrigated area was due to the high and uneven terrain in the middle reach of the mainstream with high agriculture efficiency the percent irrigated area and cultivated land yield were 55 9 and 5 9 t ha respectively zhao et al 2015a the sown area of grain crops as percent of land area and yield per unit area of grain crops were around 25 and 6 6 t ha respectively table 1 mainstream flow rate gradually declined from moderate to low along the flow direction and had the highest tds of average of 0 54 g l figs 2 4 under moderate precipitation 430 mm yr thus while the high agricultural efficiency was mainly driven by irrigation the high flow rates in some sections of middle reach were driven by the convergence of groundwater and the relatively large sink area in the mountain region the estimated contribution of dissolution and or transpiration to total salinity was 83 6 for the middle reach and was higher than 73 8 for other reaches this indicated that the high tds was driven by high evapotranspiration agricultural activities and efficiency in the middle reach zhang et al 1995 zhang and shan 2008 and zhang et al 2011 described the process by which agriculture effects surface groundwater chemistry long term farming can accelerate weathering and erosion of surficial rocks and soil since tillage and cultivation destroy natural vegetation and cause weathering to penetrate greater depths irrigation also can increase mineralization of groundwater through leaching of soils salts and then unconfined groundwater discharging high salts into rivers and streams can cause high riverine tds content the isotopes values of water samples are nearly parallel to lmwl and the overall small deviation from the line middle plot in fig 5 suggested that transpiration was likely the main driver of the increased solute concentrations moya et al 2016 evapotranspiration as a major control on the enrichment of ions in groundwater was also identified by herczeg et al 1991 and moya et al 2015 thus weathering and erosion agricultural activities were the possible main processes affecting water chemistry in htr from the tributaries and mainstream comparison of tributary and mainstream tds showed that there was higher salt content 0 26 0 72 g l in the mainstream in contrast salt content of almost all the tributaries was less than 0 4 g l with salt content even lower than 0 27 g l in the headwater region of qingshui tributary the high tds in the mainstream was due to the long term water rock interaction which increased ion content of water in the main channel wang et al 2016 also due to the increasing effect of agriculture on water flow into the mainstream as increasing runoff path takes more ions from the surrounding farmlands zhang et al 1995 2011 li et al 2016 4 3 cross border water amount the isotope mass balance together with the water balance method is widely used to estimate the inflow outflow and interaction of surface water and groundwater systems zhang et al 2013 fan et al 2016 shaw et al 2017 yang et al 2012 2017 with water scarcity the quantification of cross border river flow from upstream to downstream regions is critical for integrated water resources management for the entire uhtb the wide range of tributary Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d left plot of fig 5 indicated that water flow from the tributary to the mainstream was limited across the entire basin this was the general picture of the current mode of renewal of water resources the lack of flow into the mainstream was apparently read as high efficiency of surface water use in the nested smaller sub basins or an indication of water shortage in uhtb qingshui sub region was characterized by rich water resource renewal due to high precipitation and low evapotranspiration driven by the rainfed nature of cultivation and high elevation of the region the water chemistry of mainstream htr was strongly influenced by inflow from qingshui tributary figs 5 and 6 as such the tributary was the main resource of water for downstream uhbt also while flow rate of the tributaries in the downstream region of uhbt were low that from mainstream htr reached 20 m3 s before discharging downstream into gangnan reservoir in pingshan county figs 2 and 3 the apparent increasing flow rates of mainstream indicated that the sub surface runoff groundwater was the main way of flowing into htr before rainy season groundwater as base flow discharging surface water were common situations guzm√°n et al 2016 kebede et al 2016 based on the isotope and water balance methods the estimated f ug for a section of the river downstream pingshan county in hebei province close to the upstream section number 8 in fig 3 with runoff of 17 17 m3 s had cross border groundwater inflow of 7 73 m3 s from upstream shanxi province the estimated f lg representing local groundwater inflow from the mountain on the two sides of the htr section in hebei province was 5 12 m3 s together with surface runoff upstream inflow to mainstream htr was 3 93 m3 s and local tributaries inflow to htr was 0 38 m3 s the calculated water flow rate from shanxi province to hebei province was 11 66 m3 s which accounted for 67 9 of runoff flow in the selected river section in pingshan county the flow rate from surface and groundwater systems in the region was 5 51 m3 s accounting for 32 1 of flow in the region also based on the three flow rates from qingshui tributary and mainstream before and after tributary inflow 91 9 of htr water was from qingshui tributary 4 4 irrigation function of reservoirs reservoirs can be used to regulate and store rainwater which is critical for agricultural irrigation for reservoirs in the upstream reach such function was limited because of low water storage that was hardly enough for discharge the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d of reservoir water departed more from the lmwl but was much higher than most of the stable isotopes in the tributaries and mainstream left plot in fig 5 together with the actual reservoir water and the monitored mainstream flow rate water discharged from the reservoirs to rivers for agricultural irrigation was limited in addition reservoir water isotopes in upstream of uhtb were much higher with higher deviation from lmwl than water isotopes in downstream gangnan reservoir right plot in fig 5 this suggested that upstream reservoir water endured stronger evaporation and less groundwater recharge the stable isotope of static waters generally varied linearly with salt content due to the dominant evaporation yadav 1997 in contrast the tds content average of 0 24 g l of reservoir water in uhtb was low compared to the most enriched isotope values figs 5 and 6 and was even lower than that of river water one main reason for the low reservoir water tds was that recharge from upstream water with higher salt content after flow across farmlands was limited it then implied that water flow across farmlands and discharge into reservoirs was limited due to low precipitation and high water use intensity in the study area 4 5 implications for agricultural water use htr is a cross border river and the main source of groundwater in ncp in uhtb water consumption as percent natural annual runoff was 56 6 in 2000 2012 exceeding the 40 internationally recognized warning line note then that the water consumption ratio was 7 5 24 0 before 1980 wang et al 2014a agriculture is the highest water user for htr irrigation distrit in the middle reaches of uhtb average precipitation was 390 8 mm and deliverd water volume from htr was 32 6 106 m3 in 2001 2011 ma et al 2018 then irrigation water delivered from htr was around 3 4 times that of locally produced runoff for runoff coefficient of 4 8 feng and zhao 2009 this suggested that the water intensive agriculture used up all the runoff that could have flown to downstream region clarifying the spatial water use and yield intensity is key for achieving a scientifically driven water allocation of cross border rivers and for sustainable regional development with spatially correlated hydrological processes and agricultural activities cross border water was the basis for deep understanding of the above issues in the absence of dense spatial information inclunding information on farmland area irrigation water amount and delivered water from river field hydrological survey along with the environmental isotope and hydro chemical analysis was the best way to get to that objective the results of this study suggested that even if 67 9 of runoff flow in the selected river section in hebei province was from upstream shanxi province that was still far from enough considering the wide downstream plain of htb and the important role it plays as the main source of groundwater in ncp thus agricultural water saving is urgent in the high production area especially in the middle reach of uhtb and the most efficient way to do this is to directly reduce water demand irrigation water transfer loss was over 60 thus the soil rock channels needed to be replaced by pipelines also high water intensive crops should be replaced by low water use crops by adjusting planting structure li and ma 2017 the small runoff recharge in reservoirs in the upstream region of uhtb indicated that the high farmland area needed to be reduced which will in turn reduce interception water in farmlands adjusting the planting structure such as stopping or reducing wheat planting area because of its high water requirement and dry season cultivation is also urgent in the downstream region of uhtb 5 conclusions as a major water resource area in ncp investigating hillslope hydrological processes of uhtb is critical for understanding the spatial variations in water delivery and water use this is also important for developing sustainable regional water management strategies against the declining runoff and heightening vulnerability of the ecosystem the water chemistry analysis in this study showed variations in spatial evaporation mineral dissolution and or transpiration the distributions of Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o of river water were near parallel to lmwl except for the middle reach suggesting that isotopic enrichment due to evaporation was not prevalent in the river systems and that there was surface water recharge by groundwater and groundwater recharge by precipitation intensive agricultural activities caused the specific distribution of stable isotopes of deviating lmwl highest tds and lowest f only 0 85 in the middle reach the estimated contribution of dissolution and or transpiration to the total water salinity was 83 6 in the middle reach higher than the 73 8 in the other reaches the irrigation function of upstream reservoirs was not fully reflected there was limited recharge flow from the surrounding farmlands and discharge from reservoir to river even in the dry season qingshui tributary was the main water resource for the downstream region of uhtb water yield in uhtb was poor due to low precipitation in the upstream reaches and intensive agricultural activity only e tributary and qingshui tributary originated respectively from the northern and southern slopes of wutai mountain had rich water before the rains thus almost all the river water was used in the intensive agriculture especially in the middle reach of uhtb before inflow from qingshui tributary out of the monitored 17 17 m3 s runoff in pingshan county hebei province 67 9 11 66 m3 s was from shanxi province and 91 9 from qingshui tributary this suggested that 32 1 5 51 m3 s of the flow was from surface water and groundwater in local region the 67 9 runoff flow from upstream shanxi province is far from enough considering the wide downstream plain of htb and the important role it plays as the main source of groundwater in ncp to increase runoff in htr agricultural water saving is urgent in the middle reach reducing planted crop area is needed to reduce intercepted water in farmlands in the upstream region of uhtb adjusting the planting structure such as stopping or reducing wheat planting is also urgent in the

11271,a field hydrology survey was conducted to determine spatial variations in regional water yield and use intensity and clarify the main causes of the variation in upstream hutuo river basin uhtb the study showed that 1 the spatial distribution of flow salt and stable isotopes reflected variations in regional water yield and use intensity total dissolved solids tds in river water were lower in qingshui tributary and the headwater region of hutuo river htr the distributions of Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o of river water were nearly parallel to the local meteoric water line lmwl except for the middle reach intensive agricultural activities were responsible for the deviation of spatially stable isotopes from lmwl the highest tds and 0 85 evaporation fraction in the middle reach 2 the spatial flow indicated that almost all the river water was used in agriculture especially in the middle reach of uhtb before inflow from qingshui tributary based on the balance in monitored flow rate and isotopes about 67 9 of the water flow 11 66 m3 s was from upstream shanxi province and discharged into the downstream of hebei province 91 9 of which was from qingshui tributary 3 irrigation function of upstream reservoirs was not fully reflected due to less storage of water along with low recharge and discharge events given the declining water yield and high water requirement there was the need to overhaul agricultural water use strategies to ensure cross border water availability the research could lay the basis for designing cross border agricultural water use strategies in uhtb and other basins with similar hydro climatic conditions keywords hydrochemistry runoff agricultural water use hutuo river basin china 1 introduction river runoff is a vital hydrological process especially in headwater catchments the volume of runoff influences the degree of water availability vegetation distribution and land cover change in the runoff producing area runoff is also directly related with lateral flow surface and subsurface from mountains to downstream regions there is an increasing trend of runoff decline in terrestrial ecosystems around the world with increasing scarcity of water hydrologists and policy makers have increasingly focused on the factors that influence runoff decline in river catchments generally climate variability and human activities have emerged as the two important factors influencing runoff decline buendia et al 2016 gao et al 2016 while the effect of the variation in climate is mainly in form of decreasing precipitation human activities through land use cover change reservoir operation and direct surface water extraction affect spatio temporal distribution of streamflow wang and hejazi 2011 xu et al 2014 the above conditions are generally studied through analysis of long term data which are turn strongly dependent on the time period hutuo river basin hrb is a typical headwater basin in north china plain ncp that is the main source of groundwater for the entire central region of the plain hutuo river htr flow has been declining in the last half century and runoff during non flood season since the early 2000s has decreased to one third of that in the 1950s cheng et al 2014 the decline in inflow from upstream catchment during non flood season is the main cause of significant environmental deterioration in downstream regions human activity has the highest impact on runoff decline and agricultural water use is the dominant factor tian et al 2009 yang and tian 2009 furthermore there are no disturbances in evapotranspiration and precipitation in hrb headwater region also evapotranspiration in the region is strongly influenced by precipitation which has been decreasing in the past half century zhang et al 2012 long term monitoring points of runoff are generally scarce in mountain catchments there are only three such national monitoring points in the 15 915 km2 upstream of hrb which does not provide sufficient data on river water quality and quantity in this region this is not enough for hydrological and meteorological analysis in space but also for analysis of runoff processes and regional water use in complex mountain catchments environmental isotopes and chemical studies of the hydrogeology along with dense field survey is an excellent way of depicting spatial correlations of hydrological processes water chemistry and water use the evaluation of the main factors of specific hydrological processes has been the center of hydrological research as environmental isotopes are not significantly affected by transpiration stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen can be used to differentiate between evaporation which fractionates isotopes and non fractionating process of transpiration cartwright et al 2012 the combined assessment of oxygen hydrogen and major ion chemistry can be used to determine the primary processes by which evaporation and transpiration control solute concentration moya et al 2016 this can in turn be used to evaluate the relative importance of evaporation and transpiration in the build up of salinity sun et al 2016 in basins with dominant native vegetation and efficient use of available precipitation cartwright et al 2012 noted that 18o is not correlated with groundwater tds and that transpiration is a more important process in solute concentration in sambhar lake in rajasthan india yadav 1997 observed that 18o in the lake water varied linearly with salt content which phenomenon was dominantly driven by evaporation stable isotope fractionation during evaporation from open water bodies is described by rayleigh evaporation model as isotope ratio increases with increasing evaporation rate evaporation of open water bodies can be estimated using isotope count dreybrodt and deininger 2014 wang et al 2014b by estimating the remaining fraction and salt content of water bodies it is possible to isolate the contributions of evapo driven concentration and mineral dissolution and or transpiration to total salinity of a given water sample huang and pang 2012 wang and guo 2015 isotope mass balance is widely used to evaluate water balance and transformation in hydrological processes especially in estimating inflow outflow and interaction of surface water and groundwater zhang et al 2013 estimated inflow outflow and evaporation of bosten lake in china gibson et al 2017 evaluated the trends in regional evaporation loss and water yield based on stable isotope mass balance in lakes of precambrian shield drainages in ontario canada fan et al 2016 quantified the ratio of ice snowmelt rain and groundwater flow into tarim river the largest inland river in china yang et al 2012 estimated groundwater composition at 60 70 river water after the wet season period shaw et al 2017 estimated groundwater inflow and outflow for georgetown lake a lake with structurally complex geology in montana usa against the declining runoff and degrading environment in hutuo river basin htb there is the need for spatial hydrology data and improved hydrological characterization of surface water systems in htb the use of environmental isotopes and hydro chemical methods can deepen our understanding of spatial water consumption in various land use conditions this can in turn lead to more accurate determination of the root cause of runoff decline and to develop guidelines for scientific water use and management also the isotope and salinity of stream water sampled before the rainy season that is not mixed with the present day rainwater characterized by relative low ion and isotope concentration can reasonably reflect true spatial water use and yield of native vegetation and crops in this study several surface water systems including rivers and reservoirs were sampled before the rainy season and river flow rates estimated along mainstream and tributaries of htr in upstream hutuo river basin uhtb the objective of the study was to assess spatial variation in water use and yield depict spatial correlation of hydrological processes and agricultural activities and to quantify inflow from upstream shanxi province to the downstream region of hebei province using environmental isotope and hydro chemical analysis the results of the research can be used in design overhaul of cross border agricultural water use strategies for sustainable development of river basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area htr originates in fansi county in shanxi province and flows across hebei province before joining haihe river in north china uhtb is approximately 15 915 km2 in area and lies between longitudes 112 25 114 10 e and latitudes 38 00 39 46 n it stretches over an elevation range of 127 3059 m above mean sea level and has the most vegetation cover in the upstream region around gangnan reservoir with over 70 of its area located in shanxi province there are four long tributaries in uhtb which are qingshui river and e river in the north of htr and then muma river and wu river in the south of htr fig 1 both qingshui and e rivers originate in wutai mountains and are recharged by snowmelt and rainfall there is rich fissure water in the metamorphic clastic and limestone rocks in the mountain and hilly areas song et al 2013 the study area has a temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate with cold dry winter and hot rainy summer about 70 80 of the annual precipitation of 400 700 mm occurs during the rainy summer from july through september the main land use types include woodland shrub e g vitex negundo and zizyphus jujuba herbs e g themed japonica and bothriochloa ischaemum and farmland e g wheat and maize the woodland is mainly deciduous broad leaved e g quercus genus and coniferous e g pinus tabulaeformis platycladus orientalis forests tian et al 2009 based on 2014 statistical data from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn the area sown with grain crops mainly maize and millet account for some 90 of total cultivated area in the seven upstream counties in shanxi province then the maize millet ratio is 65 with winter wheat and summer maize as the main grain crops for the continuous crop rotation system in the downstream county of pingshan in hebei province maize in shanxi province is generally planted from late april to early may before the start of rainy season and harvested before or after the 1st of october millet is generally planted in may and harvested in october summer maize in hebei province is generally planted at the end of june and harvested before or after the 1st of october followed by winter wheat in the next season which is harvested at the end of june in the year after irrigation is necessary before sowing or germination especially for maize due to the little rainfall at sowing any subsequent irrigation during the growing season is dependent on the mode of the rainfall winter wheat grows across the whole dry season and irrigation is done to guarantee high yield the amount is 60 90 mm per irrigation event htr runoff is the main source of water and it is delivered through irrigation ditches rubber dam sand gate and intake gate ma et al 2018 groundwater withdrawal is another water source especially when surface water is scare in the winter wheat growth season organic or chemical n and p fertilizer is normally broadcasted followed by plowing by turning over the soil prior to sowing additional fertilizer is broadcasted on the soil surface before irrigation or the start of the rains and at least one round of fertilization for maize and wheat during the growing season 2 2 field survey and sampling a field survey was conducted along the rivers and riparian areas in upstream htb in june 2016 before the rains it was mostly at jointing stage of maize in the upstream and middle reaches and at seedling stage in the downstream of uhtb and just after one or two irrigation events for maize runoff samples were collected from the mainstream and tributaries using 150 ml wide mouth plastic bottles and each sample duplicated once the bottles were completely filled slowly to minimize alteration of isotopic composition of the water samples a total of 38 water samples were collected from htr and its tributaries and 6 from reservoirs fig 1 furthermore 8 dry tributaries were discussed under flow rate analysis although each sample site was visited only once the spatial distribution of the sample sites was quite representative in terms of water quality and quantity of the entire uhtb all the water samples were passed through 0 22 Œºm filter before analysis stable isotopes Œ¥d Œ¥ 18o are reported in standard Œ¥ notion relative to nist iaea vsmow reference document the values are measured using picarro l2120 i liquid water isotope analyzer which has an accuracy of Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d of less than 0 1 and 0 5 respectively total dissolved solids tds were measured by traditional oven dried method flow rate was roughly calculated by multiplying flow velocity with discharge cross section where flow velocity was determined by the float method the area of discharge cross section was calculated by multiplying water depth and river width and the depth and width visually estimated when measurement with ruler was impossible 2 3 rayleigh evaporation model for stable isotopes the theory of rayleigh distillation on Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o isotopic components was used to calculate the remaining fraction of open and evaporated water body in general rayleigh distillation equation states that isotope ratio r in a diminishing reservoir of reactants is a function of its initial isotopic ratio r0 the remaining fraction of that reservoir f and the fractionation factor Œ± v w for the following reaction clark and fritz 1997 wang et al 2014b 1 r r 0 f Œ± v w 1 where Œ± v w is generally calculated from an enrichment factor Œµ of the relationship of Œµ Œ± v w 1 which incorporates both equilibrium Œµ v w and kinetic enrichment Œ¥ Œµ v b l and Œµ Œµ v w Œ¥ Œµ v b l factors the equilibrium enrichment factor Œµ v w is calculated using the relationship Œµ Œ± 1 and the equilibrium isotope fractionation factor Œ± w v which is strongly dependent on the temperature t in kelvin degree of the reaction the following equations are used to calculate the equilibrium fractionation factors of 18o and 2h between water and vapor majoube 1971 2 10 3 l n Œ± o 118 w v 1 137 10 6 t 2 0 4156 10 3 t 2 0667 3 10 3 l n Œ± h 12 w v 24 844 10 6 t 2 76 248 10 3 t 52 612 the following equations are used to calculate the kinetic

factors of 18o and 2h between vapor and boundary layer in the evaporation interface after converting the isotope ratios to Œ¥ values eq 1 is then replaced by eq 6 the f for reservoir and river water is calculated as wang et al 2014b 6 Œ¥ exp ln f Œµ 1000 Œ¥ 0 1000 1000 2 4 isotope mass balance the isotope mass balance imb in combination with water balance was used to estimate ungauged groundwater inflow from shanxi province and pingshan county to htr the total water resources and percent flow from upstream shanxi province into downstream hebei province was estimated and the boundary section shown in fig 3 the water balance and imb are written respectively as 7 f d s f u s f u g f l s f l g 8 f d s Œ¥ d s f u s Œ¥ u s f u g Œ¥ u g f l s Œ¥ l s f l g Œ¥ l g where f ds is gauged mainstream flow rate in the downstream section of pingshan county f us is gauged flow rate of mainstream inflow in upstream yuxian county shanxi province f ug is ungauged flow rate of groundwater inflow from upstream yuxian county f ls is gauged flow rate of local tributary inflow in pingshan region and f lg is ungauged flowrate of local tributary inflow as groundwater all in m3 s Œ¥ ds Œ¥ us Œ¥ ug Œ¥ ls and Œ¥ lg are the isotope compositions of downstream mainstream upstream mainstream upstream groundwater inflow local tributary inflow and local groundwater inflow respectively given that Œ¥ us Œ¥ ug and Œ¥ ls Œ¥ lg only f ug and f lg remain unknown which are then estimated from gauged flow rates and isotope values the isotope hypothesis is rational because the difference in Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o values between river and groundwater systems is not obvious in upstream htb zhang et al 2008 also the transitions of groundwater and surface water are common hydrological processes in mountain regions the unit of Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o is and the estimated f ug and f lg are the average of two values respectively calculated from the known values of Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o balance 2 5 statistical data collection the data on agriculture for the eight counties in the study area were acquired from national meteorological information center http data cma cn including land area area under crop vegetable and fruit and yield 3 results 3 1 spatial flow rate the flow rates of htr and its tributaries are illustrated in fig 2 the basin wide flow rate showed clear spatial differences relatively high in the upper middle and lower reaches of the mainstream and qingshui and e tributaries figs 2 and 3 flow rate in the mainstream headwater region in fansi county was lowest with an average of 0 24 m3 s it was highest 6 46 m3 s in yuanping county in the middle reach which gradually declined along flow direction up to the point of inflow from qingshui tributary the highest mainstream runoff 22 5 m3 s occurred at the cross section near the entrance to gangnan reservoir followed by 17 0 m3 s and 12 0 m3 s at the other two cross sections along the flow direction close to gangnan reservoir compared with the mainstream tributary flow rates were lower there were three higher tributary runoffs before discharge into htr two of which were at the end of qingshui tributary and e tributary with respective flow rates of 3 08 m3 s and 2 36 m3 s the highest tributary runoff with 3 86 m3 s flow rate was at the upstream of qingshui tributary with the exception of qingshui and e tributaries almost all the tributaries in the catchment were drying up with flow generally less than 0 13 m3 s 3 2 spatial salt to clearly depict the spatial variation the salt contents of tributary waters were classified into 5 grades of equal intervals and the same intervals adopted in the classification of salt contents of the mainstream and reservoir waters salt concentrations in htr mainstream the tributaries and the reservoirs are illustrated in fig 4 when combined together the spatial distribution of the basin wide tds was relatively high in the middle reach and low in the upper and lower reaches of uhtb fig 4 salt content in the middle reach of mainstream htr was high average of 0 57 g l and was highest 0 72 g l at the meeting point of yuanping and xinzhou counties inversely salt content was low in the headwater and downstream reaches of htr with respective averages of 0 35 g l and 0 39 g l with the exception of the 0 81 g l salt concentration in a small tributary with only 0 01 m3 s flow in dingxiang county the salt content of almost all the tributaries was less than 0 4 g l there was low 0 27 g l salt content in qingshui tributary salt content of reservoirs in the headwater region in fansi county was higher than that in reservoirs in the middle and downstream regions the range of salt content was 0 17 0 40 g l in reservoirs in the headwater region and only 0 12 g l in gangnan reservoir in the downstream region 3 3 spatially stable isotopes while the global meteoric water line gmwl is related as Œ¥d 8Œ¥ 18o 10 the local meteoric water line lmwl of isotopic data in htb is reported as Œ¥d 6 42Œ¥ 18o 4 66 jia et al 2015 fig 5 illustrates gmwl lmwl Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d of rivers and reservoirs in the study area in the left plot in fig 5 the apparent deviation of lmwl from gmwl was due to evaporation during precipitation the Œ¥ 18o range of 7 08 to 0 59 and Œ¥d range of 58 05 to 20 56 for reservoirs were much higher than in rivers and with high deviations from lmwl the ranges of Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d for tributary runoff were wider than for the mainstream with Œ¥ 18o range of 11 0 to 6 01 for tributaries and 9 84 to 7 59 for mainstream the corresponding ranges of Œ¥d were 76 81 to 46 35 for tributaries and 2 77 to 57 38 for mainstream the average Œ¥ 18o for tributary runoff 9 67 was less than that for the mainstream 8 50 also the average Œ¥d for tributary runoff 68 41 was less than that for the mainstream 62 20 the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d for reservoirs were most enriched with average values of 4 21 and 41 3 respectively two water samples from two reservoirs in upstream of uhtb had extremely enriched isotopic compositions 0 59 and 1 11 for Œ¥ 18o and then 20 56 and 24 69 for Œ¥d the middle plot fig 5 depicts stable isotopes along the river flow from upstream to downstream in uhtb the sections of the upstream middle stream and downstream of uhtb are depicted in fig 3 the isotope value for water rich qingshui tributary was also separately presented it was obvious that Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d gradually increased along flow direction of htr with some overlapping areas in the middle reach compared with others the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d trend line for the middle reach of uhtb deviated more from lmwl the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d concentration was much lower for water rich qingshui tributary and the flow of the tributary into htr decreased isotope concentration of mainstream runoff the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d for qingshui tributary were within lmwl and some isotope measures even lied outside the water line the low value was due to elevation wutai mountain is located at the roof of north china with the highest elevation of 3058 m thus the cyclic local generation of moisture is characterized by specific isotope composition of precipitation in the region compared with isotope values of gangnan reservoir in downstream uhtb Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d of reservoirs in upstream uhtb were much higher with higher deviation from lmwl right plot in fig 5 3 4 stable isotope correlation with tds fig 6 shows the correlations of Œ¥d and tds of the various water bodies Œ¥d and tds and then f and tds along the flow direction from the left plot Œ¥d was positive for rivers with increasing tds and smaller gradient for the mainstream then there was no relationship between the stable isotopes and tds for reservoir water in the region the middle and right plots in fig 6 suggest the existence of a relationship among Œ¥d f and tds for rivers along the flow direction the respective relationships in water rich qingshui tributary were also separately illustrated the sections of the upstream middle stream and downstream uhtb are shown in fig 3 the Œ¥d and tds for river water in the middle reach were relatively high and with Œ¥d and tds trend line nearly horizontal then most of the values for the other reaches were relatively low and with positive correlation between Œ¥d and tds for all of the other reaches as a whole concurrently f for river water in the middle reach was low with an average value of 0 85 and f and tds trend line also nearly horizontal in contrast most of the f values for the other reaches were 0 85 and with negative correlation between f and tds for all of the other reaches as a whole the Œ¥d and tds for river water were much lower in water rich qingshui tributary while f for the tributary was much higher with some values close to 1 0 the flow of this tributary into htr decreased the Œ¥d and tds and increased f for mainstream runoff middle and right plots of fig 6 4 discussions 4 1 spatial difference in evaporation while evaporative processes lead to the enrichments of stable isotopes and dissolved ions transpiration process do not significantly affect environmental isotopes cartwright et al 2012 moya et al 2016 the high Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d values for reservoir water in upstream uhtb suggested that evaporation was the dominant process of static water loss left plot in fig 5 then the non relationship between Œ¥d and tds indicated that the contribution of evaporation to tds concentration was limited when reservoir salt content was low left plot in fig 6 from combined f and tds for reservoirs water huang and pang 2012 the estimated contributions of evaporation driven concentration and mineral dissolution and or transpiration to total salinity of reservoirs were 17 8 and 48 0 respectively there was a wider range of Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d for tributary runoff than for mainstream runoff some tributary runoff values of Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d were richer than mainstream runoff which indicated that tributaries with low flows endured much stronger evaporation than tributaries with high flows left plot in fig 5 the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d gradients for various reaches except the middle reach of river water were nearly parallel to lmwl this suggested evaporation only slightly enriched river water isotope content middle plot of fig 5 and that rivers were continuously recharged by groundwater river recharge by groundwater was a common hydrological process in the study area especially in dry seasons zhang 1979 zhang et al 2008 the estimated contributions of evaporation driven concentration and mineral dissolution and or transpiration to total salinity of river were 2 0 and 73 8 respectively in the reaches except the middle reaches compared with other trend lines the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d trend line for rivers in middle reach of uhtb deviated more from lmwl middle plot of fig 5 indicating significant Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d isotope fractionation and strong surface water evaporation in the reach the low f for river water in the middle reach also indicated high evaporation right plot in fig 6 the estimated contributions of evaporation driven concentration and dissolution and or transpiration to total salinity were 2 6 and 83 6 respectively for the middle reach this indicated that higher evapotranspiration i e high agricultural water use intensity in the reach than in other reaches the high intensity exploitation and pumping of groundwater mainly for agriculture caused decline in groundwater and river runoff in the middle reach of uhtb zhao et al 2015b which enhanced water surface evaporation and isotope concentration 4 2 spatial differences in agricultural activities htr flow rates fails to reflect spatial differences in agricultural activities due to the spatial variability of water yield and precipitation assuming that the spatial variation of soil and rock materials was negligible the spatial variation of tds was strongly driven by the degree of agricultural activities in upstream uhtb in the headwater region in fansi county there was low agricultural efficiency with only 25 6 of the farmland area irrigated yield output of 1 9 t ha zhao et al 2015a grain crops yield of 2 3 t ha 15 sown area of grain crops as percent of land area table 1 responding to the low agricultural efficiency i e weak soil mineral dissolution and or transpiration led to low flow and tds mean of 0 29 g l in the mainstream in qingshui tributary sub basin where percent irrigated area was only 24 6 and farmland productivity was 3 3 t ha which was moderate agricultural efficiency the flow rate was relatively high the corresponding tds average of 0 31 g l was low and was similar to that of river water in the headwater region in fansi county figs 2 4 the different flow rates in the two regions were mainly driven by precipitation which was low 350 mm yr in fansi county and high 530 mm yr in wutai county the higher farmland productivity in qingshui tributary sub basin was attributed to the rich precipitation and rich surface water resources while the small irrigated area was due to the high and uneven terrain in the middle reach of the mainstream with high agriculture efficiency the percent irrigated area and cultivated land yield were 55 9 and 5 9 t ha respectively zhao et al 2015a the sown area of grain crops as percent of land area and yield per unit area of grain crops were around 25 and 6 6 t ha respectively table 1 mainstream flow rate gradually declined from moderate to low along the flow direction and had the highest tds of average of 0 54 g l figs 2 4 under moderate precipitation 430 mm yr thus while the high agricultural efficiency was mainly driven by irrigation the high flow rates in some sections of middle reach were driven by the convergence of groundwater and the relatively large sink area in the mountain region the estimated contribution of dissolution and or transpiration to total salinity was 83 6 for the middle reach and was higher than 73 8 for other reaches this indicated that the high tds was driven by high evapotranspiration agricultural activities and efficiency in the middle reach zhang et al 1995 zhang and shan 2008 and zhang et al 2011 described the process by which agriculture effects surface groundwater chemistry long term farming can accelerate weathering and erosion of surficial rocks and soil since tillage and cultivation destroy natural vegetation and cause weathering to penetrate greater depths irrigation also can increase mineralization of groundwater through leaching of soils salts and then unconfined groundwater discharging high salts into rivers and streams can cause high riverine tds content the isotopes values of water samples are nearly parallel to lmwl and the overall small deviation from the line middle plot in fig 5 suggested that transpiration was likely the main driver of the increased solute concentrations moya et al 2016 evapotranspiration as a major control on the enrichment of ions in groundwater was also identified by herczeg et al 1991 and moya et al 2015 thus weathering and erosion agricultural activities were the possible main processes affecting water chemistry in htr from the tributaries and mainstream comparison of tributary and mainstream tds showed that there was higher salt content 0 26 0 72 g l in the mainstream in contrast salt content of almost all the tributaries was less than 0 4 g l with salt content even lower than 0 27 g l in the headwater region of qingshui tributary the high tds in the mainstream was due to the long term water rock interaction which increased ion content of water in the main channel wang et al 2016 also due to the increasing effect of agriculture on water flow into the mainstream as increasing runoff path takes more ions from the surrounding farmlands zhang et al 1995 2011 li et al 2016 4 3 cross border water amount the isotope mass balance together with the water balance method is widely used to estimate the inflow outflow and interaction of surface water and groundwater systems zhang et al 2013 fan et al 2016 shaw et al 2017 yang et al 2012 2017 with water scarcity the quantification of cross border river flow from upstream to downstream regions is critical for integrated water resources management for the entire uhtb the wide range of tributary Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d left plot of fig 5 indicated that water flow from the tributary to the mainstream was limited across the entire basin this was the general picture of the current mode of renewal of water resources the lack of flow into the mainstream was apparently read as high efficiency of surface water use in the nested smaller sub basins or an indication of water shortage in uhtb qingshui sub region was characterized by rich water resource renewal due to high precipitation and low evapotranspiration driven by the rainfed nature of cultivation and high elevation of the region the water chemistry of mainstream htr was strongly influenced by inflow from qingshui tributary figs 5 and 6 as such the tributary was the main resource of water for downstream uhbt also while flow rate of the tributaries in the downstream region of uhbt were low that from mainstream htr reached 20 m3 s before discharging downstream into gangnan reservoir in pingshan county figs 2 and 3 the apparent increasing flow rates of mainstream indicated that the sub surface runoff groundwater was the main way of flowing into htr before rainy season groundwater as base flow discharging surface water were common situations guzm√°n et al 2016 kebede et al 2016 based on the isotope and water balance methods the estimated f ug for a section of the river downstream pingshan county in hebei province close to the upstream section number 8 in fig 3 with runoff of 17 17 m3 s had cross border groundwater inflow of 7 73 m3 s from upstream shanxi province the estimated f lg representing local groundwater inflow from the mountain on the two sides of the htr section in hebei province was 5 12 m3 s together with surface runoff upstream inflow to mainstream htr was 3 93 m3 s and local tributaries inflow to htr was 0 38 m3 s the calculated water flow rate from shanxi province to hebei province was 11 66 m3 s which accounted for 67 9 of runoff flow in the selected river section in pingshan county the flow rate from surface and groundwater systems in the region was 5 51 m3 s accounting for 32 1 of flow in the region also based on the three flow rates from qingshui tributary and mainstream before and after tributary inflow 91 9 of htr water was from qingshui tributary 4 4 irrigation function of reservoirs reservoirs can be used to regulate and store rainwater which is critical for agricultural irrigation for reservoirs in the upstream reach such function was limited because of low water storage that was hardly enough for discharge the Œ¥ 18o and Œ¥d of reservoir water departed more from the lmwl but was much higher than most of the stable isotopes in the tributaries and mainstream left plot in fig 5 together with the actual reservoir water and the monitored mainstream flow rate water discharged from the reservoirs to rivers for agricultural irrigation was limited in addition reservoir water isotopes in upstream of uhtb were much higher with higher deviation from lmwl than water isotopes in downstream gangnan reservoir right plot in fig 5 this suggested that upstream reservoir water endured stronger evaporation and less groundwater recharge the stable isotope of static waters generally varied linearly with salt content due to the dominant evaporation yadav 1997 in contrast the tds content average of 0 24 g l of reservoir water in uhtb was low compared to the most enriched isotope values figs 5 and 6 and was even lower than that of river water one main reason for the low reservoir water tds was that recharge from upstream water with higher salt content after flow across farmlands was limited it then implied that water flow across farmlands and discharge into reservoirs was limited due to low precipitation and high water use intensity in the study area 4 5 implications for agricultural water use htr is a cross border river and the main source of groundwater in ncp in uhtb water consumption as percent natural annual runoff was 56 6 in 2000 2012 exceeding the 40 internationally recognized warning line note then that the water consumption ratio was 7 5 24 0 before 1980 wang et al 2014a agriculture is the highest water user for htr irrigation distrit in the middle reaches of uhtb average precipitation was 390 8 mm and deliverd water volume from htr was 32 6 106 m3 in 2001 2011 ma et al 2018 then irrigation water delivered from htr was around 3 4 times that of locally produced runoff for runoff coefficient of 4 8 feng and zhao 2009 this suggested that the water intensive agriculture used up all the runoff that could have flown to downstream region clarifying the spatial water use and yield intensity is key for achieving a scientifically driven water allocation of cross border rivers and for sustainable regional development with spatially correlated hydrological processes and agricultural activities cross border water was the basis for deep understanding of the above issues in the absence of dense spatial information inclunding information on farmland area irrigation water amount and delivered water from river field hydrological survey along with the environmental isotope and hydro chemical analysis was the best way to get to that objective the results of this study suggested that even if 67 9 of runoff flow in the selected river section in hebei province was from upstream shanxi province that was still far from enough considering the wide downstream plain of htb and the important role it plays as the main source of groundwater in ncp thus agricultural water saving is urgent in the high production area especially in the middle reach of uhtb and the most efficient way to do this is to directly reduce water demand irrigation water transfer loss was over 60 thus the soil rock channels needed to be replaced by pipelines also high water intensive crops should be replaced by low water use crops by adjusting planting structure li and ma 2017 the small runoff recharge in reservoirs in the upstream region of uhtb indicated that the high farmland area needed to be reduced which will in turn reduce interception water in farmlands adjusting the planting structure such as stopping or reducing wheat planting area because of its high water requirement and dry season cultivation is also urgent in the downstream region of uhtb 5 conclusions as a major water resource area in ncp investigating hillslope hydrological processes of uhtb is critical for understanding the spatial variations in water delivery and water use this is also important for developing sustainable regional water management strategies against the declining runoff and heightening vulnerability of the ecosystem the water chemistry analysis in this study showed variations in spatial evaporation mineral dissolution and or transpiration the distributions of Œ¥d and Œ¥ 18o of river water were near parallel to lmwl except for the middle reach suggesting that isotopic enrichment due to evaporation was not prevalent in the river systems and that there was surface water recharge by groundwater and groundwater recharge by precipitation intensive agricultural activities caused the specific distribution of stable isotopes of deviating lmwl highest tds and lowest f only 0 85 in the middle reach the estimated contribution of dissolution and or transpiration to the total water salinity was 83 6 in the middle reach higher than the 73 8 in the other reaches the irrigation function of upstream reservoirs was not fully reflected there was limited recharge flow from the surrounding farmlands and discharge from reservoir to river even in the dry season qingshui tributary was the main water resource for the downstream region of uhtb water yield in uhtb was poor due to low precipitation in the upstream reaches and intensive agricultural activity only e tributary and qingshui tributary originated respectively from the northern and southern slopes of wutai mountain had rich water before the rains thus almost all the river water was used in the intensive agriculture especially in the middle reach of uhtb before inflow from qingshui tributary out of the monitored 17 17 m3 s runoff in pingshan county hebei province 67 9 11 66 m3 s was from shanxi province and 91 9 from qingshui tributary this suggested that 32 1 5 51 m3 s of the flow was from surface water and groundwater in local region the 67 9 runoff flow from upstream shanxi province is far from enough considering the wide downstream plain of htb and the important role it plays as the main source of groundwater in ncp to increase runoff in htr agricultural water saving is urgent in the middle reach reducing planted crop area is needed to reduce intercepted water in farmlands in the upstream region of uhtb adjusting the planting structure such as stopping or reducing wheat planting is also urgent in the

11272,oasis effect may have significant impacts on the crop water use in irrigated fields of extremely arid conditions studies on crop coefficients and its relevant influence factors are essential to accurately determine the irrigation scheduling under such conditions a two year experiment was conducted in an irrigated vineyard to estimate evapotranspiration et and its two components evaporation e and crop transpiration t and to develop appropriate region specific crop coefficients k c k cb in arid northwest china the contributions of oasis effect to k c the relationships of both k c and k cb to canopy conductance g c and leaf area index lai were investigated local values of k c for evapotranspiration and crop transpiration k cb were calculated using the field data and the dual k c approach the daily et ranged from 0 80 to 9 87 mm d 1 and from 0 99 to 8 73 mm d 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively with corresponding t et values amounting to approximately 58 4 and 55 1 the locally averaged k c values were 0 79 1 31 and 1 08 during the initial middle and late growth stages respectively versus corresponding k cb values of 0 17 0 97 and 0 64 arid advection accounted for 16 9 to 57 4 and from 1 4 to 49 0 of daily k c during the two study periods both k c and k cb to lai is a linear regression but to g c is an exponential one lai is a better indicator than g c when it is used to predict k c and k cb these results will help growers to improve irrigation efficiency and quantify the contributions of individual factors to k c and k cb in such conditions keywords evapotranspiration crop coefficient oasis effect oasis ecosystem 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a significant process in terrestrial systems where it represents a link among the hydrological carbon and energy cycles zhu et al 2016a b about 60 of rainfall re enters the atmosphere through transpiration t and evaporation e but this amount can reach 90 in agricultural ecosystems jung et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 thus accurate measurement and estimation of et and its components t and e in agricultural ecosystems are crucial both for managing irrigation and for improving crop yield allen et al 2011 sun et al 2012 kool et al 2014 zhao and zhao 2015 many techniques have been developed to measure et and its components such as combining the sap flow and eddy covariance methods herbst et al 1996 cavanaugh et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 developing land surface models oleson et al 2004 dirmeyer et al 2006 and isotope methods williams et al 2004 wang et al 2010 jasechko et al 2013 of these methods the combination of sap flow and eddy covariance techniques supply a direct and robust observation of et and t and therefore provide basic data that can be used to assess the accuracy of other methods thus this combination has been widely used to measure and partition the components of et in various ecosystems ding et al 2015 in comparison with direct in situ measurements accurately estimating et based on meteorological data is appealing in irrigation scheduling due to its relative simplicity and ease of application jagtap and jones 1989 ding et al 2015 the dual crop coefficient dual k c method proposed by the food and agriculture organization fao 56 has been widely used to estimate the components of et allen et al 1998 in this method the crop coefficient k c is partitioned into two parts the basal crop coefficient k cb representing crop transpiration and the soil evaporation coefficient k e this method has been extensively applied in different crop ecosystems including coffee flumignan et al 2009 castor campbell et al 2015 apple trees marsal et al 2013 peach orchard pa√ßo et al 2012 and grapevines fandi√±o et al 2012 pic√≥n toro et al 2012 poblete echeverr√≠a and ortega farias 2013 zhao et al 2015 however the values of the crop coefficients k c or k cb have been reported to be sensitive to climate hydrological and environmental factors as a result the proposed adjustment method for k c and k cb in fao 56 can only approximately explain the variations of k c and k cb in response to changes in relative humidity rh wind speed and other environmental variables allen et al 1998 significant uncertainties in estimating et and its components have been reported in previous studies when directly using the fao proposed coefficient values in different regions s√°nchez et al 2014 yang et al 2016 thus it is necessary to identify the specific values of k c and k cb across different agricultural ecosystems and environmental conditions as these values provide important guidance for local irrigation practices and can be used to improve water use efficiency yang et al 2016 in addition the relationships of both k c and k cb to various ecological and environmental factors e g canopy conductance leaf area index lai and vapor pressure deficit need to be investigated in detail however as far as we know such studies are relatively few to improve regional food security china has been forced to implement cultivation in many areas where water is scarce for example the landscape in arid northwestern china is characterized by widely distributed gobi desert i e desert with a gravel surface interspersed with many oases where there is abundant light to support agricultural ecosystems but limited water resources zhu et al 2007 2008 2014 in this region a phenomenon known as the oasis effect which involves evaporative cooling over areas of water that leads to advection of warmer bodies of air is often observed on clear days wang and mitsuta 1992 lee et al 2004 previous studies have indicated that the oasis effect will increase et in agricultural systems prueger et al 1996 lei and yang 2010 ding et al 2015 however fewer studies have attempted to investigate the impact of the oasis effect on k c and its components in the arid oasis agricultural systems in northwestern china in the present study direct measurements of the components of et obtained by combining the sap flow and eddy covariance techniques in a grapevine ecosystem in the arid region of northwestern china our main objectives were 1 to investigate the seasonal variations of k c k cb and k e under the advective conditions 2 to identify the relationships of both k c and k cb to local ecological factors and 3 to evaluate the impact of the oasis effect on k c 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the experiment was conducted in a grapevine vitis vinifera cv thompson seedless ecosystem during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the study site is located in the nanhu oasis of northwestern china 39 52 34 n 94 06 19 e 1300 m a s l one plot in an area of 7 2 ha 450 m 160 m was selected in this area to conduct our study the canopy height of the vineyard was about 2 5 m above the ground fig 1 a b the planting pattern of the grapes was in rows with a spacing of 3 m between rows and 1 m between grapes trellises fig 1c with the rows oriented from north to south weeds at the study site were removed regularly during the whole growth stage pruning was performed around doy 230 during 2014 and 2015 to improve the yield and increase the water use efficiency the root depth of the grapevines was about 2 0 m below the surface with about 1 5 m of the lateral root spread in the inter row space which was too shallow to reach the groundwater caused by the deep water table 10 50 m in this region ma et al 2013 therefore the contribution of ground water was not considered in the computations plants received flood irrigation about every 20 days during the growth stages based on the fao classification the soil type is arenosols with a mean soil bulk density being 1 41 g cm 3 yan et al 2015 the values of the measured field water capacity Œ∏ fc at site was 0 28 m3 m 3 and the wilting point Œ∏ wp by allen et al 1998 was about 0 13 m3 m 3 the annual total solar radiation ranged from 5903 4 to 6309 5 mw m 2 which provided sufficient sunlight for grapes in the study area the annual mean temperature and rainfall were 9 3 c and 36 9 mm respectively with mean monthly temperatures ranging from 9 3 c in january to 24 9 c in july yan et al 2015 2 2 eddy covariance and sap flow measurements eddy covariance method was used to measure the daily et in the grapevine field the eddy covariance instrumentations fig 1e were installed at 4 0 m above the ground level which consist of an open path h2o co2 analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa and a three dimensional sonic anemometer r3 50 gill instruments uk there were four soil heat flux plates hfp01sc hukseflux netherlands installed at a depth of 50 mm below the ground surface soil heat flux g was calculated by averaging the four directions of heat fluxes data from sensors measurements were made continuously from 15 april day of year doy 105 to 13 october doy 285 in 2014 and 2015 the dominant wind direction during the study period was north east the 80 of contributing source area was from 150 m stable stratification to 250 m unstable stratification and the dominant direction was north east indicating the measured fluxes were primarily contributed by the vineyard fig 1b all data were recorded at a frequency of 10 hz using a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa and the average value of 30 min was computed daily averages were calculated during post processing linear interpolation method was used to complete daily et values when the data gaps were less than 2 h in a day any day that did not have necessary measurements to complete a diurnal cycle were discarded in this study in addition observations during the rainfall events were not used as the eddy covariance measurements were less reliable during precipitation events zhao et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the energy balance closure method which is based on conservation of energy was used to evaluate the quality of eddy covariance data fig 2 shows strong and statistically significant fits for the energy balance closure slopes 0 91 and 0 87 with r 2 0 82 and 0 87 in 2014 and 2015 respectively which was comparable to that in previous studies conducted in vineyards under similar circumstances ferreira et al 2012 generally between 10 and 30 of the energy was missing from the energy balance as being common in previous research oncley et al 2007 foken 2008 allen et al 2011 the results suggest that the energy balance closure in present study was reasonable meanwhile to overcome the issue of energy imbalance the bowen ratio method was applied to correct the measured et and the results could be seen in supplement sap flow measurements were made from 1 may doy 121 to 13 october doy 285 in 2014 and between 21 june doy 172 and 13 october doy 285 in 2015 six grapevines that covered the whole range of diameters were selected each year with their diameters at breast height ranging from 2 01 to 4 14 cm sap flow f g h 1 was measured using a flow 32a 1 k system dynamax austin tx usa according to the heat balance method sakuratani 1981 the probes were mounted more than 40 cm above the ground on the grapevine s trunk to avoid damage from the irrigation water and were wrapped in aluminum foil to minimize the effects of solar heating fig 1d details of the installation and the theory behind the measurements were provided by trambouze and voltz 2001 2 3 other variables weather variables were measured at the study site using an automatic weather station the global solar radiation was observed at a height of 3 m above the soil surface nr01 hukse flux delft the netherlands both rh and air temperature hmp60 vaisala helsinki finland were monitored at heights of 3 0 2 5 2 0 1 5 and 1 0 m above the soil surface the cr1000 data logger was used to store and compute the half hourly means of these data volumetric water content vwc at 5 10 20 50 80 and 100 cm depths was measured continuously during two study periods ml2x delta t uk an lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer li cor was used to measure the canopy lai a regression relationship was defined between leaf area la cm2 and the leaf width lw cm and leaf length ll cm la 0 70 lw ll 2 57 r 2 0 98 200 leaves were collected from the grapevines in the study plot to obtain this regression relationship the total leaf area a m2 was calculated from the measurements of all leaves for each sample grapevine 2 4

f i is the sap flow in sample i g h 1 a i is the leaf area of sample i m2 the daily canopy transpiration t mm d 1 was calculated by summing the half hourly t values from eq 1 three crop coefficients k

accounted for by transpiration t k e is the portion of k c accounted for by soil evaporation e et is the measured evapotranspiration and et 0 mm d 1 is the daily reference evapotranspiration which is calculated using the standardized penman monteith equation jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 the analysis was only conducted under good water status conditions due to the definition of kc allen et al 1998 that is when the water stress coefficient ks was less than 1 during two study periods corresponding observations were discarded see details in supplement therefore the kc and kcb values used in present study represent conditions without water stress the k c during the middle k c mid and late k c late growth stages is usually adjusted using the fao 56 method when u 2 the wind speed at a height of 2 m is not equal to 2 0 m s 1 and rh min the average value of the minimum daily rh during the middle and late stages of growth is different from 45 allen et al 1998 the adjustment equations are expressed as follows 5 k c mid k c mid tab 0 04 u 2 2 0 04 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 6 k c late k c late tab 0 04 u 2 2 0 04 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 where k c mid tab and k c late tab are the corresponding mid season and late season values respectively under standard conditions that were provided in table 12 of the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 and h is the average crop height at the corresponding stages m a similar approach was used to adjust the values of k cb mid and k cb late for the transpiration components during the middle and late stages respectively of the growing season the grapevine growth stages were classified as initial development middle season and late season based on the fao 56 segmentation approach allen et al 1998 horizontal line segments were used to represent the growth curve during the initial and middle parts of the season but used increasing and decreasing line segments to represent the development and late parts of the season respectively canopy conductance g c

93 and 2 57 to 38 25 c with an average value of 18 52 and 18 89 c during experimental periods in two years respectively fig 3a and b the daily et0 varied from 0 80 to 7 11 and 1 13 to 7 32 mm d 1 with an average value of 3 73 and 4 28 mm d 1 during experimental periods in two years respectively fig 3a and b the total precipitation was 13 2 mm in 2014 and 50 8 mm with four events greater than 5 0 mm in 2015 fig 3c and d vwc has a wide range over the whole growing season and the variability of vwc was mainly depended on local irrigation scheduling and rain fig 3c and d the peak value of vwc was reached after rain and irrigation about 0 32 m3 m 3 and would gradually reduce until the next irrigation rain the average daily relative humidity rh ranged from 11 6 to 75 8 and from 10 3 to 90 6 in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3e and f daily vapor pressure deficit vpd varied from 0 30 to 2 78 kpa and from 0 18 to 2 59 kpa in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3e and f daily mean u ranged from 0 19

variation of k c and its partitioning in both years lai increased rapidly from the initial to the middle stage and then decreased slowly thereafter the peak lai of 4 88 m2 m 2 was reached on 22 august 2014 doy 234 fig 3g and the peak of 4 67 m2 m 2 was reached on 23 august 2015 doy 235 fig 3h daily g c ranged from about 0 56 mm s 1 at the initial stage in both years to 20 35 mm s 1 in 2014 and 16 60 mm s 1 in 2015 at the middle stage thereafter it declined to about 1 19 and 0 96 mm s 1 at the late stage in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3i and j in previous research the highest value of daily g c was 32 5 mm s 1 among primary vegetation types with an extensive lai range kelliher et al 1995 thus our results fall within the range reported from previous studies of daily g c irrigation in both years was about 142 5 mm each time at an interval of about 20 days 3 2 crop transpiration versus evapotranspiration fig 4 shows the seasonal variations of et and t during the growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 the transpiration data from doy 157 to 193 in 2014 doy 120 to 172 and doy 238 to 245 in 2015 were missing due to the malfunctions of the instruments and power failures the daily values of t increased from 0 09 mm d 1 during the initial stage of the growing season in 2014 t value during the initial stage in 2015 was missing to 7 52 and 7 07 mm d 1 respectively during the corresponding middle stages and then decreased gradually until the leaf fall season meanwhile the et values ranged from 0 80 and 0 99 mm d 1 during the initial stages of the growing season in 2014 and 2015 respectively to 9 87 and 8 73 mm d 1 when the canopy reached full cover and then declined steadily until the leaf fall season the mean values of et were 4 63 and 4 77 mm d 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively versus corresponding averages of 3 00 and 3 33 mm d 1 for t these results were higher than those in previous studies of grapevines ortega farias et al 2010 pic√≥n toro et al 2012 poblete echeverr√≠a and ortega farias 2013 the high values of et and t can be attributed to the high et 0 combined with high lai and oasis effect at the study site the ratio of t et was 58 4 and 55 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively the results suggested that the crop transpiration t during the summer is a dominant water flux of evapotranspiration et compared to others sutanto et al 2014 concomitantly the t et ratios were lower than the values for grapevines under drip irrigation which ranged from 78 9 3 1 mean sd to 84 1 1 3 l√≥pez urrea et al 2012 poblete echeverr√≠a and ortega farias 2013 in particular fandi√±o et al 2012 suggested that the ratio of t et ranged from 85 to 92 under sub drip irrigation at vineyards with active ground cover and also applying sub drip irrigation and having active ground cover that highly contributed to the total transpiration 47 to 58 of total t these could be interpreted by the fact that water use efficiency of drip irrigation was higher than that of flood irrigation however our results were greater than the values measured from vineyard with low fractional cover 50 7 2 4 zhao et al 2015 the small values of t et for vines with low fractional cover may be because the available energy intercepted by the canopy for transpiration was low during the growth stage the differences between present study and previous results clearly indicated that the ratio of t et is strongly affected by water availability ambient conditions irrigation system and canopy characteristics schlesinger and jasechko 2014 therefore locally specific estimates of the ratio were still needed 3 3 local kc and kcb versus fao 56 climate adjusted values seasonal variations of daily k c and k cb displayed similar tendency during two experimental years fig 5 daily values of k c increased from nearly 0 45 during the initial stages to about 1 65 by the middle stages and then gradually decreased the k cb values were also having the similar trend during the growth stage at the same time daily values of k e demonstrated an approximately opposite trend during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the highest values of k c and k cb generally appeared when the canopy reached its full expansion and the soil moisture was completely adequate but the peak values of k c and k cb were generally transitory our results agree with those in a number of previous studies for grapes grimes and williams 1990 williams et al 2003a b the maximum seasonal value of k c in the present study was in excess of 1 0 which was comparable to those reported in previous studies for example johnson et al 2005 suggested the maximum k c values were between 1 10 and 1 20 in an american vineyard allen and pereira 2009 provided a peak k c of 1 10 for grapes during the middle season netzer et al 2009 reported a peak k c of 1 20 for grapevines v vinifera cv superior seedless in southern israel pic√≥n toro et al 2012 reported the maximum value of kc was close to 2 for tempranillo during their study periods in south western spain the differences among these studies in the maximum k c value probably resulted from uncertainties in the calculation method combined with the use of different cultivars different irrigation methods and different environmental conditions table 1 shows the observed durations of the growth stages during the two study periods this combined with other factors leads to differences between the local observed k c k c local and the fao 56 climate adjusted k c k c fao for the growth stages table 2 fig 6 table 2 indicates that the average observed k c was higher than k c fao in both study periods after examining the possible reasons for the higher k c values in the present study we hypothesize that the increased t and e that result from higher solar radiation and temperature were by themselves insufficient to cause the remarkable increase of k c because the e value would be relatively low when the canopy reached its maximum coverage even when combined with high levels of solar radiation and high temperatures allen et al 1998 thus it was necessary to determine what other factors could have contributed to the increased k c one possibility is the oasis effect rosenberg et al 1983 prueger et al 1996 zhu et al 2014 which could result from high surface heterogeneity this was often observed during cloud free days at our study site when the sensible heat flux h was close to zero or even negative near ground level due to the advection of hotter air from the surrounding desert areas causing a flow of warm air to the study site li and yu 2007 lei and yang 2010 zhu et al 2014 at the same time the latent heat le often equaled or exceeded the local available energy net radiation minus the heat flux from the ground r n g due to the downward fluxes of h as energy inputs into the et processes evett et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 to examine the contribution of the oasis effect to k c five clear days and one rainy day in 2014 and 2015 were chosen to investigate the possibility of heat advection prueger et al 1996 zhu et al 2014 fig 7 a h shows that on clear days a prominent advection process could be detected at 14 00 13 00 14 30 14 30 15 30 15 30 and 16 30 16 30 bst beijing standard time in 2014 2015 respectively which suggested that the sensible heat flux h provided the energy that drove et evapotranspiration in the vineyard during the period surrounding these times in contrast days when advection was absent happened sometimes during days with a clear sky in 2014 fig 7i and 2015 fig 7k and during a rainy day in 2014 fig 7j and 2015 fig 7l fig 8 shows the dynamics of daily r ad during the 2014 and 2015 study periods r ad could be positive or negative for a given day during the study period which demonstrates that the oasis effect can either increase or decrease k c all the days during the two study periods showed obviously positive r ad suggesting that the oasis effect increased k c when positive advection occurred because h afforded the energy for et rather than consumption of available energy the contribution of the oasis effect to k c ranged from 16 9 to 57 4 in 2014 and from 1 4 to 49 0 in 2015 indicating that the oasis effect contributed substantially to the crop coefficient k c our estimates of this contribution were higher than those in a previous study in cropland 4 4 28 0 ding et al 2015 but comparable to the sensible heat advection achieved in previous studies under a similar environment 50 0 li and yu 2007 therefore the effects of the oasis effect on daily k c should not be ignored in future research in general the use of irrigation in farmland will generate the oasis effect thereby increasing daily k c so accounting for the influence of this effect on k c could help managers modify their irrigation practices to reduce water consumption ding et al 2015 3 4 effects of physiological factors on kc and kcb fig 9 illustrates the relationships between the two crop coefficients k c k cb and the main factors that influence them the relationships between the crop coefficients k c k cb and lai were moderately strong and statistically significant r 2 0 78 p 0 01 in both years fig 9 a b which agrees with previous results by williams and ayars 2005 for grapevines thompson seedless in california intrigliolo et al 2009 also found a significant relationship with an average k cb of 0 49 in grapevines riesling at lai 1 57 which was comparable to the present results these similarities suggested that the relationships between the crop coefficients and lai could be applicable for many different grape cultivars despite differences in the climate varieties datasets and management system ding et al 2015 pic√≥n toro et al 2012 meanwhile it seems that both k c and k cb to g c was an exponential regression during two study periods fig 9c d in addition lai seems better able than g c r 2 0 67 to predict the crop coefficients in both years moreover both lai and g c had a better fit with k cb than with k c suggesting that lai and g c are likely to indicate t more accurately than et therefore k cb may be more strongly affected than k c by the physiological responses of grapevines to their cultivation environment 3 5 comparisons of observed and estimated et and t values fig 10 shows the results of a cross validation between the daily measured and estimated values of et and t which can be used to evaluate the performance of the k c and k cb values estimated by means of the dual k c approach the regression between the measured and estimated values of daily et in both years was not statistically different from line 1 1 with r2 being 0 67 and 0 60 in 2014 and 2015 figs 10a and 10b respectively the normalized root mean square error nrmse and mean absolute error mae were 0 27 and 0 98 mm d 1 and 0 24 and 1 01 mm d 1 for 2014 and 2015 respectively this agrees with the results of a previous study using the dual k c approach poblete echeverr√≠a and ortega farias 2013 zhao et al 2015 our results therefore suggested that the values of k c calculated by means of the dual k c method can provide a good estimate of the daily values of et in contrast the dual k c method seemed to slightly overestimating daily t in 2014 with the values of r2 nrmse and mae being 0 83 0 30 and 0 99 mm d 1 respectively fig 10c nevertheless it tended to slightly underestimate the daily values of t in 2015 with r2 nrmse and mae being 0 80 0 31 and 1 29 mm d 1 respectively fig 10d this resulted in some discrepancies between the strengths of the relationships between observed and simulated t the discrepancies may be attributable to the uncertainty when scaling up t from individual trees to canopy scale meanwhile the soil characteristics e g Œ∏fc measured at limited points may not adequately stand for the whole study site and this can also contribute to some uncertainties in estimating t zhao et al 2015 however although the use of other models may overcome the uncertainties in estimating et and t our results nonetheless suggest that the dual k c methodologycould be used for providing acceptable daily et and t estimates 4 conclusions our 2 year study of irrigated grapes in an arid region of northwestern china revealed the importance of regionally calibrated crop coefficients the high values of et and t can be attributed to the high et 0 combined with high lai and oasis effect the values of the t et ratio were strongly affected by water availability ambient conditions irrigation system and canopy characteristics the average observed k c was higher than k c fao in both study periods the contribution of the oasis effect to daily k c was too important to ignore in arid regions such as our study area lai is a better indicator than g c when it was used to predict k c and k cb the dual k c method let us estimate k c and k cb with good accuracy in the irrigated vineyard as a result it was possible to estimate et and t with reasonable accuracy and account for inter annual variability moreover the local values of k c and k cb calculated by means of the dual k c methodology will improve real time management of irrigation efficiency and improve water allocation under the regional environmental conditions since water is a rare and precious resource in the study area limitations still exist when measuring t and et using sf and ec techniques for some instances uncertainty is generally produced when sf method is used to scale up t from individual trees to landscape meanwhile although the ec techniques are widely used under a variety of conditions the energy closure problem still exists thus some other methods in estimating et and t should be investigated in the future studies such as et models based on remote sensing observations or others based on penman monteith equations although the relationships described in this paper were moderately strong there was clearly room for improvement particularly with respect to eliminating periods when the instruments were unavailable leading to long periods with missing data acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science

11272,oasis effect may have significant impacts on the crop water use in irrigated fields of extremely arid conditions studies on crop coefficients and its relevant influence factors are essential to accurately determine the irrigation scheduling under such conditions a two year experiment was conducted in an irrigated vineyard to estimate evapotranspiration et and its two components evaporation e and crop transpiration t and to develop appropriate region specific crop coefficients k c k cb in arid northwest china the contributions of oasis effect to k c the relationships of both k c and k cb to canopy conductance g c and leaf area index lai were investigated local values of k c for evapotranspiration and crop transpiration k cb were calculated using the field data and the dual k c approach the daily et ranged from 0 80 to 9 87 mm d 1 and from 0 99 to 8 73 mm d 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively with corresponding t et values amounting to approximately 58 4 and 55 1 the locally averaged k c values were 0 79 1 31 and 1 08 during the initial middle and late growth stages respectively versus corresponding k cb values of 0 17 0 97 and 0 64 arid advection accounted for 16 9 to 57 4 and from 1 4 to 49 0 of daily k c during the two study periods both k c and k cb to lai is a linear regression but to g c is an exponential one lai is a better indicator than g c when it is used to predict k c and k cb these results will help growers to improve irrigation efficiency and quantify the contributions of individual factors to k c and k cb in such conditions keywords evapotranspiration crop coefficient oasis effect oasis ecosystem 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a significant process in terrestrial systems where it represents a link among the hydrological carbon and energy cycles zhu et al 2016a b about 60 of rainfall re enters the atmosphere through transpiration t and evaporation e but this amount can reach 90 in agricultural ecosystems jung et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 thus accurate measurement and estimation of et and its components t and e in agricultural ecosystems are crucial both for managing irrigation and for improving crop yield allen et al 2011 sun et al 2012 kool et al 2014 zhao and zhao 2015 many techniques have been developed to measure et and its components such as combining the sap flow and eddy covariance methods herbst et al 1996 cavanaugh et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 developing land surface models oleson et al 2004 dirmeyer et al 2006 and isotope methods williams et al 2004 wang et al 2010 jasechko et al 2013 of these methods the combination of sap flow and eddy covariance techniques supply a direct and robust observation of et and t and therefore provide basic data that can be used to assess the accuracy of other methods thus this combination has been widely used to measure and partition the components of et in various ecosystems ding et al 2015 in comparison with direct in situ measurements accurately estimating et based on meteorological data is appealing in irrigation scheduling due to its relative simplicity and ease of application jagtap and jones 1989 ding et al 2015 the dual crop coefficient dual k c method proposed by the food and agriculture organization fao 56 has been widely used to estimate the components of et allen et al 1998 in this method the crop coefficient k c is partitioned into two parts the basal crop coefficient k cb representing crop transpiration and the soil evaporation coefficient k e this method has been extensively applied in different crop ecosystems including coffee flumignan et al 2009 castor campbell et al 2015 apple trees marsal et al 2013 peach orchard pa√ßo et al 2012 and grapevines fandi√±o et al 2012 pic√≥n toro et al 2012 poblete echeverr√≠a and ortega farias 2013 zhao et al 2015 however the values of the crop coefficients k c or k cb have been reported to be sensitive to climate hydrological and environmental factors as a result the proposed adjustment method for k c and k cb in fao 56 can only approximately explain the variations of k c and k cb in response to changes in relative humidity rh wind speed and other environmental variables allen et al 1998 significant uncertainties in estimating et and its components have been reported in previous studies when directly using the fao proposed coefficient values in different regions s√°nchez et al 2014 yang et al 2016 thus it is necessary to identify the specific values of k c and k cb across different agricultural ecosystems and environmental conditions as these values provide important guidance for local irrigation practices and can be used to improve water use efficiency yang et al 2016 in addition the relationships of both k c and k cb to various ecological and environmental factors e g canopy conductance leaf area index lai and vapor pressure deficit need to be investigated in detail however as far as we know such studies are relatively few to improve regional food security china has been forced to implement cultivation in many areas where water is scarce for example the landscape in arid northwestern china is characterized by widely distributed gobi desert i e desert with a gravel surface interspersed with many oases where there is abundant light to support agricultural ecosystems but limited water resources zhu et al 2007 2008 2014 in this region a phenomenon known as the oasis effect which involves evaporative cooling over areas of water that leads to advection of warmer bodies of air is often observed on clear days wang and mitsuta 1992 lee et al 2004 previous studies have indicated that the oasis effect will increase et in agricultural systems prueger et al 1996 lei and yang 2010 ding et al 2015 however fewer studies have attempted to investigate the impact of the oasis effect on k c and its components in the arid oasis agricultural systems in northwestern china in the present study direct measurements of the components of et obtained by combining the sap flow and eddy covariance techniques in a grapevine ecosystem in the arid region of northwestern china our main objectives were 1 to investigate the seasonal variations of k c k cb and k e under the advective conditions 2 to identify the relationships of both k c and k cb to local ecological factors and 3 to evaluate the impact of the oasis effect on k c 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the experiment was conducted in a grapevine vitis vinifera cv thompson seedless ecosystem during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the study site is located in the nanhu oasis of northwestern china 39 52 34 n 94 06 19 e 1300 m a s l one plot in an area of 7 2 ha 450 m 160 m was selected in this area to conduct our study the canopy height of the vineyard was about 2 5 m above the ground fig 1 a b the planting pattern of the grapes was in rows with a spacing of 3 m between rows and 1 m between grapes trellises fig 1c with the rows oriented from north to south weeds at the study site were removed regularly during the whole growth stage pruning was performed around doy 230 during 2014 and 2015 to improve the yield and increase the water use efficiency the root depth of the grapevines was about 2 0 m below the surface with about 1 5 m of the lateral root spread in the inter row space which was too shallow to reach the groundwater caused by the deep water table 10 50 m in this region ma et al 2013 therefore the contribution of ground water was not considered in the computations plants received flood irrigation about every 20 days during the growth stages based on the fao classification the soil type is arenosols with a mean soil bulk density being 1 41 g cm 3 yan et al 2015 the values of the measured field water capacity Œ∏ fc at site was 0 28 m3 m 3 and the wilting point Œ∏ wp by allen et al 1998 was about 0 13 m3 m 3 the annual total solar radiation ranged from 5903 4 to 6309 5 mw m 2 which provided sufficient sunlight for grapes in the study area the annual mean temperature and rainfall were 9 3 c and 36 9 mm respectively with mean monthly temperatures ranging from 9 3 c in january to 24 9 c in july yan et al 2015 2 2 eddy covariance and sap flow measurements eddy covariance method was used to measure the daily et in the grapevine field the eddy covariance instrumentations fig 1e were installed at 4 0 m above the ground level which consist of an open path h2o co2 analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa and a three dimensional sonic anemometer r3 50 gill instruments uk there were four soil heat flux plates hfp01sc hukseflux netherlands installed at a depth of 50 mm below the ground surface soil heat flux g was calculated by averaging the four directions of heat fluxes data from sensors measurements were made continuously from 15 april day of year doy 105 to 13 october doy 285 in 2014 and 2015 the dominant wind direction during the study period was north east the 80 of contributing source area was from 150 m stable stratification to 250 m unstable stratification and the dominant direction was north east indicating the measured fluxes were primarily contributed by the vineyard fig 1b all data were recorded at a frequency of 10 hz using a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa and the average value of 30 min was computed daily averages were calculated during post processing linear interpolation method was used to complete daily et values when the data gaps were less than 2 h in a day any day that did not have necessary measurements to complete a diurnal cycle were discarded in this study in addition observations during the rainfall events were not used as the eddy covariance measurements were less reliable during precipitation events zhao et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the energy balance closure method which is based on conservation of energy was used to evaluate the quality of eddy covariance data fig 2 shows strong and statistically significant fits for the energy balance closure slopes 0 91 and 0 87 with r 2 0 82 and 0 87 in 2014 and 2015 respectively which was comparable to that in previous studies conducted in vineyards under similar circumstances ferreira et al 2012 generally between 10 and 30 of the energy was missing from the energy balance as being common in previous research oncley et al 2007 foken 2008 allen et al 2011 the results suggest that the energy balance closure in present study was reasonable meanwhile to overcome the issue of energy imbalance the bowen ratio method was applied to correct the measured et and the results could be seen in supplement sap flow measurements were made from 1 may doy 121 to 13 october doy 285 in 2014 and between 21 june doy 172 and 13 october doy 285 in 2015 six grapevines that covered the whole range of diameters were selected each year with their diameters at breast height ranging from 2 01 to 4 14 cm sap flow f g h 1 was measured using a flow 32a 1 k system dynamax austin tx usa according to the heat balance method sakuratani 1981 the probes were mounted more than 40 cm above the ground on the grapevine s trunk to avoid damage from the irrigation water and were wrapped in aluminum foil to minimize the effects of solar heating fig 1d details of the installation and the theory behind the measurements were provided by trambouze and voltz 2001 2 3 other variables weather variables were measured at the study site using an automatic weather station the global solar radiation was observed at a height of 3 m above the soil surface nr01 hukse flux delft the netherlands both rh and air temperature hmp60 vaisala helsinki finland were monitored at heights of 3 0 2 5 2 0 1 5 and 1 0 m above the soil surface the cr1000 data logger was used to store and compute the half hourly means of these data volumetric water content vwc at 5 10 20 50 80 and 100 cm depths was measured continuously during two study periods ml2x delta t uk an lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer li cor was used to measure the canopy lai a regression relationship was defined between leaf area la cm2 and the leaf width lw cm and leaf length ll cm la 0 70 lw ll 2 57 r 2 0 98 200 leaves were collected from the grapevines in the study plot to obtain this regression relationship the total leaf area a m2 was calculated from the measurements of all leaves for each sample grapevine 2 4 parameter calculations the half hourly canopy transpiration t mm h 1 was computed as follows yan et al 2015 soegaard and boegh 1995 1 t k n i 1 n f i a i l a i where n is the number of samples k 0 001 f i is the sap flow in sample i g h 1 a i is the leaf area of sample i m2 the daily canopy transpiration t mm d 1 was calculated by summing the half hourly t values from eq 1 three crop coefficients k c k cb and k e for the grapevines were calculated as follows allen et al 1998 2 k c e t e t 0 3 k c k c b k e 4 k c b t e t 0 where k c is the overall crop coefficient k cb is the portion of k c accounted for by transpiration t k e is the portion of k c accounted for by soil evaporation e et is the measured evapotranspiration and et 0 mm d 1 is the daily reference evapotranspiration which is calculated using the standardized penman monteith equation jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 the analysis was only conducted under good water status conditions due to the definition of kc allen et al 1998 that is when the water stress coefficient ks was less than 1 during two study periods corresponding observations were discarded see details in supplement therefore the kc and kcb values used in present study represent conditions without water stress the k c during the middle k c mid and late k c late growth stages is usually adjusted using the fao 56 method when u 2 the wind speed at a height of 2 m is not equal to 2 0 m s 1 and rh min the average value of the minimum daily rh during the middle and late stages of growth is different from 45 allen et al 1998 the adjustment equations are expressed as follows 5 k c mid k c mid tab 0 04 u 2 2 0 04 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 6 k c late k c late tab 0 04 u 2 2 0 04 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 where k c mid tab and k c late tab are the corresponding mid season and late season values respectively under standard conditions that were provided in table 12 of the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 and h is the average crop height at the corresponding stages m a similar approach was used to adjust the values of k cb mid and k cb late for the transpiration components during the middle and late stages respectively of the growing season the grapevine growth stages were classified as initial development middle season and late season based on the fao 56 segmentation approach allen et al 1998 horizontal line segments were used to represent the growth curve during the initial and middle parts of the season but used increasing and decreasing line segments to represent the development and late parts of the season respectively canopy conductance g c

93 and 2 57 to 38 25 c with an average value of 18 52 and 18 89 c during experimental periods in two years respectively fig 3a and b the daily et0 varied from 0 80 to 7 11 and 1 13 to 7 32 mm d 1 with an average value of 3 73 and 4 28 mm d 1 during experimental periods in two years respectively fig 3a and b the total precipitation was 13 2 mm in 2014 and 50 8 mm with four events greater than 5 0 mm in 2015 fig 3c and d vwc has a wide range over the whole growing season and the variability of vwc was mainly depended on local irrigation scheduling and rain fig 3c and d the peak value of vwc was reached after rain and irrigation about 0 32 m3 m 3 and would gradually reduce until the next irrigation rain the average daily relative humidity rh ranged from 11 6 to 75 8 and from 10 3 to 90 6 in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3e and f daily vapor pressure deficit vpd varied from 0 30 to 2 78 kpa and from 0 18 to 2 59 kpa in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3e and f daily mean u ranged from 0 19

variation of k c and its partitioning in both years lai increased rapidly from the initial to the middle stage and then decreased slowly thereafter the peak lai of 4 88 m2 m 2 was reached on 22 august 2014 doy 234 fig 3g and the peak of 4 67 m2 m 2 was reached on 23 august 2015 doy 235 fig 3h daily g c ranged from about 0 56 mm s 1 at the initial stage in both years to 20 35 mm s 1 in 2014 and 16 60 mm s 1 in 2015 at the middle stage thereafter it declined to about 1 19 and 0 96 mm s 1 at the late stage in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 3i and j in previous research the highest value of daily g c was 32 5 mm s 1 among primary vegetation types with an extensive lai range kelliher et al 1995 thus our results fall within the range reported from previous studies of daily g c irrigation in both years was about 142 5 mm each time at an interval of about 20 days 3 2 crop transpiration versus evapotranspiration fig 4 shows the seasonal variations of et and t during the growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 the transpiration data from doy 157 to 193 in 2014 doy 120 to 172 and doy 238 to 245 in 2015 were missing due to the malfunctions of the instruments and power failures the daily values of t increased from 0 09 mm d 1 during the initial stage of the growing season in 2014 t value during the initial stage in 2015 was missing to 7 52 and 7 07 mm d 1 respectively during the corresponding middle stages and then decreased gradually until the leaf fall season meanwhile the et values ranged from 0 80 and 0 99 mm d 1 during the initial stages of the growing season in 2014 and 2015 respectively to 9 87 and 8 73 mm d 1 when the canopy reached full cover and then declined steadily until the leaf fall season the mean values of et were 4 63 and 4 77 mm d 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively versus corresponding averages of 3 00 and 3 33 mm d 1 for t these results were higher than those in previous studies of grapevines ortega farias et al 2010 pic√≥n toro et al 2012 poblete echeverr√≠a and ortega farias 2013 the high values of et and t can be attributed to the high et 0 combined with high lai and oasis effect at the study site the ratio of t et was 58 4 and 55 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively the results suggested that the crop transpiration t during the summer is a dominant water flux of evapotranspiration et compared to others sutanto et al 2014 concomitantly the t et ratios were lower than the values for grapevines under drip irrigation which ranged from 78 9 3 1 mean sd to 84 1 1 3 l√≥pez urrea et al 2012 poblete echeverr√≠a and ortega farias 2013 in particular fandi√±o et al 2012 suggested that the ratio of t et ranged from 85 to 92 under sub drip irrigation at vineyards with active ground cover and also applying sub drip irrigation and having active ground cover that highly contributed to the total transpiration 47 to 58 of total t these could be interpreted by the fact that water use efficiency of drip irrigation was higher than that of flood irrigation however our results were greater than the values measured from vineyard with low fractional cover 50 7 2 4 zhao et al 2015 the small values of t et for vines with low fractional cover may be because the available energy intercepted by the canopy for transpiration was low during the growth stage the differences between present study and previous results clearly indicated that the ratio of t et is strongly affected by water availability ambient conditions irrigation system and canopy characteristics schlesinger and jasechko 2014 therefore locally specific estimates of the ratio were still needed 3 3 local kc and kcb versus fao 56 climate adjusted values seasonal variations of daily k c and k cb displayed similar tendency during two experimental years fig 5 daily values of k c increased from nearly 0 45 during the initial stages to about 1 65 by the middle stages and then gradually decreased the k cb values were also having the similar trend during the growth stage at the same time daily values of k e demonstrated an approximately opposite trend during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the highest values of k c and k cb generally appeared when the canopy reached its full expansion and the soil moisture was completely adequate but the peak values of k c and k cb were generally transitory our results agree with those in a number of previous studies for grapes grimes and williams 1990 williams et al 2003a b the maximum seasonal value of k c in the present study was in excess of 1 0 which was comparable to those reported in previous studies for example johnson et al 2005 suggested the maximum k c values were between 1 10 and 1 20 in an american vineyard allen and pereira 2009 provided a peak k c of 1 10 for grapes during the middle season netzer et al 2009 reported a peak k c of 1 20 for grapevines v vinifera cv superior seedless in southern israel pic√≥n toro et al 2012 reported the maximum value of kc was close to 2 for tempranillo during their study periods in south western spain the differences among these studies in the maximum k c value probably resulted from uncertainties in the calculation method combined with the use of different cultivars different irrigation methods and different environmental conditions table 1 shows the observed durations of the growth stages during the two study periods this combined with other factors leads to differences between the local observed k c k c local and the fao 56 climate adjusted k c k c fao for the growth stages table 2 fig 6 table 2 indicates that the average observed k c was higher than k c fao in both study periods after examining the possible reasons for the higher k c values in the present study we hypothesize that the increased t and e that result from higher solar radiation and temperature were by themselves insufficient to cause the remarkable increase of k c because the e value would be relatively low when the canopy reached its maximum coverage even when combined with high levels of solar radiation and high temperatures allen et al 1998 thus it was necessary to determine what other factors could have contributed to the increased k c one possibility is the oasis effect rosenberg et al 1983 prueger et al 1996 zhu et al 2014 which could result from high surface heterogeneity this was often observed during cloud free days at our study site when the sensible heat flux h was close to zero or even negative near ground level due to the advection of hotter air from the surrounding desert areas causing a flow of warm air to the study site li and yu 2007 lei and yang 2010 zhu et al 2014 at the same time the latent heat le often equaled or exceeded the local available energy net radiation minus the heat flux from the ground r n g due to the downward fluxes of h as energy inputs into the et processes evett et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 to examine the contribution of the oasis effect to k c five clear days and one rainy day in 2014 and 2015 were chosen to investigate the possibility of heat advection prueger et al 1996 zhu et al 2014 fig 7 a h shows that on clear days a prominent advection process could be detected at 14 00 13 00 14 30 14 30 15 30 15 30 and 16 30 16 30 bst beijing standard time in 2014 2015 respectively which suggested that the sensible heat flux h provided the energy that drove et evapotranspiration in the vineyard during the period surrounding these times in contrast days when advection was absent happened sometimes during days with a clear sky in 2014 fig 7i and 2015 fig 7k and during a rainy day in 2014 fig 7j and 2015 fig 7l fig 8 shows the dynamics of daily r ad during the 2014 and 2015 study periods r ad could be positive or negative for a given day during the study period which demonstrates that the oasis effect can either increase or decrease k c all the days during the two study periods showed obviously positive r ad suggesting that the oasis effect increased k c when positive advection occurred because h afforded the energy for et rather than consumption of available energy the contribution of the oasis effect to k c ranged from 16 9 to 57 4 in 2014 and from 1 4 to 49 0 in 2015 indicating that the oasis effect contributed substantially to the crop coefficient k c our estimates of this contribution were higher than those in a previous study in cropland 4 4 28 0 ding et al 2015 but comparable to the sensible heat advection achieved in previous studies under a similar environment 50 0 li and yu 2007 therefore the effects of the oasis effect on daily k c should not be ignored in future research in general the use of irrigation in farmland will generate the oasis effect thereby increasing daily k c so accounting for the influence of this effect on k c could help managers modify their irrigation practices to reduce water consumption ding et al 2015 3 4 effects of physiological factors on kc and kcb fig 9 illustrates the relationships between the two crop coefficients k c k cb and the main factors that influence them the relationships between the crop coefficients k c k cb and lai were moderately strong and statistically significant r 2 0 78 p 0 01 in both years fig 9 a b which agrees with previous results by williams and ayars 2005 for grapevines thompson seedless in california intrigliolo et al 2009 also found a significant relationship with an average k cb of 0 49 in grapevines riesling at lai 1 57 which was comparable to the present results these similarities suggested that the relationships between the crop coefficients and lai could be applicable for many different grape cultivars despite differences in the climate varieties datasets and management system ding et al 2015 pic√≥n toro et al 2012 meanwhile it seems that both k c and k cb to g c was an exponential regression during two study periods fig 9c d in addition lai seems better able than g c r 2 0 67 to predict the crop coefficients in both years moreover both lai and g c had a better fit with k cb than with k c suggesting that lai and g c are likely to indicate t more accurately than et therefore k cb may be more strongly affected than k c by the physiological responses of grapevines to their cultivation environment 3 5 comparisons of observed and estimated et and t values fig 10 shows the results of a cross validation between the daily measured and estimated values of et and t which can be used to evaluate the performance of the k c and k cb values estimated by means of the dual k c approach the regression between the measured and estimated values of daily et in both years was not statistically different from line 1 1 with r2 being 0 67 and 0 60 in 2014 and 2015 figs 10a and 10b respectively the normalized root mean square error nrmse and mean absolute error mae were 0 27 and 0 98 mm d 1 and 0 24 and 1 01 mm d 1 for 2014 and 2015 respectively this agrees with the results of a previous study using the dual k c approach poblete echeverr√≠a and ortega farias 2013 zhao et al 2015 our results therefore suggested that the values of k c calculated by means of the dual k c method can provide a good estimate of the daily values of et in contrast the dual k c method seemed to slightly overestimating daily t in 2014 with the values of r2 nrmse and mae being 0 83 0 30 and 0 99 mm d 1 respectively fig 10c nevertheless it tended to slightly underestimate the daily values of t in 2015 with r2 nrmse and mae being 0 80 0 31 and 1 29 mm d 1 respectively fig 10d this resulted in some discrepancies between the strengths of the relationships between observed and simulated t the discrepancies may be attributable to the uncertainty when scaling up t from individual trees to canopy scale meanwhile the soil characteristics e g Œ∏fc measured at limited points may not adequately stand for the whole study site and this can also contribute to some uncertainties in estimating t zhao et al 2015 however although the use of other models may overcome the uncertainties in estimating et and t our results nonetheless suggest that the dual k c methodologycould be used for providing acceptable daily et and t estimates 4 conclusions our 2 year study of irrigated grapes in an arid region of northwestern china revealed the importance of regionally calibrated crop coefficients the high values of et and t can be attributed to the high et 0 combined with high lai and oasis effect the values of the t et ratio were strongly affected by water availability ambient conditions irrigation system and canopy characteristics the average observed k c was higher than k c fao in both study periods the contribution of the oasis effect to daily k c was too important to ignore in arid regions such as our study area lai is a better indicator than g c when it was used to predict k c and k cb the dual k c method let us estimate k c and k cb with good accuracy in the irrigated vineyard as a result it was possible to estimate et and t with reasonable accuracy and account for inter annual variability moreover the local values of k c and k cb calculated by means of the dual k c methodology will improve real time management of irrigation efficiency and improve water allocation under the regional environmental conditions since water is a rare and precious resource in the study area limitations still exist when measuring t and et using sf and ec techniques for some instances uncertainty is generally produced when sf method is used to scale up t from individual trees to landscape meanwhile although the ec techniques are widely used under a variety of conditions the energy closure problem still exists thus some other methods in estimating et and t should be investigated in the future studies such as et models based on remote sensing observations or others based on penman monteith equations although the relationships described in this paper were moderately strong there was clearly room for improvement particularly with respect to eliminating periods when the instruments were unavailable leading to long periods with missing data acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science

11273,protection and management of water quality across agricultural landscapes requires a sound understanding of runoff and or leaching of nutrients and other agrichemicals from agricultural production systems to receiving waters we in a large leaching columns experiment studied the losses of dissolved organic n don dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic n din and total dissolved n tdn from maize cultivation on a coarse textured soil in in mediterranean central chile the combined effects of cover crops and inorganic n fertilisation rates were evaluated on nitrogen and carbon leaching loads din don and doc and ratios of soluble components don din don tdn and doc don a total of 52 soil columns for 13 treatments 4 replicates were established to evaluate leaching of dissolved n and c forms from 1 continuous bare soil fallow compared with a continuous cover crop lolium multiflorum or trifolium repens with 0 or 150 kg n ha 1 applied and 2 maize fallow and maize cover crop rotations with two different n doses 250 or 400 kg n ha 1 for the maize and cover crops l multiflorum and or t repens we found that inclusion of a grass cover crop l multiflorum and optimal n fertilisation 250 kg n ha 1 treatment resulted into lower din losses from the study columns however in trial 1 the don load from the treatments with continuous grass cover crop l multiflorum was on average twice the din load in trial 2 the crop rotation of maize cultivation with 400 kg n ha 1 applied and inclusion of a legume cover crop t repens resulted into the highest din loads while a crop rotation of maize with 250 kg n ha 1 applied and inclusion of a grass cover crop l multiflorum had the lowest din loads however the latter rotation gave significantly higher don loads than the maize fallow treatments in trials 1 and 2 inclusion of l multiflorum enhanced soil organic pools and microbial activity and thus increased the amount of don and doc susceptible to leaching overall the rotation with maize with 250 kg n ha 1 applied and l multiflorum as cover crop generated the lowest amount of tdn leaching from the soil columns we recommend this to be further studied in field conditions as a best management practice for reducing the risk of diffuse pollution of surface water bodies and groundwater from maize cultivation in mediterranean central chile keywords agriculture water quality diffuse pollution soil percolation nitrogen and carbon loads 1 introduction protection and management of water quality across agricultural landscapes requires a sound understanding of runoff and or leaching of nutrients and other agrichemicals from agricultural production systems to receiving waters dissolved inorganic nitrogen din forms such as nitrate no3 n and ammonium nh4 n have been identified as the main forms of nitrogen n leaching in agricultural systems galloway et al 2008 vitousek et al 2009 salazar et al 2013 however recent studies include dissolved organic n don leaching as another important n loss pathway from agroecosystems abaas et al 2012 mcgovern et al 2014 scott and rothstein 2014 according to van kessel et al 2009 it has been known for more than 125 years that don leaching losses occur from agricultural fields but most n loss studies on agricultural systems have not measured don as a potential pathway jones et al 2004 concluded that don is an important soluble n pool within total dissolved nitrogen tdn in soil and although its full ecological significance remains unknown they recommend measuring don on a routine basis alongside measurements of din losses from agricultural soils dissolved organic n losses could explain a large fraction of the missing nitrogen in n budgets pujo pay and conan 2003 for example van kessel et al 2009 and manninen et al 2018 reported that on average don leaching losses are equivalent to one third of total dissolved n tdn losses from cultivated soil including grassland pasture and cereals from europe recently several studies have been carried out investigating leaching of don from soils under forest kiikkil√§ et al 2013 campbell et al 2014 and grassland necpalova et al 2012 riaz et al 2012 hoeft et al 2014 however only a few studies has focused on investigating losses of don from arable soils macdonald et al 2016 manninen et al 2018 particularly in the mediterranean climatic conditions to the authors knowledge there are few studies published to date investigating don content on soils under mediterranean conditions for instance the studies carried out in plant communities in spain delgado baquerizo et al 2011 and vineyard in greece christou et al 2006 neff et al 2003 noted that don contains a mixture of recalcitrant and labile compounds with substantial and very different roles in terrestrial biochemistry which may affect the n balance in soil in two ways firstly it can enable a short circuit in the terrestrial n cycle whereby plants absorb some don forms directly from the soil solution without the need for microbial mineralisation in soil n√§sholm et al 2009 secondly it may represent a significant n loss when plants and edaphic microorganisms cannot assimilate available don in the soil solution with some forms of don being flushed from ecosystems during rapid n leaching neff et al 2003 as mentioned above the latter has been widely demonstrated for forest kiikkil√§ et al 2013 campbell et al 2014 and grassland ecosystems necpalova et al 2012 riaz et al 2012 hoeft et al 2014 but it has not been properly investigated and quantified in agricultural soils thus it is important to evaluate the potential effects on don pools and crop production caused by excessive don leaching in agricultural soils for instance ros et al 2009 noted that after n fertiliser application to soils changes in n flux can occur through the don pools however there are still many gaps in our understanding of the significance of don in agricultural production systems as a potential pathway for n losses murphy et al 2000 the impact of don losses from agricultural soils on water quality has recently been shown in different studies where don in surface waters was related to the surrounding area of agricultural land rasmussen et al 2008 bartley et al 2012 wohlfart et al 2012 evans et al 2014 at the catchment level agricultural fields have been linked to increase don export mattsson et al 2009 with the increase suggested to originate from intensive farming practices mattsson et al 2005 van kessel et al 2009 concluded that leaching of don from agricultural soils into surface water leads to eutrophication and acidification on the other hand worrall et al 2004 noted that the removal of doc from water sources represents one of the major costs to water treatment in large parts of britain therefore a better understanding and quantification of don and doc leaching from agricultural soils would help minimise its losses and effects on agricultural production and receiving water quality in the mediterranean zone of chile there is a serious risk of diffuse pollution of surface water bodies and groundwater due to excessive applications of n fertilizers for maize zea mays under irrigation fuentes et al 2014 corradini et al 2015 n√°jera et al 2015 this is a particular concern in areas with coarse textured soils which are more prone to n leaching due to low water holding capacity casanova et al 2013 these concerns also extend to other mediterranean climate regions of the world where irrigated maize fields with high n doses represent a high risk of creating diffuse n pollution areas isidoro et al 2006 berenguer et al 2009 salmer√≥n et al 2011 simeonova et al 2017 establishment of cover crops during the intercropping period of maize replacing bare fallows in these mediterranean zones has been proposed to counteract the negative impacts of din leaching or diffuse pollution from irrigated maize fields salmer√≥n et al 2011 gabriel and quemada 2011 gabriel et al 2012 however most soils in such agroecosystems are depleted of their antecedent soil organic carbon soc pool and inclusion of cover crops can enhance soc pool and microbial activity lal 2013 hence increasing the risk of don leaching due to higher total inputs of n van kessel et al 2009 another important consideration is that cover crop species e g grasses poaceae or legumes fabaceae used in a crop rotation may influence the don din ratio but their impact on don leaching is particularly poorly understood moreover because plant residues from a winter legume included as a cover crop are rapidly decomposed wagger et al 1998 it is well known that this may increase soc and organic n there is a risk of this organic n leaching from the system if its release from cover crop residues and the n organic mineralisation is not synchronised with the n requirements of the following crop gentry et al 2013 however the components of dissolved organic matter dom don and dissolved organic carbon doc are directly associated in soil water systems vinther et al 2006 reported higher losses of doc by leaching from cover crops than from bare soil in denmark vinther et al 2006 also noted that doc could be an important energy source for denitrifying bacteria in deeper soil layers and thereby reduce leaching of dissolved n forms to groundwaters in addition there are potential effects of leached doc on receiving water quality due to changes in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems through its influence on light regime energy and nutrient supply and metal toxicity evans et al 2005 there are very limited understanding and quantification of the potential effects of cover crops on cycling and losses of don and doc from soils under maize cultivation under mediterranean conditions in this study we examined the combined effects of inorganic n fertilisation and cover crop inclusions on nitrogen and carbon leaching loads din don and doc and ratios of soluble components don din don tdn and doc don from a coarse textured soil from central chile to reduce their impact on receiving water quality across agricultural landscape in central chile and similar mediterranean conditions in other places worldwide 2 material and methods 2 1 experiment description the study was conducted in a temperature controlled glasshouse 25 c on undisturbed soil columns packed in pvc tubes 0 2 m diameter 0 5 m long at the antumapu experimental station located in santiago chile 33 34 s 70 38 w the soil was taken from the antumapu experimental station and is classified as an entic haploxeroll ciren 1996 a total of 52 13 treatments 4 replicates soil columns were established and monitored over a period of august 2015 to september 2017 each soil column had a funnel at the bottom filled with quartz sand as a filter for solid particle removal a plastic tube connected the funnel with a plastic bottle 4 l that collected the deep percolating water from the soil column the first season with maize spring summer 2016 ran from october 2015 to march 2016 but samples were not taken because the soil columns were in a settling stage after the maize was harvested march 2016 dissolved n forms were measured from april 2016 until september 2016 autumn winter 1 from october 2016 until march 2017 spring summer 1 and from april 2017 until september 2017 autumn winter 2 table 1 summarizes the physio chemical properties of the soil columns studied at field level two horizons of the soil 0 42 cm and 42 50 cm were sampled and a composite soil sample of five constituent samples per horizon was collected for chemical and physical characterisation they were analysed as bulk simple sample following chilean standard methods for soil chemical sadzawka et al 2006 and physical analyses sandoval et al 2012 including soil phwater 1 2 5 by potentiometry and ph meter electrical conductivity ece in soil extract with a conductivity meter soil organic matter som by chromic acid

trials and treatments table 2 summarizes the details of the soil columns crop rotations fertilizer treatments 4 replicates and trials established to study the combined effects of inorganic n fertilisation and cover crops on maize yield and leaching of din don and doc from the soil the experiment established and studied four crop rotations namely continuous fallow continuous cover crop maize followed by fallow and maize followed by cover crop these crop rotations were grouped in two trials to compare 1 continuous fallow vs continuous cover crop and 2 maize fallow vs maize cover crop rotations the experiment further included treatments with two cover crop types i e l multiflorum and t repens and different rates in inorganic n fertilizer applications table 2 for continuous cover crops there were two rates 0 and 150 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer applied for grass crop 150 kg n ha 1 represents over fertilisation of 50 compared to the recommend n fertilization programs in chile but it is usually practised by farmers in the country for maize 250 kg n ha 1 corresponds to the optimum dose whereas 400 kg n ha 1 represents over fertilisation which is usually practised by farmers in central chile n√°jera et al 2015 in trial 2 the treatments with maize and fallow zm f had bare soil during autumn winter april 2016 september 2016 and april 2017 september 2017 while maize was cultivated during spring summer october 2015 march 2016 and october 2016 march 2017 in the treatments with maize and cover crops cover crops were growing during autumn winter april 2016 september 2016 and april 2017 september 2017 while maize was cultivated during spring summer october 2015 march 2016 and october 2016 march 2017 in the maize treatments two seeds per soil column were planted and after its emergence only the most vigorous and healthy plant was selected then maize crop management followed the common field crop practices harvesting in march each year following harvest maize stalks were shredded and incorporated into soil at 0 10 cm depth the l multiflorum lm and t repens tr were sown at doses equivalent to 35 and 5 kg ha 1 respectively in the soil columns in the mixed lm tr treatments these were seed at a proportion of 30 lm and 70 tr according to the previous mentioned doses in the maize cover crop treatments see table 2 the cover crops were harvested in september each year before next maize planting whereas in case of continuous cover crop treatments these were cut in march and september during the spring season there were applied 150 kg n ha 1 using potassium nitrate at planting in treatments lm lm150 tr tr150 zm f400 zm lm400 zm tr400 and zm lm tr400 and 250 kg n ha 1 using potassium nitrate after planting at v7 stage in zm f250 zm f400 zm lm250 zm lm400 zm tr250 zm tr400 zm lm tr250 and zm lm tr400 2 3 sampling procedure and measurements during the study period each column was irrigated weekly with 0 25 0 50 l equivalent to 8 16 mm depending on crop water demand and avoiding generation of deep percolation however deep water percolation was induced below the 50 cm soil column with an irrigation amount of 4 l equivalent to 129 mm applied to each column during both autumn winter periods to simulate an extreme rainfall event that may occurs in a mediterranean region mariani and parisi 2014 and during the spring summer period to simulate an excessive irrigation event with a furrow system that are usually applied by farmers in mediterranean central chile n√°jera et al 2015 in total there were nine excessive water application events with deep percolation three in autumn winter 2016 four in spring summer 2016 and two in autumn winter 2017 assuming a water density of 1 mg m 3 and measuring the water percolation mass precision balance the volume of percolated water in each column was weekly calculated crop evapotranspiration etc was determined as the difference between the water losses measured as deep percolation and water inputs by irrigation assuming no changes allen et al 1998 after each excess irrigation event water samples of 100 ml collected below the soil column were chilled in coolers and delivered to the laboratory for further chemical analysis the collected water samples were filtered through nitrate free filters 0 45 Œºm and the clear filtrate obtained was analysed for tdn din no3 n and nh4 n and doc within 24 h a chromotropic acid method hach kit nitraver x reagent set usa was used to determine no3 n and an ammonia salicylate method hach kit amvertm nitrogen ammonium reagent usa to determine nh4 n concentrations in the collected water samples moreover an uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr5000 usa was used to measure both din forms in the samples the doc and tdn concentrations were measured using a shimadzu toc n analyser and then don was calculated as the difference between tdn measurements and din concentrations using colorimetric methods the known column cross section 0 031 m2 was used to express the din don and doc loads in kg ha 1 calculated as the volume of the percolated water multiplied with the solute concentration measured finally samples of cover crop plant materials were collected from each soil column at the end of each period to determine total dry mass at 70 c sadzawka et al 2004 2 4 statistical analysis after testing for normality of the data collected statistical comparisons were made between the treatments studied table 2 to determine whether there were treatment effects on nitrogen and carbon leaching loads din don and doc and ratios of soluble components

the continuous cover crop treatments with the continuous bare soil treatment signifies effects of cover crops on soil water balance soil percolation and leaching of nitrogen and carbon from the soil column experiments in this comparison continuous cover crops lm lm0 lm lm150 tr tr0 and tr tr150 treatments resulted into the lower soil percolation than continuous fallow f f0 treatments during both autumn winter periods of 2016 and 2017 fig 1 considering the overall period continuous fallow yielded the highest deep percolation denoting the absence of crop evapotranspiration expressed clearly by the cropping treatments fig 2 nitrogen mineralisation was the dominant process affecting din concentrations in the soil columns under continuous fallow f f0 treatment in this case leaching of din was the main source of n losses from the soil the mean concentrations of din in soil percolation solution under continuous fallow were measured significantly higher than in the continuous cover crop treatments table 3 interestingly the measured din concentration in the soil percolation solution for the continuous t repens tr tr0 and tr tr 150 treatment was on average two to three fold higher than for the continuous l multiflorum lm lm0 and lm lm150 treatment table 3 moreover l multiflorum tended to display higher biomass than t repens this highlights that l multiflorum grass species takes up more din from the soil solution resulting in the lowest concentration of din leaching in the soil percolation solution as also found by korsaeth et al 2003 the presence of the legume t repens increased the din concentration in the soil solution through n fixation hence increased the availability and leaching of inorganic n in the soil shepherd et al 2001 reported average values of don equivalent to 8 10 kg ha 1 in the top 15 cm of several agricultural soils with 75 of n in the soil solution they also reported that even on no manure applied soils don constituted about 8 of total n losses in soil drainage from eighteen soils in a range of textures and management i e grass arable and with manure applications from uk jensen et al 1997 reported a don range of 8 30 kg ha 1 for sandy soils in denmark and mcneill et al 1998 reported a don range of 2 26 mg kg 1 during summer in soils under either continuous wheat or pasture in the western australia in this study the unfertilised cover crop treatments resulted the highest don concentrations in soil percolation followed by the fertilised cover crop treatments table 3 in addition the treatments including l multiflorum had higher don concentrations values than the t repens treatments tr tr0 and tr tr150 with only non detectable don levels in f f0 table 3 these results are within the range of values 0 7 to 3 1 mg l 1 reported in a review of don leaching from pasture systems van kessel et al 2009 however our study and some european experiments sj√∂berg et al 2003 on forest soils show a general trend for don leaching to decrease with increasing n fertilizer input table 3 this is in contrast to observations in northern hardwood and pine forest under increased atmospheric deposition of n in usa mcdowell et al 2004 pregitzer et al 2004 our results suggest that inorganic n fertilisation favoured mineralisation of organic n forms in the soil this is supported by the fact that the treatments with a cover crop and normal n fertilisation lm lm150 and tr tr150 showed significantly lower don concentrations than the corresponding treatments without n fertilisation lm lm0 and tr tr0 table 3 the continuous fallow f f0 treatment received no organic n during the study period which may explain its non detectable don concentrations table 3 the effects of cover crops were not observed that significant in terms of doc concentrations measured in the soil percolation table 3 however the treatment with t repens without n fertilisation tr tr0 showed the highest doc concentration while the continuous fallow treatment showed the lowest doc concentration table 3 in the cover crop treatments the doc concentration in leachate did not show a clear tendency probably due to the short study period 2 years similar to don losses the continuous fallow treatment had the lowest doc concentrations which may be related to the lack of organic matter addition during the study period in addition under continuous fallow bare soil no root exudates were produced which may explain the lower doc concentrations in continuous fallow treatment vinther et al 2006 table 4 summarizes the effects of different treatments on different solute leaching loads integrating the effects on soil percolation and solute concentrations in soil percolation the soil columns the continuous fallow treatment resulted the highest din loads whereas the treatments with l multiflorum lm lm0 and lm lm150 had the lowest din loads table 4 this was the combined effect of lower soil percolation fig 2 and lower din concentrations table 3 measured in the l multiflorum treatments the din load was significantly higher in t repens than in l multiflorum treatments in contrast the treatments with l multiflorum showed the highest don loads whereas the fallow showed the lowest don loads this may be explained by l multiflorum producing more above ground biomass and root biomass than t repens therefore l multiflorum had higher din uptake and don production in the soil columns than t repens as a result in l multiflorum the don load increased in proportion to the greater litter production and microbial processing of soil organic n dijkstra et al 2007 l multiflorum resulted an average don leaching load that was twice the din load table 4 treatments f f0 continuous fallow and lm lm150 also had the highest doc loads with significant differences compared with the t repens treatments the treatments with l multiflorum showed significantly higher don din and don tdn ratio and lower doc don ratio than the other treatments this is possibly because don is linked to doc load by sharing the same origin of organic matter wohlfart et al 2012 we found that in bare soil the amount of doc leaching was 16 fold higher than the don leaching which suggests that if an agricultural soil is fallow for a short time 2 years the lack of organic matter turnover in soil and root exudates reduce the amount of don leaching more rapidly than the doc leaching 3 2 trial 2 percolation and leaching of din don and doc in maize cover crop rotations trial 2 assessed the effects of including cover crops as maize cover crop rotations and fertilization rates on soil water balance soil percolation and leaching of n and c from the soil column experiments during the autumn winter seasons of 2016 and 2017 the maize cover crop treatments that included l multiflorum zm lm250 zm lm400 zm lm tr250 and zm lm tr400 resulted into lower soil percolation than the treatments with fallow and t repens fig 3 however during the spring summer 2016 when a maize crop was present in all treatments there was no clear tendency in soil percolation except that the lowest percolation occurred in the treatment that received excess n zm f400 fig 3 which was associate with a high maize biomass growth data not shown overall the treatments that included l multiflorum zm lm250 zm lm tr250 and zm lm tr400 resulted into lower soil percolation than the treatments with fallow and t repens zm tr250 and zm tr400 over the study period from april 2016 to september 2017 fig 4 considering the amount of water applied and soil percolation measured our result suggest that maize cultivation treatments with l multiflorum showed higher evapotranspiration than the fallow and t repens treatments due to higher biomass growth during autumn winter period fig 4 inclusion of cover crops as maize cover crop rotations and fertilization rates had significant effect on mean concentrations of din don and doc during the study period table 3 as expected excessive n fertilizer application 400 kg n ha 1 increased the din concentrations in leachate but the increase was only significant on zm tr400 table 3 huang et al 2011 found that when fertilisation was increased from 0 to 360 kg n ha 1 in a wheat maize crop rotation in china the din concentration in leachate increased from 8 to 104 mg n l 1 in the present study the maize cultivation with excessive n fertilization and t repens as a cover crop zm tr400 resulted into the highest din concentration while the maize cultivation with optimal n fertilization and l multiflorum as a cover crop zm lm250 resulted into the lowest din concentration leaching from the soil columns table 3 as discussed above in trial 1 the l multiflorum grass species takes up more din from the soil solution resulting into the lowest concentration of din leaching in the soil percolation solution korsaeth et al 2003 however some treatments with l multiflorum zm lm250 and zm lm tr400 showed the highest don concentrations in leachate 6 mg l 1 table 3 with significant differences compared with the other treatments huang et al 2011 have reported don concentrations ranging from 0 8 to 6 0 mg l 1 in leachate from winter wheat summer maize double cropping systems in the north china we did not find any effect of the n fertilisation dose applied to the maize crop in spring on don concentrations which suggest that most of the no3 n was either uptake by the maize or lost by leaching other possible explanation is that microbial consumption of no3 was not an important process in controlling soil no3 n concentrations in the soil shi and norton 2000 then the don concentration was not affected by the no3 n microbial assimilation and decomposition as in trial 1 in the winter cover crops the treatments with l multiflorum had higher above ground biomass than the t repens table 3 which suggests that l multiflorum had greater root biomass in the soil this greater belowground biomass presumably favoured organic matter inputs to soil during autumn winter which resulted in higher don concentrations in the soil solution and a higher risk of don leaching another possible explanation is that much of the don leached below the rooting zone in l multiflorum treatments was recalcitrant and largely unavailable for plants and soil microorganisms delgado baquerizo et al 2011 found that don dominates over din in terms of concentrations on soils for most plant communities in winter while the opposite occurs in summer in mediterranean ecosystems they also noted that plant canopies generating higher litter and organic matter accumulation beneath plants might explain the higher don concentration in soil also dijkstra et al 2007 found that don leaching increased with greater litter production and microbial processing of soil organic n in grasslands in usa similar to don losses the crop rotation with maize excess n fertilization and a cover crop mix l multiflorum t repens treatment zm lm tr400 resulted into significantly highest doc concentration in soil percolation from the soil columns table 3 in the other maize cover crop treatments the doc concentration in soil percolation did not show a clear tendency probably due to the short study period 2 years table 4 summarizes the estimates of leaching loads of din don and doc from different maize cover crop rotations and fertilization treatments over the study period the maize cultivation with excessive n fertilization and a cover crop mix l multiflorum t repens treatment i e zm lm tr400 resulted into the highest din load 227 kg ha 1 whereas maize cultivation with optimal n fertilization and cover crop l multiflorum treatment i e zm lm250 resulted into the lowest din load 82 kg ha 1 from the soil columns table 4 in treatment zm lm250 the low din loads were related mainly to the combined effects of lowest soil deep percolation fig 4 generated by higher evapotranspiration by the cover crop during autumn winter and optimum maize n fertilisation during spring summer leading to lowest din concentrations in the soil percolation table 3 in contrast treatment zm lm250 showed the highest don loads because it had the highest don concentrations in the soil percolation the treatment zm lm tr400 had the highest doc loads table 4 due to having the highest doc concentrations in the soil percolation table 3 overall the zm lm250 treatment showed significant higher don din and don tdn ratio and lower doc don ratio than the other treatments whereas the rotations with fallow zm f250 and zm f400 showed the lowest don din and don tdn ratio and the highest doc don ratio vinther et al 2006 noted that fresh younger organic matter produced during recent years contributes more to the dissolved pools of organic c and n than the old humus fraction of the soil which may explain why cover crop treatments showed higher don leaching than bare soil similar to trial 1 in trial 2 we found that including a fallow period and the associated lack of organic additions to soil decreased the amount of don leaching more rapidly than the doc leaching in soil percolation from the soil columns it is clear that this study evaluated the worst possible scenarios favouring din leaching i e a coarse textured soil extremely high intensity precipitation or irrigation events with application of 129 mm and excess n applied 400 kg n ha1 however the results supports the earlier findings of a potential risk of din leaching due to excessive n fertilisation for maize cultivation which can result in substantial n leaching losses under high intensity precipitation and excessive irrigation in central chile salazar et al 2014 corradini et al 2015 salazar et al 2017 this could be addressed by inclusion of a cover crop l multiflorum and optimal n fertilisation treatment i e zm lm250 for maize cultivation on coarse textured soils in central chile the inclusion of cover crops however could lead to an increase in leaching of don and doc in the soil percolation table 4 if leached don moves through the soil and is mineralised below the rooting depth it will also contribute to the tdn load but if mineralised within the rooting depth it may eventually contribute to the soil n supply to the crop the leached doc could be an important energy source for denitrifying bacteria in deeper soil layers and thereby reduce leaching of dissolved n forms to groundwaters vinther et al 2006 therefore further information is required for effects of cover crops on the mobility and degradability of don and doc pools and their fate in the deeper soil layers under maize cover crop rotations in central chile while much research has been devoted to quantifying the amount and flux of dissolved organic nutrients in freshwater and marine systems less has been performed on soils the findings of this study and further research in leaching and fate of don as an n sink in agricultural production systems will be crucial to improve our farm management and cultivation practices to help reduce their environmental impacts on receiving waters across agricultural landscapes 4 conclusions the study clearly shows that inclusion of cover crops in maize cultivation had significant effects on cycling and losses of din don and doc from a coarse textured soil column experiment using the soil column experiments we found that inclusion of a grass cover crop l multiflorum and optimal n fertilisation 250 kg n ha 1 treatment resulted into lower din losses from maize cultivation on a coarse textured soil in trial 1 we found that inclusion of a continuous grass cover crop l multiflorum resulted into the don loading as the dominant form of nitrogen leaching on average 65 of tdn loading while inclusion of a continuous legume cover crop t repens or fallow the don leaching load was an order of magnitude lower than the din load from the soil columns we also found that when an agricultural soil is under fallow the lack of turnover of organic matter in soil and root exudates reduces don leaching more rapidly than doc leaching giving lower don din and don tdn load ratios but higher doc don load ratio than cover cropping in the short time scale as studied here 2 years in trial 2 we found that a crop rotation with maize excessive n fertilization 400 kg n ha 1 and inclusion of a legume cover crop t repens showed the highest din leaching load whereas a crop rotation with maize optimal n fertilisation 250 kg n ha 1 and a grass cover crop l multiflorum had the lowest din loads from the soil columns however the latter treatment had significantly higher don loads 16 of tdn loads than all other maize fallow treatments overall the rotation with maize optimal n fertilisation 250 kg n ha 1 and a grass cover crop l multiflorum generated the lowest amount of tdn leaching from the soil columns we recommend this to be further studied in field conditions as a best management practice for reducing the risk of diffuse pollution

11273,protection and management of water quality across agricultural landscapes requires a sound understanding of runoff and or leaching of nutrients and other agrichemicals from agricultural production systems to receiving waters we in a large leaching columns experiment studied the losses of dissolved organic n don dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic n din and total dissolved n tdn from maize cultivation on a coarse textured soil in in mediterranean central chile the combined effects of cover crops and inorganic n fertilisation rates were evaluated on nitrogen and carbon leaching loads din don and doc and ratios of soluble components don din don tdn and doc don a total of 52 soil columns for 13 treatments 4 replicates were established to evaluate leaching of dissolved n and c forms from 1 continuous bare soil fallow compared with a continuous cover crop lolium multiflorum or trifolium repens with 0 or 150 kg n ha 1 applied and 2 maize fallow and maize cover crop rotations with two different n doses 250 or 400 kg n ha 1 for the maize and cover crops l multiflorum and or t repens we found that inclusion of a grass cover crop l multiflorum and optimal n fertilisation 250 kg n ha 1 treatment resulted into lower din losses from the study columns however in trial 1 the don load from the treatments with continuous grass cover crop l multiflorum was on average twice the din load in trial 2 the crop rotation of maize cultivation with 400 kg n ha 1 applied and inclusion of a legume cover crop t repens resulted into the highest din loads while a crop rotation of maize with 250 kg n ha 1 applied and inclusion of a grass cover crop l multiflorum had the lowest din loads however the latter rotation gave significantly higher don loads than the maize fallow treatments in trials 1 and 2 inclusion of l multiflorum enhanced soil organic pools and microbial activity and thus increased the amount of don and doc susceptible to leaching overall the rotation with maize with 250 kg n ha 1 applied and l multiflorum as cover crop generated the lowest amount of tdn leaching from the soil columns we recommend this to be further studied in field conditions as a best management practice for reducing the risk of diffuse pollution of surface water bodies and groundwater from maize cultivation in mediterranean central chile keywords agriculture water quality diffuse pollution soil percolation nitrogen and carbon loads 1 introduction protection and management of water quality across agricultural landscapes requires a sound understanding of runoff and or leaching of nutrients and other agrichemicals from agricultural production systems to receiving waters dissolved inorganic nitrogen din forms such as nitrate no3 n and ammonium nh4 n have been identified as the main forms of nitrogen n leaching in agricultural systems galloway et al 2008 vitousek et al 2009 salazar et al 2013 however recent studies include dissolved organic n don leaching as another important n loss pathway from agroecosystems abaas et al 2012 mcgovern et al 2014 scott and rothstein 2014 according to van kessel et al 2009 it has been known for more than 125 years that don leaching losses occur from agricultural fields but most n loss studies on agricultural systems have not measured don as a potential pathway jones et al 2004 concluded that don is an important soluble n pool within total dissolved nitrogen tdn in soil and although its full ecological significance remains unknown they recommend measuring don on a routine basis alongside measurements of din losses from agricultural soils dissolved organic n losses could explain a large fraction of the missing nitrogen in n budgets pujo pay and conan 2003 for example van kessel et al 2009 and manninen et al 2018 reported that on average don leaching losses are equivalent to one third of total dissolved n tdn losses from cultivated soil including grassland pasture and cereals from europe recently several studies have been carried out investigating leaching of don from soils under forest kiikkil√§ et al 2013 campbell et al 2014 and grassland necpalova et al 2012 riaz et al 2012 hoeft et al 2014 however only a few studies has focused on investigating losses of don from arable soils macdonald et al 2016 manninen et al 2018 particularly in the mediterranean climatic conditions to the authors knowledge there are few studies published to date investigating don content on soils under mediterranean conditions for instance the studies carried out in plant communities in spain delgado baquerizo et al 2011 and vineyard in greece christou et al 2006 neff et al 2003 noted that don contains a mixture of recalcitrant and labile compounds with substantial and very different roles in terrestrial biochemistry which may affect the n balance in soil in two ways firstly it can enable a short circuit in the terrestrial n cycle whereby plants absorb some don forms directly from the soil solution without the need for microbial mineralisation in soil n√§sholm et al 2009 secondly it may represent a significant n loss when plants and edaphic microorganisms cannot assimilate available don in the soil solution with some forms of don being flushed from ecosystems during rapid n leaching neff et al 2003 as mentioned above the latter has been widely demonstrated for forest kiikkil√§ et al 2013 campbell et al 2014 and grassland ecosystems necpalova et al 2012 riaz et al 2012 hoeft et al 2014 but it has not been properly investigated and quantified in agricultural soils thus it is important to evaluate the potential effects on don pools and crop production caused by excessive don leaching in agricultural soils for instance ros et al 2009 noted that after n fertiliser application to soils changes in n flux can occur through the don pools however there are still many gaps in our understanding of the significance of don in agricultural production systems as a potential pathway for n losses murphy et al 2000 the impact of don losses from agricultural soils on water quality has recently been shown in different studies where don in surface waters was related to the surrounding area of agricultural land rasmussen et al 2008 bartley et al 2012 wohlfart et al 2012 evans et al 2014 at the catchment level agricultural fields have been linked to increase don export mattsson et al 2009 with the increase suggested to originate from intensive farming practices mattsson et al 2005 van kessel et al 2009 concluded that leaching of don from agricultural soils into surface water leads to eutrophication and acidification on the other hand worrall et al 2004 noted that the removal of doc from water sources represents one of the major costs to water treatment in large parts of britain therefore a better understanding and quantification of don and doc leaching from agricultural soils would help minimise its losses and effects on agricultural production and receiving water quality in the mediterranean zone of chile there is a serious risk of diffuse pollution of surface water bodies and groundwater due to excessive applications of n fertilizers for maize zea mays under irrigation fuentes et al 2014 corradini et al 2015 n√°jera et al 2015 this is a particular concern in areas with coarse textured soils which are more prone to n leaching due to low water holding capacity casanova et al 2013 these concerns also extend to other mediterranean climate regions of the world where irrigated maize fields with high n doses represent a high risk of creating diffuse n pollution areas isidoro et al 2006 berenguer et al 2009 salmer√≥n et al 2011 simeonova et al 2017 establishment of cover crops during the intercropping period of maize replacing bare fallows in these mediterranean zones has been proposed to counteract the negative impacts of din leaching or diffuse pollution from irrigated maize fields salmer√≥n et al 2011 gabriel and quemada 2011 gabriel et al 2012 however most soils in such agroecosystems are depleted of their antecedent soil organic carbon soc pool and inclusion of cover crops can enhance soc pool and microbial activity lal 2013 hence increasing the risk of don leaching due to higher total inputs of n van kessel et al 2009 another important consideration is that cover crop species e g grasses poaceae or legumes fabaceae used in a crop rotation may influence the don din ratio but their impact on don leaching is particularly poorly understood moreover because plant residues from a winter legume included as a cover crop are rapidly decomposed wagger et al 1998 it is well known that this may increase soc and organic n there is a risk of this organic n leaching from the system if its release from cover crop residues and the n organic mineralisation is not synchronised with the n requirements of the following crop gentry et al 2013 however the components of dissolved organic matter dom don and dissolved organic carbon doc are directly associated in soil water systems vinther et al 2006 reported higher losses of doc by leaching from cover crops than from bare soil in denmark vinther et al 2006 also noted that doc could be an important energy source for denitrifying bacteria in deeper soil layers and thereby reduce leaching of dissolved n forms to groundwaters in addition there are potential effects of leached doc on receiving water quality due to changes in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems through its influence on light regime energy and nutrient supply and metal toxicity evans et al 2005 there are very limited understanding and quantification of the potential effects of cover crops on cycling and losses of don and doc from soils under maize cultivation under mediterranean conditions in this study we examined the combined effects of inorganic n fertilisation and cover crop inclusions on nitrogen and carbon leaching loads din don and doc and ratios of soluble components don din don tdn and doc don from a coarse textured soil from central chile to reduce their impact on receiving water quality across agricultural landscape in central chile and similar mediterranean conditions in other places worldwide 2 material and methods 2 1 experiment description the study was conducted in a temperature controlled glasshouse 25 c on undisturbed soil columns packed in pvc tubes 0 2 m diameter 0 5 m long at the antumapu experimental station located in santiago chile 33 34 s 70 38 w the soil was taken from the antumapu experimental station and is classified as an entic haploxeroll ciren 1996 a total of 52 13 treatments 4 replicates soil columns were established and monitored over a period of august 2015 to september 2017 each soil column had a funnel at the bottom filled with quartz sand as a filter for solid particle removal a plastic tube connected the funnel with a plastic bottle 4 l that collected the deep percolating water from the soil column the first season with maize spring summer 2016 ran from october 2015 to march 2016 but samples were not taken because the soil columns were in a settling stage after the maize was harvested march 2016 dissolved n forms were measured from april 2016 until september 2016 autumn winter 1 from october 2016 until march 2017 spring summer 1 and from april 2017 until september 2017 autumn winter 2 table 1 summarizes the physio chemical properties of the soil columns studied at field level two horizons of the soil 0 42 cm and 42 50 cm were sampled and a composite soil sample of five constituent samples per horizon was collected for chemical and physical characterisation they were analysed as bulk simple sample following chilean standard methods for soil chemical sadzawka et al 2006 and physical analyses sandoval et al 2012 including soil phwater 1 2 5 by potentiometry and ph meter electrical conductivity ece in soil extract with a conductivity meter soil organic matter som by chromic acid

trials and treatments table 2 summarizes the details of the soil columns crop rotations fertilizer treatments 4 replicates and trials established to study the combined effects of inorganic n fertilisation and cover crops on maize yield and leaching of din don and doc from the soil the experiment established and studied four crop rotations namely continuous fallow continuous cover crop maize followed by fallow and maize followed by cover crop these crop rotations were grouped in two trials to compare 1 continuous fallow vs continuous cover crop and 2 maize fallow vs maize cover crop rotations the experiment further included treatments with two cover crop types i e l multiflorum and t repens and different rates in inorganic n fertilizer applications table 2 for continuous cover crops there were two rates 0 and 150 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer applied for grass crop 150 kg n ha 1 represents over fertilisation of 50 compared to the recommend n fertilization programs in chile but it is usually practised by farmers in the country for maize 250 kg n ha 1 corresponds to the optimum dose whereas 400 kg n ha 1 represents over fertilisation which is usually practised by farmers in central chile n√°jera et al 2015 in trial 2 the treatments with maize and fallow zm f had bare soil during autumn winter april 2016 september 2016 and april 2017 september 2017 while maize was cultivated during spring summer october 2015 march 2016 and october 2016 march 2017 in the treatments with maize and cover crops cover crops were growing during autumn winter april 2016 september 2016 and april 2017 september 2017 while maize was cultivated during spring summer october 2015 march 2016 and october 2016 march 2017 in the maize treatments two seeds per soil column were planted and after its emergence only the most vigorous and healthy plant was selected then maize crop management followed the common field crop practices harvesting in march each year following harvest maize stalks were shredded and incorporated into soil at 0 10 cm depth the l multiflorum lm and t repens tr were sown at doses equivalent to 35 and 5 kg ha 1 respectively in the soil columns in the mixed lm tr treatments these were seed at a proportion of 30 lm and 70 tr according to the previous mentioned doses in the maize cover crop treatments see table 2 the cover crops were harvested in september each year before next maize planting whereas in case of continuous cover crop treatments these were cut in march and september during the spring season there were applied 150 kg n ha 1 using potassium nitrate at planting in treatments lm lm150 tr tr150 zm f400 zm lm400 zm tr400 and zm lm tr400 and 250 kg n ha 1 using potassium nitrate after planting at v7 stage in zm f250 zm f400 zm lm250 zm lm400 zm tr250 zm tr400 zm lm tr250 and zm lm tr400 2 3 sampling procedure and measurements during the study period each column was irrigated weekly with 0 25 0 50 l equivalent to 8 16 mm depending on crop water demand and avoiding generation of deep percolation however deep water percolation was induced below the 50 cm soil column with an irrigation amount of 4 l equivalent to 129 mm applied to each column during both autumn winter periods to simulate an extreme rainfall event that may occurs in a mediterranean region mariani and parisi 2014 and during the spring summer period to simulate an excessive irrigation event with a furrow system that are usually applied by farmers in mediterranean central chile n√°jera et al 2015 in total there were nine excessive water application events with deep percolation three in autumn winter 2016 four in spring summer 2016 and two in autumn winter 2017 assuming a water density of 1 mg m 3 and measuring the water percolation mass precision balance the volume of percolated water in each column was weekly calculated crop evapotranspiration etc was determined as the difference between the water losses measured as deep percolation and water inputs by irrigation assuming no changes allen et al 1998 after each excess irrigation event water samples of 100 ml collected below the soil column were chilled in coolers and delivered to the laboratory for further chemical analysis the collected water samples were filtered through nitrate free filters 0 45 Œºm and the clear filtrate obtained was analysed for tdn din no3 n and nh4 n and doc within 24 h a chromotropic acid method hach kit nitraver x reagent set usa was used to determine no3 n and an ammonia salicylate method hach kit amvertm nitrogen ammonium reagent usa to determine nh4 n concentrations in the collected water samples moreover an uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr5000 usa was used to measure both din forms in the samples the doc and tdn concentrations were measured using a shimadzu toc n analyser and then don was calculated as the difference between tdn measurements and din concentrations using colorimetric methods the known column cross section 0 031 m2 was used to express the din don and doc loads in kg ha 1 calculated as the volume of the percolated water multiplied with the solute concentration measured finally samples of cover crop plant materials were collected from each soil column at the end of each period to determine total dry mass at 70 c sadzawka et al 2004 2 4 statistical analysis after testing for normality of the data collected statistical comparisons were made between the treatments studied table 2 to determine whether there were treatment effects on nitrogen and carbon leaching loads din don and doc and ratios of soluble components

the continuous cover crop treatments with the continuous bare soil treatment signifies effects of cover crops on soil water balance soil percolation and leaching of nitrogen and carbon from the soil column experiments in this comparison continuous cover crops lm lm0 lm lm150 tr tr0 and tr tr150 treatments resulted into the lower soil percolation than continuous fallow f f0 treatments during both autumn winter periods of 2016 and 2017 fig 1 considering the overall period continuous fallow yielded the highest deep percolation denoting the absence of crop evapotranspiration expressed clearly by the cropping treatments fig 2 nitrogen mineralisation was the dominant process affecting din concentrations in the soil columns under continuous fallow f f0 treatment in this case leaching of din was the main source of n losses from the soil the mean concentrations of din in soil percolation solution under continuous fallow were measured significantly higher than in the continuous cover crop treatments table 3 interestingly the measured din concentration in the soil percolation solution for the continuous t repens tr tr0 and tr tr 150 treatment was on average two to three fold higher than for the continuous l multiflorum lm lm0 and lm lm150 treatment table 3 moreover l multiflorum tended to display higher biomass than t repens this highlights that l multiflorum grass species takes up more din from the soil solution resulting in the lowest concentration of din leaching in the soil percolation solution as also found by korsaeth et al 2003 the presence of the legume t repens increased the din concentration in the soil solution through n fixation hence increased the availability and leaching of inorganic n in the soil shepherd et al 2001 reported average values of don equivalent to 8 10 kg ha 1 in the top 15 cm of several agricultural soils with 75 of n in the soil solution they also reported that even on no manure applied soils don constituted about 8 of total n losses in soil drainage from eighteen soils in a range of textures and management i e grass arable and with manure applications from uk jensen et al 1997 reported a don range of 8 30 kg ha 1 for sandy soils in denmark and mcneill et al 1998 reported a don range of 2 26 mg kg 1 during summer in soils under either continuous wheat or pasture in the western australia in this study the unfertilised cover crop treatments resulted the highest don concentrations in soil percolation followed by the fertilised cover crop treatments table 3 in addition the treatments including l multiflorum had higher don concentrations values than the t repens treatments tr tr0 and tr tr150 with only non detectable don levels in f f0 table 3 these results are within the range of values 0 7 to 3 1 mg l 1 reported in a review of don leaching from pasture systems van kessel et al 2009 however our study and some european experiments sj√∂berg et al 2003 on forest soils show a general trend for don leaching to decrease with increasing n fertilizer input table 3 this is in contrast to observations in northern hardwood and pine forest under increased atmospheric deposition of n in usa mcdowell et al 2004 pregitzer et al 2004 our results suggest that inorganic n fertilisation favoured mineralisation of organic n forms in the soil this is supported by the fact that the treatments with a cover crop and normal n fertilisation lm lm150 and tr tr150 showed significantly lower don concentrations than the corresponding treatments without n fertilisation lm lm0 and tr tr0 table 3 the continuous fallow f f0 treatment received no organic n during the study period which may explain its non detectable don concentrations table 3 the effects of cover crops were not observed that significant in terms of doc concentrations measured in the soil percolation table 3 however the treatment with t repens without n fertilisation tr tr0 showed the highest doc concentration while the continuous fallow treatment showed the lowest doc concentration table 3 in the cover crop treatments the doc concentration in leachate did not show a clear tendency probably due to the short study period 2 years similar to don losses the continuous fallow treatment had the lowest doc concentrations which may be related to the lack of organic matter addition during the study period in addition under continuous fallow bare soil no root exudates were produced which may explain the lower doc concentrations in continuous fallow treatment vinther et al 2006 table 4 summarizes the effects of different treatments on different solute leaching loads integrating the effects on soil percolation and solute concentrations in soil percolation the soil columns the continuous fallow treatment resulted the highest din loads whereas the treatments with l multiflorum lm lm0 and lm lm150 had the lowest din loads table 4 this was the combined effect of lower soil percolation fig 2 and lower din concentrations table 3 measured in the l multiflorum treatments the din load was significantly higher in t repens than in l multiflorum treatments in contrast the treatments with l multiflorum showed the highest don loads whereas the fallow showed the lowest don loads this may be explained by l multiflorum producing more above ground biomass and root biomass than t repens therefore l multiflorum had higher din uptake and don production in the soil columns than t repens as a result in l multiflorum the don load increased in proportion to the greater litter production and microbial processing of soil organic n dijkstra et al 2007 l multiflorum resulted an average don leaching load that was twice the din load table 4 treatments f f0 continuous fallow and lm lm150 also had the highest doc loads with significant differences compared with the t repens treatments the treatments with l multiflorum showed significantly higher don din and don tdn ratio and lower doc don ratio than the other treatments this is possibly because don is linked to doc load by sharing the same origin of organic matter wohlfart et al 2012 we found that in bare soil the amount of doc leaching was 16 fold higher than the don leaching which suggests that if an agricultural soil is fallow for a short time 2 years the lack of organic matter turnover in soil and root exudates reduce the amount of don leaching more rapidly than the doc leaching 3 2 trial 2 percolation and leaching of din don and doc in maize cover crop rotations trial 2 assessed the effects of including cover crops as maize cover crop rotations and fertilization rates on soil water balance soil percolation and leaching of n and c from the soil column experiments during the autumn winter seasons of 2016 and 2017 the maize cover crop treatments that included l multiflorum zm lm250 zm lm400 zm lm tr250 and zm lm tr400 resulted into lower soil percolation than the treatments with fallow and t repens fig 3 however during the spring summer 2016 when a maize crop was present in all treatments there was no clear tendency in soil percolation except that the lowest percolation occurred in the treatment that received excess n zm f400 fig 3 which was associate with a high maize biomass growth data not shown overall the treatments that included l multiflorum zm lm250 zm lm tr250 and zm lm tr400 resulted into lower soil percolation than the treatments with fallow and t repens zm tr250 and zm tr400 over the study period from april 2016 to september 2017 fig 4 considering the amount of water applied and soil percolation measured our result suggest that maize cultivation treatments with l multiflorum showed higher evapotranspiration than the fallow and t repens treatments due to higher biomass growth during autumn winter period fig 4 inclusion of cover crops as maize cover crop rotations and fertilization rates had significant effect on mean concentrations of din don and doc during the study period table 3 as expected excessive n fertilizer application 400 kg n ha 1 increased the din concentrations in leachate but the increase was only significant on zm tr400 table 3 huang et al 2011 found that when fertilisation was increased from 0 to 360 kg n ha 1 in a wheat maize crop rotation in china the din concentration in leachate increased from 8 to 104 mg n l 1 in the present study the maize cultivation with excessive n fertilization and t repens as a cover crop zm tr400 resulted into the highest din concentration while the maize cultivation with optimal n fertilization and l multiflorum as a cover crop zm lm250 resulted into the lowest din concentration leaching from the soil columns table 3 as discussed above in trial 1 the l multiflorum grass species takes up more din from the soil solution resulting into the lowest concentration of din leaching in the soil percolation solution korsaeth et al 2003 however some treatments with l multiflorum zm lm250 and zm lm tr400 showed the highest don concentrations in leachate 6 mg l 1 table 3 with significant differences compared with the other treatments huang et al 2011 have reported don concentrations ranging from 0 8 to 6 0 mg l 1 in leachate from winter wheat summer maize double cropping systems in the north china we did not find any effect of the n fertilisation dose applied to the maize crop in spring on don concentrations which suggest that most of the no3 n was either uptake by the maize or lost by leaching other possible explanation is that microbial consumption of no3 was not an important process in controlling soil no3 n concentrations in the soil shi and norton 2000 then the don concentration was not affected by the no3 n microbial assimilation and decomposition as in trial 1 in the winter cover crops the treatments with l multiflorum had higher above ground biomass than the t repens table 3 which suggests that l multiflorum had greater root biomass in the soil this greater belowground biomass presumably favoured organic matter inputs to soil during autumn winter which resulted in higher don concentrations in the soil solution and a higher risk of don leaching another possible explanation is that much of the don leached below the rooting zone in l multiflorum treatments was recalcitrant and largely unavailable for plants and soil microorganisms delgado baquerizo et al 2011 found that don dominates over din in terms of concentrations on soils for most plant communities in winter while the opposite occurs in summer in mediterranean ecosystems they also noted that plant canopies generating higher litter and organic matter accumulation beneath plants might explain the higher don concentration in soil also dijkstra et al 2007 found that don leaching increased with greater litter production and microbial processing of soil organic n in grasslands in usa similar to don losses the crop rotation with maize excess n fertilization and a cover crop mix l multiflorum t repens treatment zm lm tr400 resulted into significantly highest doc concentration in soil percolation from the soil columns table 3 in the other maize cover crop treatments the doc concentration in soil percolation did not show a clear tendency probably due to the short study period 2 years table 4 summarizes the estimates of leaching loads of din don and doc from different maize cover crop rotations and fertilization treatments over the study period the maize cultivation with excessive n fertilization and a cover crop mix l multiflorum t repens treatment i e zm lm tr400 resulted into the highest din load 227 kg ha 1 whereas maize cultivation with optimal n fertilization and cover crop l multiflorum treatment i e zm lm250 resulted into the lowest din load 82 kg ha 1 from the soil columns table 4 in treatment zm lm250 the low din loads were related mainly to the combined effects of lowest soil deep percolation fig 4 generated by higher evapotranspiration by the cover crop during autumn winter and optimum maize n fertilisation during spring summer leading to lowest din concentrations in the soil percolation table 3 in contrast treatment zm lm250 showed the highest don loads because it had the highest don concentrations in the soil percolation the treatment zm lm tr400 had the highest doc loads table 4 due to having the highest doc concentrations in the soil percolation table 3 overall the zm lm250 treatment showed significant higher don din and don tdn ratio and lower doc don ratio than the other treatments whereas the rotations with fallow zm f250 and zm f400 showed the lowest don din and don tdn ratio and the highest doc don ratio vinther et al 2006 noted that fresh younger organic matter produced during recent years contributes more to the dissolved pools of organic c and n than the old humus fraction of the soil which may explain why cover crop treatments showed higher don leaching than bare soil similar to trial 1 in trial 2 we found that including a fallow period and the associated lack of organic additions to soil decreased the amount of don leaching more rapidly than the doc leaching in soil percolation from the soil columns it is clear that this study evaluated the worst possible scenarios favouring din leaching i e a coarse textured soil extremely high intensity precipitation or irrigation events with application of 129 mm and excess n applied 400 kg n ha1 however the results supports the earlier findings of a potential risk of din leaching due to excessive n fertilisation for maize cultivation which can result in substantial n leaching losses under high intensity precipitation and excessive irrigation in central chile salazar et al 2014 corradini et al 2015 salazar et al 2017 this could be addressed by inclusion of a cover crop l multiflorum and optimal n fertilisation treatment i e zm lm250 for maize cultivation on coarse textured soils in central chile the inclusion of cover crops however could lead to an increase in leaching of don and doc in the soil percolation table 4 if leached don moves through the soil and is mineralised below the rooting depth it will also contribute to the tdn load but if mineralised within the rooting depth it may eventually contribute to the soil n supply to the crop the leached doc could be an important energy source for denitrifying bacteria in deeper soil layers and thereby reduce leaching of dissolved n forms to groundwaters vinther et al 2006 therefore further information is required for effects of cover crops on the mobility and degradability of don and doc pools and their fate in the deeper soil layers under maize cover crop rotations in central chile while much research has been devoted to quantifying the amount and flux of dissolved organic nutrients in freshwater and marine systems less has been performed on soils the findings of this study and further research in leaching and fate of don as an n sink in agricultural production systems will be crucial to improve our farm management and cultivation practices to help reduce their environmental impacts on receiving waters across agricultural landscapes 4 conclusions the study clearly shows that inclusion of cover crops in maize cultivation had significant effects on cycling and losses of din don and doc from a coarse textured soil column experiment using the soil column experiments we found that inclusion of a grass cover crop l multiflorum and optimal n fertilisation 250 kg n ha 1 treatment resulted into lower din losses from maize cultivation on a coarse textured soil in trial 1 we found that inclusion of a continuous grass cover crop l multiflorum resulted into the don loading as the dominant form of nitrogen leaching on average 65 of tdn loading while inclusion of a continuous legume cover crop t repens or fallow the don leaching load was an order of magnitude lower than the din load from the soil columns we also found that when an agricultural soil is under fallow the lack of turnover of organic matter in soil and root exudates reduces don leaching more rapidly than doc leaching giving lower don din and don tdn load ratios but higher doc don load ratio than cover cropping in the short time scale as studied here 2 years in trial 2 we found that a crop rotation with maize excessive n fertilization 400 kg n ha 1 and inclusion of a legume cover crop t repens showed the highest din leaching load whereas a crop rotation with maize optimal n fertilisation 250 kg n ha 1 and a grass cover crop l multiflorum had the lowest din loads from the soil columns however the latter treatment had significantly higher don loads 16 of tdn loads than all other maize fallow treatments overall the rotation with maize optimal n fertilisation 250 kg n ha 1 and a grass cover crop l multiflorum generated the lowest amount of tdn leaching from the soil columns we recommend this to be further studied in field conditions as a best management practice for reducing the risk of diffuse pollution

opportunities to avoid accumulation of no3 in soils the aim was to integrate data from reported studies at a regional scale in order to develop strategies to control soil no3 accumulation in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of data the data used in this study were extracted from the literature between 1990 and 2016 that reported post harvest soil no3 concentrations in wheat and maize

most of the data were from wheat maize rotation studies the analysis of irrigation management rainfall and soil properties was conducted for the wheat maize rotation system and not for individual crops within the system this was not the case for exploring the effects of fertilizer application method and fertilizer type where all cropping systems were used as data were not sufficient for the wheat maize rotation to unify data and eliminate background interferences gross and net accumulations of soil no3 were derived from ding et al 2015 and calculated using the following equations 1 cno3

confidence intervals cis of each categorical group were estimated by metawin rosenberg et al 2000 software in the graphs forest plots the effect size the mean value and 95 cis of each grouping was transformed back i e exponentially transformed and converted to a percentage change in no3 n accumulation relative to the control group 3 results 3 1 relationships between nitrate accumulation and leaching accumulation of no3 in the top 0 100 cm soil and no3 leaching were significantly p 0 001 correlated for both wheat and maize systems fig 1 leaching increased 0 058 and 0 34 kg ha 1 for every kilogram of no3 n accumulated per hectare of wheat and maize respectively however the slope was larger for maize than for wheat indicating that no3 accumulated in soil was more vulnerable to losses from maize than from wheat fields 3 2 factors affecting soil nitrate accumulation 3 2 1 cropping soil no3 accumulation varied between different cropping systems wheat maize rotation in one year had the greatest no3 accumulation followed by monoculture and wheat or maize intercropping fig 2 no3 n accumulation was approximately 11 kg ha 1 for monoculture systems but was 69 and 118 kg ha 1 for maize and 38 and 79 kg ha 1 for wheat in intercropping and wheat maize rotation systems respectively 3 2 2 fertilization nitrate accumulation increased with increasing n application rate fig 3 mean no3 accumulation was 26 45 89 and 168 kg ha 1 for wheat and 39 59 95 and 102 kg ha 1 for maize at application rates of 0 100 100 200 200 300 and 300 kg n ha 1 respectively nitrate accumulation in soil for maize was smaller than that for wheat when n application rate increased from 200 to 300 to 300 kg ha 1 increasing n fertilizer application from 200 to 300 to 300 kg n per ha increased maize yield but only slightly affected wheat yield fig 3 fertilizer type and application method affected soil no3 accumulation fig 4 fertigation resulted in high accumulation of no3 n averaging 143 and 148 kg ha 1 for wheat and maize respectively the accumulation was significantly lower when fertilizer was top dressed or broadcast prior to tilling in comparison to fertigation at the same application rate averaging 60 and 86 kg ha 1 for wheat and 96 and 88 kg ha 1 for maize respectively fig 4a b this was probably due to higher ammonia emission losses when top dressing and surface broadcasting most of the studies used urea number of data 377 and only a few number of data 31 used ammonium chloride ammonium nitrate or a combination of chemical fertilizers and manure it seems chemical fertilizer combined with manure results in a greater nitrate accumulation rate followed by urea ammonium chloride and ammonium nitrate in wheat fields fig 4c for maize it was slightly different where application of urea resulted in the highest nitrate accumulation rate however slow or controlled fertilizer applications resulted in 50 lower nitrate accumulation compared with urea fig 4d 3 2 3 rainfall and irrigation soil no3 n accumulation increased to 156 and 138 kg ha 1 for wheat and maize respectively as precipitation increased to 400 550 mm and then decreased for wheat or remained unchanged for maize when precipitation further increased to 550 mm fig 5 a b soil no3 accumulation was higher with sprinkler irrigation than flood irrigation for both wheat and maize averaging 55 and 47 kg ha 1 for wheat and 199 and 79 kg ha 1 for maize respectively fig 5c d there was no consistent trend observed for irrigation rate for wheat or maize fig 5e f however no3 accumulation varied more widely for maize than for wheat 3 2 4 soil texture no3 accumulation was affected by soil texture the accumulation averaged 107 and 175 kg ha 1 in heavy textured soils for wheat and maize fields respectively but only 60 and 52 kg ha 1 in light to medium textured soils noticeably the average accumulation for maize was 96 and 150 kg ha 1 in light and medium soils respectively fig 6 a b 3 2 5 combined factors of cropping system precipitation and n application side by side comparisons of fields receiving different rates of n application showed that the accumulation of no3 in wheat maize rotations increased with increasing n application the accumulation increased from 48 to 327 for dry regions precipitation 600 mm and it was from 71 to 2117 for wet regions precipitation 600 mm at increasing n application rates of 100 100 200 200 300 and 300 kg ha 1 respectively fig 7 a for maize fields the effect size was 68 to 391 in dry regions and 111 to 914 in wet regions respectively for monoculture production no3 accumulation for wheat was 44 to 495 and 44 to 202 for maize when n application increased at the same level as that of wheat respectively data for monoculture in wet regions were insufficient for inferring this trend is similar with combined cropping system as showed in fig 3 clearly the rate of n application in combination with rainfall had a crucial impact on nitrate accumulation fig 7b 3 3 soil nitrate accumulation in wheat maize systems the no3 n in the top 0 100 cm soil layer at conventional n application rates was 120 and 147 kg ha 1 for wheat and maize respectively averaging 135 kg ha 1 table 2 the accumulation varied between regions being highest in beijing average 277 kg ha 1 followed by hebei 190 kg ha 1 and anhui 170 kg ha 1 for maize for wheat it was highest in hebei 159 kg ha 1 followed by shandong 124 kg ha 1 the trend that soil no3 n increased as more n was applied remained for regions that had higher n applications beijing gansu hebei shandong and shaanxi table 3 4 discussion a much higher nitrate leaching rate was observed for maize than wheat when soil nitrate accumulation rate increased by 1 unit fig 1 a similar result was reported by ju et al 2009 who reported that nitrate leaching during the maize season 12 1 leaching out of 100 cm soil depth was 4 5 times higher than that in the wheat season 2 7 leaching out of 100 cm soil depth this was more related to the distribution of precipitation in the studied region where precipitation occurred between june and october a typical season for maize production fang et al 2006 direct measurement of nitrate leaching is a high priority to determine the environmental risk of fertilizer application the strong correlation between soil nitrate accumulation and leaching suggests that soil nitrate accumulation could be a useful indicator of potential nitrate leaching if there is no direct measurement of nitrate leaching however high soil nitrate accumulation does not always represent a high nitrate leaching loss for example nitrate accumulation in the sprinkle irrigation wheat and maize system was 17 152 higher than flood irrigation fig 5c d this does not mean sprinkle irrigation is worse than flood irrigation since most of nitrate has been already leached out of 0 100 cm soil in the flood irrigation system xi and zhou 2003 4 1 factors affecting soil nitrate accumulation 4 1 1 fertilization and cropping fertilization significantly impacted soil no3 accumulation heavy application of n 360 kg n per hectare reduced the efficiency of n utilization and increased soil no3 accumulation leaching similar to the previous studies ru et al 2015 yang et al 2012 ye et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 which reported over fertilization can result in ca a 6 19 reduction of apparent recovery efficiency of applied n ren and a 30 93 increase of soil no3 accumulation using slow or controlled release forms of fertilizer tended to reduce soil no3 accumulation fig 6c d compared with conventional forms but the number of data for other types of fertilizer is small li et al 2008 and zhang et al 2012 reported 20 70 reductions in no3 accumulation and ca a 10 increase in crop yield if urea was conventional form substituted by slow release fertilizer slow or controlled release fertilizers slowly release n which can improve nue and reduce the need for total n input and repeated fertilizer dressings geng et al 2015 sempeho et al 2014 shaviv and mikkelsen 1993 the present study showed that intercropping reduced soil no3 accumulation compared to monoculture or wheat maize rotation as reported by fujita et al 1992 and liu et al 2009 cereals intercropped with legumes enriched soil fertility by n fixation and reduced the n fertilizer requirement intercropping has significant effects on microbiological and chemical properties in the rhizosphere as the soil is aerated with the help of shallow roots which may contribute to improved crop yield and soil quality el swaify et al 1988 song et al 2007 and result in high crop n uptake with low residual soil no3 compared with monoculture cropping the n application rate in a wheat maize rotation two crops within one year is higher and results in greater soil no3 accumulation in monoculture systems growing catch crops during the off season can results in plant uptake of residual soil n that would otherwise leach out from the root zone at the same time catch crops can be a source of n input for the next crop and decrease fertilizer requirement sapkota et al 2011 4 1 1 1 rainfall and irrigation nitrate leached downward through the soil profile by water from rainfall and irrigation in this study soil no3 accumulation increased with increasing rainfall reaching the highest level at 400 550 mm annual rainfall and then declined as rainfall increased further these observations were similar to a recent study reporting that the highest accumulation of no3 occurred at 500 550 mm annual precipitation zhou et al 2016 precipitation is a limiting factor for plant growth in arid and semi arid regions 400 mm and application of n according to plant requirements is smaller than in humid regions reducing soil no3 accumulation however excess n has been applied during the last four decades in china wang and zhang 2011 resulting in increased soil no3 high precipitation 800 mm annual in humid regions accompanied by high n fertilizer inputs increases the risk of no3 leaching from the top soil zhou et al 2016 however soil no3 accumulation was higher with high rainfall than with low rainfall especially with n rates 300 kg ha 1 fig 7 there are many factors that are affected by water availability such as crop n uptake leaching ammonia emission denitrification mineralization and irrigation the pattern of lower no3 accumulation at low rainfall and high no3 accumulation at high rainfall is partially explained by the flood irrigation in the north china plain fang et al 2010 and partially explained by the monoculture cropping system in the dry northwest china li et al 2002 probably the much higher rates of irrigation in the experiments at low rainfall than at high rainfall was a major factor affecting the accumulation of nitrate also compared with annual rainfall it is the individual intensive rainfall events that are more likely to drive higher potential of no3 leaching liang et al 2011 4 1 1 2 soil texture soil texture affects water movement and therefore the partitioning of no3 between leaching losses by denitrification and retention in the soil as shown in this study no3 accumulation in maize production was highest in heavy textured clay soils intermediate in medium textured loam soils and lowest in light textured loamy sand soils su et al 2014 and sun et al 2012 observed that no3 accumulation was the greatest in loam soils intermediate in sandy loam and lowest in loamy sand suggesting that soil no3 was affected by the proportion of silt and sand sandy soil has large porosity and permeability that allow easy transport and leaching of no3 resulting in low no3 accumulation conversely accumulation of no3 was high in clay soils which have a good soil structure and nutrient preserving capability yang and tang 2012 4 2 mitigation options although no3 that has accumulated in the top 100 cm of soil can be used by the next crop over accumulation of nitrate in the soil should be avoided as extreme rainfall events are becoming more frequent in china as we have observed from this study that due to variation in environmental soil and management factors regional differences in accumulation of no3 content in the soil and nitrate leaching can be significant managing the soil nitrate leaching or over accumulation in these regions may need different approaches however fertilization and water management represent the major options to reduce no3 accumulation in soil based on previous studies and this study management options include limiting the n application rate and tuning the n application timing to crop demand cui et al 2018 ju et al 2009 malhi et al 2011 accounting for the residual n in the soil in the planning of n application for the next crop de et al 2016 and using water sensing technologies to reduce over irrigation sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 zotarelli et al 2011 bausch and delgado 2005 suggested that in season n application be managed by remotely sensing crop utilization wheat roots can reach up to 2 0 m in the north china plain zhou et al 2008 hence limiting n application rate in winter wheat production can substantially reduce the high soil no3 accumulation observed in this study delgado et al 2002 suggested that site specific management zoning be used to improve n management these site management strategies have the potential to avoid over fertilization and increase nue for areas with high no3 accumulation where nitrate has leached to the deep vadose zone out of the reach of crop roots this no3 can be reduced by adding extra carbon in the soil to promote the denitrification process schipper and vojvodiƒá vukoviƒá 2001 5 conclusion understanding the factors affecting no3 accumulation in the soil is essential for developing strategies to decrease groundwater contamination our analysis showed that there are significant positive correlations between nitrate leaching and soil nitrate accumulation both in maize and wheat systems indicating soil nitrate accumulation could be a useful indicator of potential leaching risk accumulation of no3 in the soil increased with increasing n application rate and many other factors such as precipitation irrigation and fertilization methods and soil texture also impacts on the nitrate accumulation there are large variations of nitrate accumulation in wheat and maize systems across china due to different cropping systems fertilization and irrigation regimes hence regionally specific management measures need to be developed to control soil no3 accumulation in china especially in the north china plain these measures should have an emphasis on the use of fertilizers and irrigation specifically residual no3 in soils needs to be credited as a source of n for crops and sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation systems should be programmed to meet crop demands for water such measures could be used as the basis for developing regulations for the use of fertilizer and irrigation in china acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfd0800106 the national natural science foundation of

ranging from 30 to 40 ju et al 2009 but its much lower in regions where high n application rates are typical ju et al 2003 in general nitrate accumulates in soil when n fertilizer is oversupplied ju et al 2004 vitousek et al 2009 especially in intensive cropping double or triple cropping regions zhou et al 2016 nitrate in soils can leach into groundwater following heavy rainfall or irrigation contaminating drinking water ju et al 2003 liu 2015 the ministry of water resources of china 2016 analyzed the content of no3 in water from 2103 wells in 18 administrative regions in china and found that 80 of the wells contained 30 mg l 1 no3 n characterized as level v contamination gb14848 93 the no3 n content of groundwater analyzed for the bohai rim region averaged 11 9 mg l 1 and 30 of monitored wells exceeded the world health organization who standard of 50 mg nitrate per l 11 3 mg l 1 no3 n zhao and liu 2014 high no3 in groundwater poses a direct threat to human health tao and xin 2014 world health organization who 2011 the risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater can be assessed from no3 accumulation in the soil salo and turtola 2006 as the concentration of no3 in groundwater responds slowly to changes in agricultural practices and is subject to weather events wick et al 2012 soil residual no3 has been used as an alternative indicator for the risk of no3 leaching haene et al 2014 yadav 1997 determined that 68 of applied fertilizer n accumulated in the soil as no3 from which 20 entered the groundwater controlling groundwater no3 contamination is important for safe water supply chen et al 2016 kirchmann et al 2002 maeda et al 2003 zheng 2015 in addition to the use of fertilizers and irrigation management the use of manure and other n sources crop type soil properties such as soil texture and rainfall affect soil no3 accumulation and leaching de ruijter et al 2007 li et al 2016 shang et al 2012 tosti et al 2014 many countries adopted water quality legislation to control no3 contamination such as the implementation of the nitrates directive in the european union oenema et al 2011 velthof et al 2014 china has a unique challenge in feeding its large population with limited land resources and also needs similar strategies to reduce no3 leaching han et al 2016 bai et al 2018 the objectives of this study were to i determine the relationship between accumulation of no3 in agricultural soils in china and management soil and environmental factors ii quantify the relationship between accumulation and leaching of no3 and iii explore mitigation opportunities to avoid accumulation of no3 in soils the aim was to integrate data from reported studies at a regional scale in order to develop strategies to control soil no3 accumulation in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of data the data used in this study were extracted from the literature between 1990 and 2016 that reported post harvest soil no3 concentrations in wheat and maize fields in china the following criteria were used in the literature search a field studies in which wheat or maize production systems the geographical location soil property and agronomic practices involved were clearly described and b mean of no3 accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil layer standard errors and the number of replicates were reported or computable rice was not included in the literature search considering its low potential for accumulation of no3 in the soil tong et al 2005 the search was conducted using the china knowledge resource integrated database google scholar and the web of science together 212 published studies 34 in english were identified bringing in 1077 observations including 441 for wheat and 636 for maize study areas included 13 of the 31 provinces in china representing 81 of the wheat production and 61 of the maize production areas in 2016 national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2016 2 2 data collation and analysis the following results were included in our database the rate of n application kg ha 1 soil no3 accumulation in the 0 100 cm top layer kg ha 1 soil no3 content mg kg 1 no3 leaching per season kg n ha 1 study location latitude

extract numerical values from graphs metawin software to analyze the effective size and spss to do the significance test the influence of the following factors on soil no3 accumulation was analyzed 1 geographical region northeast north and northwest china 2 crop type wheat and maize 3 soil texture 4 fertilizer application rate method and type of fertilizers used 5 rainfall and irrigation methods and rates and 6 cropping systems monoculture with one crop one year intercropping with two crops within one season and wheat maize rotation within one year relationships between accumulation and leaching of no3 derived from the literature study are listed in table 1 in these studies soil no3 accumulation and leaching were measured simultaneously using percolating pools or lysimeter we analyzed the different influencing factors for the conventional range of n application rates based on the analysis of collected data and corrected with empirical application rate wheat 120 250 kg n ha 1 maize 170 280 kg n ha 1 chen et al 2011 2014 cui et al 2010 liang et al 2016 li et al 2018 reflecting typical practice and making any recommendations for mitigation strategies more meaningful since most of the data were from wheat maize rotation studies the analysis of irrigation management rainfall and soil properties was conducted for the wheat maize rotation system and not for individual crops within the system this was not the case for exploring the effects of fertilizer application method and fertilizer type where all cropping systems were used as data were not sufficient for the wheat maize rotation to unify data and eliminate background interferences gross and net accumulations of soil no3 were derived from ding et al 2015 and calculated using the following equations 1 cno3 st b c 10 2 ncno3 cno3 treat cno3 ck where cno3 unit kg n ha 1 is the gross no3 n accumulation st unit cm is soil thickness b unit g cm 3 is soil bulk density which was derived from the publications of the experiments c unit mg kg 1 is the soil no3 n concentration 10 is a factor to transform units ncno3 unit kg n ha 1 is the net no3 n accumulation cno3 treat unit kg n ha 1 is no3 n accumulation in crop fields that received fertilizers and cno3 ck unit kg n ha 1 is no3 n accumulation in crop fields that did not receive fertilizer application mean no3 n accumulation for different treatments were compared by duncan s test in one way anova using spss statistics 20 differences were considered significant when p was 0 05 results obtained from the referred studies were standardized by calculating their effect size effective size was defined as the natural logarithm of a response to fertilization lnr unit 1 hou et al 2015 the standardization was performed to facilitate pooling of quantitative statistical information and conducting robust comparisons of variables from different studies the log transformation allowed variances of dependent variables to be stabilized for pairwise comparisons the lnr was calculated as follows 3 lnr ln x treat x ck where x treat and x ck are means of no3 n accumulation cno3 treat and cno3 ck respectively the mean effect size and the 95 confidence intervals cis of each categorical group were estimated by metawin rosenberg et al 2000 software in the graphs forest plots the effect size the mean value and 95 cis of each grouping was transformed back i e exponentially transformed and converted to a percentage change in no3 n accumulation relative to the control group 3 results 3 1 relationships between nitrate accumulation and leaching accumulation of no3 in the top 0 100 cm soil and no3 leaching were significantly p 0 001 correlated for both wheat and maize systems fig 1 leaching increased 0 058 and 0 34 kg ha 1 for every kilogram of no3 n accumulated per hectare of wheat and maize respectively however the slope was larger for maize than for wheat indicating that no3 accumulated in soil was more vulnerable to losses from maize than from wheat fields 3 2 factors affecting soil nitrate accumulation 3 2 1 cropping soil no3 accumulation varied between different cropping systems wheat maize rotation in one year had the greatest no3 accumulation followed by monoculture and wheat or maize intercropping fig 2 no3 n accumulation was approximately 11 kg ha 1 for monoculture systems but was 69 and 118 kg ha 1 for maize and 38 and 79 kg ha 1 for wheat in intercropping and wheat maize rotation systems respectively 3 2 2 fertilization nitrate accumulation increased with increasing n application rate fig 3 mean no3 accumulation was 26 45 89 and 168 kg ha 1 for wheat and 39 59 95 and 102 kg ha 1 for maize at application rates of 0 100 100 200 200 300 and 300 kg n ha 1 respectively nitrate accumulation in soil for maize was smaller than that for wheat when n application rate increased from 200 to 300 to 300 kg ha 1 increasing n fertilizer application from 200 to 300 to 300 kg n per ha increased maize yield but only slightly affected wheat yield fig 3 fertilizer type and application method affected soil no3 accumulation fig 4 fertigation resulted in high accumulation of no3 n averaging 143 and 148 kg ha 1 for wheat and maize respectively the accumulation was significantly lower when fertilizer was top dressed or broadcast prior to tilling in comparison to fertigation at the same application rate averaging 60 and 86 kg ha 1 for wheat and 96 and 88 kg ha 1 for maize respectively fig 4a b this was probably due to higher ammonia emission losses when top dressing and surface broadcasting most of the studies used urea number of data 377 and only a few number of data 31 used ammonium chloride ammonium nitrate or a combination of chemical fertilizers and manure it seems chemical fertilizer combined with manure results in a greater nitrate accumulation rate followed by urea ammonium chloride and ammonium nitrate in wheat fields fig 4c for maize it was slightly different where application of urea resulted in the highest nitrate accumulation rate however slow or controlled fertilizer applications resulted in 50 lower nitrate accumulation compared with urea fig 4d 3 2 3 rainfall and irrigation soil no3 n accumulation increased to 156 and 138 kg ha 1 for wheat and maize respectively as precipitation increased to 400 550 mm and then decreased for wheat or remained unchanged for maize when precipitation further increased to 550 mm fig 5 a b soil no3 accumulation was higher with sprinkler irrigation than flood irrigation for both wheat and maize averaging 55 and 47 kg ha 1 for wheat and 199 and 79 kg ha 1 for maize respectively fig 5c d there was no consistent trend observed for irrigation rate for wheat or maize fig 5e f however no3 accumulation varied more widely for maize than for wheat 3 2 4 soil texture no3 accumulation was affected by soil texture the accumulation averaged 107 and 175 kg ha 1 in heavy textured soils for wheat and maize fields respectively but only 60 and 52 kg ha 1 in light to medium textured soils noticeably the average accumulation for maize was 96 and 150 kg ha 1 in light and medium soils respectively fig 6 a b 3 2 5 combined factors of cropping system precipitation and n application side by side comparisons of fields receiving different rates of n application showed that the accumulation of no3 in wheat maize rotations increased with increasing n application the accumulation increased from 48 to 327 for dry regions precipitation 600 mm and it was from 71 to 2117 for wet regions precipitation 600 mm at increasing n application rates of 100 100 200 200 300 and 300 kg ha 1 respectively fig 7 a for maize fields the effect size was 68 to 391 in dry regions and 111 to 914 in wet regions respectively for monoculture production no3 accumulation for wheat was 44 to 495 and 44 to 202 for maize when n application increased at the same level as that of wheat respectively data for monoculture in wet regions were insufficient for inferring this trend is similar with combined cropping system as showed in fig 3 clearly the rate of n application in combination with rainfall had a crucial impact on nitrate accumulation fig 7b 3 3 soil nitrate accumulation in wheat maize systems the no3 n in the top 0 100 cm soil layer at conventional n application rates was 120 and 147 kg ha 1 for wheat and maize respectively averaging 135 kg ha 1 table 2 the accumulation varied between regions being highest in beijing average 277 kg ha 1 followed by hebei 190 kg ha 1 and anhui 170 kg ha 1 for maize for wheat it was highest in hebei 159 kg ha 1 followed by shandong 124 kg ha 1 the trend that soil no3 n increased as more n was applied remained for regions that had higher n applications beijing gansu hebei shandong and shaanxi table 3 4 discussion a much higher nitrate leaching rate was observed for maize than wheat when soil nitrate accumulation rate increased by 1 unit fig 1 a similar result was reported by ju et al 2009 who reported that nitrate leaching during the maize season 12 1 leaching out of 100 cm soil depth was 4 5 times higher than that in the wheat season 2 7 leaching out of 100 cm soil depth this was more related to the distribution of precipitation in the studied region where precipitation occurred between june and october a typical season for maize production fang et al 2006 direct measurement of nitrate leaching is a high priority to determine the environmental risk of fertilizer application the strong correlation between soil nitrate accumulation and leaching suggests that soil nitrate accumulation could be a useful indicator of potential nitrate leaching if there is no direct measurement of nitrate leaching however high soil nitrate accumulation does not always represent a high nitrate leaching loss for example nitrate accumulation in the sprinkle irrigation wheat and maize system was 17 152 higher than flood irrigation fig 5c d this does not mean sprinkle irrigation is worse than flood irrigation since most of nitrate has been already leached out of 0 100 cm soil in the flood irrigation system xi and zhou 2003 4 1 factors affecting soil nitrate accumulation 4 1 1 fertilization and cropping fertilization significantly impacted soil no3 accumulation heavy application of n 360 kg n per hectare reduced the efficiency of n utilization and increased soil no3 accumulation leaching similar to the previous studies ru et al 2015 yang et al 2012 ye et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 which reported over fertilization can result in ca a 6 19 reduction of apparent recovery efficiency of applied n ren and a 30 93 increase of soil no3 accumulation using slow or controlled release forms of fertilizer tended to reduce soil no3 accumulation fig 6c d compared with conventional forms but the number of data for other types of fertilizer is small li et al 2008 and zhang et al 2012 reported 20 70 reductions in no3 accumulation and ca a 10 increase in crop yield if urea was conventional form substituted by slow release fertilizer slow or controlled release fertilizers slowly release n which can improve nue and reduce the need for total n input and repeated fertilizer dressings geng et al 2015 sempeho et al 2014 shaviv and mikkelsen 1993 the present study showed that intercropping reduced soil no3 accumulation compared to monoculture or wheat maize rotation as reported by fujita et al 1992 and liu et al 2009 cereals intercropped with legumes enriched soil fertility by n fixation and reduced the n fertilizer requirement intercropping has significant effects on microbiological and chemical properties in the rhizosphere as the soil is aerated with the help of shallow roots which may contribute to improved crop yield and soil quality el swaify et al 1988 song et al 2007 and result in high crop n uptake with low residual soil no3 compared with monoculture cropping the n application rate in a wheat maize rotation two crops within one year is higher and results in greater soil no3 accumulation in monoculture systems growing catch crops during the off season can results in plant uptake of residual soil n that would otherwise leach out from the root zone at the same time catch crops can be a source of n input for the next crop and decrease fertilizer requirement sapkota et al 2011 4 1 1 1 rainfall and irrigation nitrate leached downward through the soil profile by water from rainfall and irrigation in this study soil no3 accumulation increased with increasing rainfall reaching the highest level at 400 550 mm annual rainfall and then declined as rainfall increased further these observations were similar to a recent study reporting that the highest accumulation of no3 occurred at 500 550 mm annual precipitation zhou et al 2016 precipitation is a limiting factor for plant growth in arid and semi arid regions 400 mm and application of n according to plant requirements is smaller than in humid regions reducing soil no3 accumulation however excess n has been applied during the last four decades in china wang and zhang 2011 resulting in increased soil no3 high precipitation 800 mm annual in humid regions accompanied by high n fertilizer inputs increases the risk of no3 leaching from the top soil zhou et al 2016 however soil no3 accumulation was higher with high rainfall than with low rainfall especially with n rates 300 kg ha 1 fig 7 there are many factors that are affected by water availability such as crop n uptake leaching ammonia emission denitrification mineralization and irrigation the pattern of lower no3 accumulation at low rainfall and high no3 accumulation at high rainfall is partially explained by the flood irrigation in the north china plain fang et al 2010 and partially explained by the monoculture cropping system in the dry northwest china li et al 2002 probably the much higher rates of irrigation in the experiments at low rainfall than at high rainfall was a major factor affecting the accumulation of nitrate also compared with annual rainfall it is the individual intensive rainfall events that are more likely to drive higher potential of no3 leaching liang et al 2011 4 1 1 2 soil texture soil texture affects water movement and therefore the partitioning of no3 between leaching losses by denitrification and retention in the soil as shown in this study no3 accumulation in maize production was highest in heavy textured clay soils intermediate in medium textured loam soils and lowest in light textured loamy sand soils su et al 2014 and sun et al 2012 observed that no3 accumulation was the greatest in loam soils intermediate in sandy loam and lowest in loamy sand suggesting that soil no3 was affected by the proportion of silt and sand sandy soil has large porosity and permeability that allow easy transport and leaching of no3 resulting in low no3 accumulation conversely accumulation of no3 was high in clay soils which have a good soil structure and nutrient preserving capability yang and tang 2012 4 2 mitigation options although no3 that has accumulated in the top 100 cm of soil can be used by the next crop over accumulation of nitrate in the soil should be avoided as extreme rainfall events are becoming more frequent in china as we have observed from this study that due to variation in environmental soil and management factors regional differences in accumulation of no3 content in the soil and nitrate leaching can be significant managing the soil nitrate leaching or over accumulation in these regions may need different approaches however fertilization and water management represent the major options to reduce no3 accumulation in soil based on previous studies and this study management options include limiting the n application rate and tuning the n application timing to crop demand cui et al 2018 ju et al 2009 malhi et al 2011 accounting for the residual n in the soil in the planning of n application for the next crop de et al 2016 and using water sensing technologies to reduce over irrigation sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 zotarelli et al 2011 bausch and delgado 2005 suggested that in season n application be managed by remotely sensing crop utilization wheat roots can reach up to 2 0 m in the north china plain zhou et al 2008 hence limiting n application rate in winter wheat production can substantially reduce the high soil no3 accumulation observed in this study delgado et al 2002 suggested that site specific management zoning be used to improve n management these site management strategies have the potential to avoid over fertilization and increase nue for areas with high no3 accumulation where nitrate has leached to the deep vadose zone out of the reach of crop roots this no3 can be reduced by adding extra carbon in the soil to promote the denitrification process schipper and vojvodiƒá vukoviƒá 2001 5 conclusion understanding the factors affecting no3 accumulation in the soil is essential for developing strategies to decrease groundwater contamination our analysis showed that there are significant positive correlations between nitrate leaching and soil nitrate accumulation both in maize and wheat systems indicating soil nitrate accumulation could be a useful indicator of potential leaching risk accumulation of no3 in the soil increased with increasing n application rate and many other factors such as precipitation irrigation and fertilization methods and soil texture also impacts on the nitrate accumulation there are large variations of nitrate accumulation in wheat and maize systems across china due to different cropping systems fertilization and irrigation regimes hence regionally specific management measures need to be developed to control soil no3 accumulation in china especially in the north china plain these measures should have an emphasis on the use of fertilizers and irrigation specifically residual no3 in soils needs to be credited as a source of n for crops and sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation systems should be programmed to meet crop demands for water such measures could be used as the basis for developing regulations for the use of fertilizer and irrigation in china acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfd0800106 the national natural science foundation of
