22565,known as shape sensing real time reconstruction of a structure s three dimensional displacements using a network of in situ strain sensors and measured strains is a vital technology for structural health monitoring shm the inverse finite element method ifem is a mechanics based shape sensing algorithm shown to be fast accurate and robust for usage as a part of shm systems in this study a new eight node curved inverse shell element named as ics8 is developed based on ifem methodology the kinematic relations of ics8 element are established through combining kinematics of solid shell together with kinematic assumptions of first order shear deformation plate theory the new weighted least squares functional of ifem uses the complete set of section strains consistent with the ics8 element i e 1 coupled membrane bending and 2 transverse shear section strains the ics8 element accommodates a curvilinear isoparametric coordinate system thus it can be effectively utilized to model cylindrical curved geometries with a coarse discretization this practical modelling capability can allow a relatively sparse placement of sensors therefore providing an advantage for real time shape sensing of curvilinear geometries the high accuracy and practical utility of the ics8 element is demonstrated for different cylindrical marine structures through examining coarse ics8 discretizations with dense and sparse sensor deployments keywords shape sensing structural health monitoring cylindrical marine structures inverse finite element method ifem degenerated shell element strain sensors 1 introduction cylindrical and or curved shell structures are abundantly found in marine and offshore engineering industry and their strength is commonly increased by utilizing beam type stiffeners and girders the stiffened curved panels are mainly preferred in design of aircraft fuselages ship hulls and structural elements of land transport vehicles cho et al 2007 tran et al 2014 marine vessels generally operate under extreme loading conditions and are exposed to various types of material degradation such as pitting corrosion erosion corrosion due to the interaction of the steel and salted seawater thus resulting in expensive failure of its structural components accumulation of hidden undetected failures may gradually decrease the operational lifetime of the marine structures and finally lead to life loses of human beings sea pollution and catastrophic failure of the whole structure therefore it is necessary to avoid these failure types and acquire accurate information regarding structural safety of curved marine structures ship hull girders in real time for this purpose a structural health monitoring shm that can perform three dimensional full field displacement strain and stress monitoring has to be installed on board the prominence of installing a suitable shm system was also recognized by the international maritime organization imo in 1994 then various classification societies including abs 1995 2015 lr 2004 and dnv 2011 are regulated new rules for performing hull stress monitoring a robust shm system should integrate a network of strain sensors such as conventional strain gauges fibre bragg grating fbg sensor and wireless strain sensors into a structure then the real time data generated through these sensors should be accurately transmitted and processed in an on board database next the processed data should be used as an input for a smart and robust shape and stress sensing algorithm for performing accurate displacement and stress monitoring of the structure the overall information has to be gathered so quickly as such being suitable for the strain data acquisition in real time over the last two decades a plenty of researchers considered hull stress monitoring as a challenging research study and proposed novel shm systems to give some of the pioneering examples wang et al 2001 utilized distributed fbg sensor technology to monitor structural health of composite hulls and demonstrated various signal processing methods for characterizing hull structural response and sea states similar applications of fbg sensors to strain and stress monitoring of ship and offshore structures were presented by kageyama et al 1998 torkildsen et al 2005 murawski et al 2012 and majewska et al 2014 some of which included case studies performed under static and dynamic loads in particular shen et al 2015 analysed and optimized strain transfer ratio of two types of fbg strain rosettes to accurately monitor multidimensional strains and stresses of ship hulls their assessment methodology involved numerical and experimental investigations carried out through finite element method fem and tensile test machines respectively nielsen et al 2011 proposed an shm system for hull girders of container ships to monitor fatigue damage rates their fatigue calculation method involved whipping stresses and on board estimation of sea states obtained from full scale measurements more recently johnson et al 2018 also presented a fatigue assessment strategy through utilization of wireless hull monitoring system for high speed aluminium hulls most recently yan et al 2019 developed an shm system for investigating fatigue characteristics of the stinger structure of pipe laying ship to increase its safety in the operational conditions in addition xu and haddara 2001 utilized full scale ship motion measurements to continuously monitor wave induced bending moments of the ship hull girders moreover the ice load response of ship hull s bow structure was estimated through a continuous strain monitoring which was correlated with a fem model to investigate the effect of ice thickness and speed of the vessel leira et al 2009 furthermore kahl et al 2018 outlined classification society rules for hull monitoring systems provided the potential advantages of using hull monitoring systems and finally justified these benefits through performing full scale measurements on containerships most importantly phelps and morris 2013 reviewed various hull structural monitoring systems via presenting their technical specifications for usage in navy ships and deference industry apart from the shm systems developed for marine structures more general frameworks were developed to solve the inverse problem of shape sensing analysis for example the inverse methods introduced by maniatty and zabaras 1989 1994 and schnur and zabaras 1990 used a typical regularization approach presented by tikhonov and arsenin 1977 another example is shape sensing of beams and plates for which extensive research were conducted by scientist including davis et al 1996 kim and cho 2004 jones et al 1998 and nishio et al 2010 recently gherlone et al 2018 published a wide literature review explaining the detailed historical chain of the shape and stress sensing algorithms for beam and plate structures apart from the shm systems and inverse methods mentioned in the previous paragraphs a revolutionary shape sensing algorithm known as inverse finite element method ifem was developed by tessler and spangler 2003 2005 in fact none of the previous inverse methods has the same shape sensing capabilities as what ifem algorithm offers mainly these capabilities are threefold 1 no requirement of any loading and or material information for shape sensing in real time 2 easiness to take into account complex structural geometry and or boundary conditions and 3 high robustness stability and accuracy even with few and or noisy strain measurements hence the ifem methodology satisfies all necessities of shm systems its original mechanics based algorithm calculates a least squares functional of the errors between analytical strain measures and their experimental counterparts this error is minimized through finding the stationary point of the least squares functional with respect to the unknown nodal degrees of freedom thus allowing to obtain a final set of equations based on strain displacement relations only the structural deformed shape can be obtained through solving the ifem s final equations in real time this shape sensing information is also a fundamental constituent for reconstructing such structural response quantities as strain stress and failure for this reason ifem is a robust shape sensing tool that may assist shm of shell type critical engineering structures including some components of marine structures in addition none of the present hull shm systems recommended by class societies and researchers can be used to monitor three dimensional full field displacements strains and stresses of a marine vessel as elaborated between second and fourth paragraph of this section these current shm systems commonly monitor only several points on the structure such as two points on the weather deck amidships the questions which remain unanswered are how much reliable information these shm systems provide to the master operator of the ship in terms of the ships global structural health and if any alternative solutions exist the possible answer of this question lies in the merits of ifem for marine structures as compared to those of existing hull shm systems the main benefit is that ifem can provide full field three dimensional structural deformed shape and strain stress distribution of any marine structure this benefit brings a latter beneficial aspect of ifem specific to marine structures in other words utilization of suitable failure criteria along with the ifem s three dimensional strains stresses can allow the detection of possible damage stress locations including stress corrosion cracking i e most fundamental type of local failure experienced in marine structures moreover ifem s main output strain stress can be utilized even further to predict material degradation caused by corrosion erosion since the corroded parts of a ship structure will have a reduced stiffness they will be exposed to high strain gradients during the service life of the vessel therefore the strain jumps in the real time history of strains predicted by ifem may be logically used to predict possible corrosion damages in fact these particular abnormal structural behaviours are unique to the marine structures hence ifem has various potential merits for marine structures which may not be offered by the traditional hull shm systems available today over the last fifteen year the ifem methodology has attracted a considerable amount of attention in the field of shm for instance tessler and spangler 2004 developed a robust inverse shell element imin3 based on the kinematic relations of the first order shear deformation theory fsdt after the first ifem based element imin3 in the literature kefal et al 2016 introduced the first four node quadrilateral inverse shell element iqs4 the applications of these element types include complex aerospace quach et al 2005 vazquez et al 2005 tessler 2007 cerracchio et al 2015a and marine structures kefal and oterkus 2015 2016a 2016b as well as structural damage identification colombo et al 2019 most recently tessler et al 2018 demonstrated the high accuracy of imin3 element for structures undergoing large displacements also the imin3 element were experimentally demonstrated as a robust candidate for full field reconstruction of deformations loads and stresses of aerospace wing structures from in situ sensor measurements miller et al 2016 papa et al 2017 moreover kefal 2017 and kefal et al 2018a b demonstrated that the ifem iqs4 methodology can be suitably applied to shm of marine structures having a structural complexity and travelling in oceanographically complex sea conditions regarding the beam element types gherlone et al 2012 introduced the first efficient inverse frame element in the literature by utilizing the kinematics of timoshenko beam theory whose applications included various laboratory experiments gherlone et al 2014 song and liang 2018 zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2018 apart from beam plate shell types of inverse elements one of the most recent applications of ifem methodology was successfully demonstrated by mooij et al 2019 through development of tetrahedral and hexahedral inverse solid elements the authors make use of tikhonov regularization in the variational principle of the ifem formulation as well and presented remarkable patched tests for examining the accuracy of the inverse solid elements additionally advanced ifem formulations for shape and stress sensing of laminated composite and sandwich plate shell structures are proposed by cerracchio et al 2015a b and kefal et al 2017 2018b the authors extended the capabilities of original ifem formulation i e based on fsdt by utilizing kinematic assumptions of refined zigzag theory rzt developed by tessler et al 2010 recently the ifem rzt formulations were utilized to establish a sensor placement strategy for composite wing shaped models kefal and yildiz 2017 to the best of author s knowledge there is no study on the development of a curved inverse shell element based on ifem formulation for shape sensing of thin thick or moderately thick curved shell structures with the focus on the cylindrical marine structures the main and novel aim of this study is to develop the ifem formulation of a new eight node curved inverse shell element called as ics8 for the first time in the literature herein the main focus of the new ics8 element is to create accurate ifem models with a relatively coarse discretization using only few strain sensor measurements the overall formulation is suitable for performing accurate shape sensing analysis of thin thick and stiffened unstiffened shell structures the kinematic relations of the ics8 element are based on a typical degenerated shell element ahmad et al 1970 established by coupling of solid shell kinematics with fsdt plate theory the weighted least squares functional of ifem ics8 methodology uses the 1 coupled membrane bending section strains and 2 transverse shear sections strains this functional is minimized with respect to the unknown displacements to construct local ifem equations of the ics8 element various example problems including a simply supported cylinder an offshore substructure and a curved stiffened panel are analysed to validate the accuracy of the ics8 element through a numerical comparison with reference solutions obtained by using fem analysis as a result high precision of the ifem reconstructed displacements are obtained for different ics8 models having dense sparse and very sparse sensor distributions finally practical locations of sensors are clearly identified and demonstrated on the geometry examined in each particular example for future applications of shm systems 2 the ifem formulation for curved shells 2 1 an eight node curved inverse shell element ics8 element in this section the mathematical formulation of a new eight node curved inverse shell element ics8 is derived for shape sensing of flat curved structures the ics8 element has six degrees of freedom dof per node including an artificial drilling rotation and utilizes the kinematic relations of the fsdt coupled with solid shell kinematics the inclusion of artificial drilling rotation enables one to easily construct the global system of equations during the modelling of built up structures such as stiffened curved shells this way the singularity problems that may arise at the co planar nodes when solving global systems of the equations can be avoided without any further treatment in the final set of equations consider a generic thick shell element having curved bounding surfaces and straight sections across the thickness direction as depicted in fig 1 to describe the geometrical features of this particular curved shell three different coordinate systems are utilized the x x y z t vector shown in fig 1 represents a cartesian global coordinate system which is utilized to establish geometry of the shell body and translational dof of the ics8 element moreover the x ˆ x ˆ y ˆ z ˆ t vector denotes a cartesian local coordinate system to define local strain components within the ics8 element domain furthermore the ξ ξ η ζ t vector denotes an isoparametric coordinate system where ζ is a linear coordinate defining the thickness direction of the ics8 element and the ξ and η are curvilinear components defining the curved surface of the element for a fixed ζ coordinate these isoparametric coordinates vary between 1 and 1 on the respective surfaces of the element thus they are suitable to define the isoparametric shape functions and also perform the gauss integration within the volume of the element for a given top and bottom surface global coordinates of the nodes i e x i and x i i 1 8 the nodal coordinates of mid surface of the element x i the thickness of the element at the nodes 2 h i and the director mid surface normal direction of the each node of the element a 3 i can be readily calculated as 1a x i x i x i 2 1b 2 h i x i x i 1c a 3 i x i x i x i x i where the symbol stands for the norm of the respective vectors for clarity the vector quantities x i x i x i and a 3 i and the scalar quantity 2 h i is depicted in fig 1 utilizing these geometrical quantities of the ics8 element the transformation between isoparametric curvilinear and global cartesian coordinate systems can be established as 2 x i 1 8 n i ξ η x i ζ h i a 3 i where the n i ξ η function represents the quadratic serendipity shape functions that takes a value of unity at the node i and zero all other nodes these shape functions are given as 3a n i ξ η 1 4 1 ξ ξ i 1 η η i ξ i ξ η i η 1 i 1 2 3 4 3b n i ξ η 1 2 1 η η i 1 ξ 2 i 5 7 3c n i ξ η 1 2 1 ξ ξ i 1 η 2 i 6 8 where the ξ i η i coordinates are the isoparametric coordinates of the nodes as depicted in fig 1 utilizing the same shape functions the global the displacement vector u u x u y u z t of any material point within the ics8 element can be approximated as 4 u i 1 8 n i ξ η u i ζ h i a 1 i θ 1 i a 2 i θ 2 i where the nodal dof of the ics8 element consists of uniform translations vector i e u i u i v i w i t whose individual components are along positive x y z global axes and counter clockwise positive θ 1 i and clockwise negative θ 2 i rotations around the directions of the a 2 i and a 1 i vectors defined at node i respectively fig 1 the a 1 i and a 2 i vector are orthogonal unit vectors whose cross product is coincident with the director a 3 i a 1 i a 2 i these vectors can be readily established using the vector transformation procedures explained by ahmad et al 1970 although the kinematic relations given in eq 4 uses only 5 nodal dof an artificial drilling rotation is separately introduced at each node i to easily handle the problems involving built up structural components by using ics8 element hence the nodal displacement dof vector of the element is defined as 5a u e u 1 e u 2 e u 8 e t 5b u i e u i v i w i θ 1 i θ 2 i θ 3 i t i 1 2 8 where the symbol θ 3 i i 1 2 8 denotes the artificial drilling rotation defined as a counter clockwise positive rotation around the director a 3 i fig 1 accordingly the eq 4 can be restated using the u e vector as 6a u n 1 e n 8 e u 1 e u 8 e n e u e 6b n i e n i ξ η i ζ h i a 1 i ζ h i a 2 i 0 where i is an 3 3 identity matrix n i e is the 3 6 shape function matrix at node i and n e is the 3 48 shape function matrix of the ics8 element as described in fig 1 the local displacements of a material point in the shell body is defined by u ˆ u x ˆ u y ˆ u z ˆ t vector consistent with the local cartesian coordinate system x ˆ to derive the linear elastic in plane and transverse shear strains within the ics8 element domain the respective first order derivatives of the component of u ˆ vector should be taken with respect to local coordinates as 7a ε ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ u x ˆ x ˆ u y ˆ y ˆ u x ˆ y ˆ u y ˆ x ˆ 7b γ γ x ˆ z ˆ γ y ˆ z ˆ u x ˆ z ˆ u z ˆ x ˆ u y ˆ z ˆ u z ˆ y ˆ where the vectors ε and γ define the in plane and transverse shear strains note that normal strains ε z ˆ z ˆ along z ˆ axis is neglected based on the basic shell assumption of zero thickness stretch deformation the local strain components given in eq 7 can be calculated individually by utilizing the derivatives of the global displacements with respect to global coordinates as 8 u ˆ x ˆ t u ˆ y ˆ t u ˆ z ˆ t t t u x t u y t u z t t where t is the transformation matrix defining the local to the global transformations of strains this matrix can be established using the directions of local coordinates as 9a t t 1 t 2 t 3 with 9b t 3 x ξ x η x ξ x η 9c t 1 x ξ x ξ 9d t 2 t 3 t 1 for a constant ζ coordinate namely any surface along the thickness of the shell the unit normal vector of t 3 can be established through the cartesian products of the x χ χ ξ η vectors as given in eq 9b note that the t 3 vector becomes identical to the director a 3 i at the nodes i 1 2 8 for the thickness coordinate of ζ 0 i e mid surface once the unit vector of t 1 i e tangent to the ξ coordinate is calculated as given in eq 9c it can be used together with the normal vector to define the unit surface tangent vector t 2 which is the orthogonal to both t 1 and t 3 vectors the derivatives of the displacements with respect to the global coordinates given in eq 8 can be established by the chain rule with the following matrix relation 10a u χ 1 j 1 u χ 2 χ 1 x y z χ 2 ξ η ζ where j is jacobian matrix defined as 10b j x ξ t x η t x ζ t t substituting eq 10 into eq 8 while making use of eq 6 and subsequently allocating the relevant strains into eq 7 yield to the continuous analytical in plane and transverse shear strains defined in terms of the element dof vector u e as 11 ε u e γ u e b ε u e b γ u e where the matrices b ε and b γ are quadratic functions of ξ η and linear function of ζ these matrices define the relation between strains and displacement dof of an individual ics8 element they also contain the combinations of relevant derivatives of the serendipity shape functions with respect to ξ η and are explicitly provided in appendix a 2 2 experimentally measured strains for the ics8 ifem formulation the ifem variational functional operates based on the match between the analytical and experimental section strains through minimizing the relative error between these strains therefore the experimental strain measurements are one of the main input of the ifem formulation and have a significant role to predict accurate results these in situ measurements can be readily obtained from discrete locations of the structure being monitored via the surface mounted strain gauges or fiber bragg grating fbg sensors for instance consider the curved plate that is installed with two strain rosettes at top and bottom surface of the same mid surface positions x i i 1 n as shown in fig 2 herein the symbol n stands for the number of discrete positions having two strain rosettes utilizing the strain readings obtained from these sensors the experimental counterpart of ε i e analytical strains given by eq 11 can be calculated at any thickness coordinate ζ of the discrete positions x i as 12 e i 1 ζ 2 ε x ˆ x ˆ ξ i η i ε y ˆ y ˆ ξ i η i γ x ˆ y ˆ ξ i η i 1 ζ 2 ε x ˆ x ˆ ξ i η i ε y ˆ y ˆ ξ i η i γ x ˆ y ˆ ξ i η i i 1 n where the symbols χ ξ i η i χ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ and χ ξ i η i χ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ denote the individual in situ strain components measured at top ζ 1 and bottom ζ 1 surface of the position ξ η ξ i η i note that these experimental strain components are measured along the local axes x ˆ y ˆ z ˆ since there are three strain measurements available on either top bottom surface of a particular in plane coordinate ξ η ξ i η i they can easily be transformed to local directions via strain transformation equations thus allowing the strain rosettes to be orientated with respect to the most practical direction in the real test environment the discrete strain data χ ξ i η i χ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ can be smoothed a priori by using smoothing techniques e g smoothing element analysis developed by tessler et al 1998 1999 or they can be fitted to continuous functions through surface curve fitting techniques lancaster and salkauskas 1986 as a result of the smoothing procedure the surface strain measurements can be represented by nearly c 1 continuous polynomial functions as 13 χ ξ i η i χ ξ η χ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ where the i subscript drops naturally as the strain data become available anywhere on top and bottom surface of ics8 elements utilizing the continuous surface strain measurements one can attain the continuous form of the experimental in plane strains e as 14 e 1 ζ 2 ε x ˆ x ˆ ξ η ε y ˆ y ˆ ξ η γ x ˆ y ˆ ξ η 1 ζ 2 ε x ˆ x ˆ ξ η ε y ˆ y ˆ ξ η γ x ˆ y ˆ ξ η the availability of c 1 continuous in situ strains e may be crucial in terms of predicting experimental transverse shear strains γ in fact the calculation of neither continuous nor discrete form of γ strain is not easy as compared to those of e strains because the in situ surface strain measurements cannot be directly used to calculate in situ transverse shear strains however the first order derivatives of e strains with respect to global coordinates can be utilized together with fsdt s equilibrium governing equations to calculate the γ strains the mathematical details of this calculation was provided by kefal 2017 for the iqs4 element to predict accurate values of γ strains a similar procedure can be applied to ics8 element as well the transverse shear strains may have a considerable effect on the accuracy of shape sensing of a thick plate shell structure nevertheless transverse shear deformations are much smaller than the membrane bending and membrane bending coupled deformations in the deformation of thin shells hence the contributions of γ measurements can be safely omitted in the variational principle of ifem formulation for thin shells such as structural components of marine structures 2 3 weighted least squares functional of ics8 ifem methodology the original ifem methodology introduced by tessler and spangler 2003 2005 accounts for the three main actions of the deformations through a least squares functional containing the individual errors between analytical and experimental sections strains these deformation fields consist of membrane bending and transverse shear deformations of the fsdt herein a similar framework of the ifem s variational functional is adopted for this purpose the difference between the analytical section strains ε u e and γ u e and the experimental counterparts e and γ can be defined using error functions of ϕ i u e i ε γ respectively as 15a ϕ ε u e ε u e e 15b ϕ γ u e γ u e γ where the error functional of ϕ ε u e and ϕ γ u e are associated with the coupled membrane bending deformations and transverse shear deformations respectively firstly inserting these strain errors into squared l2 norms i e known as euclidean norms then associating each squared norm with suitable weighting coefficients of ω ε and ω γ and finally integrating the sum of weighted squared error norms over the volume individual ics8 element v a general weighted least squares functional φ e u e can be established for the ics8 ifem methodology as 16 φ e u e 1 v v ω ε ϕ ε u e 2 ω γ ϕ γ u e 2 d v where the φ e u e is also normalized with respect to volume of the element to acquire a dimensionless functional consistent with the strain measures note that the squared l2 norms 2 of the ϕ i u e i ε γ vectors given in eq 16 can be calculated as the dot product of vectors ϕ i ϕ i conceptually the weighting coefficients was introduced into the least squares functional of ifem methodology by tessler et al 2011 the utilization of weighting constants become critical for problems involving a sparse deployment of strain sensors in other words they have to be adjusted properly for those problems involving relatively few experimental strain data because the complete coherence between theoretical strain components and their experimentally measured values is maintained overall the structure through these weighting coefficients to elaborate on the usage of ω i i ε γ consider an ics8 element having strain rosettes on both top and bottom surface of the element and assume that all the experimental section strains are computed for this element for this scenario one to one strain data is available between analytical and experimental strains therefore all weighting constants will be equal to unity i e ω i 1 i ε γ on the other hand if an element has undetermined in situ strain component namely the value of either e or γ is not available for an ics8 element in the analysis then a small value compared to unity λ 1 such as λ 10 3 needs to be assigned to the corresponding weighting constant and the associated squared norm should be reduced to the following form 17a ϕ ε 2 ε u e 2 for ω ε λ 17b ϕ γ 2 γ u e 2 for ω γ λ for clarity consider a structure being fully instrumented with sensors such that each single ics8 element has two strain rosettes at the top and bottom surfaces of the elements also assume that the structure is thin and henceforth the experimental transverse shear strain measures are not calculated for the analysis for this case the weighting constants can be adjusted as ω ε 1 and ω γ λ thus the φ e u e functional takes the following form for every ics8 element 18 φ e u e 1 v v ε u e e 2 λ γ u e 2 d v another example would be a thin structure being partially instrumented with sensors for this example the ics8 elements having strain rosettes would have the same φ e u e functional given in eq 18 whereas the φ e u e functional for ics8 elements having no in situ strain data strain less elements takes the following form 19 φ e u e 1 v v λ ε u e 2 λ γ u e 2 d v then the ics8 model can have the ability to maintain the required interpolation connectivity between the elements with strain sensor data according to the general form of the ifem formulation tessler and spangler 2005 the deformed shape of a individual element can be obtained by minimizing the φ e u e functional with respect to the nodal dof of the element u e as 20 φ e u e u e 0 k e u e f e where the left hand side matrix of the element k e is same for predefined locations of strain sensors thus its sub elements are not affected by experimentally measured strain values on the other hand the element right hand side vector f e is a function of the in situ strain reading therefore this vector has to be updated at the each increment of strain data acquisition utilizing the b i i ε γ matrices and their corresponding weighting constants ω i i ε γ the k e matrix and f e vector can be explicitly as 21a k e 1 v v ω ε b ε t b ε ω γ b γ t b γ d v 21b f e 1 v v ω ε b ε t ε ω γ b γ t γ d v where the integration over the volume of an ics8 element can be numerically performed through gauss quadrature rule it is important to compute a suitable k e matrix that can avoid any spurious modes and is well posed matrix after the application of problem specific constraint boundary condition for this purpose a full integration scheme with 3 3 2 number of gauss points along the isoparametric coordinates ξ η ζ is recommended however in practice it is also possible to perform a reduced integration via 2 2 2 number of gauss points along the ξ η ζ coordinates in order to avoid from the occurrence of membrane bending and or transverse shear locking the other types of gauss integration schemes and their effect on the solution accuracy of forward fem analysis are detailed by onate 2013 which can be utilized for the ifem analysis as well after calculating the k e matrix for an ics8 element using the eq 21a an artificial stiffness term corresponding to each drilling rotation dof θ 3 i i 1 2 8 has to be inserted into the diagonal positions of the k e matrix this way the spurious modes or any singular solution due to the inclusion of drilling dof can be readily avoided these terms can be selected and located at the specific diagonal positions corresponding to each node s drilling dof available in the k e matrix as 22 k j j e λ min k j 1 j 1 e k j 2 j 2 e j 6 i i 1 2 8 where λ is a small positive coefficient e g λ 10 5 and the k j j e k j 1 j 1 e k j 2 j 2 e coefficients are diagonal terms of the k e matrix corresponding to the rotational dof of θ 1 i θ 2 i θ 3 i i 1 2 3 respectively herein the first and second subscripts available in the parentheses represent the row and column positions of the stiffness coefficients belonging to the k e matrix the experimental section strains in eq 21b are continuous therefore their values at the gauss points should be used to perform an accurate integration as explained earlier in section 2 2 once the discrete surface measurement at arbitrary locations ξ i η i i 1 n are obtained from sensor and smoothed using smoothing curve fitting techniques the experimental measurements at the specific gauss points can be easily generated on the other hand if the discrete in situ section strains values e i or γ i is willing to be directly used in eq 21b without any smoothing curve fitting operations the sensor has to be located at the coordinates of gauss points on top and bottom surfaces of the element domain this way the predicted values of f e vector will still be highly accurate however it would be costly in practice since at least 3 3 or 2 2 number of strain measurements at both top and bottom surface of the element is necessary for performing the full or reduced integrations respectively alternatively the e i or γ i in situ strains computed at arbitrary locations ξ i η i i 1 n can be averaged to obtain average uniform in situ strain values for an ics8 element as 23 χ a v g i 1 n χ i n χ e γ which can be then assigned to every gauss point during the numerical integration in other words the continuous form of the experimental section strains given in eq 21b is considered to be uniform within the inverse element χ χ a v g χ e γ although this assumption will produce some error in the computation of f e vector it will not affect the overall reconstruction of the deformed shape since an individual element domain has an infinitesimally small surface as compared to the whole surface of the structure being monitored in case of a single in situ section strain being available per ics8 element namely n 1 and thus i 1 only two strain rosettes are patched on the top and bottom of the in plane position of ξ 1 η 1 for this case the centroid of the element ξ 1 η 1 0 0 may be preferably chosen to mount these sensors on the structure for obtaining the e 1 or γ 1 the values in average sense over the ics8 element the local matrix vector equations calculated using the eq 21 can be assembled to obtain a global resulting equation system for a discretized structure for this purpose the conventional assembly process of the fem can be reliably used in the ifem analysis as well as a result the final global equations can be defined as 24a k u f with 24b k ω e 1 n e l t e t k e t e 24c f ω e 1 n e l t e t f e 24d u ω e 1 n e l t e t u e where the ω e 1 n e l symbol denotes element assembly operator with the parameter n e l defining the total number of inverse finite elements and the k f and u are the global left hand side matrix right hand side vector and dof vector of the discretized structure respectively the matrix t e given in eq 24b d is an element transformation matrix performing relevant transformation of the necessary nodal dof of the element from local to global coordinate system in fact the translational dof have already been defined according to the global coordinate system therefore the element equations corresponding to local rotational dof needs to be transformed before the assembly process for this particular transformation the following definition of t e matrix can be utilized 25a t e i 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t 1 e 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

vector defined at nodes a 1 i a 2 i a 3 i are utilized to perform suitable transformations from local to global coordinate systems and the 3 3 identity matrix i keeps the globally defined translational dof available in their original coordinate system after the transformation operation before solving the eq 24a to obtain the global displacement dof the singularity mode i e rigid body motions of the discretized structure available in k matrix should be disabled through application of problem specific displacement boundary conditions as a result the eq 24a can be reduced to final system of equations as 26 k r u r f r where the k r matrix is surely non singular invertible as it become a positive definite matrix herein it is worthy to note that f r vector has to be updated based on the in situ strain readings whereas the k r matrix doesn t require measured strain information and will not necessarily be updated for any deformation cycle accordingly the k r matrix can be inverted only once hence allowing a quick solution for the eq 26 namely a simple matrix vector multiplication k r 1 f r overall this operation can be performed quickly in real time and provide the unknown dof vector u r at any real time the global structural response namely total deformed shape of the structure can be acquired through calculating the magnitude of displacement vectors available at any position over the solution domain for this purpose the evaluated global displacements u r can be transformed back to the local coordinate system to make the u e vectors become available for all the element substituting the values of u e vector into eq 6 the magnitude of u vector provides the information of total displacements at any spatial coordinate as 27 u t ξ η ζ u ξ η ζ u x u y u z inserting the evaluated local displacements dof u e into the eq 11 yields to calculation of the continuous strain components throughout the ics8 element domain then determination of stress distribution over the element domain can be possible by using the evaluated strain components within the hooke s law for isotropic material as 28 σ τ d 0 0 g ε γ where the vectors σ and τ represent the in plane and transverse shear stress components in element coordinate system x ˆ respectively according to the plane stress condition i e zero stress along the thickness coordinate z ˆ the coupled membrane bending stiffness d and the transverse shear stiffness g of the material can be defined as 29 d e 1 ν 2 1 ν 0 ν 1 0 0 0 1 ν 2 g e 2 1 ν 1 0 0 1 where the symbols e and ν represent elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of the material respectively the individual components of stress vectors may be symbolically defined as 30 σ σ x ˆ x ˆ σ y ˆ y ˆ τ x ˆ y ˆ t τ τ x ˆ z ˆ τ y ˆ z ˆ t which can be utilized to calculate an equivalent stress distribution based on the von mises failure criterion with the boundary conditions of general plane stress i e σ z ˆ z ˆ 0 and τ i z ˆ 0 i x ˆ y ˆ as 31 σ v σ x ˆ x ˆ 2 σ y ˆ y ˆ 2 σ x ˆ x ˆ σ y ˆ y ˆ 3 τ x ˆ y ˆ 2 τ x ˆ z ˆ 2 τ y ˆ z ˆ 2 note that a similar strategy can confidently be used for the strain components to obtain von mises strain distribution over an ics8 element finally either equivalent stress or strain values can be a viable indicator for damage detection evaluation as part of the shm process colombo et al 2019 3 numerical results in this section three different example problems are solved to validate the accuracy of the present ics8 ifem formulation these problems consist of a simply supported quarter cylinder an offshore wind turbine substructure and a stiffened cylindrical shell these structures have been effectively utilized in manufacturing process of various types of marine structures including ship and offshore structures therefore displacement and stress monitoring of these structural components is vital to enhance the regulations of classification societies such as abs dnv regarding the installation of shm systems on marine structures firstly detailed variations of displacements strains and stresses are produced for each problem analysed in this section through performing high fidelity fem analyses then the results of direct fem analyses are adopted as reference solutions and utilized to numerically simulate the experimental strain measurements obtained from in situ strain rosettes the simulated sensor data is then used as an input for conducting the ifem analysis of each benchmark problem after that shape strain and stress sensing of each structure is achieved utilizing different ics8 models having dense and sparse sensor placements following to the ics8 ifem analysis the reconstructed continuous form of displacement strain and stress results are examined in detail finally these results are compared against those of high fidelity fem reference solutions for validation purposes 3 1 a simply supported quarter cylinder in this example a quarter cylinder with length of l 10 m radius of r 5 m and thickness of 2 h is considered to validate the accuracy of the present ics8 element formulation the radius to thickness ratio of the cylinder is varied as r 2 h 4 6 10 20 50 100 to examine the shape sensing capabilities of the element for thick moderately thick and thin shell structures as depicted in fig 3 a two different coordinate systems are utilized to describe geometrical properties applied boundary conditions and kinematic relations of the shell body a global cartesian coordinate system x y z with the origin 0 0 0 is located at the centre of the right hand side circle moreover cylindrical axes θ 1 θ 2 with positive directions shown in fig 3 a is located at the position of x y z 0 5 0 which can be easily utilized to define the thickness coordinate as θ 3 θ 1 θ 2 the volume of the shell domain can be readily described by lower and upper bounds of the cylindrical coordinates θ 1 0 l θ 2 0 π 2 and θ 3 h h in addition the coordinate θ 3 0 defines the mid surface of the shell body the bottom θ 3 h and top surface θ 3 h of the cylindrical shell is subjected to varying bi sinusoidal pressure q θ 1 θ 2 q 0 sin π θ 1 l sin 2 θ 2 where the pressure magnitude is q 0 0 5 mpa along positive θ 3 direction the cylinder is made of an isotropic material with elastic modulus of the e 210 gpa and poisson s ratio of ν 0 3 each edge of the cylinder is simply supported and the following translation and rotation constraints are accordingly applied 32a v w θ 1 0 along the edges x 0 and x l 32b u w θ 2 0 along the edge y 0 32c u v θ 2 0 along the edge z 0 where u v w represent the uniform translations along positive x y z coordinates and θ 1 θ 2 denote positive and negative rotations around positive θ 2 θ 1 coordinates respectively fig 3 a note that artificial drilling dof θ 3 corresponding to counter clockwise rotations around positive θ 3 is fully constrained all over the shell domain since the current geometry has a monolithic structure i e has no built up segmented stiffened structural topology uniform discretization of the shell domain is performed by subdividing each edge of the cylinder with n e equal segments as such defining a mesh with n e n e number of quadrilateral elements for instance this subdivision parameter is set to n e 8 for the discretization shown in fig 3 b an accurate reference solution of this problem is obtained through performing a direct fem analysis utilizing a high fidelity mesh with n e 50 for this fem analysis an in house finite element code kefal and oterkus 2014 that implements the eight node element developed by ahmad et al 1970 is used the maximum values of the displacements and rotations obtained from fem analysis are listed in table 1 for varying radius to thickness rations as emphasized by the superscript ref these values are used as the reference normalization factors for analysis results hence the normalized displacement rotation and stress results can be defined as 33 χ χ χ r e f χ u v w u t θ 1 θ 2 θ t σ v where the u t and θ t represents the magnitude of total displacements and rotations at mid surface of the shell which can be defined as 34a u t u 2 v 2 w 2 34b θ t θ 1 2 θ 2 2 as opposed to the high fidelity fem analysis the ifem analysis of the cylinder is conducted by using four different coarse ics8 models with element subdivisions of n e 4 8 16 the inverse elements of each ics8 model have two strain rosettes located at the centroid of the elements namely one located at the centroid of top surface and the other located on centroid of the bottom surfaces of the shell body hence the total number sensors required for an ics8 model can be simply calculated as 2 n e n e although the required number of sensor may be seen as impractical in the real test environment the sparse deployment of sensors can be also utilized for the sake of decreasing the number of sensor since the verification of the new element formulation is of the main concern an ideal benchmark case with dense sensor data i e each ics8 element has in situ strain data is being performed herein nevertheless the usage of sparse sensor data is emphasized in the next examples for demonstrating practical utility of the proposed ics8 ifem methodology the in situ surface strain measurements are not smoothed via smoothing techniques hence the experimentally measured transverse shear strains are not available in the ifem analysis therefore the weighting coefficients associated with section strains are set to as ω ε 1 and ω γ 10 3 for all the ics8 elements to compare the performance of the ics8 element with respect to a planar ifem element in the case of cylindrical structures the quarter cylinder is also modelled using the iqs4 inverse shell element kefal et al 2016 which includes hierarchical drilling dof and is able to perform shape sensing of the present geometry note that the same problem set up and strain sensor positions used in the case of ics8 models are kept same when modelling the cylinder with iqs4 elements the accuracies of each ics8 and iqs4 models are assessed for varying radius to thickness ratios of the cylinder for this assessment the relative errors between ifem ics8 and iqs4 and fem predictions for maximum values of total displacements total rotations and von mises stresses are calculated as listed in tables 2 4 respectively according to the percent differences listed in table 2 the ics8 model corresponding to n e 4 produces nearly 2 and less than 1 error for maximum total displacements of thick 4 r 2 h 6 and moderately thick or thin 10 r 2 h 100 cylinders respectively for the same discretization n e 4 however the performance of iqs4 flat element is much lower as compared to the ics8 element especially in the range of thick regimes 4 r 2 h 10 as listed in table 2 the iqs4 element produces at least two times larger percent error than those of ics8 thus demonstrating the superior shape sensing capability of ics8 element for cylindrical structures nevertheless for displacement reconstruction of the thin cylinders the iqs4 predictions become more accurate with percent errors less than 3 as compared to those of reference fem solutions when the density of sensors increases the percent difference between ics8 and fem results dramatically decreases for all the thickness ranges whereas the percent difference between iqs4 and fem results become less than 2 for only thin cylinders 20 r 2 h 100 note that almost a perfect match between ifem and fem solutions for u t displacement is achieved for ics8 models of n e 8 16 as listed in table 2 the percent differences listed in table 3 demonstrate that a coarse ics8 discretization n e 4 can fairly reconstruct the total rotations of the cylinder with less than 6 and 9 errors for thin and thick regimes respectively expectedly denser strain data result in a highly accurate rotation sensing for ics8 model n e 8 16 however the iqs4 discretizations produced a large percent difference e g more than 20 for the thick cylinders 4 r 2 h 6 as listed in table 3 this clearly demonstrate the superior performance of the ics8 element as compared to the flat ifem element in terms of shape sensing of curved cylinders on the other hand as listed in table 4 the percent differences of the von mises stress predictions indicate that a coarse ics8 model n e 4 with few strain rosettes can still maintain an accurate stress sensing of thin moderately thick and thick cylinders with nearly 5 6 and 7 error in maximum stress predictions respectively this accuracy improve up only 2 and less than 1 errors for thick or thin cylinders once a finer ics8 mesh n e 16 with a denser strain data is utilized in the analysis however similar to shape sensing results the iqs4 element produced a large error in the reconstruction of the von mises stresses as listed in table 4 although this error decrease up to 2 for a fine discretization n e 16 in the thickness range of 20 r 2 h 100 the iqs4 element still produced more than 10 error for thick and moderately thick cylinders 4 r 2 h 10 overall these results demonstrate the increased performances of the ics8 element over a flat ifem element in terms of both shape and stress sensing of the curved structures to examine the overall quality of full field deformation and stress reconstruction contours of individual components of the total displacement and rotations as well as von mises stresses are compared between ifem ics8 and iqs4 and fem analysis in figs 4 13 the displacement and rotation results given in figs 4 10 correspond to the radius to thickness ratio of r 2 h 20 whereas the von mises stress results are plotted for three different thickness regimes r 2 h 4 20 100 in figs 11 13 the ics8 n e 8 model produces almost indistinguishable displacement contours from those of fem as shown in figs 4 7 proving full field shape sensing capability of the present ics8 element formulation although the iqs4 n e 8 model can also predict highly accurate distributions of individual displacement components over the cylindrical geometry the accuracy of predicted maximum values are less than those of ics8 n e 8 model as depicted in figs 4 7 on the other hand a superior accuracy is achieved with the ics8 n e 8 model for the individual components rotations and total rotation as depicted in figs 8 10 however the contours of θ 1 and θ 2 rotation produced iqs4 elements just fairly agree with those of reference solutions and the maximum values of θ 2 predicted using iqs4 elements are underestimated with a percent difference of 9 2 as compared to those of reference solutions fig 9 the von mises stress contours presented in figs 11 13 demonstrate that ics8 element formulation can be suitably utilized to perform highly accurate and full field stress sensing of thick moderately thick and thin structures instead the iqs4 element can estimate reasonably accurate von mises stress results for only thickness ranges of r 2 h 20 100 as depicted in figs 12 and 13 and it underestimates the maximum values of the von mises stress for thick cylinder as depicted in fig 11 overall the ifem results of the benchmark problem investigated in this section validate the high accuracy of the ics8 formulation and demonstrate the superior performance of this curved element against flat ifem iqs4 element for shape and stress sensing of cylindrical structures 3 2 an offshore wind turbine substructure in this example the practical application of ics8 ifem methodology to a substructure of offshore wind turbine or met mast is concerned according to dnv 2015 the term substructure refers to the component of the supporting structure shown in fig 14 a that extends upwards from the soil and links the foundation and the main structure e g wind turbine tower the substructures of offshore met masts are typically long cylindrical structures fig 14 a a similar geometrical topology is selected in this case which is composed of two cylinders having different lengths and radiuses and connected to each other by a cone the exact dimensions of the substructure geometry are described in fig 14 b and the overall structure has the uniform thickness of 2 h 40 mm note that an appropriate geometrical smoothness between connecting edges of cone and cylinders is ensured by using fillet operation with radius of 10 m when generating the cad model of the substructure the length to thickness ratios of the cylinders are higher than 400 thus the present geometry can be considered as a very thin offshore structure the material of the substructure is an isotropic material having elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of e 210 gpa and ν 0 3 respectively a global cartesian coordinate system is located at the centre of the bottom circle for which the axes orientation is clearly presented in fig 14 b since the bottom edge is directly connected to the foundation the clamped boundary condition is applied along the circumference of the circle at position z 0 for clarity of specifying the θ 1 and θ 2 local rotations as shown in fig 14 b direction of the a 1 i and a 2 i vectors are chosen to be aligned with the positive circumferential and normal direction of the global z axis i e denoted by the curvilinear axes θ 1 and θ 2 respectively besides the artificial drilling rotation is fully constraint herein as it has no contribution to the global displacement solution of an unstiffened structure regarding the loading condition of the present offshore substructure two different uniformly distributed pressures are applied over the surface located at z 45 m the first pressure is along positive y axis with magnitude of p y 1440 π h d 0 kpa representing the resultant wave force along the lateral surface of the substructure on the other hand the second pressure represents the mass of the main structure along negative z axis with magnitude of p z 720 π h d 0 kpa where the symbol d 0 3 5 h m denotes the internal diameter of the top circle based on the aforementioned geometrical and material properties as well as the applied boundary condition a high fidelity fem analysis is performed utilizing a uniformly distributed mesh consisted of 2160 quadrilateral elements and 39 312 dof as depicted in fig 15 a to obtain the reference solutions of the current example the direct fem analysis is conducted based on the high fidelity mesh and using the in house finite element code developed by kefal and oterkus 2014 herein the reference strains i e obtained from fem analysis are utilized to simulate the experimentally measured strains used in the ifem analysis the maximum values of most critical reference solutions including translational displacements along y and z coordinates total displacements top surface strains along global z axis and von mises stresses are listed in table 5 similar to the example problem solved in section 3 1 these maximum values are used as normalization factors to obtain normalized variations of χ χ v w u t ε z z σ v displacement strain and stresses predicted in both fem and ifem analyses as depicted in fig 15 b the ifem mesh is consisted of only 240 ics8 elements with 4464 dof thus it is much coarser than those of fem four different ics8 models are examined for shape strain and stress sensing of the substructure the first model is the dense model for which all the ics8 elements have two strain rosettes at the element centroid and for brevity this model is denoted by the uppercase latter d the second and third model have sparse deployment of strain rosettes and only 80 ics8 elements are being instrumented with strain rosettes for both models however the selection of the sensor locations are different for these models and they are distinguished from each other by labels s1 and s2 as depicted in fig 16 note that the uppercase letter s herein refers to the word sparse the fourth model has most sparse deployment of sensors as it has 40 ics8 elements instrumented with sensors as depicted in fig 16 this last model is labelled as vs which signifies the availability of very sparse strain data for the ifem analysis as such nearly 83 of the total number of ics8 elements are chosen to be strain less elements with no experimentally measured data the weighting coefficients associated with transverse shear strains are set to as w γ 10 3 for all the elements of each ics8 model d s1 s2 vs for those elements missing in situ surface strain measurement in the sparse ics8 models s1 s2 vs the weights corresponding to the in plane section strains are set to as ω ε 10 3 this adjustment of weighting coefficients can ensure the highly accurate strain interpolation connection between the elements having available in situ strain measurement as listed in table 6 the percent difference between ifem and fem results for the maximum values of the v w u t displacements are less than 1 3 5 8 1 6 and 1 for the ics8 models of d s1 s2 and vs remarkably the sparse ics8 models s2 and vs provide almost as same accuracy as the ics8 model with full strain measurement since the main deformation mode of the substructure is due to bending moment around x axis the strains at the maximum and minimum y coordinates reach their maximum values therefore collecting the strain measurements from these positions become critical for the ifem analysis hence the sparse ics8 s2 model can predict the displacement response of the substructure better than the ics8 s1 model regarding the strain and or stress sensing results all the ics8 models produce small percent differences mainly less than 1 as listed in table 6 overall these percent differences reveal the high accuracy of utilizing ics8 model for the purpose of strain and stress monitoring utilizing a coarse ifem mesh with few sparse strain data this accuracy is not valid only for the maximum values of the normalized variables but also is maintained over the three dimensional space of the geometry this fact is demonstrated by comparing the contours of each ics8 model for normalized total displacement strain along z axis and von mises stress with those of fem as presented in figs 17 21 in fig 17 the variation of displacement contours for all the ifem models are almost indiscernible from each other and those of reference fem solutions the deformed shapes presented in fig 18 has the same magnification factor of 17 for clearly visualizing the structural response and fairly comparing ifem sparse models s2 and vs with those of high fidelity fem according to this comparison the deformed shapes produced by ifem and fem are indistinguishable from each other this comparison indicates that the ifem ics8 formulation enables highly accurate reconstruction of deformed shape of the substructure even with very sparse strain measurements regarding the strain and stress contours presented in figs 19 and 20 a superior match of contours is observed between fem and ifem s2 analyses whereas there is small differences available between the strain and stress contours of ifem s1 and vs models and their reference fem solutions nevertheless the global maximum and minimum position of both strains and stresses are almost perfectly captured by these sparse ics8 models the distribution of the strain and stress contours can be readily improved through mapping the displacement field obtained from coarse mesh to a fine mesh and then performing the post processing step on the fine mesh as depicted in fig 21 the strain and stress variation corresponding to the ics8 vs model is detailed utilizing the same high fidelity mesh of fem analysis in the aforementioned post processing procedure note that no extra ifem analysis is required in this case only the mesh used in the visualization process is detailed for calculating high strain or stress gradients over small size elements overall these comparisons validate and demonstrate the superior predictive capabilities of ics8 formulation accounting for strain and stress sensing with dense and or sparse strain measurements on a coarse ifem discretization 3 3 a stiffened cylindrical shell this example problem concerns the practical application of the ics8 element to real time displacement and stress monitoring of a curved stiffened thin walled cylindrical panel in fact the structural geometry of a stiffened cylindrical shell can be considered as a representative of structural component of floating marine structures e g longitudinally and transversely stiffened bilge strake therefore the following ifem analysis can be beneficial for improving real time shm capabilities for curved marine structural components the cylindrical panel is a one quarter of a cylinder having same length and radius of 6 m and a uniform thickness of 30 mm as presented in fig 22 the inner surface of the panel is orthogonally stiffened using seventeen equally spaced 6 m long stiffeners having a rectangular cross section with height and thickness of 0 2 m and 30 mm respectively the cylindrical panel is also transversely supported by three different continuous and equally spaced girders as depicted in fig 22 these girders have an l beam cross section with height of 0 4 m flange size of 0 2 m and thickness of 50 mm the isotropic material of the overall structure has elastic modulus of e 210 gpa poisson s ratio of ν 0 3 and density of ρ 7850 kg m 3 a global cartesian coordinate system x y z with the origin 0 0 0 is located at the centre of the right hand side circle and positive directions of the coordinate axes are clearly shown in fig 22 the artificial drilling rotations are enabled to easily perform ifem analysis on built up structural the topology of overall structure the u v and w define the positive translations along the positive x y and z axes respectively moreover the θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 rotations define the global counter clockwise rotations around positive directions of global coordinate system as shown in fig 22 according to global coordinate system antisymmetric constraint boundary conditions are imposed to the four edges of the panel therefore the exact kinematic boundary conditions along x 0 m and x 6 m edges including the stiffeners edges are 35a v w θ 1 0 along y 0 m edge including girders edges is 35b u w θ 2 0 and along z 0 m edge including girders edges is 35c u v θ 3 0 the outer surface of the panel is subjected to the sinusoidal time varying pressure of p t p 0 sin π t where the t represents the time and its variation is defined as t 0 05 s 4 s herein the p 0 is the magnitude of the pressure having the direction pointing out the inner surface of the panel and is a uniform function of spatial coordinates defined as p 0 0 25 mpa as depicted in fig 23 a the stiffened cylindrical shell is discretized using uniformly distributed 10 890 curved eight node quadrilateral element having 196 926 dof utilizing this fine mesh a linear elastic time domain fem analysis of the panel is performed for this purpose the commercial finite element software ansys is used and the shell281 element i e an eight node curved shell element based on fsdt and time step size of δ t 0 05 s with total 80 time steps are selected during the analysis as a result of the high fidelity fem analysis the transient structural response of the panel reference solutions is obtained and also real time strain sensor measurements are simulated on the other hand the ifem analysis is performed by using a coarse discretization consisted of uniformly distributed 582 ics8 elements with 10 542 dof as presented in fig 23 b three different sensor placement models are examined for this coarse ifem mesh the first model is a dense model and labelled as d since all the ics8 elements have surface mounted strain sensors the second model is a sparse sensor placement model labelled as s and has the sensors located at the ics8 elements on the cylindrical panel as shown in fig 24 for this model total number of ics8 element having strain sensor is only 216 meaning that more than 50 of the sensors used in ics8 d model is removed the final sensor placement model has only the sensors around the centre lines and perimeter of the panel as depicted in fig 24 in this model almost half of the sensor available in ics8 s model is removed and the total number ics8 elements having strain sensors immensely reduced to 104 only hence the third ics8 model is referred to as very sparse sensor placement model and is labelled as vs since the resulting deformations of the panel exhibit a coupled membrane bending behaviour the strain sensors are placed on top and bottom surfaces of the elements for all the ics8 d s vs models span to thickness ratios of all structural components of the cylindrical shell is suitable to take the advantage of thin shell assumptions thus the weighting coefficients for the transverse shear strains are adjusted to ω γ 10 3 during the ifem analysis besides the weighting coefficients associated with in plane strains are set to as ω ε 10 3 for the strain less elements with no strain sensors available in ics8 s and vs models to examine the structural response of the stiffened panel and validate the accuracy of ics8 element for real time monitoring time histories of the displacement strain and stress quantities predicted by ifem analysis are compared with those of fem analysis for this comparison five different critical locations p i i 1 2 5 where the individual structural response quantities reach their maximum values are selected as listed in table 7 for a clarity the exact locations of these points are also presented in depicted in fig 22 the time domain variations of translational displacement dofs w v and u calculated at points p 1 p 2 and p 3 are presented in figs 25 27 respectively in these figures the results of ics8 ifem d s vs models are clearly compared with reference fem solutions according these comparisons the ifem d and s models produce almost the same transient trend as their reference w and v solutions depicted in figs 25 and 26 additionally a similar small difference is observed between ifem vs and fem predictions for time varying response of w displacements fig 25 whereas this difference is almost disappeared for the v displacements fig 26 on the other hand there is a small inaccuracy available in the ifem d and s predictions for the u displacements as shown in fig 27 although the inaccuracy increases further for the ifem vs predictions of the u displacements the magnitude of the u displacement is much smaller than the v and w displacements hence this error has no large contribution to the accuracy of total displacements predictions of ifem analysis as depicted in fig 28 the ifem vs model predicts highly accurate total displacements at point p 1 which fairly agrees with reference solution an improved accuracy is observed by the denser ifem models d and vs for predicting u t displacement as their results are almost perfectly matching with those of fem as shown in fig 28 overall these results validate the accuracy of ics8 formulation for usage in real time displacement monitoring of a complex structural geometry by utilizing a very sparse deployment of strain sensors additionally as depicted in figs 29 and 30 the strain and von mises stress monitoring results obtained from all ifem d s and vs models clearly correlate with those of reference solutions especially the ifem and fem predictions for the global strains ε y y along global y axis at point p 4 are almost indistinguishable from each other whereas there is a very small inaccuracy less than 5 produced by ifem models for the von mises stresses measured at point p 5 the maximum total displacement and von mises stress predicted by fem analysis at time t 1 1 5 s are listed in table 8 which are utilized to obtain u t and σ v normalized variations presented in figs 31 33 as can be seen from fig 31 the percent difference between ifem d and s models and the reference solutions for the maximum u t displacement is 0 7 and 1 4 respectively in addition the contours of ifem d and s models and reference solution for u t displacements are almost indiscernible from each other hence these results reveal a superior accuracy of ifem ics8 formulation for full field shape sensing moreover the percent difference between ifem vs and reference solutions for the maximum total displacement becomes 5 6 as shown in fig 31 nevertheless the overall predictions of maximum and minimum locations of u t displacement are guaranteed by the ifem vs model hence it has fair enough accuracy for performing full field shape sensing the deformed shapes obtained from the high fidelity fem and low fidelity ifem vs analysis are compared at three different time steps as depicted in fig 32 herein the total deformations of both ifem vs and fem at different time steps are magnified with the same factor of 233 to make a clear comparison between deformed shapes at different time steps as well as to fairly examine the shape sensing capability of ifem vs model against reference solutions as can be seen from the fig 32 that the ifem vs model predicts almost indistinguishable deformed shapes from those of fem at all three time steps these results clearly demonstrate the potential practical applicability and high accuracy of the ics8 element for performing shape sensing analysis utilizing only sparse strain measurements finally the σ v stress contours obtained from fem and ifem d s vs analysis at time step of t 1 are compared in fig 33 for all the ics8 models the maximum and minimum stress locations are in well agreement between the ifem and reference solutions remarkably although there is no strain sensor available at the girders stiffeners in very sparse ics8 model the stress contours demonstrate that ifem vs analysis can produce highly accurate stress variations along the surfaces of the girders and stiffeners a much better accuracy can be expectedly obtained in the cylindrical panel as there are in situ sensors available in fact there are small discrepancy with less than 13 error obtained between ifem and fem predictions for the maximum σ v stresses which is due to the high strain stress gradients available in the high fidelity fem mesh as explain earlier in section 3 2 usage of a finer mesh in the post processing step of the ifem analysis can overcome this problem and increase the accuracy and smoothness of the stress contours for this purpose the displacements predicted in ifem d model is mapped onto a finer mesh and stresses are calculated over the new mesh depicted in fig 34 herein the percent difference between the ifem d and fem diminishes to only 6 4 which can be assesses as an accurate stress prediction this way the smoothness of overall stress contours is increased as well to sum up these results prove that ics8 ifem framework can predict accurate three dimensional and full field stress solutions for stress sensing analysis of curved structures 4 conclusions the ifem algorithm uses discrete surface strain measurements to dynamically track the full field and three dimensional displacements strains and stresses of a structure in the present study the displacement and stress monitoring of cylindrical marine structures subjected to static and dynamic loads are accomplished based on a novel ics8 ifem formulation the minimization of a weighted least squares functional with respect to the unknown displacements i e the general mathematical concept of ifem methodology originally introduced by tessler and spangler 2005 is adopted to derive the resulting element equations of the ics8 element this new inverse shell element ics8 has a curvilinear geometry and utilizes the kinematic assumptions of the mindlin s plate theory therefore the ics8 element can be an attractive candidate for modelling curved thin thick structures through a low fidelity discretization strategies with sparse strain sensor deployment additionally the modelling capability of the ics8 element is enhanced by introducing an artificial drilling dof for shape sensing analysis of built up stiffened curved structures hence various large scale marine structures including ship hulls onshore and offshore structures submarines etc can be suitably modelled with a coarser mesh than as what flat surface inverse elements offer in the current study a smooth distribution of strains is ensured by performing direct high fidelity fem analysis for the representative curved marine structural components this simulated strain data represented experimentally measured strains used as an input for the ifem analysis of the marine structures investigated in the present study according to comparison between the ifem and reference fem analysis for various results it is demonstrated that the ics8 element can very accurately predict the full field deformed shapes global strain and stress distributions by using even very sparse sensor data and a low fidelity discretization for these comparisons the effect of sensor locations and sparsity of strain data on solution accuracy of displacements strains and stresses is also detailed as a result the

22565,known as shape sensing real time reconstruction of a structure s three dimensional displacements using a network of in situ strain sensors and measured strains is a vital technology for structural health monitoring shm the inverse finite element method ifem is a mechanics based shape sensing algorithm shown to be fast accurate and robust for usage as a part of shm systems in this study a new eight node curved inverse shell element named as ics8 is developed based on ifem methodology the kinematic relations of ics8 element are established through combining kinematics of solid shell together with kinematic assumptions of first order shear deformation plate theory the new weighted least squares functional of ifem uses the complete set of section strains consistent with the ics8 element i e 1 coupled membrane bending and 2 transverse shear section strains the ics8 element accommodates a curvilinear isoparametric coordinate system thus it can be effectively utilized to model cylindrical curved geometries with a coarse discretization this practical modelling capability can allow a relatively sparse placement of sensors therefore providing an advantage for real time shape sensing of curvilinear geometries the high accuracy and practical utility of the ics8 element is demonstrated for different cylindrical marine structures through examining coarse ics8 discretizations with dense and sparse sensor deployments keywords shape sensing structural health monitoring cylindrical marine structures inverse finite element method ifem degenerated shell element strain sensors 1 introduction cylindrical and or curved shell structures are abundantly found in marine and offshore engineering industry and their strength is commonly increased by utilizing beam type stiffeners and girders the stiffened curved panels are mainly preferred in design of aircraft fuselages ship hulls and structural elements of land transport vehicles cho et al 2007 tran et al 2014 marine vessels generally operate under extreme loading conditions and are exposed to various types of material degradation such as pitting corrosion erosion corrosion due to the interaction of the steel and salted seawater thus resulting in expensive failure of its structural components accumulation of hidden undetected failures may gradually decrease the operational lifetime of the marine structures and finally lead to life loses of human beings sea pollution and catastrophic failure of the whole structure therefore it is necessary to avoid these failure types and acquire accurate information regarding structural safety of curved marine structures ship hull girders in real time for this purpose a structural health monitoring shm that can perform three dimensional full field displacement strain and stress monitoring has to be installed on board the prominence of installing a suitable shm system was also recognized by the international maritime organization imo in 1994 then various classification societies including abs 1995 2015 lr 2004 and dnv 2011 are regulated new rules for performing hull stress monitoring a robust shm system should integrate a network of strain sensors such as conventional strain gauges fibre bragg grating fbg sensor and wireless strain sensors into a structure then the real time data generated through these sensors should be accurately transmitted and processed in an on board database next the processed data should be used as an input for a smart and robust shape and stress sensing algorithm for performing accurate displacement and stress monitoring of the structure the overall information has to be gathered so quickly as such being suitable for the strain data acquisition in real time over the last two decades a plenty of researchers considered hull stress monitoring as a challenging research study and proposed novel shm systems to give some of the pioneering examples wang et al 2001 utilized distributed fbg sensor technology to monitor structural health of composite hulls and demonstrated various signal processing methods for characterizing hull structural response and sea states similar applications of fbg sensors to strain and stress monitoring of ship and offshore structures were presented by kageyama et al 1998 torkildsen et al 2005 murawski et al 2012 and majewska et al 2014 some of which included case studies performed under static and dynamic loads in particular shen et al 2015 analysed and optimized strain transfer ratio of two types of fbg strain rosettes to accurately monitor multidimensional strains and stresses of ship hulls their assessment methodology involved numerical and experimental investigations carried out through finite element method fem and tensile test machines respectively nielsen et al 2011 proposed an shm system for hull girders of container ships to monitor fatigue damage rates their fatigue calculation method involved whipping stresses and on board estimation of sea states obtained from full scale measurements more recently johnson et al 2018 also presented a fatigue assessment strategy through utilization of wireless hull monitoring system for high speed aluminium hulls most recently yan et al 2019 developed an shm system for investigating fatigue characteristics of the stinger structure of pipe laying ship to increase its safety in the operational conditions in addition xu and haddara 2001 utilized full scale ship motion measurements to continuously monitor wave induced bending moments of the ship hull girders moreover the ice load response of ship hull s bow structure was estimated through a continuous strain monitoring which was correlated with a fem model to investigate the effect of ice thickness and speed of the vessel leira et al 2009 furthermore kahl et al 2018 outlined classification society rules for hull monitoring systems provided the potential advantages of using hull monitoring systems and finally justified these benefits through performing full scale measurements on containerships most importantly phelps and morris 2013 reviewed various hull structural monitoring systems via presenting their technical specifications for usage in navy ships and deference industry apart from the shm systems developed for marine structures more general frameworks were developed to solve the inverse problem of shape sensing analysis for example the inverse methods introduced by maniatty and zabaras 1989 1994 and schnur and zabaras 1990 used a typical regularization approach presented by tikhonov and arsenin 1977 another example is shape sensing of beams and plates for which extensive research were conducted by scientist including davis et al 1996 kim and cho 2004 jones et al 1998 and nishio et al 2010 recently gherlone et al 2018 published a wide literature review explaining the detailed historical chain of the shape and stress sensing algorithms for beam and plate structures apart from the shm systems and inverse methods mentioned in the previous paragraphs a revolutionary shape sensing algorithm known as inverse finite element method ifem was developed by tessler and spangler 2003 2005 in fact none of the previous inverse methods has the same shape sensing capabilities as what ifem algorithm offers mainly these capabilities are threefold 1 no requirement of any loading and or material information for shape sensing in real time 2 easiness to take into account complex structural geometry and or boundary conditions and 3 high robustness stability and accuracy even with few and or noisy strain measurements hence the ifem methodology satisfies all necessities of shm systems its original mechanics based algorithm calculates a least squares functional of the errors between analytical strain measures and their experimental counterparts this error is minimized through finding the stationary point of the least squares functional with respect to the unknown nodal degrees of freedom thus allowing to obtain a final set of equations based on strain displacement relations only the structural deformed shape can be obtained through solving the ifem s final equations in real time this shape sensing information is also a fundamental constituent for reconstructing such structural response quantities as strain stress and failure for this reason ifem is a robust shape sensing tool that may assist shm of shell type critical engineering structures including some components of marine structures in addition none of the present hull shm systems recommended by class societies and researchers can be used to monitor three dimensional full field displacements strains and stresses of a marine vessel as elaborated between second and fourth paragraph of this section these current shm systems commonly monitor only several points on the structure such as two points on the weather deck amidships the questions which remain unanswered are how much reliable information these shm systems provide to the master operator of the ship in terms of the ships global structural health and if any alternative solutions exist the possible answer of this question lies in the merits of ifem for marine structures as compared to those of existing hull shm systems the main benefit is that ifem can provide full field three dimensional structural deformed shape and strain stress distribution of any marine structure this benefit brings a latter beneficial aspect of ifem specific to marine structures in other words utilization of suitable failure criteria along with the ifem s three dimensional strains stresses can allow the detection of possible damage stress locations including stress corrosion cracking i e most fundamental type of local failure experienced in marine structures moreover ifem s main output strain stress can be utilized even further to predict material degradation caused by corrosion erosion since the corroded parts of a ship structure will have a reduced stiffness they will be exposed to high strain gradients during the service life of the vessel therefore the strain jumps in the real time history of strains predicted by ifem may be logically used to predict possible corrosion damages in fact these particular abnormal structural behaviours are unique to the marine structures hence ifem has various potential merits for marine structures which may not be offered by the traditional hull shm systems available today over the last fifteen year the ifem methodology has attracted a considerable amount of attention in the field of shm for instance tessler and spangler 2004 developed a robust inverse shell element imin3 based on the kinematic relations of the first order shear deformation theory fsdt after the first ifem based element imin3 in the literature kefal et al 2016 introduced the first four node quadrilateral inverse shell element iqs4 the applications of these element types include complex aerospace quach et al 2005 vazquez et al 2005 tessler 2007 cerracchio et al 2015a and marine structures kefal and oterkus 2015 2016a 2016b as well as structural damage identification colombo et al 2019 most recently tessler et al 2018 demonstrated the high accuracy of imin3 element for structures undergoing large displacements also the imin3 element were experimentally demonstrated as a robust candidate for full field reconstruction of deformations loads and stresses of aerospace wing structures from in situ sensor measurements miller et al 2016 papa et al 2017 moreover kefal 2017 and kefal et al 2018a b demonstrated that the ifem iqs4 methodology can be suitably applied to shm of marine structures having a structural complexity and travelling in oceanographically complex sea conditions regarding the beam element types gherlone et al 2012 introduced the first efficient inverse frame element in the literature by utilizing the kinematics of timoshenko beam theory whose applications included various laboratory experiments gherlone et al 2014 song and liang 2018 zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2018 apart from beam plate shell types of inverse elements one of the most recent applications of ifem methodology was successfully demonstrated by mooij et al 2019 through development of tetrahedral and hexahedral inverse solid elements the authors make use of tikhonov regularization in the variational principle of the ifem formulation as well and presented remarkable patched tests for examining the accuracy of the inverse solid elements additionally advanced ifem formulations for shape and stress sensing of laminated composite and sandwich plate shell structures are proposed by cerracchio et al 2015a b and kefal et al 2017 2018b the authors extended the capabilities of original ifem formulation i e based on fsdt by utilizing kinematic assumptions of refined zigzag theory rzt developed by tessler et al 2010 recently the ifem rzt formulations were utilized to establish a sensor placement strategy for composite wing shaped models kefal and yildiz 2017 to the best of author s knowledge there is no study on the development of a curved inverse shell element based on ifem formulation for shape sensing of thin thick or moderately thick curved shell structures with the focus on the cylindrical marine structures the main and novel aim of this study is to develop the ifem formulation of a new eight node curved inverse shell element called as ics8 for the first time in the literature herein the main focus of the new ics8 element is to create accurate ifem models with a relatively coarse discretization using only few strain sensor measurements the overall formulation is suitable for performing accurate shape sensing analysis of thin thick and stiffened unstiffened shell structures the kinematic relations of the ics8 element are based on a typical degenerated shell element ahmad et al 1970 established by coupling of solid shell kinematics with fsdt plate theory the weighted least squares functional of ifem ics8 methodology uses the 1 coupled membrane bending section strains and 2 transverse shear sections strains this functional is minimized with respect to the unknown displacements to construct local ifem equations of the ics8 element various example problems including a simply supported cylinder an offshore substructure and a curved stiffened panel are analysed to validate the accuracy of the ics8 element through a numerical comparison with reference solutions obtained by using fem analysis as a result high precision of the ifem reconstructed displacements are obtained for different ics8 models having dense sparse and very sparse sensor distributions finally practical locations of sensors are clearly identified and demonstrated on the geometry examined in each particular example for future applications of shm systems 2 the ifem formulation for curved shells 2 1 an eight node curved inverse shell element ics8 element in this section the mathematical formulation of a new eight node curved inverse shell element ics8 is derived for shape sensing of flat curved structures the ics8 element has six degrees of freedom dof per node including an artificial drilling rotation and utilizes the kinematic relations of the fsdt coupled with solid shell kinematics the inclusion of artificial drilling rotation enables one to easily construct the global system of equations during the modelling of built up structures such as stiffened curved shells this way the singularity problems that may arise at the co planar nodes when solving global systems of the equations can be avoided without any further treatment in the final set of equations consider a generic thick shell element having curved bounding surfaces and straight sections across the thickness direction as depicted in fig 1 to describe the geometrical features of this particular curved shell three different coordinate systems are utilized the x x y z t vector shown in fig 1 represents a cartesian global coordinate system which is utilized to establish geometry of the shell body and translational dof of the ics8 element moreover the x ˆ x ˆ y ˆ z ˆ t vector denotes a cartesian local coordinate system to define local strain components within the ics8 element domain furthermore the ξ ξ η ζ t vector denotes an isoparametric coordinate system where ζ is a linear coordinate defining the thickness direction of the ics8 element and the ξ and η are curvilinear components defining the curved surface of the element for a fixed ζ coordinate these isoparametric coordinates vary between 1 and 1 on the respective surfaces of the element thus they are suitable to define the isoparametric shape functions and also perform the gauss integration within the volume of the element for a given top and bottom surface global coordinates of the nodes i e x i and x i i 1 8 the nodal coordinates of mid surface of the element x i the thickness of the element at the nodes 2 h i and the director mid surface normal direction of the each node of the element a 3 i can be readily calculated as 1a x i x i x i 2 1b 2 h i x i x i 1c a 3 i x i x i x i x i where the symbol stands for the norm of the respective vectors for clarity the vector quantities x i x i x i and a 3 i and the scalar quantity 2 h i is depicted in fig 1 utilizing these geometrical quantities of the ics8 element the transformation between isoparametric curvilinear and global cartesian coordinate systems can be established as 2 x i 1 8 n i ξ η x i ζ h i a 3 i where the n i ξ η function represents the quadratic serendipity shape functions that takes a value of unity at the node i and zero all other nodes these shape functions are given as 3a n i ξ η 1 4 1 ξ ξ i 1 η η i ξ i ξ η i η 1 i 1 2 3 4 3b n i ξ η 1 2 1 η η i 1 ξ 2 i 5 7 3c n i ξ η 1 2 1 ξ ξ i 1 η 2 i 6 8 where the ξ i η i coordinates are the isoparametric coordinates of the nodes as depicted in fig 1 utilizing the same shape functions the global the displacement vector u u x u y u z t of any material point within the ics8 element can be approximated as 4 u i 1 8 n i ξ η u i ζ h i a 1 i θ 1 i a 2 i θ 2 i where the nodal dof of the ics8 element consists of uniform translations vector i e u i u i v i w i t whose individual components are along positive x y z global axes and counter clockwise positive θ 1 i and clockwise negative θ 2 i rotations around the directions of the a 2 i and a 1 i vectors defined at node i respectively fig 1 the a 1 i and a 2 i vector are orthogonal unit vectors whose cross product is coincident with the director a 3 i a 1 i a 2 i these vectors can be readily established using the vector transformation procedures explained by ahmad et al 1970 although the kinematic relations given in eq 4 uses only 5 nodal dof an artificial drilling rotation is separately introduced at each node i to easily handle the problems involving built up structural components by using ics8 element hence the nodal displacement dof vector of the element is defined as 5a u e u 1 e u 2 e u 8 e t 5b u i e u i v i w i θ 1 i θ 2 i θ 3 i t i 1 2 8 where the symbol θ 3 i i 1 2 8 denotes the artificial drilling rotation defined as a counter clockwise positive rotation around the director a 3 i fig 1 accordingly the eq 4 can be restated using the u e vector as 6a u n 1 e n 8 e u 1 e u 8 e n e u e 6b n i e n i ξ η i ζ h i a 1 i ζ h i a 2 i 0 where i is an 3 3 identity matrix n i e is the 3 6 shape function matrix at node i and n e is the 3 48 shape function matrix of the ics8 element as described in fig 1 the local displacements of a material point in the shell body is defined by u ˆ u x ˆ u y ˆ u z ˆ t vector consistent with the local cartesian coordinate system x ˆ to derive the linear elastic in plane and transverse shear strains within the ics8 element domain the respective first order derivatives of the component of u ˆ vector should be taken with respect to local coordinates as 7a ε ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ u x ˆ x ˆ u y ˆ y ˆ u x ˆ y ˆ u y ˆ x ˆ 7b γ γ x ˆ z ˆ γ y ˆ z ˆ u x ˆ z ˆ u z ˆ x ˆ u y ˆ z ˆ u z ˆ y ˆ where the vectors ε and γ define the in plane and transverse shear strains note that normal strains ε z ˆ z ˆ along z ˆ axis is neglected based on the basic shell assumption of zero thickness stretch deformation the local strain components given in eq 7 can be calculated individually by utilizing the derivatives of the global displacements with respect to global coordinates as 8 u ˆ x ˆ t u ˆ y ˆ t u ˆ z ˆ t t t u x t u y t u z t t where t is the transformation matrix defining the local to the global transformations of strains this matrix can be established using the directions of local coordinates as 9a t t 1 t 2 t 3 with 9b t 3 x ξ x η x ξ x η 9c t 1 x ξ x ξ 9d t 2 t 3 t 1 for a constant ζ coordinate namely any surface along the thickness of the shell the unit normal vector of t 3 can be established through the cartesian products of the x χ χ ξ η vectors as given in eq 9b note that the t 3 vector becomes identical to the director a 3 i at the nodes i 1 2 8 for the thickness coordinate of ζ 0 i e mid surface once the unit vector of t 1 i e tangent to the ξ coordinate is calculated as given in eq 9c it can be used together with the normal vector to define the unit surface tangent vector t 2 which is the orthogonal to both t 1 and t 3 vectors the derivatives of the displacements with respect to the global coordinates given in eq 8 can be established by the chain rule with the following matrix relation 10a u χ 1 j 1 u χ 2 χ 1 x y z χ 2 ξ η ζ where j is jacobian matrix defined as 10b j x ξ t x η t x ζ t t substituting eq 10 into eq 8 while making use of eq 6 and subsequently allocating the relevant strains into eq 7 yield to the continuous analytical in plane and transverse shear strains defined in terms of the element dof vector u e as 11 ε u e γ u e b ε u e b γ u e where the matrices b ε and b γ are quadratic functions of ξ η and linear function of ζ these matrices define the relation between strains and displacement dof of an individual ics8 element they also contain the combinations of relevant derivatives of the serendipity shape functions with respect to ξ η and are explicitly provided in appendix a 2 2 experimentally measured strains for the ics8 ifem formulation the ifem variational functional operates based on the match between the analytical and experimental section strains through minimizing the relative error between these strains therefore the experimental strain measurements are one of the main input of the ifem formulation and have a significant role to predict accurate results these in situ measurements can be readily obtained from discrete locations of the structure being monitored via the surface mounted strain gauges or fiber bragg grating fbg sensors for instance consider the curved plate that is installed with two strain rosettes at top and bottom surface of the same mid surface positions x i i 1 n as shown in fig 2 herein the symbol n stands for the number of discrete positions having two strain rosettes utilizing the strain readings obtained from these sensors the experimental counterpart of ε i e analytical strains given by eq 11 can be calculated at any thickness coordinate ζ of the discrete positions x i as 12 e i 1 ζ 2 ε x ˆ x ˆ ξ i η i ε y ˆ y ˆ ξ i η i γ x ˆ y ˆ ξ i η i 1 ζ 2 ε x ˆ x ˆ ξ i η i ε y ˆ y ˆ ξ i η i γ x ˆ y ˆ ξ i η i i 1 n where the symbols χ ξ i η i χ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ and χ ξ i η i χ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ denote the individual in situ strain components measured at top ζ 1 and bottom ζ 1 surface of the position ξ η ξ i η i note that these experimental strain components are measured along the local axes x ˆ y ˆ z ˆ since there are three strain measurements available on either top bottom surface of a particular in plane coordinate ξ η ξ i η i they can easily be transformed to local directions via strain transformation equations thus allowing the strain rosettes to be orientated with respect to the most practical direction in the real test environment the discrete strain data χ ξ i η i χ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ can be smoothed a priori by using smoothing techniques e g smoothing element analysis developed by tessler et al 1998 1999 or they can be fitted to continuous functions through surface curve fitting techniques lancaster and salkauskas 1986 as a result of the smoothing procedure the surface strain measurements can be represented by nearly c 1 continuous polynomial functions as 13 χ ξ i η i χ ξ η χ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ ε x ˆ x ˆ ε y ˆ y ˆ γ x ˆ y ˆ where the i subscript drops naturally as the strain data become available anywhere on top and bottom surface of ics8 elements utilizing the continuous surface strain measurements one can attain the continuous form of the experimental in plane strains e as 14 e 1 ζ 2 ε x ˆ x ˆ ξ η ε y ˆ y ˆ ξ η γ x ˆ y ˆ ξ η 1 ζ 2 ε x ˆ x ˆ ξ η ε y ˆ y ˆ ξ η γ x ˆ y ˆ ξ η the availability of c 1 continuous in situ strains e may be crucial in terms of predicting experimental transverse shear strains γ in fact the calculation of neither continuous nor discrete form of γ strain is not easy as compared to those of e strains because the in situ surface strain measurements cannot be directly used to calculate in situ transverse shear strains however the first order derivatives of e strains with respect to global coordinates can be utilized together with fsdt s equilibrium governing equations to calculate the γ strains the mathematical details of this calculation was provided by kefal 2017 for the iqs4 element to predict accurate values of γ strains a similar procedure can be applied to ics8 element as well the transverse shear strains may have a considerable effect on the accuracy of shape sensing of a thick plate shell structure nevertheless transverse shear deformations are much smaller than the membrane bending and membrane bending coupled deformations in the deformation of thin shells hence the contributions of γ measurements can be safely omitted in the variational principle of ifem formulation for thin shells such as structural components of marine structures 2 3 weighted least squares functional of ics8 ifem methodology the original ifem methodology introduced by tessler and spangler 2003 2005 accounts for the three main actions of the deformations through a least squares functional containing the individual errors between analytical and experimental sections strains these deformation fields consist of membrane bending and transverse shear deformations of the fsdt herein a similar framework of the ifem s variational functional is adopted for this purpose the difference between the analytical section strains ε u e and γ u e and the experimental counterparts e and γ can be defined using error functions of ϕ i u e i ε γ respectively as 15a ϕ ε u e ε u e e 15b ϕ γ u e γ u e γ where the error functional of ϕ ε u e and ϕ γ u e are associated with the coupled membrane bending deformations and transverse shear deformations respectively firstly inserting these strain errors into squared l2 norms i e known as euclidean norms then associating each squared norm with suitable weighting coefficients of ω ε and ω γ and finally integrating the sum of weighted squared error norms over the volume individual ics8 element v a general weighted least squares functional φ e u e can be established for the ics8 ifem methodology as 16 φ e u e 1 v v ω ε ϕ ε u e 2 ω γ ϕ γ u e 2 d v where the φ e u e is also normalized with respect to volume of the element to acquire a dimensionless functional consistent with the strain measures note that the squared l2 norms 2 of the ϕ i u e i ε γ vectors given in eq 16 can be calculated as the dot product of vectors ϕ i ϕ i conceptually the weighting coefficients was introduced into the least squares functional of ifem methodology by tessler et al 2011 the utilization of weighting constants become critical for problems involving a sparse deployment of strain sensors in other words they have to be adjusted properly for those problems involving relatively few experimental strain data because the complete coherence between theoretical strain components and their experimentally measured values is maintained overall the structure through these weighting coefficients to elaborate on the usage of ω i i ε γ consider an ics8 element having strain rosettes on both top and bottom surface of the element and assume that all the experimental section strains are computed for this element for this scenario one to one strain data is available between analytical and experimental strains therefore all weighting constants will be equal to unity i e ω i 1 i ε γ on the other hand if an element has undetermined in situ strain component namely the value of either e or γ is not available for an ics8 element in the analysis then a small value compared to unity λ 1 such as λ 10 3 needs to be assigned to the corresponding weighting constant and the associated squared norm should be reduced to the following form 17a ϕ ε 2 ε u e 2 for ω ε λ 17b ϕ γ 2 γ u e 2 for ω γ λ for clarity consider a structure being fully instrumented with sensors such that each single ics8 element has two strain rosettes at the top and bottom surfaces of the elements also assume that the structure is thin and henceforth the experimental transverse shear strain measures are not calculated for the analysis for this case the weighting constants can be adjusted as ω ε 1 and ω γ λ thus the φ e u e functional takes the following form for every ics8 element 18 φ e u e 1 v v ε u e e 2 λ γ u e 2 d v another example would be a thin structure being partially instrumented with sensors for this example the ics8 elements having strain rosettes would have the same φ e u e functional given in eq 18 whereas the φ e u e functional for ics8 elements having no in situ strain data strain less elements takes the following form 19 φ e u e 1 v v λ ε u e 2 λ γ u e 2 d v then the ics8 model can have the ability to maintain the required interpolation connectivity between the elements with strain sensor data according to the general form of the ifem formulation tessler and spangler 2005 the deformed shape of a individual element can be obtained by minimizing the φ e u e functional with respect to the nodal dof of the element u e as 20 φ e u e u e 0 k e u e f e where the left hand side matrix of the element k e is same for predefined locations of strain sensors thus its sub elements are not affected by experimentally measured strain values on the other hand the element right hand side vector f e is a function of the in situ strain reading therefore this vector has to be updated at the each increment of strain data acquisition utilizing the b i i ε γ matrices and their corresponding weighting constants ω i i ε γ the k e matrix and f e vector can be explicitly as 21a k e 1 v v ω ε b ε t b ε ω γ b γ t b γ d v 21b f e 1 v v ω ε b ε t ε ω γ b γ t γ d v where the integration over the volume of an ics8 element can be numerically performed through gauss quadrature rule it is important to compute a suitable k e matrix that can avoid any spurious modes and is well posed matrix after the application of problem specific constraint boundary condition for this purpose a full integration scheme with 3 3 2 number of gauss points along the isoparametric coordinates ξ η ζ is recommended however in practice it is also possible to perform a reduced integration via 2 2 2 number of gauss points along the ξ η ζ coordinates in order to avoid from the occurrence of membrane bending and or transverse shear locking the other types of gauss integration schemes and their effect on the solution accuracy of forward fem analysis are detailed by onate 2013 which can be utilized for the ifem analysis as well after calculating the k e matrix for an ics8 element using the eq 21a an artificial stiffness term corresponding to each drilling rotation dof θ 3 i i 1 2 8 has to be inserted into the diagonal positions of the k e matrix this way the spurious modes or any singular solution due to the inclusion of drilling dof can be readily avoided these terms can be selected and located at the specific diagonal positions corresponding to each node s drilling dof available in the k e matrix as 22 k j j e λ min k j 1 j 1 e k j 2 j 2 e j 6 i i 1 2 8 where λ is a small positive coefficient e g λ 10 5 and the k j j e k j 1 j 1 e k j 2 j 2 e coefficients are diagonal terms of the k e matrix corresponding to the rotational dof of θ 1 i θ 2 i θ 3 i i 1 2 3 respectively herein the first and second subscripts available in the parentheses represent the row and column positions of the stiffness coefficients belonging to the k e matrix the experimental section strains in eq 21b are continuous therefore their values at the gauss points should be used to perform an accurate integration as explained earlier in section 2 2 once the discrete surface measurement at arbitrary locations ξ i η i i 1 n are obtained from sensor and smoothed using smoothing curve fitting techniques the experimental measurements at the specific gauss points can be easily generated on the other hand if the discrete in situ section strains values e i or γ i is willing to be directly used in eq 21b without any smoothing curve fitting operations the sensor has to be located at the coordinates of gauss points on top and bottom surfaces of the element domain this way the predicted values of f e vector will still be highly accurate however it would be costly in practice since at least 3 3 or 2 2 number of strain measurements at both top and bottom surface of the element is necessary for performing the full or reduced integrations respectively alternatively the e i or γ i in situ strains computed at arbitrary locations ξ i η i i 1 n can be averaged to obtain average uniform in situ strain values for an ics8 element as 23 χ a v g i 1 n χ i n χ e γ which can be then assigned to every gauss point during the numerical integration in other words the continuous form of the experimental section strains given in eq 21b is considered to be uniform within the inverse element χ χ a v g χ e γ although this assumption will produce some error in the computation of f e vector it will not affect the overall reconstruction of the deformed shape since an individual element domain has an infinitesimally small surface as compared to the whole surface of the structure being monitored in case of a single in situ section strain being available per ics8 element namely n 1 and thus i 1 only two strain rosettes are patched on the top and bottom of the in plane position of ξ 1 η 1 for this case the centroid of the element ξ 1 η 1 0 0 may be preferably chosen to mount these sensors on the structure for obtaining the e 1 or γ 1 the values in average sense over the ics8 element the local matrix vector equations calculated using the eq 21 can be assembled to obtain a global resulting equation system for a discretized structure for this purpose the conventional assembly process of the fem can be reliably used in the ifem analysis as well as a result the final global equations can be defined as 24a k u f with 24b k ω e 1 n e l t e t k e t e 24c f ω e 1 n e l t e t f e 24d u ω e 1 n e l t e t u e where the ω e 1 n e l symbol denotes element assembly operator with the parameter n e l defining the total number of inverse finite elements and the k f and u are the global left hand side matrix right hand side vector and dof vector of the discretized structure respectively the matrix t e given in eq 24b d is an element transformation matrix performing relevant transformation of the necessary nodal dof of the element from local to global coordinate system in fact the translational dof have already been defined according to the global coordinate system therefore the element equations corresponding to local rotational dof needs to be transformed before the assembly process for this particular transformation the following definition of t e matrix can be utilized 25a t e i 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t 1 e 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t 2 e 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t 8 e with 25b t i e a 2 i t a 1 i t a 3 i t t i 1 2 8 where the unit directions of the local rotations and the director vector defined at nodes a 1 i a 2 i a 3 i are utilized to perform suitable transformations from local to global coordinate systems and the 3 3 identity matrix i keeps the globally defined translational dof available in their original coordinate system after the transformation operation before solving the eq 24a to obtain the global displacement dof the singularity mode i e rigid body motions of the discretized structure available in k matrix should be disabled through application of problem specific displacement boundary conditions as a result the eq 24a can be reduced to final system of equations as 26 k r u r f r where the k r matrix is surely non singular invertible as it become a positive definite matrix herein it is worthy to note that f r vector has to be updated based on the in situ strain readings whereas the k r matrix doesn t require measured strain information and will not necessarily be updated for any deformation cycle accordingly the k r matrix can be inverted only once hence allowing a quick solution for the eq 26 namely a simple matrix vector multiplication k r 1 f r overall this operation can be performed quickly in real time and provide the unknown dof vector u r at any real time the global structural response namely total deformed shape of the structure can be acquired through calculating the magnitude of displacement vectors available at any position over the solution domain for this purpose the evaluated global displacements u r can be transformed back to the local coordinate system to make the u e vectors become available for all the element substituting the values of u e vector into eq 6 the magnitude of u vector provides the information of total displacements at any spatial coordinate as 27 u t ξ η ζ u ξ η ζ u x u y u z inserting the evaluated local displacements dof u e into the eq 11 yields to calculation of the continuous strain components throughout the ics8 element domain then determination of stress distribution over the element domain can be possible by using the evaluated strain components within the hooke s law for isotropic material as 28 σ τ d 0 0 g ε γ where the vectors σ and τ represent the in plane and transverse shear stress components in element coordinate system x ˆ respectively according to the plane stress condition i e zero stress along the thickness coordinate z ˆ the coupled membrane bending stiffness d and the transverse shear stiffness g of the material can be defined as 29 d e 1 ν 2 1 ν 0 ν 1 0 0 0 1 ν 2 g e 2 1 ν 1 0 0 1 where the symbols e and ν represent elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of the material respectively the individual components of stress vectors may be symbolically defined as 30 σ σ x ˆ x ˆ σ y ˆ y ˆ τ x ˆ y ˆ t τ τ x ˆ z ˆ τ y ˆ z ˆ t which can be utilized to calculate an equivalent stress distribution based on the von mises failure criterion with the boundary conditions of general plane stress i e σ z ˆ z ˆ 0 and τ i z ˆ 0 i x ˆ y ˆ as 31 σ v σ x ˆ x ˆ 2 σ y ˆ y ˆ 2 σ x ˆ x ˆ σ y ˆ y ˆ 3 τ x ˆ y ˆ 2 τ x ˆ z ˆ 2 τ y ˆ z ˆ 2 note that a similar strategy can confidently be used for the strain components to obtain von mises strain distribution over an ics8 element finally either equivalent stress or strain values can be a viable indicator for damage detection evaluation as part of the shm process colombo et al 2019 3 numerical results in this section three different example problems are solved to validate the accuracy of the present ics8 ifem formulation these problems consist of a simply supported quarter cylinder an offshore wind turbine substructure and a stiffened cylindrical shell these structures have been effectively utilized in manufacturing process of various types of marine structures including ship and offshore structures therefore displacement and stress monitoring of these structural components is vital to enhance the regulations of classification societies such as abs dnv regarding the installation of shm systems on marine structures firstly detailed variations of displacements strains and stresses are produced for each problem analysed in this section through performing high fidelity fem analyses then the results of direct fem analyses are adopted as reference solutions and utilized to numerically simulate the experimental strain measurements obtained from in situ strain rosettes the simulated sensor data is then used as an input for conducting the ifem analysis of each benchmark problem after that shape strain and stress sensing of each structure is achieved utilizing different ics8 models having dense and sparse sensor placements following to the ics8 ifem analysis the reconstructed continuous form of displacement strain and stress results are examined in detail finally these results are compared against those of high fidelity fem reference solutions for validation purposes 3 1 a simply supported quarter cylinder in this example a quarter cylinder with length of l 10 m radius of r 5 m and thickness of 2 h is considered to validate the accuracy of the present ics8 element formulation the radius to thickness ratio of the cylinder is varied as r 2 h 4 6 10 20 50 100 to examine the shape sensing capabilities of the element for thick moderately thick and thin shell structures as depicted in fig 3 a two different coordinate systems are utilized to describe geometrical properties applied boundary conditions and kinematic relations of the shell body a global cartesian coordinate system x y z with the origin 0 0 0 is located at the centre of the right hand side circle moreover cylindrical axes θ 1 θ 2 with positive directions shown in fig 3 a is located at the position of x y z 0 5 0 which can be easily utilized to define the thickness coordinate as θ 3 θ 1 θ 2 the volume of the shell domain can be readily described by lower and upper bounds of the cylindrical coordinates θ 1 0 l θ 2 0 π 2 and θ 3 h h in addition the coordinate θ 3 0 defines the mid surface of the shell body the bottom θ 3 h and top surface θ 3 h of the cylindrical shell is subjected to varying bi sinusoidal pressure q θ 1 θ 2 q 0 sin π θ 1 l sin 2 θ 2 where the pressure magnitude is q 0 0 5 mpa along positive θ 3 direction the cylinder is made of an isotropic material with elastic modulus of the e 210 gpa and poisson s ratio of ν 0 3 each edge of the cylinder is simply supported and the following translation and rotation constraints are accordingly applied 32a v w θ 1 0 along the edges x 0 and x l 32b u w θ 2 0 along the edge y 0 32c u v θ 2 0 along the edge z 0 where u v w represent the uniform translations along positive x y z coordinates and θ 1 θ 2 denote positive and negative rotations around positive θ 2 θ 1 coordinates respectively fig 3 a note that artificial drilling dof θ 3 corresponding to counter clockwise rotations around positive θ 3 is fully constrained all over the shell domain since the current geometry has a monolithic structure i e has no built up segmented stiffened structural topology uniform discretization of the shell domain is performed by subdividing each edge of the cylinder with n e equal segments as such defining a mesh with n e n e number of quadrilateral elements for instance this subdivision parameter is set to n e 8 for the discretization shown in fig 3 b an accurate reference solution of this problem is obtained through performing a direct fem analysis utilizing a high fidelity mesh with n e 50 for this fem analysis an in house finite element code kefal and oterkus 2014 that implements the eight node element developed by ahmad et al 1970 is used the maximum values of the displacements and rotations obtained from fem analysis are listed in table 1 for varying radius to thickness rations as emphasized by the superscript ref these values are used as the reference normalization factors for analysis results hence the normalized displacement rotation and stress results can be defined as 33 χ χ χ r e f χ u v w u t θ 1 θ 2 θ t σ v where the u t and θ t represents the magnitude of total displacements and rotations at mid surface of the shell which can be defined as 34a u t u 2 v 2 w 2 34b θ t θ 1 2 θ 2 2 as opposed to the high fidelity fem analysis the ifem analysis of the cylinder is conducted by using four different coarse ics8 models with element subdivisions of n e 4 8 16 the inverse elements of each ics8 model have two strain rosettes located at the centroid of the elements namely one located at the centroid of top surface and the other located on centroid of the bottom surfaces of the shell body hence the total number sensors required for an ics8 model can be simply calculated as 2 n e n e although the required number of sensor may be seen as impractical in the real test environment the sparse deployment of sensors can be also utilized for the sake of decreasing the number of sensor since the verification of the new element formulation is of the main concern an ideal benchmark case with dense sensor data i e each ics8 element has in situ strain data is being performed herein nevertheless the usage of sparse sensor data is emphasized in the next examples for demonstrating practical utility of the proposed ics8 ifem methodology the in situ surface strain measurements are not smoothed via smoothing techniques hence the experimentally measured transverse shear strains are not available in the ifem analysis therefore the weighting coefficients associated with section strains are set to as ω ε 1 and ω γ 10 3 for all the ics8 elements to compare the performance of the ics8 element with respect to a planar ifem element in the case of cylindrical structures the quarter cylinder is also modelled using the iqs4 inverse shell element kefal et al 2016 which includes hierarchical drilling dof and is able to perform shape sensing of the present geometry note that the same problem set up and strain sensor positions used in the case of ics8 models are kept same when modelling the cylinder with iqs4 elements the accuracies of each ics8 and iqs4 models are assessed for varying radius to thickness ratios of the cylinder for this assessment the relative errors between ifem ics8 and iqs4 and fem predictions for maximum values of total displacements total rotations and von mises stresses are calculated as listed in tables 2 4 respectively according to the percent differences listed in table 2 the ics8 model corresponding to n e 4 produces nearly 2 and less than 1 error for maximum total displacements of thick 4 r 2 h 6 and moderately thick or thin 10 r 2 h 100 cylinders respectively for the same discretization n e 4 however the performance of iqs4 flat element is much lower as compared to the ics8 element especially in the range of thick regimes 4 r 2 h 10 as listed in table 2 the iqs4 element produces at least two times larger percent error than those of ics8 thus demonstrating the superior shape sensing capability of ics8 element for cylindrical structures nevertheless for displacement reconstruction of the thin cylinders the iqs4 predictions become more accurate with percent errors less than 3 as compared to those of reference fem solutions when the density of sensors increases the percent difference between ics8 and fem results dramatically decreases for all the thickness ranges whereas the percent difference between iqs4 and fem results become less than 2 for only thin cylinders 20 r 2 h 100 note that almost a perfect match between ifem and fem solutions for u t displacement is achieved for ics8 models of n e 8 16 as listed in table 2 the percent differences listed in table 3 demonstrate that a coarse ics8 discretization n e 4 can fairly reconstruct the total rotations of the cylinder with less than 6 and 9 errors for thin and thick regimes respectively expectedly denser strain data result in a highly accurate rotation sensing for ics8 model n e 8 16 however the iqs4 discretizations produced a large percent difference e g more than 20 for the thick cylinders 4 r 2 h 6 as listed in table 3 this clearly demonstrate the superior performance of the ics8 element as compared to the flat ifem element in terms of shape sensing of curved cylinders on the other hand as listed in table 4 the percent differences of the von mises stress predictions indicate that a coarse ics8 model n e 4 with few strain rosettes can still maintain an accurate stress sensing of thin moderately thick and thick cylinders with nearly 5 6 and 7 error in maximum stress predictions respectively this accuracy improve up only 2 and less than 1 errors for thick or thin cylinders once a finer ics8 mesh n e 16 with a denser strain data is utilized in the analysis however similar to shape sensing results the iqs4 element produced a large error in the reconstruction of the von mises stresses as listed in table 4 although this error decrease up to 2 for a fine discretization n e 16 in the thickness range of 20 r 2 h 100 the iqs4 element still produced more than 10 error for thick and moderately thick cylinders 4 r 2 h 10 overall these results demonstrate the increased performances of the ics8 element over a flat ifem element in terms of both shape and stress sensing of the curved structures to examine the overall quality of full field deformation and stress reconstruction contours of individual components of the total displacement and rotations as well as von mises stresses are compared between ifem ics8 and iqs4 and fem analysis in figs 4 13 the displacement and rotation results given in figs 4 10 correspond to the radius to thickness ratio of r 2 h 20 whereas the von mises stress results are plotted for three different thickness regimes r 2 h 4 20 100 in figs 11 13 the ics8 n e 8 model produces almost indistinguishable displacement contours from those of fem as shown in figs 4 7 proving full field shape sensing capability of the present ics8 element formulation although the iqs4 n e 8 model can also predict highly accurate distributions of individual displacement components over the cylindrical geometry the accuracy of predicted maximum values are less than those of ics8 n e 8 model as depicted in figs 4 7 on the other hand a superior accuracy is achieved with the ics8 n e 8 model for the individual components rotations and total rotation as depicted in figs 8 10 however the contours of θ 1 and θ 2 rotation produced iqs4 elements just fairly agree with those of reference solutions and the maximum values of θ 2 predicted using iqs4 elements are underestimated with a percent difference of 9 2 as compared to those of reference solutions fig 9 the von mises stress contours presented in figs 11 13 demonstrate that ics8 element formulation can be suitably utilized to perform highly accurate and full field stress sensing of thick moderately thick and thin structures instead the iqs4 element can estimate reasonably accurate von mises stress results for only thickness ranges of r 2 h 20 100 as depicted in figs 12 and 13 and it underestimates the maximum values of the von mises stress for thick cylinder as depicted in fig 11 overall the ifem results of the benchmark problem investigated in this section validate the high accuracy of the ics8 formulation and demonstrate the superior performance of this curved element against flat ifem iqs4 element for shape and stress sensing of cylindrical structures 3 2 an offshore wind turbine substructure in this example the practical application of ics8 ifem methodology to a substructure of offshore wind turbine or met mast is concerned according to dnv 2015 the term substructure refers to the component of the supporting structure shown in fig 14 a that extends upwards from the soil and links the foundation and the main structure e g wind turbine tower the substructures of offshore met masts are typically long cylindrical structures fig 14 a a similar geometrical topology is selected in this case which is composed of two cylinders having different lengths and radiuses and connected to each other by a cone the exact dimensions of the substructure geometry are described in fig 14 b and the overall structure has the uniform thickness of 2 h 40 mm note that an appropriate geometrical smoothness between connecting edges of cone and cylinders is ensured by using fillet operation with radius of 10 m when generating the cad model of the substructure the length to thickness ratios of the cylinders are higher than 400 thus the present geometry can be considered as a very thin offshore structure the material of the substructure is an isotropic material having elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of e 210 gpa and ν 0 3 respectively a global cartesian coordinate system is located at the centre of the bottom circle for which the axes orientation is clearly presented in fig 14 b since the bottom edge is directly connected to the foundation the clamped boundary condition is applied along the circumference of the circle at position z 0 for clarity of specifying the θ 1 and θ 2 local rotations as shown in fig 14 b direction of the a 1 i and a 2 i vectors are chosen to be aligned with the positive circumferential and normal direction of the global z axis i e denoted by the curvilinear axes θ 1 and θ 2 respectively besides the artificial drilling rotation is fully constraint herein as it has no contribution to the global displacement solution of an unstiffened structure regarding the loading condition of the present offshore substructure two different uniformly distributed pressures are applied over the surface located at z 45 m the first pressure is along positive y axis with magnitude of p y 1440 π h d 0 kpa representing the resultant wave force along the lateral surface of the substructure on the other hand the second pressure represents the mass of the main structure along negative z axis with magnitude of p z 720 π h d 0 kpa where the symbol d 0 3 5 h m denotes the internal diameter of the top circle based on the aforementioned geometrical and material properties as well as the applied boundary condition a high fidelity fem analysis is performed utilizing a uniformly distributed mesh consisted of 2160 quadrilateral elements and 39 312 dof as depicted in fig 15 a to obtain the reference solutions of the current example the direct fem analysis is conducted based on the high fidelity mesh and using the in house finite element code developed by kefal and oterkus 2014 herein the reference strains i e obtained from fem analysis are utilized to simulate the experimentally measured strains used in the ifem analysis the maximum values of most critical reference solutions including translational displacements along y and z coordinates total displacements top surface strains along global z axis and von mises stresses are listed in table 5 similar to the example problem solved in section 3 1 these maximum values are used as normalization factors to obtain normalized variations of χ χ v w u t ε z z σ v displacement strain and stresses predicted in both fem and ifem analyses as depicted in fig 15 b the ifem mesh is consisted of only 240 ics8 elements with 4464 dof thus it is much coarser than those of fem four different ics8 models are examined for shape strain and stress sensing of the substructure the first model is the dense model for which all the ics8 elements have two strain rosettes at the element centroid and for brevity this model is denoted by the uppercase latter d the second and third model have sparse deployment of strain rosettes and only 80 ics8 elements are being instrumented with strain rosettes for both models however the selection of the sensor locations are different for these models and they are distinguished from each other by labels s1 and s2 as depicted in fig 16 note that the uppercase letter s herein refers to the word sparse the fourth model has most sparse deployment of sensors as it has 40 ics8 elements instrumented with sensors as depicted in fig 16 this last model is labelled as vs which signifies the availability of very sparse strain data for the ifem analysis as such nearly 83 of the total number of ics8 elements are chosen to be strain less elements with no experimentally measured data the weighting coefficients associated with transverse shear strains are set to as w γ 10 3 for all the elements of each ics8 model d s1 s2 vs for those elements missing in situ surface strain measurement in the sparse ics8 models s1 s2 vs the weights corresponding to the in plane section strains are set to as ω ε 10 3 this adjustment of weighting coefficients can ensure the highly accurate strain interpolation connection between the elements having available in situ strain measurement as listed in table 6 the percent difference between ifem and fem results for the maximum values of the v w u t displacements are less than 1 3 5 8 1 6 and 1 for the ics8 models of d s1 s2 and vs remarkably the sparse ics8 models s2 and vs provide almost as same accuracy as the ics8 model with full strain measurement since the main deformation mode of the substructure is due to bending moment around x axis the strains at the maximum and minimum y coordinates reach their maximum values therefore collecting the strain measurements from these positions become critical for the ifem analysis hence the sparse ics8 s2 model can predict the displacement response of the substructure better than the ics8 s1 model regarding the strain and or stress sensing results all the ics8 models produce small percent differences mainly less than 1 as listed in table 6 overall these percent differences reveal the high accuracy of utilizing ics8 model for the purpose of strain and stress monitoring utilizing a coarse ifem mesh with few sparse strain data this accuracy is not valid only for the maximum values of the normalized variables but also is maintained over the three dimensional space of the geometry this fact is demonstrated by comparing the contours of each ics8 model for normalized total displacement strain along z axis and von mises stress with those of fem as presented in figs 17 21 in fig 17 the variation of displacement contours for all the ifem models are almost indiscernible from each other and those of reference fem solutions the deformed shapes presented in fig 18 has the same magnification factor of 17 for clearly visualizing the structural response and fairly comparing ifem sparse models s2 and vs with those of high fidelity fem according to this comparison the deformed shapes produced by ifem and fem are indistinguishable from each other this comparison indicates that the ifem ics8 formulation enables highly accurate reconstruction of deformed shape of the substructure even with very sparse strain measurements regarding the strain and stress contours presented in figs 19 and 20 a superior match of contours is observed between fem and ifem s2 analyses whereas there is small differences available between the strain and stress contours of ifem s1 and vs models and their reference fem solutions nevertheless the global maximum and minimum position of both strains and stresses are almost perfectly captured by these sparse ics8 models the distribution of the strain and stress contours can be readily improved through mapping the displacement field obtained from coarse mesh to a fine mesh and then performing the post processing step on the fine mesh as depicted in fig 21 the strain and stress variation corresponding to the ics8 vs model is detailed utilizing the same high fidelity mesh of fem analysis in the aforementioned post processing procedure note that no extra ifem analysis is required in this case only the mesh used in the visualization process is detailed for calculating high strain or stress gradients over small size elements overall these comparisons validate and demonstrate the superior predictive capabilities of ics8 formulation accounting for strain and stress sensing with dense and or sparse strain measurements on a coarse ifem discretization 3 3 a stiffened cylindrical shell this example problem concerns the practical application of the ics8 element to real time displacement and stress monitoring of a curved stiffened thin walled cylindrical panel in fact the structural geometry of a stiffened cylindrical shell can be considered as a representative of structural component of floating marine structures e g longitudinally and transversely stiffened bilge strake therefore the following ifem analysis can be beneficial for improving real time shm capabilities for curved marine structural components the cylindrical panel is a one quarter of a cylinder having same length and radius of 6 m and a uniform thickness of 30 mm as presented in fig 22 the inner surface of the panel is orthogonally stiffened using seventeen equally spaced 6 m long stiffeners having a rectangular cross section with height and thickness of 0 2 m and 30 mm respectively the cylindrical panel is also transversely supported by three different continuous and equally spaced girders as depicted in fig 22 these girders have an l beam cross section with height of 0 4 m flange size of 0 2 m and thickness of 50 mm the isotropic material of the overall structure has elastic modulus of e 210 gpa poisson s ratio of ν 0 3 and density of ρ 7850 kg m 3 a global cartesian coordinate system x y z with the origin 0 0 0 is located at the centre of the right hand side circle and positive directions of the coordinate axes are clearly shown in fig 22 the artificial drilling rotations are enabled to easily perform ifem analysis on built up structural the topology of overall structure the u v and w define the positive translations along the positive x y and z axes respectively moreover the θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 rotations define the global counter clockwise rotations around positive directions of global coordinate system as shown in fig 22 according to global coordinate system antisymmetric constraint boundary conditions are imposed to the four edges of the panel therefore the exact kinematic boundary conditions along x 0 m and x 6 m edges including the stiffeners edges are 35a v w θ 1 0 along y 0 m edge including girders edges is 35b u w θ 2 0 and along z 0 m edge including girders edges is 35c u v θ 3 0 the outer surface of the panel is subjected to the sinusoidal time varying pressure of p t p 0 sin π t where the t represents the time and its variation is defined as t 0 05 s 4 s herein the p 0 is the magnitude of the pressure having the direction pointing out the inner surface of the panel and is a uniform function of spatial coordinates defined as p 0 0 25 mpa as depicted in fig 23 a the stiffened cylindrical shell is discretized using uniformly distributed 10 890 curved eight node quadrilateral element having 196 926 dof utilizing this fine mesh a linear elastic time domain fem analysis of the panel is performed for this purpose the commercial finite element software ansys is used and the shell281 element i e an eight node curved shell element based on fsdt and time step size of δ t 0 05 s with total 80 time steps are selected during the analysis as a result of the high fidelity fem analysis the transient structural response of the panel reference solutions is obtained and also real time strain sensor measurements are simulated on the other hand the ifem analysis is performed by using a coarse discretization consisted of uniformly distributed 582 ics8 elements with 10 542 dof as presented in fig 23 b three different sensor placement models are examined for this coarse ifem mesh the first model is a dense model and labelled as d since all the ics8 elements have surface mounted strain sensors the second model is a sparse sensor placement model labelled as s and has the sensors located at the ics8 elements on the cylindrical panel as shown in fig 24 for this model total number of ics8 element having strain sensor is only 216 meaning that more than 50 of the sensors used in ics8 d model is removed the final sensor placement model has only the sensors around the centre lines and perimeter of the panel as depicted in fig 24 in this model almost half of the sensor available in ics8 s model is removed and the total number ics8 elements having strain sensors immensely reduced to 104 only hence the third ics8 model is referred to as very sparse sensor placement model and is labelled as vs since the resulting deformations of the panel exhibit a coupled membrane bending behaviour the strain sensors are placed on top and bottom surfaces of the elements for all the ics8 d s vs models span to thickness ratios of all structural components of the cylindrical shell is suitable to take the advantage of thin shell assumptions thus the weighting coefficients for the transverse shear strains are adjusted to ω γ 10 3 during the ifem analysis besides the weighting coefficients associated with in plane strains are set to as ω ε 10 3 for the strain less elements with no strain sensors available in ics8 s and vs models to examine the structural response of the stiffened panel and validate the accuracy of ics8 element for real time monitoring time histories of the displacement strain and stress quantities predicted by ifem analysis are compared with those of fem analysis for this comparison five different critical locations p i i 1 2 5 where the individual structural response quantities reach their maximum values are selected as listed in table 7 for a clarity the exact locations of these points are also presented in depicted in fig 22 the time domain variations of translational displacement dofs w v and u calculated at points p 1 p 2 and p 3 are presented in figs 25 27 respectively in these figures the results of ics8 ifem d s vs models are clearly compared with reference fem solutions according these comparisons the ifem d and s models produce almost the same transient trend as their reference w and v solutions depicted in figs 25 and 26 additionally a similar small difference is observed between ifem vs and fem predictions for time varying response of w displacements fig 25 whereas this difference is almost disappeared for the v displacements fig 26 on the other hand there is a small inaccuracy available in the ifem d and s predictions for the u displacements as shown in fig 27 although the inaccuracy increases further for the ifem vs predictions of the u displacements the magnitude of the u displacement is much smaller than the v and w displacements hence this error has no large contribution to the accuracy of total displacements predictions of ifem analysis as depicted in fig 28 the ifem vs model predicts highly accurate total displacements at point p 1 which fairly agrees with reference solution an improved accuracy is observed by the denser ifem models d and vs for predicting u t displacement as their results are almost perfectly matching with those of fem as shown in fig 28 overall these results validate the accuracy of ics8 formulation for usage in real time displacement monitoring of a complex structural geometry by utilizing a very sparse deployment of strain sensors additionally as depicted in figs 29 and 30 the strain and von mises stress monitoring results obtained from all ifem d s and vs models clearly correlate with those of reference solutions especially the ifem and fem predictions for the global strains ε y y along global y axis at point p 4 are almost indistinguishable from each other whereas there is a very small inaccuracy less than 5 produced by ifem models for the von mises stresses measured at point p 5 the maximum total displacement and von mises stress predicted by fem analysis at time t 1 1 5 s are listed in table 8 which are utilized to obtain u t and σ v normalized variations presented in figs 31 33 as can be seen from fig 31 the percent difference between ifem d and s models and the reference solutions for the maximum u t displacement is 0 7 and 1 4 respectively in addition the contours of ifem d and s models and reference solution for u t displacements are almost indiscernible from each other hence these results reveal a superior accuracy of ifem ics8 formulation for full field shape sensing moreover the percent difference between ifem vs and reference solutions for the maximum total displacement becomes 5 6 as shown in fig 31 nevertheless the overall predictions of maximum and minimum locations of u t displacement are guaranteed by the ifem vs model hence it has fair enough accuracy for performing full field shape sensing the deformed shapes obtained from the high fidelity fem and low fidelity ifem vs analysis are compared at three different time steps as depicted in fig 32 herein the total deformations of both ifem vs and fem at different time steps are magnified with the same factor of 233 to make a clear comparison between deformed shapes at different time steps as well as to fairly examine the shape sensing capability of ifem vs model against reference solutions as can be seen from the fig 32 that the ifem vs model predicts almost indistinguishable deformed shapes from those of fem at all three time steps these results clearly demonstrate the potential practical applicability and high accuracy of the ics8 element for performing shape sensing analysis utilizing only sparse strain measurements finally the σ v stress contours obtained from fem and ifem d s vs analysis at time step of t 1 are compared in fig 33 for all the ics8 models the maximum and minimum stress locations are in well agreement between the ifem and reference solutions remarkably although there is no strain sensor available at the girders stiffeners in very sparse ics8 model the stress contours demonstrate that ifem vs analysis can produce highly accurate stress variations along the surfaces of the girders and stiffeners a much better accuracy can be expectedly obtained in the cylindrical panel as there are in situ sensors available in fact there are small discrepancy with less than 13 error obtained between ifem and fem predictions for the maximum σ v stresses which is due to the high strain stress gradients available in the high fidelity fem mesh as explain earlier in section 3 2 usage of a finer mesh in the post processing step of the ifem analysis can overcome this problem and increase the accuracy and smoothness of the stress contours for this purpose the displacements predicted in ifem d model is mapped onto a finer mesh and stresses are calculated over the new mesh depicted in fig 34 herein the percent difference between the ifem d and fem diminishes to only 6 4 which can be assesses as an accurate stress prediction this way the smoothness of overall stress contours is increased as well to sum up these results prove that ics8 ifem framework can predict accurate three dimensional and full field stress solutions for stress sensing analysis of curved structures 4 conclusions the ifem algorithm uses discrete surface strain measurements to dynamically track the full field and three dimensional displacements strains and stresses of a structure in the present study the displacement and stress monitoring of cylindrical marine structures subjected to static and dynamic loads are accomplished based on a novel ics8 ifem formulation the minimization of a weighted least squares functional with respect to the unknown displacements i e the general mathematical concept of ifem methodology originally introduced by tessler and spangler 2005 is adopted to derive the resulting element equations of the ics8 element this new inverse shell element ics8 has a curvilinear geometry and utilizes the kinematic assumptions of the mindlin s plate theory therefore the ics8 element can be an attractive candidate for modelling curved thin thick structures through a low fidelity discretization strategies with sparse strain sensor deployment additionally the modelling capability of the ics8 element is enhanced by introducing an artificial drilling dof for shape sensing analysis of built up stiffened curved structures hence various large scale marine structures including ship hulls onshore and offshore structures submarines etc can be suitably modelled with a coarser mesh than as what flat surface inverse elements offer in the current study a smooth distribution of strains is ensured by performing direct high fidelity fem analysis for the representative curved marine structural components this simulated strain data represented experimentally measured strains used as an input for the ifem analysis of the marine structures investigated in the present study according to comparison between the ifem and reference fem analysis for various results it is demonstrated that the ics8 element can very accurately predict the full field deformed shapes global strain and stress distributions by using even very sparse sensor data and a low fidelity discretization for these comparisons the effect of sensor locations and sparsity of strain data on solution accuracy of displacements strains and stresses is also detailed as a result the optimum strain sensor locations are clearly identified and demonstrated for each ifem ics8 models of the case studies hence ics8 ifem methodology is a promising and smart framework to perform an accurate shape and stress sensing providing a viable technology for shm of future marine structures acknowledgement the financial support provided by the scientific and technological research council

22566,with the hypotheses of small deformation and bernoulli euler beam a gap element is introduced to describe the contact between the circular column and the external cylinder the dynamic relaxation method is used to calculate the static equilibrium of the twisted column constrained by the cylinder the post buckling modes of a torsional column in a cylinder are investigated for the deformation configurations of one point two point three point and point line point contact it is found that the end constraint has an effect on the length of the two suspended sections of helical buckling mode but has no effect on the length of the continuous contact section in the middle the relations have been derived among critical torque post buckling modes lengths of each section and loads including shear bending moment and contact force finally the torsional buckling has been investigated for sucker rods and drill pipes with lengths of 1 km it is found that the helical buckling of multiple pitches occurs the results of the current study provide theoretical guidance for the design of centralizer spacing in oil and gas engineering applications keywords torsional buckling helical buckling sucker rod drill pipe dynamic relaxation method 1 introduction the drill pipes in the drilling engineering and the sucker rods of progressive cavity pump pcp in the oil production engineering are subjected to loads such as torque and self weight these pipes and rods are several kilometers long which increase flexibility and may cause torsional buckling under the wellbore constraints the buckled pipes and rods will contact the wellbores increasing the friction resulting in problems such as transmission of torque loads and wear failure etc zhang et al 2014 2016 drumond et al 2018 therefore torsion buckling analysis is very important for drilling and production engineering euler ziegler 1977 first studied the buckling of columns under compression buckling is not only caused by compression the columns may become unstable under the action of torque greenhill 1883 researched torsion buckling for the first time for hinged constraints at both ends the greenhill buckling formula is 1 m t 2 π e i l where m t is torque e i is bending stiffness l is the length of the column ziegler 1977 obtained the torsion buckling solution for fixed constraints 2 m t 2 861 π e i l for the hinged column subjected to both compression and torsion the greenhill buckling formula greenhill 1883 is 3 f n m t 2 4 e i π 2 e i l 2 where f n is the compression load torsion buckling problems have attracted the interest of many researchers van der heijden et al 2003a analyzed the phenomenon of multi point contact caused by torsion katsaounis and papazoglou 1999 investigated the buckling problem of vertical risers under torque gulyayev et al 2009 performed the quasi static buckling analysis of rotary drill strings the results show that the initial buckling mode has a complex shape and is related to the helical bending of the bottom hole assembly bha gulyaev et al 2010 considered the quasi static bifurcation state of the ultra deep vertical drill string in the compression and pulling process of a long rotating column with uniform liquid inflow chen and sie 2017 used the shooting method to analysis the self line contact deformation under combined edge thrust and torsion zhao and van der heijden 2019 studied the dynamic torsional buckling and found that the torsional instability was delayed by passive loads it is noticed that in the above eqs 1 3 and available open literatures the cylindrical constraint is not taken into account for the torsion buckling for the cylindrical constraint miska and cunha 1995 used the principle of energy conservation and virtual work to obtain the relation between the loads and the pitch of the column subjected to compression and torsion 4 f n 3 π m t h 8 π 2 e i h 2 where h is the pitch of the buckled column miska and cunha 1995 also researched the helical buckling under compression and torsion in inclined wellbores he et al 1995 theoretically analyzed the interaction of torque and helical buckling in coiled tubing drilling wu 1997 also analyzed the effect of torsion on the buckling of the drill string experiment studies by salies et al 1994 showed that the effect of torsion on the critical helical buckling load was limited usually no more than 10 considering the effects of axial forces torque and weight gao and huang 2015 summarized various critical helical buckling conditions they found that the torque reduced the helical buckling load and pitch but increased the contact force the study of menand et al 2008 showed that the critical load of a rotating pipe string subjected to torque could be reduced by 50 compared to that of a non rotating string a torque not only affects the helical buckling configuration but the helical buckling also causes torque loading in reverse if the pipe without torque in the initial state is axially compressed and the ends of the pipe are constrained by no relative rotation the helical buckling will cause induced torque mitchell 2003 mitchell 2003 pointed out that the induced torque may exceed the compensating torque for larger radial clearance however wu 1997 believed that the buckling of the pipe string would not occur under the action of a single torsion but would lead to the strength failure caused by torsion we note that eq 4 can be rewritten when the torque acts alone 5 m t 8 π e i 3 h eq 5 was derived using the continuous contact assumption the effect of boundary condition was not considered for this continuous contact van der heijden 2001 2002 studied the static deformation of a twisted column confined to a cylinder using precise geometry van der heijden 2001 studied isotropic rods in a cylinder he later extended the work to the case of anisotropy van der heijden et al 2002 and further to the analysis to the rotation of rods van der heijden and fraser 2003b all the aforesaid research work focused on studying torsion effect under the continuous assumption that the buckled rod was still in contact with the cylindrical wall from one end to the other later researchers studied the effect of the boundary conditions and analyzed the post buckling configuration of torsional rods in cylinder chen and li 2011 considered the fixed constraints and concluded that four types of torsion buckling modes could be found under the hypothesis of small deformation however ten types of torsion buckling modes were found by shooting method using the theory of elastic model li and chen 2014 for sucker rods and drill pipes in wellbores generally up to one thousand meters or even several kilometers in length can torsion buckling occur when the torsional strength is satisfied considering the constraints at the both ends of a sucker rod if torsion buckling occurs where is the contact point how long is the suspended section how long is the continuous contact section how many pitches can be formed these problems especially for the sucker rods and drill pipes subjected to torque have practical engineering significance however these problems have not been investigated in detail by researchers in our current study we reject the continuous contact hypothesis adopted in conventional theoretical analysis and use the dynamic relaxation method to simulate the torsion buckling behavior of the pipe in a cylinder for the hinged and fixed support cases the configuration of the static equilibrium of the torsion buckling is analyzed in order to answer the questions mentioned in the previous paragraph 2 model and method 2 1 assumptions the following assumptions are made 1 the column is straight and it is also linear elastic 2 the cross section of the column is solid or hollow circle the cross section of the cylinder is circular too 3 the initial annular gap between the column and the cylinder exists the column before deformation is located in the center of the cylinder 4 the column is only subjected to a concentrated torque at the both ends 5 this annular gap is very small and the lateral deformation of the buckled column is very small the column is assumed to be of small deformation 6 the cylinder is treated as rigid bodies and fixed 7 the friction is ignored when the buckled column is in contact with the rigid cylinder wall 8 we study the final deformation of the column under the end torque the transient effects of inertial and damping forces are ignored 2 2 element description using bernoulli euler beam assumption the element is a circular column as shown in fig 1 where x straight axis of the column geometric locus of cross sectional centroids y z central and principal axes of the cross section let v w denote the lateral displacements in the y and z directions respectively u and φ x is the axial displacement in the x direction and the angle of twist about the x direction the elastic strain energy u p of circular beam element with length l can be expressed as barsoum and gallagher 1970 6 u p 1 2 0 l g j φ x 2 e i z v 2 e i y w 2 d x where is equivalent to d d x e and g are respectively the young s modulus and shear modulus i z and i y are moments of inertia calculated about the z and y axes respectively j is the polar moment of inertia of the cross sectional area the potential energy v p of the applied torque m x is given by 7 v p m x φ x 1 φ x 2 1 2 m x 0 l v w w v d x the second two parts in eq 6 equal the increased strain energy of the column during buckling the first part in eq 7 is the product of the applied torque and the corresponding displacement the change in potential energy due to torsional action is sought in finding the second part trahair and teh 2001 in eq 7 the term m x v w d x represents the work done by the moment component about the y axis m x v see fig 2 a of the torque m x when there is an angle change w d x about the y axis between the ends of an element of length d x see fig 2 b the term m x w v d x has the similar meaning the potential energy π p is given by 8 π p u p v p to transfer eq 8 into matrix expression displacement function is needed to describe the behavior of the element here using hermitian approximation zienkiewicz et al 2000 the element displacement vector d is 9 d u v w φ x t nq where q is the node displacement vector n is the hermitian shape function matrix q and n have the below expressions 10 q u 1 v 1 w 1 φ x 1 φ y 1 φ z 1 u 2 v 2 w 2 φ x 2 φ y 2 φ z 2 t 11 n n u n v n w n φ x h 1 0 0 0 0 f

introducing eq 9 into eqs 6 8 the potential energy is obtained 12 π p 1 2 q t k 0 q 1 2 q t k σ q q t f where k 0 and k σ are the linear and stress stiffness matrix respectively f is the node loads vector given by 13 f f x 1 f y 1 f z 1 m x 1 m y 1 m z 1 f x 2 f y 2 f z 2 m x 2 m y 2 m z 2 t use the minimum potential energy principle 14 δ π p 0 and perform the above variation on eq 12 the equilibrium equation of the following element is obtained 15 k 0 q k σ q f it is noted that the above formulas in this section do not take into account the contact between the column and the cylinder when the column buckles the contact relation will be described by the gap element 2 3 contact relation the contact relation between the column and the cylinder is described by using gap element a gap element liu et al 2002 zhang et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 is a virtual element its inner and outer boundaries are connected with the outer surface of the columns and the inner wall of the cylinders respectively the local coordinate system o y z of the gap element coincides with the local coordinate system of the beam element the gap element is a 2d element whose displacements are the lateral displacements of the beam element the displacement vector of the gap element is 16 u g v w t n g q where shape function matrix n g n v n w is a 2 12 matrix and the explicit expressions are given in eq 11 the lateral displacement u g and the direction angle β g of the gap element at any position are described below 17 u g u d v 2 w 2 β g β d arctan w v where u d and β d are the lateral displacement and the direction angle of the beam element respectively the initial gap r g of the gap element is expressed as 18 r g d i d 0 2 where d i and d 0 are the outer diameter of the column and the inner diameter of the cylinder respectively thus the normal strain ε g n of the gap element is 19 ε g n u g r g the contact force between the column and the inner surface of the cylinder is 20 f g n 0 g k u g r g u g r g 0 u g r g 0 where f g n is the contact force g k is the stiffness of the gap element when contact occurs the small penetration is u pe u g r g the contact force f g n can be further transformed to the additional nodal force of the beam element based on the strain ε g n in eq 20 and contact force f g n in eq 21 the definite formula of iteration calculation for gap element can be written as 1 for the free state 21 ε g n 1 0 ε min f g n f min 0 g k 0 2 for the elastic contact state 22 ε min ε g n 1 0 ε max f g n f min 0 g k 0 where ε min ε max and f min are small quantities larger than zero to control the convergence accuracy of gap element iteration ε min and ε max are the minimum and maximum iteration errors for gap element strain respectively f min is the iterative error of the gap element contact force in order to make the contact satisfy the definite solution of the gap element the stiffness g k of the gap element should be revised continuously in the iterative calculation similarly using the principle of minimum potential energy the stiffness matrix of the gap element can be written in the following formula liu et al 2002 23 k g n g t g k n g 2 4 static equilibrium equation by assembling the beam element in eq 15 and gap element in eq 23 we get the global equilibrium equation as follows 24 k 0 k σ k g u f m f g n where k 0 is the global elastic stiffness matrix k σ is the global stress stiffness matrix k g is the global gap element stiffness matrix u are the vector of node displacement f m and f g n are respectively the equivalent nodal force vector of the beam element and the gap element with respect to the global coordinates x y z in fig 4 the two ends of the columns see points a and b in fig 4 a are treated as hinged or fixed restraints the displacement boundary condition of the hinged constraint is 25 u a v a w a v b w b 0 while the displacement boundary condition of the fixed constraint is 26 u a v a w a v b w b 0 φ x a φ y a φ z a φ y b φ z b 0 the columns are subjected to a torque m t applied at point b the column end point the hinged constraint and its end torque are shown in fig 4 a the other end point a of the column is constrained by the torsional displacement φ a x 0 since the friction is ignored the columns are in statically equilibrium after torsion buckling the calculated reaction force m x a is equal to m x b m t m x b m x a under the action of torque m t torsion buckling deformation occurs the column is in contact with the inner wall of the rigid cylinder the possible deformation shape is shown in fig 4 c the cross section before and after the buckling is shown in fig 4 d and e respectively 2 5 virtual dynamic solution when the twisted column buckles the deformation changes dramatically and the buckled column suddenly contacts the cylinder problems such as deformation instability and convergence difficulty exist in our computational simulation to solve these problems we use the dynamic relaxation method zhang et al 2019 to transform the static buckling problem in fig 4 a into the artificial dynamic solution in fig 4 b in fig 4 b the perturbation force f p t is applied in the column middle to form the buckled shape easily in order to reduce the transient impact of torsion and perturbation force on the column the time history loading of sinusoidal wave is adopted the curves of m x b t and f p t are shown in fig 4 f and their expressions are as follows 27 m x b t m t sin π t t 0 0 t t 1 m t t t 1 28 f p t f p sin 2 π t t 0 0 t t 2 0 t t 2 in which t is the response time t 0 is the characteristic loading time t 1 t 0 4 t 2 t 0 2 by applying virtual inertia and damping force in dynamic relaxation method the static buckling system of eq 24 is transformed into a virtual dynamic solution 29 m u c u ku f t where k k 0 k σ k g m c and k are respectively the mass damping and stiffness matrix of the twist column u and u are the node acceleration and velocity vectors of the column respectively f t is the load vector of the column f t f m t f g n t f p t rayleigh damping is used to set the α damping to a large value which attenuates the dynamic response of the system in the nonlinear dynamic eq 29 the internal loads are no longer proportional to the node displacements the stiffness matrix of the twist column depends on the current displacements therefore instead of eq 29 the newmark scheme hughes 2012 is applied to the nonlinear semi discrete equation 30 m u t c u t f i t f a t where f i is the internal load vector f i k 0 k σ k g u t assuming that the time increment is δ t when t δ t eq 33 can be rewritten as follows 31 m u t δ t c u t δ t f t δ t i u t δ t f t δ t a it is noted that f t δ t i u t δ t is dependent on the current displacement u t δ t at time t δ t in addition to eq 31 the following formulas are used to update u t δ t and u t δ t 32 u t δ t u t 1 δ n u t δ n u t δ t δ t 33 u t δ t u t u t δ t 1 2 β n u t β n u t δ t δ t 2 where β n and δ n are newmark parameters the amplitude attenuation coefficient γ n is used to control the amount of numerical damping when the following relation is satisfied 34 δ n 1 2 γ β n 1 4 1 γ n 2 γ n 0 newmark scheme is unconditionally stable hughes 2012 in the current study we set γ n 0 005 using the newton raphson method bathe 2014 eq 31 eq 32 and eq 33 can be solved simultaneously when t t 0 2 f p 0 m x b remains unchanged thus eq 30 is rewritten as 35 f r t m u c u f a t f i t where f r t is residual force vector when the iteration process goes on the transient response of the twist column tends to be static and the deformation u gradually becomes constant u u and f r tend to be 0 then f a f i eq 24 can be calculated successfully the static equilibrium state is thus obtained for the twist column constrained by a cylinder 3 effect of the algorithm 3 1 calculation parameter the drill pipe with the length l 130 m the outer diameter d o 158 75 mm and the inner diameter d i 57 15 mm are selected to calculate the torsion buckling the drill pipe has an elastic modulus e 210 gpa and density ρ 7871 kg m3 the inner diameter of the cylinder d i 215 9 mm and the annular gap is r g 28 575 mm the length of each beam element is l 0 5 m 3 2 torsional buckling analysis without contact let the dimensionless torque of the column be 36 m t m t l 2 π e i the reference α 0 is α 0 2 ω where ω π 2 l 2 e i ρ a a π d o 2 d i 2 4 for α 20 α 0 various dimensionless torques m t are applied and the lateral deflection at the column mid point vs time is shown in fig 5 in fig 5 we can see that when m t 1 00 the lateral displacement u d decreases with the withdrawal of the lateral perturbation force f p and tends to zero gradually so the twisted column is in a stable state when m t 1 00 u d remains unchanged when f p is removed the twisted column is in a critical state of equilibrium and m t 1 00 is the critical value when m t 1 00 u d increases when f p is withdrawn so the twisted column is in an unstable state the dimensionless critical torque m t 1 00 calculated by us is fully consistent with the analytical solution in eq 1 which indicates that our computational simulation has a high calculation accuracy for static buckling solution for the dimensionless critical torque m t 1 00 the damping effect on the lateral deflection and buckled shape is shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively it is noticed that the smaller the damping the shorter the time to achieve lateral deflection stability and the smaller the deflection the buckling shape is a 3d spiral curve shown in fig 7 a while the 2d plane is circular as shown in fig 7 b 3 3 torsional buckling analysis with contact 3 3 1 effect of the damping for the dimensionless torque m t 2 50 the lateral displacement velocity and acceleration in the column mid point vs time are depicted in fig 8 under various alpha damping fig 9 shows the effect of the damping on the deflection curve with the increasing calculation time the lateral displacement u d increases gradually and tends to be constant because of the cylinder constraint the column contacts the inner wall of the cylinder when u d reaches annular gap r g 28 575 mm then u d remains unchanged in fig 8 it can be seen that after buckling the time required for the column to contact the cylindrical wall is positively correlated with the alpha damping during the loading stage of the torque and perturbation force a very small alpha damping will easily cause very large lateral velocity and acceleration which will make the calculation difficult to converge in the stable stage of the torque the lateral velocity and acceleration gradually tend to zero with the calculation time after the deflection is stabilized the lateral displacement and direction angle of the corresponding deflection curve remain unchanged and the deflection curves coincide with each other in fig 9 this result demonstrates that the ultimate buckling deformation does not change with the virtual damping therefore to get the convergence of the algorithm larger alpha damping is required to obtain stable lateral deformation a longer calculation time is required 3 3 2 effect of element length for a given damp α 450 α 0 and torque m t 2 50 fig 10 shows the effect of element length on the deflection curve in fig 10 a it is seen that the lateral displacement of different element lengths is almost the same for a given length range 0 25 m 4 00 m however element length has certain effect on the direction angle β d i e the direction angle decreases with the increasing element length in fig 10 b for a column length l 130 m it we set the element length as 0 25 m β d is 733 3 however when the element length is set as 4 00 m β d becomes 709 0 which decreases by 24 3 or 3 3 in order to improve the computational efficiency and maintain the computational accuracy the length of the element in this paper is taken as 0 50 m 4 post buckling configuration of twisted columns 4 1 post buckling deformation analysis the simulation parameters are the same as those in section 3 by changing the torque the characteristic post buckling modes of the twisted column in a cylinder are calculated fig 11 depicts the 3d deformation shape and plane curve of the characteristic configuration for hinged constraint fig 11 demonstrates that the buckling mode undergoes the deformation of single point two point three point and point line point contact in turn the deformation of point line point contact undergoes one two predictable three and more pitches in turn for hinged restraint the various buckling modes are as follows 1 when m t 1 00 the twisted column contacts with the midpoint of the cylinder and is divided into two suspended sections as shown in fig 11 a the deformation is a single point contact shape which is represented by the symbol c1 the buckling configuration consists of two equal length suspended sections l 1 2 when m t 1 37 the contact point in the middle of the twisted column disappears and two contact points appear at the both sides of the column midpoint as shown in fig 11 b the deformation suddenly changes into two point contact shape the buckling configuration consists of three suspension sections i e two equal length first suspension sections l 1 and 1 s suspended section l 2 3 when the torque m t further increases to 1 68 a contact point appears in the middle of the twisted column which transforms the deformation into a three point contact shape as shown in fig 11 c whether it is a single point two point or three point contact deformation the contact point is uniformly represented by the symbol c1 which is called the first contact point the twisted column is divided into four suspended sections and is composed of two equal length first suspended sections l 1 and two equal length second suspended sections l 2 4 when m t reaches 1 75 the single point contact shape in the midpoint of the column becomes a multi point continuous contact zone as shown in fig 11 d the continuous multi point contact is referred to as continuous contact or line contact the contact points at the both ends of the continuous contact zone are denoted by the symbol c2 which is called the second contact point between the continuous contact section and the ends of the column two single contact points still exist we call the deformation with both single point and continuous contact zone as the point line point contact configuration the buckling configuration is divided into four suspended sections and one continuous contact section i e two equal length first suspended sections l 2 two equal length second suspended sections l 2 and one continuous contact section l c 5 as the torque is further increased the length of the continuous contact section l c increases and the direction angle β c 2 c 2 between the contact points of the continuous contact zone ends also increases when the torque m t is increased to 2 81 β c 2 c 2 360 and one pitch is formed as shown in fig 11 e when m t 4 00 the deformed shape with two pitches is formed as shown in fig 11 f it is noted that the buckling configuration after point line point contact deformation is still composed of four suspended sections and one continuous contact section but the length of each section is different 4 2 relation between torque and each section length the positions of the contact points c1 and c2 verses the applied torque m t are plotted in fig 12 the length of each section is shown in fig 11 above the critical torques and the length of each section are summarized in table 1 for single point contact deformation the critical torque of fixed constraint is 1 42 times that of hinged constraint however when a pitch is formed the critical torque ratio of the two constraints decreases to about 1 14 times for single point contact deformation the contact point is always in the middle of the column however for the two point contact and the subsequent buckling deformation cases the contact point c1 gradually moves toward the end of the column for point line point contact deformation the contact point c2 also moves toward the end of the column as the torque increases we find that the pitch lengths are the same although the critical torques of the two constraints are different in table 1 the boundary conditions at the both ends affect only the length of the first and second suspended section i e the section length l 1 and l 2 among them the length of the first suspended section l 1 of hinged constraint is less than that of the fixed constraint however for the second suspended section l 2 the opposite conclusion appears we introduce the following dimensionless length variables 37 η l m t l e i η 1 m t l 1 e i η 2 m t l 2 e i η c m t l c e i η h m t l h e i where η l is the dimensionless length of the column η 1 η 2 η c and η h are the dimensionless lengths of the first the second suspended section the continuous contact section and one pitch section respectively when one pitch and n pitches are formed the dimensionless length of the continuous contact section can be further expressed as 38 η c n η h where n is no of pitch the curves of dimensionless length of each section corresponding to each dimensionless torque are drawn together as shown in fig 13 after the buckling deformation of point line point contact in fig 13 the dimensionless length η 1 and η 2 of the first and second suspended section tend to be constant rapidly with the increasing torque m t the dimensionless length η c of the continuous contact section increases linearly therefore when one or more pitches are formed the dimensionless pitch η h is constant the relation between the dimensionless torque m t and the length of each section is shown in table 3 according to the dimensionless torque in eq 36 and dimensionless length in eq 37 the relation between them is obtained as follows 39 m t η l 2 π combining the length of each section in table 3 and eq 39 if the geometric dimensions of the columns are known the critical torques of each buckling modes and the positions of each contact point can be calculated conversely if the torque and geometric size are known the critical torques of each buckling deformation and the positions of each contact point can be evaluated based on the results in table 2 the relation between dimensionless torque and pitch number of hinged and fixed boundaries is plotted in fig 14 which shows that the torque increases linearly with the pitch number considering the effect of both ends restraint the dimensionless torque of fixed restraint is 13 6 larger than that of hinged restraint 4 3 bending moment shear force and contact force in various buckling modes we analysis the bending moment shear force and contact force of the twisted columns in this section the following dimensionless load variables are used 40 m b m b l 2 r g e i f s f s l 3 r g e i f 1 f 1 l 3 r g e i f q f q l 4 r g e i where m b is the bending moment m b m y 2 m z 2 n m f s is the shear force f s f y 2 f z 2 n f 1 is the contact force at the first contact point n f q is the contact force at the continuous contact section n m for the hinged and fixed constraint the distribution of the dimensionless bending moment m b shear force f s and contact force f q are drawn in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 respectively in the buckling deformation with three point and point line point contact fig 15 indicates that the bending moment at the first contact point c1 has an inflection point and then increases sharply in the middle of the columns the bending moment reaches the maximum value and the larger the torque the larger the distribution area of the maximum value fig 16 shows that the shear distribution experienced a jump due to the existence of inflection point at the first contact point c1 the maximum shear force is also located at the middle of the columns and the distribution area of the maximum value increases with the applied torque for the hinged constraint in fig 17 a during the deformation from point line point contact to one pitch the peak of the contact force is near the end of the continuous contact section however for two and three pitch configurations the contact force increases sharply near the end of the continuous contact section and tends to the maximum value for the fixed constraint in fig 17 b regardless of the buckling configuration the maximum contact load is in the middle of the columns for these two constraints the length of the continuous contact section increases with the increasing torque and the distribution range of the maximum contact load is also larger since the maximum values of the dimensionless bending moment shear force and contact force generally appear in the middle of the columns and its vicinities we draw these maximum loads together from both our computational simulation and from our fitting formulas in figs 18 20 the dimensionless contact forces of the first contact point obtained by numerical simulation and by fitting formula are shown in fig 21 according to the results of our computational simulation in this paper the dimensionless loads are fitted as follows 41 for hinged constraint for fixed constraint m b 182 256 2 π m t 2 m b 144 256 2 π m t 2 f s 28 256 2 π m t 3 f s 36 256 2 π m t 3 f q 24 256 2 π m t 4 f q 27 256 2 π m t 4 f 1 35 256 2 π m t 3 f 1 47 256 2 π m t 3 these fitting formulas in eq 41 are in very good agreement with the computational simulation results as shown in figs 18 21 for the same dimensionless torque m t the dimensionless bending moment m b with fixed constraint is 25 less than that with hinged constraint however the other three dimensionless loads f s f q and f 1 with the fixed constraints are 30 12 and 35 larger than those with hinged constraints respectively for the same buckling mode in table 2 the values m b with the two constraints are nearly equal however those values f s f q and f 1 with the fixed constraints are 89 88 and 97 larger than those with hinged constraints respectively 4 4 verification of numerical results in order to verify the reliability of the numerical results the dimensionless critical torques calculated in this paper and the analytic solutions in the literatures are listed in table 3 our computational simulation results are in good agreement with those obtained by using small deformation hypothesis in the literature chen and li 2011 it is noted that the fitting eq 41 of the contact force f q in fig 20 b is also in good agreement with the formula in this published paper chen and li 2011 which also shows that the numerical results in this paper are very reliable 5 torsional buckling of sucker rods and drill pipes the columns in boreholes subjected to torque mainly are sucker rods of progressive cavity pump and drill pipes wherein the displacement boundary of the sucker rods and drill pipes can be simplified into fixed and hinged constraint respectively the maximum shear stress τ max of the columns subjected to torque is 42 τ max m t d o 2 j if the allowable shear stress τ 150 mpa the results of various types of columns can be obtained by using the dimensionless results in table 2 the calculation results of the torsion buckling for sucker rods and drill pipes are summarized in table 4 and table 5 respectively from tables 4 and 5 it is observed that under the same torsion strength the cross section size of the columns is positively correlated with the bending stiffness e i and torque m t but inversely correlated with the dimensionless torque m t as a result the lengths of the first second suspended section l 1 and l 2 and the pitch l h decrease while the length of the continuous contact section l c and the number of pitch increase for small diameter columns such as sucker rods of progressive cavity pump the dimensionless torques range from 12 20 to 38 63 and pitch numbers range from 7 68 to 27 31 the minimum values of the first and second suspended section l 1 and l 2 are 21 2 m and 2 7 m respectively the continuous contact section accounts for 85 95 of the well depth for large diameter columns such as drill pipes the dimensionless torque is between 2 96 and 13 81 and the number of pitches formed is between 0 83 and 8 88 when the pitch number is 0 83 the buckling shape with point line point contact is formed which is close to forming one pitch the minimum lengths of the first and second suspended section are 49 1 m and 17 8 m respectively the continuous contact section is 37 5 86 5 of the well depth dimensionless loads m b f s f 1 and f q can be calculated by fitting eq 41 then bending moment m b shear force f s and contact force f 1 and f q after torsion buckling are obtained by eq 40 thus torsion buckling of sucker rods and drill pipes occurs especially for small diameter sucker rods which is easier to cause buckling in engineering applications centralizers are usually designed on columns to avoid buckling the computational simulation results in this paper provide important theoretical basis for the design of centralizer spacing for example to avoid the buckling occurrence of one pitch the distance between centralizers should be less than the dimensionless pitch length η l see table 3 5 conclusion in this paper we study the buckling problem of a circular column constrained by a cylinder under concentrated torsion applied at its ends the both ends of the column are either hinged or fixed the hypotheses of bernoulli euler and small deformation are adopted the beam element and gap element are combined to describe the contact relation between the column and the cylinder virtual dynamic solution is implemented to compute the static equilibrium state of the twisted column constrained by the cylinder firstly we have studied the effect of torque and virtual damping on the lateral deformation when the cylindrical constraint is not considered the calculated critical torque of the column without cylindrical constraints is identical to the analytical solution given in eq 1 or eq 36 then when the cylindrical constraints are considered the effects of virtual damping and element length on the algorithm are investigated virtual damping has an effect on the calculation time but it ensures the convergence of torsional buckling while the element length affects the calculation accuracy we have further studied the post buckling modes of torsional columns with cylindrical constraints the buckling modes undergo the deformation of one point two point three point and point line point contact in turn and the deformation of point line point contact undergoes the buckling shape of one two predictable three pitches and multiple pitches sequentially it is found that the length of the first suspended section of the hinged end constraint is smaller than the value of the fixed end constraint however the length of the second suspended section has the opposite results for the same buckling mode the end constraint does not affect the pitch length of the continuous contact section we obtain the relation between the dimensionless torque and the dimensionless length of each section for the various buckling modes the dimensionless loads for torsional buckling modes are analyzed including the bending moment shear force and contact force the useful fitting formula are obtained for the relation between dimensionless torque and dimensionless loads we also verify that the critical torque obtained in this paper is consistent with the results of the small deformation hypothesis in the literature chen and li 2011 the contact force of the continuous contact section is also identical to this literature finally we analyze the torsional buckling of drill pipes and sucker rods of progressive cavity pump it is noted that for the same strength condition the number of pitches formed for small diameter sucker rods reaches from 7 to 27 for large diameter drill pipes nearly one to eight pitches can also be formed the investigation results in this paper provide highly valuable insights into the buckling behavior of torsional columns confined by cylinders our computational simulations also provide useful guidance for the spacing design of centralizers

22566,with the hypotheses of small deformation and bernoulli euler beam a gap element is introduced to describe the contact between the circular column and the external cylinder the dynamic relaxation method is used to calculate the static equilibrium of the twisted column constrained by the cylinder the post buckling modes of a torsional column in a cylinder are investigated for the deformation configurations of one point two point three point and point line point contact it is found that the end constraint has an effect on the length of the two suspended sections of helical buckling mode but has no effect on the length of the continuous contact section in the middle the relations have been derived among critical torque post buckling modes lengths of each section and loads including shear bending moment and contact force finally the torsional buckling has been investigated for sucker rods and drill pipes with lengths of 1 km it is found that the helical buckling of multiple pitches occurs the results of the current study provide theoretical guidance for the design of centralizer spacing in oil and gas engineering applications keywords torsional buckling helical buckling sucker rod drill pipe dynamic relaxation method 1 introduction the drill pipes in the drilling engineering and the sucker rods of progressive cavity pump pcp in the oil production engineering are subjected to loads such as torque and self weight these pipes and rods are several kilometers long which increase flexibility and may cause torsional buckling under the wellbore constraints the buckled pipes and rods will contact the wellbores increasing the friction resulting in problems such as transmission of torque loads and wear failure etc zhang et al 2014 2016 drumond et al 2018 therefore torsion buckling analysis is very important for drilling and production engineering euler ziegler 1977 first studied the buckling of columns under compression buckling is not only caused by compression the columns may become unstable under the action of torque greenhill 1883 researched torsion buckling for the first time for hinged constraints at both ends the greenhill buckling formula is 1 m t 2 π e i l where m t is torque e i is bending stiffness l is the length of the column ziegler 1977 obtained the torsion buckling solution for fixed constraints 2 m t 2 861 π e i l for the hinged column subjected to both compression and torsion the greenhill buckling formula greenhill 1883 is 3 f n m t 2 4 e i π 2 e i l 2 where f n is the compression load torsion buckling problems have attracted the interest of many researchers van der heijden et al 2003a analyzed the phenomenon of multi point contact caused by torsion katsaounis and papazoglou 1999 investigated the buckling problem of vertical risers under torque gulyayev et al 2009 performed the quasi static buckling analysis of rotary drill strings the results show that the initial buckling mode has a complex shape and is related to the helical bending of the bottom hole assembly bha gulyaev et al 2010 considered the quasi static bifurcation state of the ultra deep vertical drill string in the compression and pulling process of a long rotating column with uniform liquid inflow chen and sie 2017 used the shooting method to analysis the self line contact deformation under combined edge thrust and torsion zhao and van der heijden 2019 studied the dynamic torsional buckling and found that the torsional instability was delayed by passive loads it is noticed that in the above eqs 1 3 and available open literatures the cylindrical constraint is not taken into account for the torsion buckling for the cylindrical constraint miska and cunha 1995 used the principle of energy conservation and virtual work to obtain the relation between the loads and the pitch of the column subjected to compression and torsion 4 f n 3 π m t h 8 π 2 e i h 2 where h is the pitch of the buckled column miska and cunha 1995 also researched the helical buckling under compression and torsion in inclined wellbores he et al 1995 theoretically analyzed the interaction of torque and helical buckling in coiled tubing drilling wu 1997 also analyzed the effect of torsion on the buckling of the drill string experiment studies by salies et al 1994 showed that the effect of torsion on the critical helical buckling load was limited usually no more than 10 considering the effects of axial forces torque and weight gao and huang 2015 summarized various critical helical buckling conditions they found that the torque reduced the helical buckling load and pitch but increased the contact force the study of menand et al 2008 showed that the critical load of a rotating pipe string subjected to torque could be reduced by 50 compared to that of a non rotating string a torque not only affects the helical buckling configuration but the helical buckling also causes torque loading in reverse if the pipe without torque in the initial state is axially compressed and the ends of the pipe are constrained by no relative rotation the helical buckling will cause induced torque mitchell 2003 mitchell 2003 pointed out that the induced torque may exceed the compensating torque for larger radial clearance however wu 1997 believed that the buckling of the pipe string would not occur under the action of a single torsion but would lead to the strength failure caused by torsion we note that eq 4 can be rewritten when the torque acts alone 5 m t 8 π e i 3 h eq 5 was derived using the continuous contact assumption the effect of boundary condition was not considered for this continuous contact van der heijden 2001 2002 studied the static deformation of a twisted column confined to a cylinder using precise geometry van der heijden 2001 studied isotropic rods in a cylinder he later extended the work to the case of anisotropy van der heijden et al 2002 and further to the analysis to the rotation of rods van der heijden and fraser 2003b all the aforesaid research work focused on studying torsion effect under the continuous assumption that the buckled rod was still in contact with the cylindrical wall from one end to the other later researchers studied the effect of the boundary conditions and analyzed the post buckling configuration of torsional rods in cylinder chen and li 2011 considered the fixed constraints and concluded that four types of torsion buckling modes could be found under the hypothesis of small deformation however ten types of torsion buckling modes were found by shooting method using the theory of elastic model li and chen 2014 for sucker rods and drill pipes in wellbores generally up to one thousand meters or even several kilometers in length can torsion buckling occur when the torsional strength is satisfied considering the constraints at the both ends of a sucker rod if torsion buckling occurs where is the contact point how long is the suspended section how long is the continuous contact section how many pitches can be formed these problems especially for the sucker rods and drill pipes subjected to torque have practical engineering significance however these problems have not been investigated in detail by researchers in our current study we reject the continuous contact hypothesis adopted in conventional theoretical analysis and use the dynamic relaxation method to simulate the torsion buckling behavior of the pipe in a cylinder for the hinged and fixed support cases the configuration of the static equilibrium of the torsion buckling is analyzed in order to answer the questions mentioned in the previous paragraph 2 model and method 2 1 assumptions the following assumptions are made 1 the column is straight and it is also linear elastic 2 the cross section of the column is solid or hollow circle the cross section of the cylinder is circular too 3 the initial annular gap between the column and the cylinder exists the column before deformation is located in the center of the cylinder 4 the column is only subjected to a concentrated torque at the both ends 5 this annular gap is very small and the lateral deformation of the buckled column is very small the column is assumed to be of small deformation 6 the cylinder is treated as rigid bodies and fixed 7 the friction is ignored when the buckled column is in contact with the rigid cylinder wall 8 we study the final deformation of the column under the end torque the transient effects of inertial and damping forces are ignored 2 2 element description using bernoulli euler beam assumption the element is a circular column as shown in fig 1 where x straight axis of the column geometric locus of cross sectional centroids y z central and principal axes of the cross section let v w denote the lateral displacements in the y and z directions respectively u and φ x is the axial displacement in the x direction and the angle of twist about the x direction the elastic strain energy u p of circular beam element with length l can be expressed as barsoum and gallagher 1970 6 u p 1 2 0 l g j φ x 2 e i z v 2 e i y w 2 d x where is equivalent to d d x e and g are respectively the young s modulus and shear modulus i z and i y are moments of inertia calculated about the z and y axes respectively j is the polar moment of inertia of the cross sectional area the potential energy v p of the applied torque m x is given by 7 v p m x φ x 1 φ x 2 1 2 m x 0 l v w w v d x the second two parts in eq 6 equal the increased strain energy of the column during buckling the first part in eq 7 is the product of the applied torque and the corresponding displacement the change in potential energy due to torsional action is sought in finding the second part trahair and teh 2001 in eq 7 the term m x v w d x represents the work done by the moment component about the y axis m x v see fig 2 a of the torque m x when there is an angle change w d x about the y axis between the ends of an element of length d x see fig 2 b the term m x w v d x has the similar meaning the potential energy π p is given by 8 π p u p v p to transfer eq 8 into matrix expression displacement function is needed to describe the behavior of the element here using hermitian approximation zienkiewicz et al 2000 the element displacement vector d is 9 d u v w φ x t nq where q is the node displacement vector n is the hermitian shape function matrix q and n have the below expressions 10 q u 1 v 1 w 1 φ x 1 φ y 1 φ z 1 u 2 v 2 w 2 φ x 2 φ y 2 φ z 2 t 11 n n u n v n w n φ x h 1 0 0 0 0 f

introducing eq 9 into eqs 6 8 the potential energy is obtained 12 π p 1 2 q t k 0 q 1 2 q t k σ q q t f where k 0 and k σ are the linear and stress stiffness matrix respectively f is the node loads vector given by 13 f f x 1 f y 1 f z 1 m x 1 m y 1 m z 1 f x 2 f y 2 f z 2 m x 2 m y 2 m z 2 t use the minimum potential energy principle 14 δ π p 0 and perform the above variation on eq 12 the equilibrium equation of the following element is obtained 15 k 0 q k σ q f it is noted that the above formulas in this section do not take into account the contact between the column and the cylinder when the column buckles the contact relation will be described by the gap element 2 3 contact relation the contact relation between the column and the cylinder is described by using gap element a gap element liu et al 2002 zhang et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 is a virtual element its inner and outer boundaries are connected with the outer surface of the columns and the inner wall of the cylinders respectively the local coordinate system o y z of the gap element coincides with the local coordinate system of the beam element the gap element is a 2d element whose displacements are the lateral displacements of the beam element the displacement vector of the gap element is 16 u g v w t n g q where shape function matrix n g n v n w is a 2 12 matrix and the explicit expressions are given in eq 11 the lateral displacement u g and the direction angle β g of the gap element at any position are described below 17 u g u d v 2 w 2 β g β d arctan w v where u d and β d are the lateral displacement and the direction angle of the beam element respectively the initial gap r g of the gap element is expressed as 18 r g d i d 0 2 where d i and d 0 are the outer diameter of the column and the inner diameter of the cylinder respectively thus the normal strain ε g n of the gap element is 19 ε g n u g r g the contact force between the column and the inner surface of the cylinder is 20 f g n 0 g k u g r g u g r g 0 u g r g 0 where f g n is the contact force g k is the stiffness of the gap element when contact occurs the small penetration is u pe u g r g the contact force f g n can be further transformed to the additional nodal force of the beam element based on the strain ε g n in eq 20 and contact force f g n in eq 21 the definite formula of iteration calculation for gap element can be written as 1 for the free state 21 ε g n 1 0 ε min f g n f min 0 g k 0 2 for the elastic contact state 22 ε min ε g n 1 0 ε max f g n f min 0 g k 0 where ε min ε max and f min are small quantities larger than zero to control the convergence accuracy of gap element iteration ε min and ε max are the minimum and maximum iteration errors for gap element strain respectively f min is the iterative error of the gap element contact force in order to make the contact satisfy the definite solution of the gap element the stiffness g k of the gap element should be revised continuously in the iterative calculation similarly using the principle of minimum potential energy the stiffness matrix of the gap element can be written in the following formula liu et al 2002 23 k g n g t g k n g 2 4 static equilibrium equation by assembling the beam element in eq 15 and gap element in eq 23 we get the global equilibrium equation as follows 24 k 0 k σ k g u f m f g n where k 0 is the global elastic stiffness matrix k σ is the global stress stiffness matrix k g is the global gap element stiffness matrix u are the vector of node displacement f m and f g n are respectively the equivalent nodal force vector of the beam element and the gap element with respect to the global coordinates x y z in fig 4 the two ends of the columns see points a and b in fig 4 a are treated as hinged or fixed restraints the displacement boundary condition of the hinged constraint is 25 u a v a w a v b w b 0 while the displacement boundary condition of the fixed constraint is 26 u a v a w a v b w b 0 φ x a φ y a φ z a φ y b φ z b 0 the columns are subjected to a torque m t applied at point b the column end point the hinged constraint and its end torque are shown in fig 4 a the other end point a of the column is constrained by the torsional displacement φ a x 0 since the friction is ignored the columns are in statically equilibrium after torsion buckling the calculated reaction force m x a is equal to m x b m t m x b m x a under the action of torque m t torsion buckling deformation occurs the column is in contact with the inner wall of the rigid cylinder the possible deformation shape is shown in fig 4 c the cross section before and after the buckling is shown in fig 4 d and e respectively 2 5 virtual dynamic solution when the twisted column buckles the deformation changes dramatically and the buckled column suddenly contacts the cylinder problems such as deformation instability and convergence difficulty exist in our computational simulation to solve these problems we use the dynamic relaxation method zhang et al 2019 to transform the static buckling problem in fig 4 a into the artificial dynamic solution in fig 4 b in fig 4 b the perturbation force f p t is applied in the column middle to form the buckled shape easily in order to reduce the transient impact of torsion and perturbation force on the column the time history loading of sinusoidal wave is adopted the curves of m x b t and f p t are shown in fig 4 f and their expressions are as follows 27 m x b t m t sin π t t 0 0 t t 1 m t t t 1 28 f p t f p sin 2 π t t 0 0 t t 2 0 t t 2 in which t is the response time t 0 is the characteristic loading time t 1 t 0 4 t 2 t 0 2 by applying virtual inertia and damping force in dynamic relaxation method the static buckling system of eq 24 is transformed into a virtual dynamic solution 29 m u c u ku f t where k k 0 k σ k g m c and k are respectively the mass damping and stiffness matrix of the twist column u and u are the node acceleration and velocity vectors of the column respectively f t is the load vector of the column f t f m t f g n t f p t rayleigh damping is used to set the α damping to a large value which attenuates the dynamic response of the system in the nonlinear dynamic eq 29 the internal loads are no longer proportional to the node displacements the stiffness matrix of the twist column depends on the current displacements therefore instead of eq 29 the newmark scheme hughes 2012 is applied to the nonlinear semi discrete equation 30 m u t c u t f i t f a t where f i is the internal load vector f i k 0 k σ k g u t assuming that the time increment is δ t when t δ t eq 33 can be rewritten as follows 31 m u t δ t c u t δ t f t δ t i u t δ t f t δ t a it is noted that f t δ t i u t δ t is dependent on the current displacement u t δ t at time t δ t in addition to eq 31 the following formulas are used to update u t δ t and u t δ t 32 u t δ t u t 1 δ n u t δ n u t δ t δ t 33 u t δ t u t u t δ t 1 2 β n u t β n u t δ t δ t 2 where β n and δ n are newmark parameters the amplitude attenuation coefficient γ n is used to control the amount of numerical damping when the following relation is satisfied 34 δ n 1 2 γ β n 1 4 1 γ n 2 γ n 0 newmark scheme is unconditionally stable hughes 2012 in the current study we set γ n 0 005 using the newton raphson method bathe 2014 eq 31 eq 32 and eq 33 can be solved simultaneously when t t 0 2 f p 0 m x b remains unchanged thus eq 30 is rewritten as 35 f r t m u c u f a t f i t where f r t is residual force vector when the iteration process goes on the transient response of the twist column tends to be static and the deformation u gradually becomes constant u u and f r tend to be 0 then f a f i eq 24 can be calculated successfully the static equilibrium state is thus obtained for the twist column constrained by a cylinder 3 effect of the algorithm 3 1 calculation parameter the drill pipe with the length l 130 m the outer diameter d o 158 75 mm and the inner diameter d i 57 15 mm are selected to calculate the torsion buckling the drill pipe has an elastic modulus e 210 gpa and density ρ 7871 kg m3 the inner diameter of the cylinder d i 215 9 mm and the annular gap is r g 28 575 mm the length of each beam element is l 0 5 m 3 2 torsional buckling analysis without contact let the dimensionless torque of the column be 36 m t m t l 2 π e i the reference α 0 is α 0 2 ω where ω π 2 l 2 e i ρ a a π d o 2 d i 2 4 for α 20 α 0 various dimensionless torques m t are applied and the lateral deflection at the column mid point vs time is shown in fig 5 in fig 5 we can see that when m t 1 00 the lateral displacement u d decreases with the withdrawal of the lateral perturbation force f p and tends to zero gradually so the twisted column is in a stable state when m t 1 00 u d remains unchanged when f p is removed the twisted column is in a critical state of equilibrium and m t 1 00 is the critical value when m t 1 00 u d increases when f p is withdrawn so the twisted column is in an unstable state the dimensionless critical torque m t 1 00 calculated by us is fully consistent with the analytical solution in eq 1 which indicates that our computational simulation has a high calculation accuracy for static buckling solution for the dimensionless critical torque m t 1 00 the damping effect on the lateral deflection and buckled shape is shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively it is noticed that the smaller the damping the shorter the time to achieve lateral deflection stability and the smaller the deflection the buckling shape is a 3d spiral curve shown in fig 7 a while the 2d plane is circular as shown in fig 7 b 3 3 torsional buckling analysis with contact 3 3 1 effect of the damping for the dimensionless torque m t 2 50 the lateral displacement velocity and acceleration in the column mid point vs time are depicted in fig 8 under various alpha damping fig 9 shows the effect of the damping on the deflection curve with the increasing calculation time the lateral displacement u d increases gradually and tends to be constant because of the cylinder constraint the column contacts the inner wall of the cylinder when u d reaches annular gap r g 28 575 mm then u d remains unchanged in fig 8 it can be seen that after buckling the time required for the column to contact the cylindrical wall is positively correlated with the alpha damping during the loading stage of the torque and perturbation force a very small alpha damping will easily cause very large lateral velocity and acceleration which will make the calculation difficult to converge in the stable stage of the torque the lateral velocity and acceleration gradually tend to zero with the calculation time after the deflection is stabilized the lateral displacement and direction angle of the corresponding deflection curve remain unchanged and the deflection curves coincide with each other in fig 9 this result demonstrates that the ultimate buckling deformation does not change with the virtual damping therefore to get the convergence of the algorithm larger alpha damping is required to obtain stable lateral deformation a longer calculation time is required 3 3 2 effect of element length for a given damp α 450 α 0 and torque m t 2 50 fig 10 shows the effect of element length on the deflection curve in fig 10 a it is seen that the lateral displacement of different element lengths is almost the same for a given length range 0 25 m 4 00 m however element length has certain effect on the direction angle β d i e the direction angle decreases with the increasing element length in fig 10 b for a column length l 130 m it we set the element length as 0 25 m β d is 733 3 however when the element length is set as 4 00 m β d becomes 709 0 which decreases by 24 3 or 3 3 in order to improve the computational efficiency and maintain the computational accuracy the length of the element in this paper is taken as 0 50 m 4 post buckling configuration of twisted columns 4 1 post buckling deformation analysis the simulation parameters are the same as those in section 3 by changing the torque the characteristic post buckling modes of the twisted column in a cylinder are calculated fig 11 depicts the 3d deformation shape and plane curve of the characteristic configuration for hinged constraint fig 11 demonstrates that the buckling mode undergoes the deformation of single point two point three point and point line point contact in turn the deformation of point line point contact undergoes one two predictable three and more pitches in turn for hinged restraint the various buckling modes are as follows 1 when m t 1 00 the twisted column contacts with the midpoint of the cylinder and is divided into two suspended sections as shown in fig 11 a the deformation is a single point contact shape which is represented by the symbol c1 the buckling configuration consists of two equal length suspended sections l 1 2 when m t 1 37 the contact point in the middle of the twisted column disappears and two contact points appear at the both sides of the column midpoint as shown in fig 11 b the deformation suddenly changes into two point contact shape the buckling configuration consists of three suspension sections i e two equal length first suspension sections l 1 and 1 s suspended section l 2 3 when the torque m t further increases to 1 68 a contact point appears in the middle of the twisted column which transforms the deformation into a three point contact shape as shown in fig 11 c whether it is a single point two point or three point contact deformation the contact point is uniformly represented by the symbol c1 which is called the first contact point the twisted column is divided into four suspended sections and is composed of two equal length first suspended sections l 1 and two equal length second suspended sections l 2 4 when m t reaches 1 75 the single point contact shape in the midpoint of the column becomes a multi point continuous contact zone as shown in fig 11 d the continuous multi point contact is referred to as continuous contact or line contact the contact points at the both ends of the continuous contact zone are denoted by the symbol c2 which is called the second contact point between the continuous contact section and the ends of the column two single contact points still exist we call the deformation with both single point and continuous contact zone as the point line point contact configuration the buckling configuration is divided into four suspended sections and one continuous contact section i e two equal length first suspended sections l 2 two equal length second suspended sections l 2 and one continuous contact section l c 5 as the torque is further increased the length of the continuous contact section l c increases and the direction angle β c 2 c 2 between the contact points of the continuous contact zone ends also increases when the torque m t is increased to 2 81 β c 2 c 2 360 and one pitch is formed as shown in fig 11 e when m t 4 00 the deformed shape with two pitches is formed as shown in fig 11 f it is noted that the buckling configuration after point line point contact deformation is still composed of four suspended sections and one continuous contact section but the length of each section is different 4 2 relation between torque and each section length the positions of the contact points c1 and c2 verses the applied torque m t are plotted in fig 12 the length of each section is shown in fig 11 above the critical torques and the length of each section are summarized in table 1 for single point contact deformation the critical torque of fixed constraint is 1 42 times that of hinged constraint however when a pitch is formed the critical torque ratio of the two constraints decreases to about 1 14 times for single point contact deformation the contact point is always in the middle of the column however for the two point contact and the subsequent buckling deformation cases the contact point c1 gradually moves toward the end of the column for point line point contact deformation the contact point c2 also moves toward the end of the column as the torque increases we find that the pitch lengths are the same although the critical torques of the two constraints are different in table 1 the boundary conditions at the both ends affect only the length of the first and second suspended section i e the section length l 1 and l 2 among them the length of the first suspended section l 1 of hinged constraint is less than that of the fixed constraint however for the second suspended section l 2 the opposite conclusion appears we introduce the following dimensionless length variables 37 η l m t l e i η 1 m t l 1 e i η 2 m t l 2 e i η c m t l c e i η h m t l h e i where η l is the dimensionless length of the column η 1 η 2 η c and η h are the dimensionless lengths of the first the second suspended section the continuous contact section and one pitch section respectively when one pitch and n pitches are formed the dimensionless length of the continuous contact section can be further expressed as 38 η c n η h where n is no of pitch the curves of dimensionless length of each section corresponding to each dimensionless torque are drawn together as shown in fig 13 after the buckling deformation of point line point contact in fig 13 the dimensionless length η 1 and η 2 of the first and second suspended section tend to be constant rapidly with the increasing torque m t the dimensionless length η c of the continuous contact section increases linearly therefore when one or more pitches are formed the dimensionless pitch η h is constant the relation between the dimensionless torque m t and the length of each section is shown in table 3 according to the dimensionless torque in eq 36 and dimensionless length in eq 37 the relation between them is obtained as follows 39 m t η l 2 π combining the length of each section in table 3 and eq 39 if the geometric dimensions of the columns are known the critical torques of each buckling modes and the positions of each contact point can be calculated conversely if the torque and geometric size are known the critical torques of each buckling deformation and the positions of each contact point can be evaluated based on the results in table 2 the relation between dimensionless torque and pitch number of hinged and fixed boundaries is plotted in fig 14 which shows that the torque increases linearly with the pitch number considering the effect of both ends restraint the dimensionless torque of fixed restraint is 13 6 larger than that of hinged restraint 4 3 bending moment shear force and contact force in various buckling modes we analysis the bending moment shear force and contact force of the twisted columns in this section the following dimensionless load variables are used 40 m b m b l 2 r g e i f s f s l 3 r g e i f 1 f 1 l 3 r g e i f q f q l 4 r g e i where m b is the bending moment m b m y 2 m z 2 n m f s is the shear force f s f y 2 f z 2 n f 1 is the contact force at the first contact point n f q is the contact force at the continuous contact section n m for the hinged and fixed constraint the distribution of the dimensionless bending moment m b shear force f s and contact force f q are drawn in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 respectively in the buckling deformation with three point and point line point contact fig 15 indicates that the bending moment at the first contact point c1 has an inflection point and then increases sharply in the middle of the columns the bending moment reaches the maximum value and the larger the torque the larger the distribution area of the maximum value fig 16 shows that the shear distribution experienced a jump due to the existence of inflection point at the first contact point c1 the maximum shear force is also located at the middle of the columns and the distribution area of the maximum value increases with the applied torque for the hinged constraint in fig 17 a during the deformation from point line point contact to one pitch the peak of the contact force is near the end of the continuous contact section however for two and three pitch configurations the contact force increases sharply near the end of the continuous contact section and tends to the maximum value for the fixed constraint in fig 17 b regardless of the buckling configuration the maximum contact load is in the middle of the columns for these two constraints the length of the continuous contact section increases with the increasing torque and the distribution range of the maximum contact load is also larger since the maximum values of the dimensionless bending moment shear force and contact force generally appear in the middle of the columns and its vicinities we draw these maximum loads together from both our computational simulation and from our fitting formulas in figs 18 20 the dimensionless contact forces of the first contact point obtained by numerical simulation and by fitting formula are shown in fig 21 according to the results of our computational simulation in this paper the dimensionless loads are fitted as follows 41 for hinged constraint for fixed constraint m b 182 256 2 π m t 2 m b 144 256 2 π m t 2 f s 28 256 2 π m t 3 f s 36 256 2 π m t 3 f q 24 256 2 π m t 4 f q 27 256 2 π m t 4 f 1 35 256 2 π m t 3 f 1 47 256 2 π m t 3 these fitting formulas in eq 41 are in very good agreement with the computational simulation results as shown in figs 18 21 for the same dimensionless torque m t the dimensionless bending moment m b with fixed constraint is 25 less than that with hinged constraint however the other three dimensionless loads f s f q and f 1 with the fixed constraints are 30 12 and 35 larger than those with hinged constraints respectively for the same buckling mode in table 2 the values m b with the two constraints are nearly equal however those values f s f q and f 1 with the fixed constraints are 89 88 and 97 larger than those with hinged constraints respectively 4 4 verification of numerical results in order to verify the reliability of the numerical results the dimensionless critical torques calculated in this paper and the analytic solutions in the literatures are listed in table 3 our computational simulation results are in good agreement with those obtained by using small deformation hypothesis in the literature chen and li 2011 it is noted that the fitting eq 41 of the contact force f q in fig 20 b is also in good agreement with the formula in this published paper chen and li 2011 which also shows that the numerical results in this paper are very reliable 5 torsional buckling of sucker rods and drill pipes the columns in boreholes subjected to torque mainly are sucker rods of progressive cavity pump and drill pipes wherein the displacement boundary of the sucker rods and drill pipes can be simplified into fixed and hinged constraint respectively the maximum shear stress τ max of the columns subjected to torque is 42 τ max m t d o 2 j if the allowable shear stress τ 150 mpa the results of various types of columns can be obtained by using the dimensionless results in table 2 the calculation results of the torsion buckling for sucker rods and drill pipes are summarized in table 4 and table 5 respectively from tables 4 and 5 it is observed that under the same torsion strength the cross section size of the columns is positively correlated with the bending stiffness e i and torque m t but inversely correlated with the dimensionless torque m t as a result the lengths of the first second suspended section l 1 and l 2 and the pitch l h decrease while the length of the continuous contact section l c and the number of pitch increase for small diameter columns such as sucker rods of progressive cavity pump the dimensionless torques range from 12 20 to 38 63 and pitch numbers range from 7 68 to 27 31 the minimum values of the first and second suspended section l 1 and l 2 are 21 2 m and 2 7 m respectively the continuous contact section accounts for 85 95 of the well depth for large diameter columns such as drill pipes the dimensionless torque is between 2 96 and 13 81 and the number of pitches formed is between 0 83 and 8 88 when the pitch number is 0 83 the buckling shape with point line point contact is formed which is close to forming one pitch the minimum lengths of the first and second suspended section are 49 1 m and 17 8 m respectively the continuous contact section is 37 5 86 5 of the well depth dimensionless loads m b f s f 1 and f q can be calculated by fitting eq 41 then bending moment m b shear force f s and contact force f 1 and f q after torsion buckling are obtained by eq 40 thus torsion buckling of sucker rods and drill pipes occurs especially for small diameter sucker rods which is easier to cause buckling in engineering applications centralizers are usually designed on columns to avoid buckling the computational simulation results in this paper provide important theoretical basis for the design of centralizer spacing for example to avoid the buckling occurrence of one pitch the distance between centralizers should be less than the dimensionless pitch length η l see table 3 5 conclusion in this paper we study the buckling problem of a circular column constrained by a cylinder under concentrated torsion applied at its ends the both ends of the column are either hinged or fixed the hypotheses of bernoulli euler and small deformation are adopted the beam element and gap element are combined to describe the contact relation between the column and the cylinder virtual dynamic solution is implemented to compute the static equilibrium state of the twisted column constrained by the cylinder firstly we have studied the effect of torque and virtual damping on the lateral deformation when the cylindrical constraint is not considered the calculated critical torque of the column without cylindrical constraints is identical to the analytical solution given in eq 1 or eq 36 then when the cylindrical constraints are considered the effects of virtual damping and element length on the algorithm are investigated virtual damping has an effect on the calculation time but it ensures the convergence of torsional buckling while the element length affects the calculation accuracy we have further studied the post buckling modes of torsional columns with cylindrical constraints the buckling modes undergo the deformation of one point two point three point and point line point contact in turn and the deformation of point line point contact undergoes the buckling shape of one two predictable three pitches and multiple pitches sequentially it is found that the length of the first suspended section of the hinged end constraint is smaller than the value of the fixed end constraint however the length of the second suspended section has the opposite results for the same buckling mode the end constraint does not affect the pitch length of the continuous contact section we obtain the relation between the dimensionless torque and the dimensionless length of each section for the various buckling modes the dimensionless loads for torsional buckling modes are analyzed including the bending moment shear force and contact force the useful fitting formula are obtained for the relation between dimensionless torque and dimensionless loads we also verify that the critical torque obtained in this paper is consistent with the results of the small deformation hypothesis in the literature chen and li 2011 the contact force of the continuous contact section is also identical to this literature finally we analyze the torsional buckling of drill pipes and sucker rods of progressive cavity pump it is noted that for the same strength condition the number of pitches formed for small diameter sucker rods reaches from 7 to 27 for large diameter drill pipes nearly one to eight pitches can also be formed the investigation results in this paper provide highly valuable insights into the buckling behavior of torsional columns confined by cylinders our computational simulations also provide useful guidance for the spacing design of centralizers

22567,the characteristics of rolling with drift in regular beam sea for a small hard chine craft at rest is investigated experimentally and modification of a strip method with ikeda s roll damping prediction method for hard chine boat ikeda et al 1990 is proposed from the comparison between calculated and measured rao of rolling it is confirmed that the calculation overestimates roll amplitude at the condition where wave encounter period is shorter than its roll natural period especially the reasons of overestimation are investigated and it is confirmed that the coupling viscous roll moment from swaying cannot be ignored for small hard chine craft for shorter wave period than its roll natural period because the roll natural period is shorter than that of a conventional displacement type vessel and its resonant wavelength is short comparing with its breadth therefore its swaying can t follow orbital motion of wave then coupling viscous roll moment from swaying becomes significant moreover as another reason of the overestimation the estimation accuracy of wave exciting roll moment is investigated and it is recommended that the diffraction potential should be solved under strict satisfying the body boundary condition for short wave length λ b 7 0 keywords small hard chine craft roll damping viscous effects sway roll coupling motion 1 introduction in general sea trial is conducted at calm sea condition to avoid the effects of winds and waves on its results however it is difficult to ignore their effects on small craft as compared to their effects on conventional displacement type vessel therefore it is necessary to correct these effects by using measured sea condition when sea trial is conducted in this research group a simplified method to obtain wave spectrum by using measured rolling of small hard chine craft without forward speed is investigated katayama and adachi 2016 the reason why rolling is used is because a small hard chine craft drifts generally in beam sea and it is confirmed by full scale measurements in real sea the simplified method to obtained wave spectrum which is proposed by katayama and adachi 2016 requires the rao response amplitude operator of rolling of the small hard chine craft whose rolling is measured then it is considered to use osm ordinary strip method e g tasai and takagi 1969 and korvin kroukovsky 1955 with ikeda s roll damping prediction method for hard chine boat ikeda and umeda 1990 in order to estimate rao of rolling as the simplest method however it is confirmed by katayama and adachi 2016 that osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat overestimates rolling of small hard chine craft at the condition where wave encounter period is shorter than its roll natural period in this study the characteristics of rolling in regular beam sea without forward speed of a scale model are investigated experimentally and its estimation method is considered based on a strip method with ikeda s roll damping prediction method for hard chine boat 2 characteristics of rolling in regular beam sea at rest 2 1 subject ship table 1 and fig 1 show the principle particulars and a photograph of the subject model height of the center of gravity kg and roll natural period t n are obtained from inclining test and free decay test respectively 2 2 measuring device and coordinate system fig 2 shows a schematic view of experiment and its coordinate system in this model experiment surge and yaw motions are fixed whereas roll sway drift heave and pitch motions are free wave height is measured with a servo type wave height meter attached to the model basin data is collected with 100 hz of sampling frequency wave height is small enough to avoid nonlinearity of rolling for wave height see appendix 2 3 measured results fig 3 shows the measured and the calculated results of non dimensional roll amplitude k wave number ζ a wave amplitude and phase delay to incident waves the estimation method is osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat the horizontal axis of this figure is the ratio of roll circular frequency to roll natural circular frequency ω e ω n from upper figure of fig 3 it is known that the calculated result is larger than the measured results in the region of ω e ω n 0 8 λ b 3 56 3 cause of overestimation as causes of the overestimation roll damping coupled viscous effects from swaying to rolling and wave exciting roll moment are investigated 3 1 roll damping a forced roll test is carried out to obtain roll damping the model is made sinusoidal rolling around the center of gravity and forced roll moment and roll displacement are measured amplitude of forced rolling is 5 0deg and its periods are 0 60 0 80 1 00 1 20 1 40s roll damping coefficient b 44 is obtained from dividing the roll moment at the moment when roll angular velocity is maximum by the maximum roll angular velocity fig 4 shows measured and estimated roll damping coefficient b 44 this figure shows that the estimated results is slightly smaller than the measured results fig 5 shows the estimated results by using the measured b 44 the modified estimation with the measured roll damping is slightly better than the original estimation however it seems that it is not significant 3 2 coupling viscous effects on rolling from swaying ikeda et al 1982 indicates that the viscous effects on rolling under coupling swaying rolling in wave is completely different from the effects under single rolling if relative fluid velocity caused by swaying and orbital motion of wave is significant compared with relative fluid velocity caused by rolling fig 6 shows the measured and the estimated results of non dimensional sway amplitude and phase delay to incident waves the horizontal axis of this figure is same as fig 3 this figure shows that sway amplitude is almost 1 0 and phase delay is almost 90deg when ω e ω n smaller than 0 8 on the other hand when ω e ω n larger than 0 8 sway amplitude becomes small according to increase in ω e ω n this means that swaying does not follow orbital motion of wave and it makes the relative fluid velocity that may affect the viscous effects on rolling generally the wave length of significant waves for conventional displacement type vessels is much longer than ship breadth in this situation swaying follows orbital motion of wave and coupling viscous effects on rolling from swaying is not significant however relative fluid velocity caused by swaying and orbital motion of wave is significant when swaying does not follow orbital motion of wave as shown in fig 6 fig 7 shows relative fluid velocity at keel of midship section caused by rolling only and by rolling sway and orbital motion of wave at the moments when ship is upright and has maximum roll angle under rolling the horizontal axis of this figure is same as fig 3 this figure shows that relative fluid velocity is clearly caused by swaying and orbital motion of wave in order to measure the hydrodynamic roll moment that is the viscous effects on rolling caused by coupling swaying rolling in wave at the condition show in fig 7 a forced coupling sway roll test is carried out the model is forced to perform sinusoidal rolling around the center of gravity and forced roll moment and roll displacement are measured fig 8 shows a schematic view of forced motion test and its coordinate system a model is fixed with three arms arm 1 and arm 2 are made the parallel swaying that has same amplitude and phase and when all arms do the same motion a model has swaying when only arm 3 moves a model has rolling when motion of arm 3 is different from motions of arm 1 and arm2 a model makes a coupling motion of sway and roll forced sway force is measured with the strain gages attached to arm 1 and arm 2 forced roll moment around roll center is measured with the strain gage attached to arm 3 roll damping moments with the coupling effects from swaying is obtained as a component in proportion to roll angular velocity and another component in proportion to roll angular acceleration is also obtained from the measured forced roll moment table 2 shows experimental conditions of the forced roll test the measurement at the same condition shown on table 2 is also carried out in the air to subtract inertia force or moment fig 9 shows roll damping with and without the coupling effects from swaying and orbital motion of wave at roll period t 0 70s as a sample this figure shows that the coupling effects change roll damping fig 10 shows a modified estimated result by using measured roll damping roll damping and coupling roll damping from swaying by the forced coupling sway roll test the modified estimated result is better than the result of osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat the modified estimation method is much better than the original estimation generally strip methods consider the coupling wave roll damping from swaying because they solve coupling motion equations therefore the results of fig 10 show that the measured coupling roll damping including the coupling viscous roll damping from swaying and it is significant although a forced coupling sway roll test is carried out to obtain the coupling viscous roll damping in this paper ikeda et al 1982 proposes the method which takes the coupling viscous effects on bilge keel component of ikeda s roll damping estimation method for conventional displacement type vessel the method can apply for ikeda s method for hard chine boat 3 3 wave exciting roll moment ikeda et al 1992 indicates that the measured wave exciting roll moment acting on a small hard chine craft is much smaller than the estimated ones by osm with ursell tasai method of lewis form section tasai and takagi 1969 and close fit method maeda h 1969 and their result is different from the result that wave exciting roll moment can be calculated accurately if a sectional hull form is expressed correctly in the case of a general cargo ship by fujino et al 1983 fig 11 shows comparison between measured and estimated wave exciting moments this figure shows measured results and the calculated results by five different methods whose details are listed in table 3 from fig 11 it is found that the measured results are much smaller than the estimated results by osm or nsm with lewis form and nsm with bem in osm or nsm with lewis form ursell tasai method of lewis form section is used and the diffraction potential is not solved with strict body boundary condition as shown in table 3 and nsm with bem uses boundary element method however the diffraction potential is not solved strictly on the other hand it is also found that stfm with bem and 3d bem is better agreement with the measured results in these calculations the diffraction potential is solved with strict body boundary condition as shown in table 3 from the above mentioned results it seems that one of the reasons for the difference of wave exciting moment is how to solve diffraction potential generally it is difficult to apply the radiation potential to calculation of wave exciting roll moment instead of the diffraction potential at the wave length not long enough to compare with breadth of ship because in the solving for diffraction potential the representative velocity of orbital motion of incident wave can not be applied for the body boundary condition and the velocity of incident wave at the body surface position should be used fig 12 shows comparison among measured rao of rolling and calculated results by the osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat and the modified osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat which includes the measured roll moment by the sway roll coupling forced motion test and the wave exciting moment obtained by solving diffraction potential with strict body boundary condition this figure shows that the results of modified osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat are significantly improved 4 conclusions in this study the characteristics of rolling of a small hard chine craft without forward speed in regular beam sea are investigated experimentally and improvement of osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat is considered to increase accuracy of estimation of rao of rolling the following conclusions are obtained 1 the estimation method which is osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat overestimates roll amplitude of a small hard chine craft without forward speed at the condition where wave encounter period is shorter than its roll natural period and around roll natural period 2 it seems that one of the reasons of overestimation around roll natural period is accuracy of roll damping estimation estimated roll damping by ikeda s method for hard chine boat is slightly smaller than the measured one osm with modified ikeda s method for hard chine boat is slightly better than the original method however it seems that it is not significant 3 from the measured results of swaying it is found that phase delay of swaying to wave is drastically changed in shorter wave period than roll natural period the change in phase delay means that its swaying can t follow orbital motion of wave finally it causes relative velocity around hull and the relative velocity makes the coupling viscous roll damping it is one of the reasons of overestimation that osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat does not include the effects the modified method which takes the coupling effects on viscous roll damping from swaying is much better than the original method the effects should be considered roll motion calculation for small hard chine craft 4 as another reason of the overestimation the prediction accuracy of wave exciting moment is doubted measured wave exciting roll moment is smaller than the results by osm the cause of overestimation is the estimation of diffraction force in the range of λ b 1 to 7 in the above mentioned range of λ b in the estimation of diffraction force the diffraction potential should be solved under satisfying strict body boundary condition in wave 5 finally it is confirmed that the modified osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat including above mentioned all modifications is significantly improved and good agreement with measured rao of rolling appendix effects of wave height on roll amplitude roll amplitudes for systematically changed wave height at the roll natural period are measured in order to investigate the maximum limit of wave height where roll amplitude is linear for wave height experimental method is the same as the method explained in chapter 2 fig a1 shows the measured results the horizontal dot dash line shows the roll angle where the chine is on the water surface in calm water this figure shows that roll amplitude increases according to increases of wave height and it is in proportion to wave height at the wave height smaller than about 1 9 cm fig a1 roll amplitude in regular beam sea without forward speed at d

test the measurement at the same condition shown on table 2 is also carried out in the air to subtract inertia force or moment fig 9 shows roll damping with and without the coupling effects from swaying and orbital motion of wave at roll period t 0 70s as a sample this figure shows that the coupling effects change roll damping fig 10 shows a modified estimated result by using measured roll damping roll damping and coupling roll damping from swaying by the forced coupling sway roll test the modified estimated result is better than the result of osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat the modified estimation method is much better than the original estimation generally strip methods consider the coupling wave roll damping from swaying because they solve coupling motion equations therefore the results of fig 10 show that the measured coupling roll damping including the coupling viscous roll damping from swaying and it is significant although a forced coupling sway roll test is carried out to obtain the coupling viscous roll damping in this paper ikeda et al 1982 proposes the method which takes the coupling viscous effects on bilge keel component of ikeda s roll damping estimation method for conventional displacement type vessel the method can apply for ikeda s method for hard chine boat 3 3 wave exciting roll moment ikeda et al 1992 indicates that the measured wave exciting roll moment acting on a small hard chine craft is much smaller than the estimated ones by osm with ursell tasai method of lewis form section tasai and takagi 1969 and close fit method maeda h 1969 and their result is different from the result that wave exciting roll moment can be calculated accurately if a sectional hull form is expressed correctly in the case of a general cargo ship by fujino et al 1983 fig 11 shows comparison between measured and estimated wave exciting moments this figure shows measured results and the calculated results by five different methods whose details are listed in table 3 from fig 11 it is found that the measured results are much smaller than the estimated results by osm or nsm with lewis form and nsm with bem in osm or nsm with lewis form ursell tasai method of lewis form section is used and the diffraction potential is not solved with strict body boundary condition as shown in table 3 and nsm with bem uses boundary element method however the diffraction potential is not solved strictly on the other hand it is also found that stfm with bem and 3d bem is better agreement with the measured results in these calculations the diffraction potential is solved with strict body boundary condition as shown in table 3 from the above mentioned results it seems that one of the reasons for the difference of wave exciting moment is how to solve diffraction potential generally it is difficult to apply the radiation potential to calculation of wave exciting roll moment instead of the diffraction potential at the wave length not long enough to compare with breadth of ship because in the solving for diffraction potential the representative velocity of orbital motion of incident wave can not be applied for the body boundary condition and the velocity of incident wave at the body surface position should be used fig 12 shows comparison among measured rao of rolling and calculated results by the osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat and the modified osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat which includes the measured roll moment by the sway roll coupling forced motion test and the wave exciting moment obtained by solving diffraction potential with strict body boundary condition this figure shows that the results of modified osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat are significantly improved 4 conclusions in this study the characteristics of rolling of a small hard chine craft without forward speed in regular beam sea are investigated experimentally and improvement of osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat is considered to increase accuracy of estimation of rao of rolling the following conclusions are obtained 1 the estimation method which is osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat overestimates roll amplitude of a small hard chine craft without forward speed at the condition where wave encounter period is shorter than its roll natural period and around roll natural period 2 it seems that one of the reasons of overestimation around roll natural period is accuracy of roll damping estimation estimated roll damping by ikeda s method for hard chine boat is slightly smaller than the measured one osm with modified ikeda s method for hard chine boat is slightly better than the original method however it seems that it is not significant 3 from the measured results of swaying it is found that phase delay of swaying to wave is drastically changed in shorter wave period than roll natural period the change in phase delay means that its swaying can t follow orbital motion of wave finally it causes relative velocity around hull and the relative velocity makes the coupling viscous roll damping it is one of the reasons of overestimation that osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat does not include the effects the modified method which takes the coupling effects on viscous roll damping from swaying is much better than the original method the effects should be considered roll motion calculation for small hard chine craft 4 as another reason of the overestimation the prediction accuracy of wave exciting moment is doubted measured wave exciting roll moment is smaller than the results by osm the cause of overestimation is the estimation of diffraction force in the range of λ b 1 to 7 in the above mentioned range of λ b in the estimation of diffraction force the diffraction potential should be solved under satisfying strict body boundary condition in wave 5 finally it is confirmed that the modified osm with ikeda s method for hard chine boat including above mentioned all modifications is significantly improved and good agreement with measured rao of rolling appendix effects of wave height on roll amplitude roll amplitudes for systematically changed wave height at the roll natural period are measured in order to investigate the maximum limit of wave height where roll amplitude is linear for wave height experimental method is the same as the method explained in chapter 2 fig a1 shows the measured results the horizontal dot dash line shows the roll angle where the chine is on the water surface in calm water this figure shows that roll amplitude increases according to increases of wave height and it is in proportion to wave height at the wave height smaller than about 1 9 cm fig a1 roll amplitude in regular beam sea without forward speed at d

22568,surf riding broaching is a dangerous event for high speed ships running in stern quartering seas theoretical methods for the prediction of wave induced forces on ships in surf riding and broaching situations are still of the qualitative level therefore an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes computational fluid dynamics cfd solver with overset grids was applied to predict the wave induced forces on ships in irregular stern quartering seas to validate the cfd method a dedicated model experiment was conducted for slender ships and the wave induced forces were measured to be for a direct comparison with cfd predictions using the same irregular waves encountered the comparison results indicate good agreement between the cfd results and the experimental fluid dynamics efd results except for the wave induced roll moment keywords stern quartering seas irregular seas wave induced force computational fluid dynamics experimental fluid dynamics surf riding broaching 1 introduction the numerical prediction of wave induced forces acting on a slender ship running in stern quartering seas is important to realise the quantitative prediction of surf riding broaching surf riding broaching is one of five stability failure modes in the second generation intact stability criteria discussed at the international maritime organisation imo imo 2016 theoretical methods such as the slender body theory e g ohkusu 1986 are useful for the predication of wave induced forces because their calculation costs are low however the accuracy of these methods has not reached the quantitative level hitherto hashimoto et al 2011 umeda et al 2016 although numerical methods such as time domain panel methods are candidates for improving the prediction accuracy few applications with the view of ship stability were reported for ships running in stern quartering seas e g verboom and van walree 2015 while a number of applications can be found in seakeeping problems this could be because a dynamic lift force due to the wave orbital motion is not negligible in stern quartering seas kashiwagi 1983 it is obvious that the prediction accuracy of surf riding broaching strongly depends on the prediction accuracy of wave induced forces hashimoto et al 2004 feng et al 2017 therefore an inaccurate prediction could result in the misjudgement of surf riding and broaching occurrences to realise the quantitative prediction of wave induced forces in following and stern quartering seas an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans solver was applied to the problem of regular seas as an advanced measure subsequently computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations indicated promising results hashimoto et al 2016 yoneda et al 2016 this result was reasonable because the urans solver used for these studies had already shown good capability for the direct prediction of surf riding and broaching events carrica 2008 sadat hosseini et al 2011 in this study we used the same urans cfd solver for the prediction of wave induced forces in irregular stern quartering seas which is the most relevant environment for the safety assessment of surf riding broaching the computational domain is discretised using multiblock structured grids with the method for the treatment of overset grids to generate the same irregular waves encountered in experimental fluid dynamics efd the measured irregular wave was decomposed to a finite number of elementary waves using a fast fourier transform fft analysis then the determined amplitude and phase of the elementary waves were used as the input for the wave boundary condition of the cfd solver to reproduce the same irregular wave profile subsequently cfd simulation was performed and validated deterministically through comparisons with a semi captive towing test in irregular seas for a high speed slender ship known as the onr tumblehome for the reproduction of irregular waves finer grids are necessary to maintain the wave profile in terms of numerical dissipation compared to cases in regular seas validation studies indicated the good agreement between the urans cfd simulations with the efd results in the prediction of wave induced hydrodynamic forces and ship vertical motions in irregular stern quartering seas because there is a strong demand for the reduction of computational cost time from a practical view point grid coarsening is attempted and its influence on the prediction accuracy is discussed finally similar cfd predictions of wave induced forces in irregular seas were performed for the onr flare of almost the same underwater hull form as the onr tumblehome but with a significantly different above water hull form by comparing the cfd result with that of the efd it is demonstrated that the urans cfd solver can capture the influence of the above water hull form on the wave induced force these results show the possibility in replacing the time and cost consuming semi captive model experiments by cfd simulation in the future 2 efd method 2 1 subject ship the subject ship is the onr tumblehome known as a high speed slender vessel with a wave piercing bow it is known that high speed slender ships are prone to suffer from surf riding and broaching owing to the small hull resistance this fact was clearly demonstrated by a free running model experiment in regular umeda et al 2008 and irregular stern quartering seas umeda et al 2016 principal particulears of the subject ship are shown in table 1 2 2 efd setup a model experiment was conducted at the marine dynamic basin of national research institute of fisheries engineering see fig 1 in the model experiment all appendages except for the twin propellers and their shafts were attached such that the experimental conditions are similar to those of the actual conditions because the exclusion of appendages results in the slight overestimation of wave induced hydrodynamic forces yoneda et al 2016 the ship model was attached to a towing subcarriage through a heaving rod a load cell to measure hydrodynamic forces is attached between the ship model and heaving rod as shown in figs 2 3 subsequently the ship model was towed in an oblique direction by the combination of the primary carriage and subcarriage the ship model was free in heave and pitch to directly compare the wave induced hydrodynamic forces in irregular waves the encountered irregular waves in the experiment must be reproduced in the cfd simulation to confirm the accuracy of wave reproduction two needle type wave probes were attached to the subcarriage as shown in fig 4 the longitudinal positions of the two wave probes are midship and bow and their transversal positions are at the end of the subcarriage to be outside of the ship generated waves 2 3 fed procedure prior to the oblique towing test in irregular waves wave measurements without the ship model were performed see fig 5 the change in wave elevation with respect to time at the position of the two wave probes was recorded for 10 min from when all the elementary waves reached the measurement point the input wave condition is shown in table 2 the mean wave period was selected to be similar with a previous free running model test umeda et al 2016 the international ship structure congress issc wave spectrum issc 1964 from 0 3 hz to 3 0 hz was used to generate elementary waves in the experiment the measured wave elevation at a fixed point in the wave basin is shown in fig 6 an oblique towing test in long crested irregular waves was conducted the towing condition is shown in table 3 the froude number was calculated using the water plane length as the representative length the coordinate system used in the analyses in the following sections is found in fig 9 in the experiment the ship model was towed in irregular stern quartering seas as shown in fig 7 during the towing test the wave induced surge force sway force roll moment and yaw moment were measured by a load cell on a gimbal and the heave and pitch motions were measured by potentiometers in addition the wave elevations at two positions i e midship and bow were measured using wave probes 3 cfd method 3 1 urans solver and grids for an accurate prediction of wave induced forces a cfd approach solving the navier stokes equation computationally is the most straightforward a cfd code cfdship iowa v4 5 carrica et al 2007a 2007b xing et al 2008 huang et al 2008 developed by iihr hydroscience engineering of the university of iowa was used for our cfd simulations recent applications of cfdship iowa to ship hydrodynamics can be found in literature stern et al 2015 cfdship iowa solves the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for the liquid phase of a free surface flow the equations are discretized in space with a finite difference approach cfdship iowa is a block structured overset cfd solver designed for applications in naval architecture problems using either absolute or relative inertial non orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems for arbitrarily moving control volumes turbulence models include the bended k ε k ω based isotropic and anisotropic rans and des approaches with near wall or wall functions a single phase level set method was used for capturing complex free surfaces the suggar code noack 2007 was used to obtain overset interpolation information between the set of overlapping grids the forces and moments can be calculated by integrating the local elemental forces along the hull surface it was confirmed that the prediction of wave induced surge forces using cfdship iowa demonstrated quantitative agreement with efd in regular following and stern quartering seas hashimoto et al 2016 the grid design for the cfd computation is shown in figs 8 9 and the coordinate system used in this study is shown in fig 9 the number of grid points is indicated in table 4 to obtain cfd results comparable to those of efd all the appendages in the experiment i e skeg bilge keels rudders and shaft brackets were included in the cfd grids to enhance the connectivity between the moving and background grids several refinement grids were introduced the grid spacing at the hull is set to 10 6 for the ship having the unit length the grid quality was verified for a calm water resistance problem furukawa et al 2012 it is noteworthy that relatively short elementary waves disappear easily if sufficiently dense background grids are not used the conditions set for cfd computation are presented in table 5 these conditions were used previously for the prediction of wave induced forces in regular seas hashimoto et al 2016 yoneda et al 2016 3 2 irregular wave generation for the generation of irregular waves in cfd the measured irregular waves are decomposed to a finite number of elementary waves under the hypothesis of linear wave superposition therefore the frequency components of the measured wave data shown in fig 6 are analysed by a fft the fft result of the amplitude and phase with respect to angular frequency is shown in fig 10 subsequently the determined wave frequencies wave numbers wave amplitudes and wave phase of 1000 elementary waves were used for the reproduction of long crested irregular waves in cfd here the wave elevation the velocity and the pressure are calculated as a superposition of linear waves and they are imposed as the inlet boundary condition and the initial boundary condition here these boundary conditions can be uniquely determined for the given time and x and z position of grid points the x position is updated in each time step using the time history of carriage speed the ship was running in stern quartering seas and was overtaken by the wave at the tested froude number therefore inversed time was used for the fft analysis of the wave phase the location of free surface is determined by solving a level set function and the pressure at the free surface taking the interfacial jump condition into account is enforced as the boundary condition in each time step carrica et al 2006 2007a for dealing large amplitude ship motions cfdship iowa allows overset multiblock grids and the suggar code noack 2007 can deal the overset domain connectivity among the set of overlapping grids this cfd scheme has been applied to a number of problems on ship dynamics in waves with experimental validations carrica et al 2007b sadat hosseini et al 2010 2011 castiglione et al 2011 a snapshot of the simulated wave pattern around the ship is shown in fig 11 4 results and discussion 4 1 irregular wave elevation first the accuracy of the irregular waves reproduced by cfd is investigated the cfd simulation was run on the hpc cluster neon at the university of iowa and the computation time for 12 s simulation is about 27 5 h using 64 cpu cores the comparison of water elevation at the position of wave probe 1 between efd and cfd is shown in fig 12 the speed of the towing carriage became constant from 128 to 140 s before and after this range the towing carriage is either accelerated or decelerated for a constant speed range the irregular wave surface can be well reproduced by cfd for relatively long waves that are dominant components for the wave induced forces in stern quartering seas 4 2 heave and pitch next the prediction accuracy of ship motions in irregular stern quartering seas is investigated the comparisons of the heave and pitch motions are shown in fig 13 a good agreement between efd and cfd results can be observed for the vertical ship motion and the same for the irregular wave elevation an unstable behaviour occurred at the beginning of the cfd result this is natural tendency of cfd that does not start from a state of rest because the flow field and ship attitude do not correspond to those of efd for the first several time steps 4 3 wave induced force finally the prediction accuracy of wave induced forces on the subject ship running in irregular stern quartering seas is investigated the comparisons of surge force sway force roll moment and yaw moment are shown in fig 14 the centre of the roll moment is assumed to be two times higher than the draught from the keel subsequently the measured and calculated roll moments were converted from the original heights of each measurement centre the centre of the yaw moment was assumed to be midship the towing carriage was accelerated till 128 s and decelerated after 140 s so the large value due to the inertia force appears after 140 s in efd the surge force includes the calm water resistance component in both efd and cfd therefore the mean value of the variation is not zero nevertheless the agreement in surge is good therefore both the wave component and calm water resistance component are well predicted by cfd the sway force and yaw moment are also predicted with sufficient accuracy which are difficult to predict by the theoretical methods hashimoto et al 2011 umeda et al 2016 the irregularity of yaw moment is the most prominent than the others and this trend can be well captured by cfd the agreement in the roll moment is worse than the other modes this is possibly because the magnitude of the roll moment is much smaller than that of the yaw moment therefore a higher accuracy is required for cfd for the roll mode 5 further discussion 5 1 grid coarsening the urans cfd simulation was demonstrated to predict the wave induced forces on ships running in irregular stern quartering seas well however a larger number of grid points and a longer computation time are required for irregular seas compared to regular seas therefore grid coarsening was tested to reveal the required spatial resolution to capture the wave induced forces in irregular stern quartering seas the coarsened grids are shown in fig 15 and the number of grid points is presented in table 6 the cfd conditions are the same as the dense grids case the shaft brackets are intentionally removed for simplicity the background grids are also coarsened but not as significantly in order to maintain the accuracy of irregular wave reproduction and propagation the comparison of cfd results using the dense and coarsened grids are shown in fig 16 along with the efd result a slight difference is shown in the sway and yaw around the third positive peak between the dense and coarse grids regarding the inaccuracy of the roll moment the improvement rate with respect to the grid points is low therefore the required grid points for the quantitative prediction of the wave induced roll moment could be numerous as the difference between the two results is negligible the coarsened grid tested is applicable to the following discussions 5 2 onr flare to collect more examples of the cfd prediction of wave induced forces in irregular stern quartering seas a similar validation study was executed for the onr flare that has almost the same underwater hull with the onr tumblehome but its topside exhibits an outward inclination unlike the onr tumblehome that exhibits an inward inclination fig 17 shows the ship model used for efd analysis for the direct comparison between the onr tumblehome and onr flare the random seed for the wave phases in the experiment was maintained such that the same irregular waves can be generated further at the same start time the same towing speed and heading angle were used as those for the onr tumblehome the grid design for the onr flare is shown in fig 18 and the number of grid points is presented in table 7 the shaft brackets are neglected similar to those in section 5 1 it is noteworthy that the same background grids were used with cfd for the onr tumblehome such that the incident irregular waves in each cfd simulation are the same the measured and calculated results of the wave induced forces are compared as shown in fig 19 the cfd result agrees well in terms of the surge force but not the roll moment as in the onr tumblehome case the agreement becomes worse in the sway force and yaw moment though the cfd result shows the same change trend among different hulls this might be because the spatial resolution of the hull using 1 92 m grid points is insufficient to obtain the appropriate pressure distribution on the hull further grid studies and investigations are required for a more concrete conclusion on the onr flare 5 3 influence of above water hull form the efd results for the onr flare and onr tumblehome are compared as already mentioned the major difference between the two ships is the inclination direction of the topside therefore the influence of the topside inclination should be discussed as shown in fig 19 the effect of the above water hull form does not appear in the surge force while it appears in the sway roll and yaw more precisely the amplitudes of the sway force roll and yaw moments of the onr flare are larger than those of the onr tumblehome this efd trend can be captured by cfd calculations based on the comparison results herein it can be concluded that urans cfd methods exhibit certain potential in replacing conventional captive model experiments in the future for the prediction of wave induced surge force sway force and yaw moment further investigations are required to predict wave induced roll moments 6 conclusions a captive model experiment was conducted for the onr tumblehome in irregular stern quartering seas to realise the quantitative prediction of wave induced forces an urans cfd simulation was performed using the same condition as the model experiment the encountered irregular waves were reproduced successfully in the cfd simulation subsequently cfd results of wave induced forces on ships were compared with the efd results it was demonstrated that the cfd results showed good agreement with the efd results in irregular stern quartering seas if a sufficient number of grid points is assigned for the hull on the other hand it was found that the prediction of wave induced roll moment is still challenging even using the unsteady rans cfd similar investigations for more severe waves involving wave breaking and overtopping are expected for the quantitative safety assessment of high speed ships against surf riding broaching in addition further validation studies for variety of ships are also expected to show the suitability of cfd method for the widespread use in the future

2007b sadat hosseini et al 2010 2011 castiglione et al 2011 a snapshot of the simulated wave pattern around the ship is shown in fig 11 4 results and discussion 4 1 irregular wave elevation first the accuracy of the irregular waves reproduced by cfd is investigated the cfd simulation was run on the hpc cluster neon at the university of iowa and the computation time for 12 s simulation is about 27 5 h using 64 cpu cores the comparison of water elevation at the position of wave probe 1 between efd and cfd is shown in fig 12 the speed of the towing carriage became constant from 128 to 140 s before and after this range the towing carriage is either accelerated or decelerated for a constant speed range the irregular wave surface can be well reproduced by cfd for relatively long waves that are dominant components for the wave induced forces in stern quartering seas 4 2 heave and pitch next the prediction accuracy of ship motions in irregular stern quartering seas is investigated the comparisons of the heave and pitch motions are shown in fig 13 a good agreement between efd and cfd results can be observed for the vertical ship motion and the same for the irregular wave elevation an unstable behaviour occurred at the beginning of the cfd result this is natural tendency of cfd that does not start from a state of rest because the flow field and ship attitude do not correspond to those of efd for the first several time steps 4 3 wave induced force finally the prediction accuracy of wave induced forces on the subject ship running in irregular stern quartering seas is investigated the comparisons of surge force sway force roll moment and yaw moment are shown in fig 14 the centre of the roll moment is assumed to be two times higher than the draught from the keel subsequently the measured and calculated roll moments were converted from the original heights of each measurement centre the centre of the yaw moment was assumed to be midship the towing carriage was accelerated till 128 s and decelerated after 140 s so the large value due to the inertia force appears after 140 s in efd the surge force includes the calm water resistance component in both efd and cfd therefore the mean value of the variation is not zero nevertheless the agreement in surge is good therefore both the wave component and calm water resistance component are well predicted by cfd the sway force and yaw moment are also predicted with sufficient accuracy which are difficult to predict by the theoretical methods hashimoto et al 2011 umeda et al 2016 the irregularity of yaw moment is the most prominent than the others and this trend can be well captured by cfd the agreement in the roll moment is worse than the other modes this is possibly because the magnitude of the roll moment is much smaller than that of the yaw moment therefore a higher accuracy is required for cfd for the roll mode 5 further discussion 5 1 grid coarsening the urans cfd simulation was demonstrated to predict the wave induced forces on ships running in irregular stern quartering seas well however a larger number of grid points and a longer computation time are required for irregular seas compared to regular seas therefore grid coarsening was tested to reveal the required spatial resolution to capture the wave induced forces in irregular stern quartering seas the coarsened grids are shown in fig 15 and the number of grid points is presented in table 6 the cfd conditions are the same as the dense grids case the shaft brackets are intentionally removed for simplicity the background grids are also coarsened but not as significantly in order to maintain the accuracy of irregular wave reproduction and propagation the comparison of cfd results using the dense and coarsened grids are shown in fig 16 along with the efd result a slight difference is shown in the sway and yaw around the third positive peak between the dense and coarse grids regarding the inaccuracy of the roll moment the improvement rate with respect to the grid points is low therefore the required grid points for the quantitative prediction of the wave induced roll moment could be numerous as the difference between the two results is negligible the coarsened grid tested is applicable to the following discussions 5 2 onr flare to collect more examples of the cfd prediction of wave induced forces in irregular stern quartering seas a similar validation study was executed for the onr flare that has almost the same underwater hull with the onr tumblehome but its topside exhibits an outward inclination unlike the onr tumblehome that exhibits an inward inclination fig 17 shows the ship model used for efd analysis for the direct comparison between the onr tumblehome and onr flare the random seed for the wave phases in the experiment was maintained such that the same irregular waves can be generated further at the same start time the same towing speed and heading angle were used as those for the onr tumblehome the grid design for the onr flare is shown in fig 18 and the number of grid points is presented in table 7 the shaft brackets are neglected similar to those in section 5 1 it is noteworthy that the same background grids were used with cfd for the onr tumblehome such that the incident irregular waves in each cfd simulation are the same the measured and calculated results of the wave induced forces are compared as shown in fig 19 the cfd result agrees well in terms of the surge force but not the roll moment as in the onr tumblehome case the agreement becomes worse in the sway force and yaw moment though the cfd result shows the same change trend among different hulls this might be because the spatial resolution of the hull using 1 92 m grid points is insufficient to obtain the appropriate pressure distribution on the hull further grid studies and investigations are required for a more concrete conclusion on the onr flare 5 3 influence of above water hull form the efd results for the onr flare and onr tumblehome are compared as already mentioned the major difference between the two ships is the inclination direction of the topside therefore the influence of the topside inclination should be discussed as shown in fig 19 the effect of the above water hull form does not appear in the surge force while it appears in the sway roll and yaw more precisely the amplitudes of the sway force roll and yaw moments of the onr flare are larger than those of the onr tumblehome this efd trend can be captured by cfd calculations based on the comparison results herein it can be concluded that urans cfd methods exhibit certain potential in replacing conventional captive model experiments in the future for the prediction of wave induced surge force sway force and yaw moment further investigations are required to predict wave induced roll moments 6 conclusions a captive model experiment was conducted for the onr tumblehome in irregular stern quartering seas to realise the quantitative prediction of wave induced forces an urans cfd simulation was performed using the same condition as the model experiment the encountered irregular waves were reproduced successfully in the cfd simulation subsequently cfd results of wave induced forces on ships were compared with the efd results it was demonstrated that the cfd results showed good agreement with the efd results in irregular stern quartering seas if a sufficient number of grid points is assigned for the hull on the other hand it was found that the prediction of wave induced roll moment is still challenging even using the unsteady rans cfd similar investigations for more severe waves involving wave breaking and overtopping are expected for the quantitative safety assessment of high speed ships against surf riding broaching in addition further validation studies for variety of ships are also expected to show the suitability of cfd method for the widespread use in the future

22569,ship transverse stability in beam seas has long been a significant concern to naval architects estimating roll motion remains important for practical risk assessments however this problem is not simple due to the nonlinear equations of motion a theoretical method for estimating the roll response and capsizing probability has been proposed but this method has only been correlated by monte carlo simulations therefore in this study model experiments for a subject ship which exhibited a strong nonlinearity exhibited in the gz curve were conducted at national research institute of fisheries engineering the results from this study correlated the proposed theory keywords beam seas non gaussian probability density function capsizing probability 1 introduction ship transverse stability in beam seas has long been a significant concern to naval architects estimating the distribution of the roll motion remains an important theme for practical risk assessment moreover as the practical interest of stability assessment prediction of the extreme event such as large roll motion and capsizing phenomenon is the key particularly the precise estimation of tails of roll distribution is essential although much research has been conducted in this field theoretical assessments of roll behavior in random beam seas remains difficult due to the nonlinear components in the ship roll equation a key characteristic of roll motion is that the restoring moment has zero crossing at the angle of vanishing stability which limits theoretical predictions thus far some methods have been presented to address this e g umeda and yamakoshi 1991 or belenky 1993 1994 for instance belenky 1993 1994 applied the piecewise linear approach whereby the restoring curve is first piecewise linearized and the analytical solution is then obtained in each segment then the capsizing probability was calculated paroka et al 2006 and maeda et al 2012 compared this theory with monte carlo simulation mcs results maki 2013 2017 proposed a method for calculating the probability density function of ship response and the probability of capsizing using a non gaussian probability density function pdf kougioumtzoglou and spanos 2014 and chai and naess 2015 reported results for a vessel rolling in irregular seas using the path integration method and found a good correlation with mcs results recently a comparison of the stochastic averaging dostal et al 2012 and the path integration methods was presented chai et al 2017 in the equation of ship roll motion there exist nonlinearity of restoring and damping components among them the largest component of non gaussianity could be come from the nonlinearity of restoring term as stated maki 2017 proposed a method for calculating the pdf of roll response following kimura and morimoto 1998 as the hydrostatic nonlinearity seems to be the largest nonlinear factor compare to self dependence of the excitation one way to reveal the shape of the tail is to consider a dynamical system with similar nonlinearity in the framework of the previous research under the assumption of white noise excitation the pdf having the same nonlinearity can be obtained as a result of solution of the fokker plank kolmogorov equation the actual distribution may be shifted with the mean estimate and scaled from the variance estimate obtained without white noise assumption see maki 2017 for details these results produced were in good agreement with mcs results from previous work this procedure had been extended to include the estimation of the capsizing probability maki 2017 with use of split time approach belenky 1993 1994 and the capsizing probability for the linear damping coefficient case was strongly correlated with the mcs results considering the safety assessment in actual seaways the wind effect on the ship stability is not negligible this study focuses on the wind effect on the roll distribution and probability of capsizing this research also includes a series of comparisons with a model test as well as experiment of performance of a single degree of freedom roll model in regular beam seas in the model experiments cehipar2792 bulian et al 2010 with almost sinusoidal characteristics in the gz curve were conducted at the national research institute of fisheries engineering nrife furthermore the authors newly proposed the non gaussian pdf in which the nonlinear damping term is explicitly taken into account maki et al 2018a and its results are also compared with the experimental results 2 formulation 2 1 equation of motion the authors first outline the theory used in this study the original method was applicable for irregular waves with a steady wind condition maki 2013 2017 in this

g z 4 ϕ 4 g z 5 ϕ 5 m w i n d v t m w a v e t where the restoring coefficients with apostrophes e g gm indicate the restoring coefficients for the shifted equation of motion due to steady wind conditions the roll moment due to irregular waves is then calculated by using the effective wave slope coefficient γ and wave slope θ t given as 12 m w a v e t w g m i x x γ θ t where wave slope is calculated for a given spectrum using the following equation 13 θ t n ω n 2 g δ s w a v e cos ω n ε n where 14 δ s w a v e 2 s w a v e ω n δ ω w a v e then the equation of motion used in this study is

next procedure in the beginning moment equation is solved to determine the variance of roll angle in this process equivalent linearization technique e g caughey 1963b socha 2005 is utilized on the other hand in the moment equation utilized here the higher order moments have to be calculated for this purpose the probability density function is necessary for white noise excitation case there exist the analytical solution of the fokker planck kolmogorov fpk equation caughey 1963a kimura and morimoto 1998 numerically showed that even in the colored noise case the shape of the pdf is strongly affected by the shape of the potential energy of the system then they approximated the actual pdf for colored noise case by using the scaled pdf for white noise case by using this pdf moment equation can be solved with the newton method at first in order to obtain the variance of roll the following equivalent linearization technique is applied in the framework of the equivalent linearization technique the original dynamical system is replaced by the linearized system the coefficients included in the linearized system are determined under the meaning of the least square method initially the equivalent linearized equation of motion is given as sakata and kimura 1979 sakata and kimura 1980 kimura and morimoto 1998 20 ϕ α e ϕ g e ϕ ϕ e f t where α e equivalent damping coefficient g e equivalent linear stiffness and a e equivalent shift of the restoring force defined as 21 a e g e ϕ e the equivalent forcing function can now be defined as 22 f e t f t a e from this the following equation is obtained 23 ϕ α e ϕ g e ϕ f e t to estimate the unknown coefficients g e and a e the error function is defined as 24 w α e ϕ g e ϕ α ϕ β ϕ ϕ g 1 ϕ g 2 ϕ 2 g 3 ϕ 3 g 4 ϕ 4 g 5 ϕ 5 the minimum condition of e w in terms of the least square fit is finally given as 25 α e α β e ϕ 2 ϕ e ϕ 2 a e e ϕ n 2 5 g n e ϕ n 1 e ϕ 2 n 2 5 g n e ϕ n e ϕ 2 e ϕ 2 g e g 1 n 2 5 g n e ϕ n 1 e ϕ

stationary condition 29 e ϕ 0 and e ϕ ϕ 0 in eq 29 h 12 and h 22 are the components of the impulse response function h given in eq 30 30 h h 11 h 12 h 21 h 22 each component h ij i j 1 2 has following

e 2 4 furthermore r k in eq 28 represents the autocorrelation function concerned with the external force f t concerning with wind generated waves there exists the causal relation between wind and waves during their development stage on the other hand even steady wind generates irregular waves as a result of a nonlinear nature of interaction between air and water thus the phase difference between the gusty wind velocity component and generated irregular wave component cannot be uniquely determined therefore it can be regarded instantaneous wind and wave as uncorrelated each other then using simple analytical integration eq 28 can be given as 33 0 h 12 k r k d k n w a v e a n 2 α e 2 4 ω h 2 ω 2 α e 2 4 ω h 2 ω 2 2 4 ω h 2 ω 2 n w i n d b n 2 α e 2 4 ω h 2 ω 2 α e 2 4 ω h 2 ω 2 2 4

solved by numerical iteration such as the newton method although some moment properties can be evaluated the shape of the distribution remains unknown the gaussian distribution is not applicable for this problem since the restoring components have strong nonlinearity kimura and morimoto 1998 introduced the non gaussian distribution to overcome this which is given as 35 p ϕ ϕ d c exp d 0 ϕ g z ξ d ξ where gz ϕ is defined as 36 g z ϕ n 1 5 g n ϕ n if the external force has a white noise spectrum this result is rigorously equal to the analytical solution of the fokker planck equation caughey 1963a the two unknown parameters c and d in eq 35 can be determined from the following condition 37 ϕ v n ϕ v p p ϕ ϕ d d ϕ 1 ϕ v n ϕ v p ϕ 2 p ϕ ϕ d d ϕ e ϕ 2 where ϕ vp and ϕ vn indicate the two vanishing angles of the restoring moment now we assume that the roll rate is normally distributed given as 38 p ϕ ϕ 1 2 π e ϕ 2 exp ϕ 2 2 e ϕ 2 the joint pdf can then be given as 39 p 1 ϕ ϕ p ϕ ϕ p ϕ ϕ d belenky and weems 2019 pointed out that in beam seas even though the distribution of roll response is non gaussian roll and its rate can be assumed be independent this formulation coincides with their conclusion following maki 2017 the exceedance probability and the capsizing probability can be estimated once the distribution is fully obtained a detailed explanation for this is omitted here see fig 1 3 comparison between theory and experiment in this study an experiment was conducted at nrife to test the proposed theory cehipar2792 bulian et al 2010 was the subject ship and its key properties are listed in table 1 the restoring curve and its fifth order polynomial fit are also plotted in fig 2 the fitting equation for the gz curve is given as 40 g z ϕ 1 308 ϕ 1 734 ϕ 3 0 08601 ϕ 5 free roll experiments were conducted at nrife to obtain the damping coefficients the obtained extinction curve is shown in fig 3 which was fitted with quadratic and linear damping coefficients given as before considering the probabilistic results the comparative results from the one dof motion equation in regular beam sea conditions are presented in regular sea conditions there exist some first order approximation technique to theoretically calculate the amplitude of motion among them the advantageous point of averaging method is its ease of the stability analysis from the averaged equation the stability of each solution can be easily determined by solving jacobian matrix on the other hand numerical technique is also one of the candidates however in numerical technique it is not straightforward to find unstable solutions moreover the results from the first order approximation method shows almost equivalent results with the solution obtained from numerical technique maki et al 2018b therefore in this paper the theoretical results based on the averaging method were obtained as follows in regular wave conditions the equation of motion is given as 42 ϕ α ϕ γ ϕ 3 c 1 ϕ c 3 ϕ 3 c 5 ϕ 5 b c o s ω t where the parameters c 1 c i and b are defined as 43 c 1 w g m i x x c i w g z i i x x i 3 and 5 b π ω 0 2 γ k ζ a in eq 42 the phase term for the external wave moment is omitted for brevity since the theoretical analysis uses an averaging technique here it is difficult to use the absolute function in the roll damping expression therefore the damping term can be replaced by a cubic polynomial expression for the damping curve which is given as 44 δ ϕ 0 05696 ϕ m 0 0004720 ϕ m 3 according to fig 4 the cubic polynomial fit functions well and there is not a large discrepancy between the quadratic and cubic expression to apply the averaging method a small value parameter ε was introduced to eq 42 and the following equation was obtained 45 ϕ p p ω 2 ϕ ε α p γ p 3 c 1 ω 2 ϕ c 3 ϕ 3 c 5 ϕ 5 b c o s ω t the following solution is now assumed 46 ϕ a cos ω t ψ ϕ a ω sin ω t ψ the newly introduced parameters a and ε are slowly varying functions with respect to time t by substituting in the terms from eq 46 and averaging in one roll period differential equations for the averaged system were finally obtained and given as 47 a ε ν a 2 β 3 a 3 8 b s i n ψ 2 ω ψ ε c 1 1 2 ω c 3 3 a 2 8 ω c 5 5 a 4 16 ω ω 2 b c o s ψ 2 a ω if the sole interest now is the stationary solution of eq 47 then the following condition must be considered 48 a 0 ψ 0 this becomes a fifth order polynomial equation with respect to a 2 which enables numerical methods such as bairstow s method to be applied figs 5 7 compare the experimental and theoretical roll response results notably the folding behavior of the response amplitude was clearly observed in the theoretical results and the experimental results these results can be found in francescutto et al 1994 even for wave steepness values of 0 01 that is small wave height the nonlinearity of the response curve was observed due to the soft spring characteristics in the restoring curve the theoretical results qualitatively agree with the experimental results however there are non negligible discrepancies between the experiments and the theoretical results which could be due to two limitations first the limitation of the one dof roll motion equation obviously roll sway and yaw modes are typically coupled but this is ignored here for theoretical purposes second and importantly the experimental method may be another limitation the bow and stern were softly moored by wires to maintain the zero yaw angle in our beam sea experiments conducted at nrife however the wire might affect the roll motion like a spring which may particularly affect the low frequency region further investigations and improving the experimental methods are required and will be the subject of our future work from the above regular wave results using the nominal averaging method the one dof roll motion model was partly validated in regular beam sea conditions therefore the discussion is advanced to the main topic which is the irregular condition case the proposed theory shown in the previous section is now utilized for estimating the response in irregular beam sea conditions initially we compared the roll pdf between experimental results and theoretical calculations fig 8 in this figure the results of the monte carlo simulation are also plotted as mcs throughout this paper all mcss are the results of 50 000 trials of one hour simulation besides the results calculated from the assumption of linear term of gz i e gm and linear damping term are also shown as linear theory therefore the pdf of the linear theory become the gaussian distribution wind was not generated in this case and only the irregular beam wave was considered because of the limitation of the one dof model mcss show a slight discrepancy from mcs results in the roll estimation however a qualitative agreement between the experimental results and mcs results was achieved from a practical view as for the theoretical results the results obtained from the proposed method and the linear method are shown in fig 8 the theoretical results and mcss do not fully agree in particular the pdf takes a larger value for large roll angles in the proposed method and it shows the heavy tail behavior the pdf of roll motion is expected to have a heavy tail belenky et al 2016 2018 however in mcs results remarkable heavy tail characteristics cannot be observed it is because the estimated variance of roll angle is greater than the variance of mcs one of the reasons of this discrepancy is considered to be the underestimation of the roll damping and the assumption of the pdf form next the results in the irregular beam wind and waves condition are shown the steady heel moment acts on the hull in irregular wind conditions as shown in the first line in eq 5 the experimental measurements of heel angle as a function of wind velocity are shown in fig 9 these data were collated from tsutsumi 2014 these experiments were conducted to obtain the probability of capsizing in the presence of irregular beam wind and wave conditions as the subject ship used in this study has a low probability of capsizing in upright conditions in calm water the experiments were conducted with an initial heel angle to increase this probability figs 10 11 compare the roll and roll rate pdf with an initial heel angle of 0 deg whereby mcs and theoretical results are plotted since the calculation shown in fig 8 was obtained for only the wave condition the pdf result exhibits symmetry however fig 10 shows clear asymmetry in the pdf at particularly large roll angles which is a strong contrast to the result from fig 8 this is because wind was not generated in fig 8 which only represents the wave condition there is also a discrepancy in the predicted roll rate in fig 11 in the statistical linearization process the nonlinearity of roll damping term is taken into account as α e in eq 25 this is well known relation however since the statistical linearization is developed for treating weakly nonlinear system some of the estimation error is considered to be come from this equivalent linearization scheme simultaneously there still exists an error derived from the utilized definition of the pdf form figs 12 13 compare the mcss and the theoretical results with an initial heel angle of 7 deg under these conditions the pdf clearly shows the non gaussian behavior at large roll angles in particular its tendency can be easily observed in the vicinity of the vanishing roll angle the roll and roll rate results from the proposed method also show better agreement with the mcs results than figs 10 11 however as can be seen in fig 13 the prediction accuracy of roll rate is not considered to be enough the variance of roll rate of the present theory is larger than that of mcs as stated above one of the reasons for this discrepancy is considered to be the underestimation of roll damping and assumption of the pdf form in such conditions the linear calculation could obviously completely fail to predict the pdf therefore the results from this show a large discrepancy with the mcs results finally the capsizing probability results are given in fig 14 capsizing is clearly an unstationary phenomenon there exist several approaches to obtain the stationary motion distribution e g kimura and morimoto 1998 roberts and vasta 2000 these methods were designed to solve a nonlinear problem however in these frameworks the occurrence of strongly nonlinear responses in general was not excluded but only the possibility of extreme occurrences that eventually lead to capsize was excluded of course the solution process of eq 27 is also for obtaining a stationary solution on the other hand capsizing problem is an escape from the considered potential well as stated above therefore it is not straightforward to obtain the probability of capsizing in this paper the authors estimated the probability of capsizing by using a split time approach shown by belenky 1993 1994 he divided the restoring curve range into the two that is range 0 and 1 range 0 has a stable upright equilibrium point whereas range 1 does unstable saddle type equilibrium point by using the current method the exceedance probability at the border between range 0 and 1 can be easily calculated in this research the boarder angle is set to the maximum restoring angle furthermore there is no resonance since the restoring moment is negative as a result the amplitudes of the heterogeneous solution are negligible belenky v l and sevastianov n b 2007 therefore the homogeneous part of the state equation becomes dominant from this consideration the capsizing condition is obtained as a function of roll rate at up crossing of the border between range 0 and 1 this up crossing roll rate can be estimated from the current calculation method combining these results the probability of capsizing can be estimated the detailed explanation was written in maki 2017 the x axis is the initial heel angle and the y axis is the capsizing probability for a one hour period of exposure at the given wind and wave conditions in this figure the experimentally obtained capsizing probability from tsutsumi 2014 is also plotted initially there is a discrepancy between the experimental and mcs results as stated it could be due to the limitation of the one dof model and the effect of wires at the stern and bow in particular the effect of wires should be checked in our future work however this discrepancy does not appear to be very large from a practical point of view as the initial heeling angle increases although there are clear disagreements between the proposed method and mcs the proposed method still appears to be able to qualitatively predict the capsizing probability further improvements of the proposed method are required to provide quantitative evaluations fill existing gaps and achieve quantitative predictions 4 new calculation method the present theory is based on two basic assumptions 1 roll and roll rate are independent and 2 the roll rate follows a gaussian process however these two assumptions could not be satisfied in a larger nonlinear damping case the present discrepancy between the theoretical and mcs results is then caused by these two assumptions therefore we introduced a non gaussian pdf that considers nonlinear damping maki et al 2018a which is given as 49 p 2 ϕ ϕ d c exp d α h 8 β 9 π 2 h 3 2 where 50 h 1 2 ϕ 2 0 ϕ g z ξ d ξ in eq 50 c and d are the unknown parameter a detailed explanation is given in maki et al 2018a and the results are shown in fig 15 note that the wave condition is the same as in fig 8 the proposed method shows better correlation with mcss fig 15 therefore one of the reasons for large discrepancy between mcs and the theoretical results is the form of the pdf however there still exists non negligible discrepancy between them it mean that there exist another unknown factor which deteriorates the prediction accuracy its application to estimation of capsizing probability is our future task 5 concluding remarks although thus far it has been proposed that the method for predicting the capsizing probability in waves which is based on the work of kimura had only been correlated with mcs therefore here we used experimental results in nrife to test the present method 1 the original methodology was extended by proposing an estimation method for irregular wind and wave conditions 2 to test the one dof roll equation used in this study a beam sea test in regular waves was conducted due to the strong nonlinearity in the restoring curve of the subject ship folding behavior was observed in response amplitude curve of roll the theoretical calculations conducted using the nominal averaging method the results showed the qualitative agreement with the experimental results 3 the theoretical method was correlated with experiments in irregular wind and wave conditions which also confirmed that the non gaussian pdf indicated qualitatively similarity however further improvements in the theory are essential to achieve quantitative estimates which is the goal of our future work 4 for the above purpose the authors proposed the non gaussian distribution in which the nonlinear damping term is explicitly taken into account and its results were correlated with the experimental results its application for the estimation of capsizing probability is highly desired acknowledgment this work was supported by a grant in aid for scientific research from the japan society for promotion of

22569,ship transverse stability in beam seas has long been a significant concern to naval architects estimating roll motion remains important for practical risk assessments however this problem is not simple due to the nonlinear equations of motion a theoretical method for estimating the roll response and capsizing probability has been proposed but this method has only been correlated by monte carlo simulations therefore in this study model experiments for a subject ship which exhibited a strong nonlinearity exhibited in the gz curve were conducted at national research institute of fisheries engineering the results from this study correlated the proposed theory keywords beam seas non gaussian probability density function capsizing probability 1 introduction ship transverse stability in beam seas has long been a significant concern to naval architects estimating the distribution of the roll motion remains an important theme for practical risk assessment moreover as the practical interest of stability assessment prediction of the extreme event such as large roll motion and capsizing phenomenon is the key particularly the precise estimation of tails of roll distribution is essential although much research has been conducted in this field theoretical assessments of roll behavior in random beam seas remains difficult due to the nonlinear components in the ship roll equation a key characteristic of roll motion is that the restoring moment has zero crossing at the angle of vanishing stability which limits theoretical predictions thus far some methods have been presented to address this e g umeda and yamakoshi 1991 or belenky 1993 1994 for instance belenky 1993 1994 applied the piecewise linear approach whereby the restoring curve is first piecewise linearized and the analytical solution is then obtained in each segment then the capsizing probability was calculated paroka et al 2006 and maeda et al 2012 compared this theory with monte carlo simulation mcs results maki 2013 2017 proposed a method for calculating the probability density function of ship response and the probability of capsizing using a non gaussian probability density function pdf kougioumtzoglou and spanos 2014 and chai and naess 2015 reported results for a vessel rolling in irregular seas using the path integration method and found a good correlation with mcs results recently a comparison of the stochastic averaging dostal et al 2012 and the path integration methods was presented chai et al 2017 in the equation of ship roll motion there exist nonlinearity of restoring and damping components among them the largest component of non gaussianity could be come from the nonlinearity of restoring term as stated maki 2017 proposed a method for calculating the pdf of roll response following kimura and morimoto 1998 as the hydrostatic nonlinearity seems to be the largest nonlinear factor compare to self dependence of the excitation one way to reveal the shape of the tail is to consider a dynamical system with similar nonlinearity in the framework of the previous research under the assumption of white noise excitation the pdf having the same nonlinearity can be obtained as a result of solution of the fokker plank kolmogorov equation the actual distribution may be shifted with the mean estimate and scaled from the variance estimate obtained without white noise assumption see maki 2017 for details these results produced were in good agreement with mcs results from previous work this procedure had been extended to include the estimation of the capsizing probability maki 2017 with use of split time approach belenky 1993 1994 and the capsizing probability for the linear damping coefficient case was strongly correlated with the mcs results considering the safety assessment in actual seaways the wind effect on the ship stability is not negligible this study focuses on the wind effect on the roll distribution and probability of capsizing this research also includes a series of comparisons with a model test as well as experiment of performance of a single degree of freedom roll model in regular beam seas in the model experiments cehipar2792 bulian et al 2010 with almost sinusoidal characteristics in the gz curve were conducted at the national research institute of fisheries engineering nrife furthermore the authors newly proposed the non gaussian pdf in which the nonlinear damping term is explicitly taken into account maki et al 2018a and its results are also compared with the experimental results 2 formulation 2 1 equation of motion the authors first outline the theory used in this study the original method was applicable for irregular waves with a steady wind condition maki 2013 2017 in this

g z 4 ϕ 4 g z 5 ϕ 5 m w i n d v t m w a v e t where the restoring coefficients with apostrophes e g gm indicate the restoring coefficients for the shifted equation of motion due to steady wind conditions the roll moment due to irregular waves is then calculated by using the effective wave slope coefficient γ and wave slope θ t given as 12 m w a v e t w g m i x x γ θ t where wave slope is calculated for a given spectrum using the following equation 13 θ t n ω n 2 g δ s w a v e cos ω n ε n where 14 δ s w a v e 2 s w a v e ω n δ ω w a v e then the equation of motion used in this study is

next procedure in the beginning moment equation is solved to determine the variance of roll angle in this process equivalent linearization technique e g caughey 1963b socha 2005 is utilized on the other hand in the moment equation utilized here the higher order moments have to be calculated for this purpose the probability density function is necessary for white noise excitation case there exist the analytical solution of the fokker planck kolmogorov fpk equation caughey 1963a kimura and morimoto 1998 numerically showed that even in the colored noise case the shape of the pdf is strongly affected by the shape of the potential energy of the system then they approximated the actual pdf for colored noise case by using the scaled pdf for white noise case by using this pdf moment equation can be solved with the newton method at first in order to obtain the variance of roll the following equivalent linearization technique is applied in the framework of the equivalent linearization technique the original dynamical system is replaced by the linearized system the coefficients included in the linearized system are determined under the meaning of the least square method initially the equivalent linearized equation of motion is given as sakata and kimura 1979 sakata and kimura 1980 kimura and morimoto 1998 20 ϕ α e ϕ g e ϕ ϕ e f t where α e equivalent damping coefficient g e equivalent linear stiffness and a e equivalent shift of the restoring force defined as 21 a e g e ϕ e the equivalent forcing function can now be defined as 22 f e t f t a e from this the following equation is obtained 23 ϕ α e ϕ g e ϕ f e t to estimate the unknown coefficients g e and a e the error function is defined as 24 w α e ϕ g e ϕ α ϕ β ϕ ϕ g 1 ϕ g 2 ϕ 2 g 3 ϕ 3 g 4 ϕ 4 g 5 ϕ 5 the minimum condition of e w in terms of the least square fit is finally given as 25 α e α β e ϕ 2 ϕ e ϕ 2 a e e ϕ n 2 5 g n e ϕ n 1 e ϕ 2 n 2 5 g n e ϕ n e ϕ 2 e ϕ 2 g e g 1 n 2 5 g n e ϕ n 1 e ϕ

solving following a differential equation concerning with the expectations sakata and kimura 1979 which is given as 26 e ϕ e ϕ e ϕ α e e ϕ g e e ϕ e f e e ϕ 2 2 e ϕ ϕ e ϕ ϕ e ϕ 2 α e e ϕ g e e ϕ 2 e ϕ

stationary condition 29 e ϕ 0 and e ϕ ϕ 0 in eq 29 h 12 and h 22 are the components of the impulse response function h given in eq 30 30 h h 11 h 12 h 21 h 22 each component h ij i j 1 2 has following

e 2 4 furthermore r k in eq 28 represents the autocorrelation function concerned with the external force f t concerning with wind generated waves there exists the causal relation between wind and waves during their development stage on the other hand even steady wind generates irregular waves as a result of a nonlinear nature of interaction between air and water thus the phase difference between the gusty wind velocity component and generated irregular wave component cannot be uniquely determined therefore it can be regarded instantaneous wind and wave as uncorrelated each other then using simple analytical integration eq 28 can be given as 33 0 h 12 k r k d k n w a v e a n 2 α e 2 4 ω h 2 ω 2 α e 2 4 ω h 2 ω 2 2 4 ω h 2 ω 2 n w i n d b n 2 α e 2 4 ω h 2 ω 2 α e 2 4 ω h 2 ω 2 2 4

solved by numerical iteration such as the newton method although some moment properties can be evaluated the shape of the distribution remains unknown the gaussian distribution is not applicable for this problem since the restoring components have strong nonlinearity kimura and morimoto 1998 introduced the non gaussian distribution to overcome this which is given as 35 p ϕ ϕ d c exp d 0 ϕ g z ξ d ξ where gz ϕ is defined as 36 g z ϕ n 1 5 g n ϕ n if the external force has a white noise spectrum this result is rigorously equal to the analytical solution of the fokker planck equation caughey 1963a the two unknown parameters c and d in eq 35 can be determined from the following condition 37 ϕ v n ϕ v p p ϕ ϕ d d ϕ 1 ϕ v n ϕ v p ϕ 2 p ϕ ϕ d d ϕ e ϕ 2 where ϕ vp and ϕ vn indicate the two vanishing angles of the restoring moment now we assume that the roll rate is normally distributed given as 38 p ϕ ϕ 1 2 π e ϕ 2 exp ϕ 2 2 e ϕ 2 the joint pdf can then be given as 39 p 1 ϕ ϕ p ϕ ϕ p ϕ ϕ d belenky and weems 2019 pointed out that in beam seas even though the distribution of roll response is non gaussian roll and its rate can be assumed be independent this formulation coincides with their conclusion following maki 2017 the exceedance probability and the capsizing probability can be estimated once the distribution is fully obtained a detailed explanation for this is omitted here see fig 1 3 comparison between theory and experiment in this study an experiment was conducted at nrife to test the proposed theory cehipar2792 bulian et al 2010 was the subject ship and its key properties are listed in table 1 the restoring curve and its fifth order polynomial fit are also plotted in fig 2 the fitting equation for the gz curve is given as 40 g z ϕ 1 308 ϕ 1 734 ϕ 3 0 08601 ϕ 5 free roll experiments were conducted at nrife to obtain the damping coefficients the obtained extinction curve is shown in fig 3 which was fitted with quadratic and linear damping coefficients given as before considering the probabilistic results the comparative results from the one dof motion equation in regular beam sea conditions are presented in regular sea conditions there exist some first order approximation technique to theoretically calculate the amplitude of motion among them the advantageous point of averaging method is its ease of the stability analysis from the averaged equation the stability of each solution can be easily determined by solving jacobian matrix on the other hand numerical technique is also one of the candidates however in numerical technique it is not straightforward to find unstable solutions moreover the results from the first order approximation method shows almost equivalent results with the solution obtained from numerical technique maki et al 2018b therefore in this paper the theoretical results based on the averaging method were obtained as follows in regular wave conditions the equation of motion is given as 42 ϕ α ϕ γ ϕ 3 c 1 ϕ c 3 ϕ 3 c 5 ϕ 5 b c o s ω t where the parameters c 1 c i and b are defined as 43 c 1 w g m i x x c i w g z i i x x i 3 and 5 b π ω 0 2 γ k ζ a in eq 42 the phase term for the external wave moment is omitted for brevity since the theoretical analysis uses an averaging technique here it is difficult to use the absolute function in the roll damping expression therefore the damping term can be replaced by a cubic polynomial expression for the damping curve which is given as 44 δ ϕ 0 05696 ϕ m 0 0004720 ϕ m 3 according to fig 4 the cubic polynomial fit functions well and there is not a large discrepancy between the quadratic and cubic expression to apply the averaging method a small value parameter ε was introduced to eq 42 and the following equation was obtained 45 ϕ p p ω 2 ϕ ε α p γ p 3 c 1 ω 2 ϕ c 3 ϕ 3 c 5 ϕ 5 b c o s ω t the following solution is now assumed 46 ϕ a cos ω t ψ ϕ a ω sin ω t ψ the newly introduced parameters a and ε are slowly varying functions with respect to time t by substituting in the terms from eq 46 and averaging in one roll period differential equations for the averaged system were finally obtained and given as 47 a ε ν a 2 β 3 a 3 8 b s i n ψ 2 ω ψ ε c 1 1 2 ω c 3 3 a 2 8 ω c 5 5 a 4 16 ω ω 2 b c o s ψ 2 a ω if the sole interest now is the stationary solution of eq 47 then the following condition must be considered 48 a 0 ψ 0 this becomes a fifth order polynomial equation with respect to a 2 which enables numerical methods such as bairstow s method to be applied figs 5 7 compare the experimental and theoretical roll response results notably the folding behavior of the response amplitude was clearly observed in the theoretical results and the experimental results these results can be found in francescutto et al 1994 even for wave steepness values of 0 01 that is small wave height the nonlinearity of the response curve was observed due to the soft spring characteristics in the restoring curve the theoretical results qualitatively agree with the experimental results however there are non negligible discrepancies between the experiments and the theoretical results which could be due to two limitations first the limitation of the one dof roll motion equation obviously roll sway and yaw modes are typically coupled but this is ignored here for theoretical purposes second and importantly the experimental method may be another limitation the bow and stern were softly moored by wires to maintain the zero yaw angle in our beam sea experiments conducted at nrife however the wire might affect the roll motion like a spring which may particularly affect the low frequency region further investigations and improving the experimental methods are required and will be the subject of our future work from the above regular wave results using the nominal averaging method the one dof roll motion model was partly validated in regular beam sea conditions therefore the discussion is advanced to the main topic which is the irregular condition case the proposed theory shown in the previous section is now utilized for estimating the response in irregular beam sea conditions initially we compared the roll pdf between experimental results and theoretical calculations fig 8 in this figure the results of the monte carlo simulation are also plotted as mcs throughout this paper all mcss are the results of 50 000 trials of one hour simulation besides the results calculated from the assumption of linear term of gz i e gm and linear damping term are also shown as linear theory therefore the pdf of the linear theory become the gaussian distribution wind was not generated in this case and only the irregular beam wave was considered because of the limitation of the one dof model mcss show a slight discrepancy from mcs results in the roll estimation however a qualitative agreement between the experimental results and mcs results was achieved from a practical view as for the theoretical results the results obtained from the proposed method and the linear method are shown in fig 8 the theoretical results and mcss do not fully agree in particular the pdf takes a larger value for large roll angles in the proposed method and it shows the heavy tail behavior the pdf of roll motion is expected to have a heavy tail belenky et al 2016 2018 however in mcs results remarkable heavy tail characteristics cannot be observed it is because the estimated variance of roll angle is greater than the variance of mcs one of the reasons of this discrepancy is considered to be the underestimation of the roll damping and the assumption of the pdf form next the results in the irregular beam wind and waves condition are shown the steady heel moment acts on the hull in irregular wind conditions as shown in the first line in eq 5 the experimental measurements of heel angle as a function of wind velocity are shown in fig 9 these data were collated from tsutsumi 2014 these experiments were conducted to obtain the probability of capsizing in the presence of irregular beam wind and wave conditions as the subject ship used in this study has a low probability of capsizing in upright conditions in calm water the experiments were conducted with an initial heel angle to increase this probability figs 10 11 compare the roll and roll rate pdf with an initial heel angle of 0 deg whereby mcs and theoretical results are plotted since the calculation shown in fig 8 was obtained for only the wave condition the pdf result exhibits symmetry however fig 10 shows clear asymmetry in the pdf at particularly large roll angles which is a strong contrast to the result from fig 8 this is because wind was not generated in fig 8 which only represents the wave condition there is also a discrepancy in the predicted roll rate in fig 11 in the statistical linearization process the nonlinearity of roll damping term is taken into account as α e in eq 25 this is well known relation however since the statistical linearization is developed for treating weakly nonlinear system some of the estimation error is considered to be come from this equivalent linearization scheme simultaneously there still exists an error derived from the utilized definition of the pdf form figs 12 13 compare the mcss and the theoretical results with an initial heel angle of 7 deg under these conditions the pdf clearly shows the non gaussian behavior at large roll angles in particular its tendency can be easily observed in the vicinity of the vanishing roll angle the roll and roll rate results from the proposed method also show better agreement with the mcs results than figs 10 11 however as can be seen in fig 13 the prediction accuracy of roll rate is not considered to be enough the variance of roll rate of the present theory is larger than that of mcs as stated above one of the reasons for this discrepancy is considered to be the underestimation of roll damping and assumption of the pdf form in such conditions the linear calculation could obviously completely fail to predict the pdf therefore the results from this show a large discrepancy with the mcs results finally the capsizing probability results are given in fig 14 capsizing is clearly an unstationary phenomenon there exist several approaches to obtain the stationary motion distribution e g kimura and morimoto 1998 roberts and vasta 2000 these methods were designed to solve a nonlinear problem however in these frameworks the occurrence of strongly nonlinear responses in general was not excluded but only the possibility of extreme occurrences that eventually lead to capsize was excluded of course the solution process of eq 27 is also for obtaining a stationary solution on the other hand capsizing problem is an escape from the considered potential well as stated above therefore it is not straightforward to obtain the probability of capsizing in this paper the authors estimated the probability of capsizing by using a split time approach shown by belenky 1993 1994 he divided the restoring curve range into the two that is range 0 and 1 range 0 has a stable upright equilibrium point whereas range 1 does unstable saddle type equilibrium point by using the current method the exceedance probability at the border between range 0 and 1 can be easily calculated in this research the boarder angle is set to the maximum restoring angle furthermore there is no resonance since the restoring moment is negative as a result the amplitudes of the heterogeneous solution are negligible belenky v l and sevastianov n b 2007 therefore the homogeneous part of the state equation becomes dominant from this consideration the capsizing condition is obtained as a function of roll rate at up crossing of the border between range 0 and 1 this up crossing roll rate can be estimated from the current calculation method combining these results the probability of capsizing can be estimated the detailed explanation was written in maki 2017 the x axis is the initial heel angle and the y axis is the capsizing probability for a one hour period of exposure at the given wind and wave conditions in this figure the experimentally obtained capsizing probability from tsutsumi 2014 is also plotted initially there is a discrepancy between the experimental and mcs results as stated it could be due to the limitation of the one dof model and the effect of wires at the stern and bow in particular the effect of wires should be checked in our future work however this discrepancy does not appear to be very large from a practical point of view as the initial heeling angle increases although there are clear disagreements between the proposed method and mcs the proposed method still appears to be able to qualitatively predict the capsizing probability further improvements of the proposed method are required to provide quantitative evaluations fill existing gaps and achieve quantitative predictions 4 new calculation method the present theory is based on two basic assumptions 1 roll and roll rate are independent and 2 the roll rate follows a gaussian process however these two assumptions could not be satisfied in a larger nonlinear damping case the present discrepancy between the theoretical and mcs results is then caused by these two assumptions therefore we introduced a non gaussian pdf that considers nonlinear damping maki et al 2018a which is given as 49 p 2 ϕ ϕ d c exp d α h 8 β 9 π 2 h 3 2 where 50 h 1 2 ϕ 2 0 ϕ g z ξ d ξ in eq 50 c and d are the unknown parameter a detailed explanation is given in maki et al 2018a and the results are shown in fig 15 note that the wave condition is the same as in fig 8 the proposed method shows better correlation with mcss fig 15 therefore one of the reasons for large discrepancy between mcs and the theoretical results is the form of the pdf however there still exists non negligible discrepancy between them it mean that there exist another unknown factor which deteriorates the prediction accuracy its application to estimation of capsizing probability is our future task 5 concluding remarks although thus far it has been proposed that the method for predicting the capsizing probability in waves which is based on the work of kimura had only been correlated with mcs therefore here we used experimental results in nrife to test the present method 1 the original methodology was extended by proposing an estimation method for irregular wind and wave conditions 2 to test the one dof roll equation used in this study a beam sea test in regular waves was conducted due to the strong nonlinearity in the restoring curve of the subject ship folding behavior was observed in response amplitude curve of roll the theoretical calculations conducted using the nominal averaging method the results showed the qualitative agreement with the experimental results 3 the theoretical method was correlated with experiments in irregular wind and wave conditions which also confirmed that the non gaussian pdf indicated qualitatively similarity however further improvements in the theory are essential to achieve quantitative estimates which is the goal of our future work 4 for the above purpose the authors proposed the non gaussian distribution in which the nonlinear damping term is explicitly taken into account and its results were correlated with the experimental results its application for the estimation of capsizing probability is highly desired acknowledgment this work was supported by a grant in aid for scientific research from the japan society for promotion of
