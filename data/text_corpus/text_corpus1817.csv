9085,unreasonable irrigation water saving and salinity control practices iws scps have resulted in a shallow groundwater table severe soil salinization and low water use efficiency in the upper yellow river basin yrb northwest china in our study a framework was developed by coupling the agro hydrological model i e ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator with a decision making method i e vikor vlsekriterijuska optimizacija i komoromisno resenje and then a comprehensive evaluation index was calculated to assess the iws scps for maize and sunflower in the upper yrb the ahc model was calibrated and validated with two years of field measured data and then it was used to perform the simulations of agro hydrological processes corresponding to the designed scenarios considering the irrigation depth and groundwater table depth gwd under the conditions of different hydrological years and degrees of soil salinization the simulated crop yield soil salinity variation and crop water productivity were used as the evaluation indicators to search for appropriate iws scps of the target crops the results showed that the recommended iws scps for maize were those with gwds between 2 1 2 3 m and irrigation depths approximately 10 lower for non saline soils in wet years and 10 higher than the present irrigation for slightly and moderately saline soils in normal and dry years whereas the iws scps with gwd between 1 5 2 2 m and an irrigation depth of approximately 10 30 lower than the present situation could be recommended for sunflower in wet years and normal years regardless of saline soils and in dry years of non saline soils the developed framework and the obtained results are expected to provide a decision tool and implications for improving irrigation efficiency and salinity control in the arid upper yrb as well as other areas with similar climate conditions and shallow groundwater keywords irrigation water saving salinity control agro hydrological model decision making method upper yellow river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation is an important factor to ensure agricultural production in semi arid and arid regions kang et al 2017 minhas et al 2020 in these regions large amounts of irrigation water are usually applied for crop production to ensure food supply however inefficient irrigation practices and poor drainage systems result in lower water use efficiency and shallow gwd further resulting in secondary soil salinity due to strong evaporation in arid climatic conditions qadir et al 2009 reported that in recent decades the irrigation efficiency decreased to approximately 40 and the salt accumulation in root zone soils reached 0 6 t ha 1 yr 1 to 10 t ha 1 yr 1 due to mismanagement of irrigation water in the aral sea basin of central asia which has a typically arid climate additionally approximately 30 of the irrigated land was affected by waterlogging induced by shallow gwds in this area reid and brooks 2000 also reported that increasing salinity caused by inappropriate irrigation has resulted in a reduction in agricultural yields and reduced biodiversity in the murray darling basin of australia under arid semi arid conditions it is obvious that unreasonable irrigation water saving and salinity control practices iws scps seriously restrict the sustainable development of agriculture therefore it is necessary to improve the iws scps with the consideration of maximizing the water use efficiency alleviating local water conflicts and maintaining food production in recent decades many methods have been proposed to determine iws scps which can be broadly grouped into two categories the first is direct or indirect measurement methods based on crop water status i e leaf stomatal conductance sap flow and stem diameter variation and soil environmental factors related to crop growth e g soil water content salinity and nutrient status all these parameters can reflect crop responses to the stresses of water salt nutrients and other environmental factors fernandez and cuevas 2010 with the advances of technologies the use of automatic instruments allows us to measure the parameters of crop water and the related environmental factors in more efficient ways facilitating the development of the iws scps more recently thermal image data of crop canopies have been widely used to diagnose the water stress of crops maes and steppe 2012 thermal data can be acquired using visible near infrared nir short wave infrared swir and sensors on uavs and satellite platforms gowda et al 2007 khanal et al 2017 based on direct and indirect measurements of crop water parameters and related environmental factors iws scps can be determined accordingly calera et al 2017 however direct and indirect measurement based methods are usually time consuming and costly the second method is based on agro hydrological modeling with mathematical models in general agro hydrological models can be classified as conceptual water balance models such as isareg pereira et al 2003 aquacrop steduto et al 2009 and simdualkc rosa et al 2012 and physically mechanistic models such as hydrus simunek et al 2012 saltmed ragab 2002 swap kroes and van dam 2003 rzqwm hanson et al 1998 and ahc xu et al 2018 both categories have been used to search for iws scps since the 1980 s pereira et al 2020 for example the isareg model was used to improve the irrigation scheduling for cotton in central asia pereira et al 2009 for silage maize and grass pasture in spain cancela et al 2006 and for maize and wheat in the huinong irrigation district of the upper yellow river basin yrb of china pereira et al 2007 the rzwqm2 model was used to simulate irrigation scheduling and improve water productivity for seed cotton in northwest china chen et al 2019 the aquacrop model was also used in varying field scale irrigation managements in maize farmland abedinpour et al 2012 and sunflower farmland todorovic et al 2009 under different climate conditions the simdualkc model was used to assess the performance of different irrigation schedules on maize water productivity paredes et al 2014 using physically mechanistic models as a decision tool for the iws scps can be found in many previous studies for example swap was used to optimize irrigation scheduling for wheatcorn cropping systems ma et al 2011 and maize pan et al 2020 in china and winter wheat in iran azad et al 2018 under different conditions to achieve sustainable agriculture in water shortage areas karandish and simunek 2019 used hydrus 2d 3d and saltmed to assess the influence of various water saving irrigation strategies on maize water footprints the recently developed ahc model is a numerical model of the physical and chemical fates of water heat solute transport in agro eco hydrological processes xu et al 2018 and has been used in some areas for example liu et al 2020a used ahc to assess the response of crop water productivity to climate change and water saving scenarios in the oasis of the middle heihe river basin additionally ahc was also used to evaluate the agro hydrological processes and water utilization in canal and well irrigated areas in the upper yrb wang et al 2022 all these related studies demonstrated that the ahc model is a promising tool for iws scps with robust computational stability and astringency in the simulation of agro hydrological processes based on the agro hydrological modeling results the appropriate iws scps can be obtained with the help of multi criteria decision making mcdm under different soil climate crop cultivation fertilization irrigation and drainage conditions in general mcdm methods can be classified into two categories i e discrete mcdm or discrete madm multi attribute decision making and continuous modm multi objective decision making methods kumar et al 2017 the madm methods include topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution hwang and yoon 1981 ahp analytic hierarchy process saaty 1990 and vikor vlsekriterijuska optimizacija i komoromisno resenje opricovic 1998 however those methods e g gp goal programming lp linear programming dea data envelopment analysis etc belong to the modm methods ha and do 2016 mcdm methods have been used for decision making in energy and environmental sustainability soltani et al 2015 supply chain management rajesh and ravi 2015 and water resource management golfam et al 2019 with the mcdm methods the problems with various conflicting interests can be addressed facilitating decision making among the mcdm methods the vikor method showed its advantage of objectively determining the weights saad and ahmad 2016 using the critic criteria importance through intercriteria correlation method diakoulaki et al 1995 the upper yrb is an important food production base in china the main crops grown in the upper yrb are wheat maize and sunflower among them the growing area of maize and sunflower showed an increasing trend in the past two decades accounting for approximately 41 0 and 15 6 of the total cropping area in recent years han 2021 water scarcity in this region is increasing due to climate change and the growing demand for water in recent decades excessive irrigation water diverted from the yellow river has resulted in a shallow groundwater table and serious soil salinization in the farmland systems thus appropriate iws scps are urgently required for the sustainably agricultural production the impacts of application of water saving practices e g improving the canal system optimizing irrigation strategies and adjusting cropping patterns on et gwd salinity yield have been investigated for the sustainable agricultural development xu et al 2010 found that canal and farm level irrigation water saving practices might lower the gwd by 0 28 0 48 m and higher declines of gwd occurred when both canal and farm systems were applied water saving practices furthermore 60 of the area implementing canal lining and upgrading hydraulic structures would reduce groundwater evaporation by 43 mm and 20 of present diverted water from the yellow river xu et al 2011 previous researches also revealed that non beneficial evaporation and salt accumulation affecting crop yields were significant due to shallow gwds ren et al 2016 and with optimum gwd ranging from 1 7 2 3 m could save 15 30 of water diversion from the yellow river ren et al 2018 later study found that the 100 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 50 cm are recommended for dry years and the 80 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 100 cm are recommended for wet years without apparently yield reduction xiong et al 2021a besides shallower gwd slightly higher yield larger actual evapotranspiration and more serious salt accumulation were identified in canal irrigated areas than in well irrigated areas wang et al 2022 however in previous studies appropriate iws scps for various salinization farmlands in different hydrological years were not well addressed nevertheless to our knowledge the multi criteria decision making mcdm method based on agro hydrological model simulation results is barely used to determine the iws scps thus the objectives of this study are 1 to propose a framework for determining the iws scps by coupling the ahc model with the vikor method and 2 to demonstrate its applicability in searching for the appropriate iws scps for maize and sunflower farmlands in the upper yrb 2 methodology 2 1 framework development the framework for the assessment of iws scps was developed by combining the ahc model with an mcdm method i e the vikor method a detailed description of the framework can be found in fig 1 based on the framework the iws scps for the target crop can be assessed as follows 1 calibration and validation of the ahc model with the collected spatial and temporal data including soil crop groundwater and irrigation date 2 scenario design considering the irrigation depth and groundwater table depth gwd under the conditions of different degrees of soil salinization in different hydrological years 3 performing the simulations corresponding to different scenarios then the simulated results of soil water salt dynamics and crop growth indices i e soil salinity variation crop yield and water productivity were used as the evaluation indicators in the vikor method 4 the benefit ratio value corresponding to each scenario was calculated in which the suitable iws scp was determined as the iws scp with the smallest benefit ratio value the ahc model and vikor method are presented as follows 2 2 ahc model the ahc model is a one dimensional agro hydrological model that includes physically based modules for simulating soil water flow solute and heat transport and crop growth xu et al 2018 2 2 1 soil water

transpiration tp based upon the leaf area index lai actual evaporation and transpiration rates are then respectively obtained as a function of the available soil water in the root zone the crop yield is calculated using the harvest index concept based on biomass and the biomass is computed from the solar radiation intercepted by the crop leaf area the plant radiation use efficiency and the water stress and temperature stress during salinity simulation lai is estimated as a function of heat unit water salt or nitrogen stress factor and development stages in the ahc the water and salt stress factors are calculated with the s shaped functions suggested by van genuchten 1987 and a salinity threshold value was adopted from dirksen and augustijn 1988 a more detailed description of the ahc model can be found in xu et al 2018 soil water flow and solute transport were simulated with a soil profile of 300 cm depth the soil profile was discretized into 300 compartments with a thickness of 1 cm for water flow the upper boundary was set as an atmospheric boundary condition specifying daily precipitation and irrigation fluxes and evaporation and transpiration rates the daily groundwater table depth was set as the bottom boundary condition in our simulation the total simulated depth is 300 cm and gwd was determined according to the corresponding designed treatments for solute transport the upper and bottom boundary conditions were specified by a concentration flux i e the observed total dissolved solid concentration of irrigation water precipitation water and groundwater the initial conditions of the soil water and salinity concentrations were set based on field observations the simulation period was from early may to mid september covering the maize and sunflower growing seasons pre and post processing of datasets could be performed by its friendly graphical user interface gui the ahc model can be calibrated and validated by comparing the simulated values and the observed data including soil moisture content salt concentration and crop growth indices crop height leaf area index and yield with a trial and error method after sensitivity analysis the model performance was evaluated in terms of the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse determination coefficient r2 and nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse mre and rmse values close to zero indicated good model performance the r2 values close to 1 0 indicated that the variation in the observed values was well captured by the model the nse values vary from to 1 with nse 1 0 representing a perfect fit and negative nse values indicating that the mean observed value was a better predictor than the simulated value which indicates unacceptable performance r2 larger than 0 5 and nse larger than 0 are generally considered acceptable moriasi et al 2007 2 3 vikor method with the vikor method the iws scp for the target crop was evaluated according to the benefit ratio value q i of each option 6 q i v s i s s s 1 v r i r r r where q i is the benefit ratio value of the i th option and the values of q corresponding to all options are arranged in descending order to make a decision in which a lower value of q means a better solution v is the decision coefficient v 0 1 and when v 0 5 or v 0 5 the decision is based on maximizing the group utility or minimizing the individual regret when v 0 5 it is a compromise decision which balances the group utility and the individual regret s i and r i represent the group utility value and individual regret value respectively s min s i s max

is the standard deviation which quantifies the contrast intensity of the j th indicator in this study soil salinity variation δs sini crop yield and crop water productivity wpet were selected as three critical indicators crop yield is the main concern of farmers and δs sini reflects the variation of salt accumulation in root zone soils during the simulation period whereas wpet is the crop production per unit water consumption δs sini and wpet can be expressed as 10 δ s s ini s f i n s i n i s i n i 11 wp et y e t a where s ini and s fin are the simulated salt storage in 0 100 cm soil

and sunflower were collected from yca yangchang canal command area n40 48 40 e107 05 15 and altitude 1039 m in the hetao irrigation district hid of the upper yrb in 2012 and 2013 ren et al 2016 daily meteorological data including precipitation air temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed 10 m above the ground were collected from the nearby linhe national meteorology station id 53513 www data cma cn the irrigation scheduling of maize and sunflower in the study area is shown in table 1 the soil physical properties in maize and sunflower are shown in table s1 the daily groundwater table depth gwd in the maize and sunflower fields is shown in fig s1 the salt concentrations of irrigation water and groundwater changed very little and averaged 0 5 g l 1 and 1 9 g l 1 respectively field observations related to soil and crop growth were conducted from april to september in both years and were replicated three times the leaf area index lai was directly measured every 15 days by accupar lp80 decagon devices usa crop height ch was observed every 10 days by ruler crop yields were measured with 10 harvested samples for each observation field ren et al 2016 detailed field observations and data acquisitions can be found in ren et al 2016 2017 2 4 2 scenario design for different hydrological years the details of the treatments corresponding to the designed scenarios are summarized and listed in table 2 groundwater table depth and irrigation depth were the major concerns for scenario design in the following analysis two types of groundwater table depths i e the free groundwater table depth fgwd and the controlled groundwater table depth cgwd were included in the scenario design four fgwds i e fgwd 0 m corresponding to the present groundwater table depth of the calibration period fgwd 0 3 m fgwd 0 6 m and fgwd 0 9 m i e 0 3 m 0 6 m and 0 9 m deeper than the present groundwater table depth of the calibration period respectively were considered controlled groundwater table depth practices simulated the conditions that the groundwater table depth during the simulation period was controlled at a certain fixed depth that adapts to the tile drainage system promoted in the hid five cgwds i e 0 9 m corresponding to the shallowest gwd suitable for crop growth 1 2 m 1 5 m 1 8 m and 2 1 m corresponding to the deepest gwd for crop growth were set for maize the irrigation depth in the calibration period was taken as the benchmark 1 0 ir for determining the irrigation scenarios for sunflower due to the slightly excessive irrigation depth of sunflower the benchmark irrigation depth was adjusted to 203 mm on may 10th and 103 mm on june 25th with reference to previous research results in this area miao et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 for each crop seven irrigation depths i e 0 7 ir corresponding to moderately deficit irrigation 0 8 ir 0 9 ir 1 0 ir 1 1 ir 1 2 ir and 1 3 ir corresponding to irrigation with a large leaching fraction were considered in the scenario design based on real farmland situations three different salinization degree scenarios i e non saline slightly saline and moderately saline farmland soils were set up according to the specific standards wang et al 1993 commonly adopted in the hid the detailed soluble salts in the 0 100 cm soils collected from hao 2015 and referred to xiong et al 2021b table 3 three hydrological years i e wet year wy normal year ny and dry year dy corresponding to precipitation frequencies of 25 50 and 75 respectively were determined with annual precipitation data from linhe national meteorological station of 63 years from 1957 to 2019 the precipitation frequency was analyzed by using the pearson type iii distribution curve bobée and ashkar 1991 smith 2020 then the years 1994 1981 and 1999 were selected as the typical years of wy ny and dy respectively table 4 each treatment considered different soil salinization level irrigation depth gwd in different hydrological years and they were all combined to compose the scenarios with the designed scenarios based on the irrigation depth and groundwater table depth the benefit ratio q i e the comprehensive index proposed by this framework of each scenario corresponding to non slightly and moderately saline soils in wet normal and dry years was calculated the iws scp with the smallest value of q was selected as the appropriate iws scp for the corresponding soil salinization degree and hydrological year of the target crop 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the indicators of goodness of fit for the calibration and validation of soil water and salt dynamics were satisfactory the simulation results of soil water content and soil salt concentration during the calibration period were all acceptable fig s2 for soil water content the mre rmse r2 and nse values were 1 35 0 026 cm3 cm 3 0 72 and 0 71 for maize and 0 24 0 025 cm3 cm 3 0 84 and 0 79 for sunflower respectively for the soil salt concentration the mre rmse r2 and nse values were 11 12 1 34 g l 1 0 72 and 0 69 for maize and 9 55 0 82 g l 1 0 74 and 0 71 for sunflower respectively the simulation of leaf area index lai and crop height ch also achieved relatively ideal results fig s4 for lai the mre rmse and nse values were 5 50 0 84 m2 m 2 and 0 53 for maize and 2 92 0 52 m2 m 2 and 0 89 for sunflower respectively for ch the mre rmse r2 and nse values were 18 03 18 82 cm 0 98 and 0 95 for maize and 4 5 21 03 cm 0 94 and 0 90 for sunflower respectively a comparison of the simulated and measured data of soil water content and soil salt concentration for maize and sunflower during the validation period is presented in fig s3 for the soil water content the fit goodness indicators were acceptable with the mre rmse r2 and nse values in the range of 1 63 2 21 0 036 0 037 cm3 cm 3 0 64 0 69 and 0 50 0 64 respectively the simulated soil salt concentration was in good agreement with the measured data and the mre rmse r2 and nse values were in the range of 2 55 3 97 0 64 0 91 g l 1 0 52 0 70 and 0 50 0 69 respectively the fitness between the simulated and observed crop growth data was also acceptable both for lai mre 1 89 10 78 rmse 0 68 1 13 nse 0 58 0 85 and ch mre 13 69 14 78 rmse 14 75 18 64 cm r2 0 93 0 99 nse 0 92 0 97 fig s4 the values of the fitness indicators related to model calibration and validation are listed in table s2 the calibrated parameters of soil hydraulic characteristics solute transport and crop growth in the study area are shown in tables s3 s5 the indicator values of calibration and validation were at an acceptable level referring to previous studies that used the same model xu et al 2018 and wang et al 2022 and the same indicators liu et al 2020a ren et al 2016 xue et al 2018 the calibrated ahc model captured the soil water salt dynamics and crop growth processes well which indicated that ahc could be adopted as a reliable and useful tool for analyzing the agro hydrological processes in this area 3 2 response of eta and bfnet eta to different irs and gwds the simulated values of actual evapotranspiration eta corresponding to normal years are presented in fig 2a maize and fig 2b sunflower the ratio of the net upward bottom flux of the root zone bfnet to evapotranspiration i e bfnet eta was used as the indicator to evaluate the contribution of groundwater to crop growth fig 3 eta increased but bfnet eta decreased as irrigation depth increased for example in the case of 0 3 m deeper than the present gwd in moderately saline soils of normal years the eta of maize and sunflower increased by 16 25 and 9 40 respectively while the bfnet eta of maize and sunflower decreased by 24 33 and 30 21 respectively as the irrigation depth increased from 0 7 ir to 1 3 ir the reason for this result is that a large irrigation depth could increase the soil water content and promote crop water consumption thus increasing eta from the farmland system increasing the irrigation depth could also result in higher water percolation thereby decreasing bfnet similar results were also reported in previous studies by liu et al 2017 and klocke et al 2013 who found that the eta of maize and sunflower increased with increasing irrigation depth gao et al 2017a also reported that as the irrigation depth increased from 294 mm to 410 mm the eta of maize increased from 412 mm to 469 mm but the net upward flux decreased from 62 mm to 3 mm in the hid with the simulation results by using the coupled model of hydrus 1d and dualkc approach ren et al 2016 reported that diverse irrigation schedules and shallow gwds resulted in large capillary rise according for 23 53 of total evapotranspiration for different crop fields in the hid these results indicate that a higher irrigation depth caused a smaller groundwater contribution to eta in contrast crops with small irrigation situations may use groundwater more effectively for their growth eta and bfnet eta decreased as the groundwater table depth increased for example in the slightly saline soils with an irrigation of 0 8 ir in normal years the eta of maize and sunflower decreased by 10 74 and 17 41 respectively and the bfnet eta decreased by 16 59 and 23 66 for these two crops as the free groundwater table depth increased from the present situation fgwd 0 m to a 0 9 m deeper situation fgwd 0 9 m respectively this finding was mainly because the shallower groundwater depth resulted in a higher soil water content and more wet soil surface through capillary rising subsequently causing rapid soil evaporation and finally leading to a higher groundwater contribution in the case of a larger gwd capillary rising carried less water from the deep layer to the topsoil layer which resulted in a lower bfnet eta kahlown et al 2005 reported that the groundwater contribution of maize and sunflower decreased from 40 to 0 and from 80 to 5 in silty loam soils as the gwd increased from 0 5 m to 3 0 m respectively based on the lysimeter measurementd liu et al 2022 reported that groundwater contribution to crop et ranged from 22 to 39 and from 8 to 15 of the actual crop et observed in the shallower and deeper gwd respectively these results indicate that the contribution of groundwater to evapotranspiration in shallow groundwater systems cannot be ignored simulations showed that eta and bfnet eta declined continuously with increasing soil salinity for example in a normal year with 80 of the present irrigation depth 0 8 ir and cgwd of 1 2 m eta decreased approximately 120 mm for maize and 30 mm for sunflower in moderately saline soils compared to those in non saline soils bfnet eta decreased 30 07 for maize and 7 63 for sunflower in moderately saline soils compared to those in non saline soils this result might be attributed to the higher soil salinity resulting in higher osmotic potential in the soil solution and thus significantly reducing evapotranspiration and crop water uptake finally causing a lower bfnet eta karimi et al 2011 found that the groundwater contribution in maize fields decreased by 1 15 as the salinity in groundwater increased from 2 5 ds m 1 to 7 5 ds m 1 under full irrigation conditions 3 3 response of soil salinity variation to irs and gwds the simulated values of δs sini corresponding to wet years are presented in fig 4a maize and fig 4b sunflower compared with the lower irrigation depth the higher irrigation depth resulted in larger salt leaching for example in non saline soils of wet years with cgwd 1 5 m compared with the 0 7 ir treatment the 1 3 ir treatment decreased the δs sini value of the maize and sunflower fields by 0 344 and 0 316 respectively a similar result was also obtained by ren et al 2018 who found that the salt accumulation of the 0 8 ir treatment was 0 19 and 0 14 lower than that of the 0 6 ir treatment respectively for maize and sunflower fields in the hid in addition soil salinity showed a declining trend with increasing groundwater table depth for example for the treatment with an irrigation depth of 0 9 ir in non saline soils in wet years δs sini decreased by 0 233 in maize fields and 0 438 in sunflower fields as cgwd increased from 0 9 m to 2 1 m the reason for this result may be that a deeper gwd not only made it easier for the root zone soil salt to leach into the deep soils but also reduced the soil salt accumulation brought by capillary rise gao et al 2020 found that as cgwd increased from 1 0 m to 4 0 m the soil salinity in the root zone decreased by 17 7 during the crop growth period in the hid therefore appropriately reducing the gwd can effectively mitigate soil salinization especially in shallow groundwater areas 3 4 response of crop yield and water productivity to irs and gwds the simulated yields and wpet of maize and sunflower corresponding to dry years are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively in terms of all scenario results a larger irrigation depth generally resulted in a higher yield and wpet as the irrigation depth increased from 0 7 ir to 1 3 ir in moderately saline soils of the dry year at present gwd fgwd 0 m the crop yield of maize and sunflower increased by 23 22 and 13 28 respectively while the wpet for these two crops increased by 9 20 and 9 03 respectively higher irrigation water could maintain relatively higher soil available water and lower soil salt content which are beneficial to crop growth liu et al 2017 found that the maize yield increased from 6 09 103 kg hm 2 to 15 40 103 kg hm 2 and its wpet increased by 42 8 as the irrigation depth increased from 20 etc to 60 etc in the nearby area however some scenarios also showed that a shallower gwd with excessive irrigation water resulted in lower crop yield and wpet for example the yield and wpet of maize and sunflower decreased by approximately 1 5 as the irrigation depth increased from 0 7 ir to 1 3 ir in the non saline soils of the wet year with cgwd 0 9 m the reason for this result is that a shallower gwd with excessive irrigation caused waterlogging and then soil aeration in the root zone was decreased finally the root activity and crop yield were seriously affected similar findings were also obtained by kang et al 2017 who reported that excessive irrigation reduced crop yield and water productivity compared to deficit irrigation the effect of gwd on yield and wpet cannot be ignored for example in non saline soils with an irrigation depth of 0 8 ir in a dry year the yield of maize increased from 12 86 103 kg hm 2 cgwd 0 9 m to 13 23 103 kg hm 2 cgwd 1 2 m and then decreased to 12 72 103 kg hm 2 cgwd 2 1 m but its wpet continuously increased by 10 40 as cgwd increased from 0 9 m to 2 1 m the reason for this result might be that increasing gwd to some extent could increase deep percolation and reduce capillary rising and thus alleviate waterlogging but continuously increasing gwd e g cgwd 2 1 m might cause soil water stress because the contribution of groundwater to crop growth can be neglected a study by gao et al 2017b also found that the yield of maize decreased from 12 44 103 kg hm 2 to 12 05 103 kg hm 2 but its wpet increased by 8 37 as the gwd increased from 1 0 m to 2 5 m when the irrigation depth equaling to 26 of the potential evapotranspiration approximately 180 mm was applied in the hid increasing soil salinity inhibited crop yield formation and reduced wpet for example in a dry year with an irrigation depth of 0 9 ir at cgwd 1 8 m the yields of maize and sunflower were reduced by 32 44 and 4 51 respectively in moderately saline soils compared with non saline soils the yield reduction of maize was larger than that of sunflower because maize is more sensitive to salt stress than sunflower the corresponding wpet decreased by 14 97 and 4 85 for maize and sunflower respectively the decrease in crop yield and wpet was mainly because crop leaf water potential stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration were significantly affected by salt stress katerji et al 1996 found that higher salinity resulted in lower crop yield based on long term lysimeter experiments xiong et al 2021b also found that higher maize and sunflower yields were obtained in areas with lower soil salt contents and or higher soil water contents throughout the hid detailed simulation results of eta bfnet eta δs sini yield wpet corresponding to each treatment could be found in figs s5 s9 3 5 searching for appropriate iws scps 3 5 1 appropriate iws scps the comprehensive evaluation index i e the benefit ratio q of maize and sunflower for different scenarios is shown in fig 7 the q value showed a declining trend with increasing irrigation depth for example in slightly saline soils of normal years with cgwd 1 5 m the q value of maize decreased from 0 94 to 0 47 as the irrigation depth increased from 0 7 ir to 1 3 ir however in wet years in non saline soils reducing the irrigation depth decreased the q value for example for the case of cgwd 0 9 m the q value decreased from 1 0 to 0 83 as the irrigation depth decreased from 1 3 ir to 1 0 ir this is consistent with the results of wpet and crop yield which decreased as the irrigation depth increased at cgwd 0 9 m the q value significantly decreased with the increase in gwd for maize a deeper gwd cgwd 2 1 m and fgwd of 0 9 m deeper than the present depth resulted in a smaller q for example in non saline soils with an irrigation depth of 0 9 ir in normal years the q value decreased from 0 77 to 0 013 as cgwd increased from 0 9 m to 2 1 m and its value decreased from 0 58 to 0 24 as fgwd increased from the present depth to 0 9 m deeper than the present depth for sunflower a smaller q existed in most scenarios with cgwd 1 5 m and fgwd of 0 3 0 6 m deeper than the present depth for example in non saline soils with an irrigation depth of 0 9 ir in normal years the q value decreased from 0 34 to 0 032 and then increased from 0 032 to 0 94 as cgwd increased from 0 9 m to 1 5 m and then increased to 2 1 m and its value decreased from 0 29 to 0 17 and then increased from 0 17 to 0 86 as fgwd increased from the present depth to 0 3 m deeper than the present depth and then to 0 9 m deeper than the present depth different crops showed different variation patterns of q under the same conditions this may be attributed to the fact that different crops have different responses to the same salt and water stresses that is also why the proper gwd for maize growth was deeper than that for sunflower the above results indicated that deeper gwd and higher ir could result in smaller q values for maize while shallower gwd and lower ir could result in smaller q values for sunflower considering the scenarios with the minimum q values the appropriate iws scps can be determined and the results are listed in table 5 as shown in table 5 except for the cases with moderately saline soils of normal years and slightly saline soils of dry years in most cases the suitable gwds for maize were cgwd 2 1 m and fgwd of 0 9 m deeper than the present depth whereas the suitable gwd for sunflower was cgwd 1 5 m except for the cases with slightly and moderately saline soils in wet years the suitable fgwds for sunflower ranged from 0 6 m deeper than the present depth to 0 9 m deeper than the present depth for wet years from 0 3 m deeper than the present depth to 0 6 deeper than the present depth m for normal years and remained the present depth for dry years the appropriate irrigation depth increased with increasing soil salinization and decreasing annual precipitation for both maize and sunflower as the soil salinity increased from non saline to moderately saline the suitable irrigation depth for maize increased from 0 9 ir to 1 1 ir in wet years from 0 9 ir to approximately 1 2 ir in normal years and from 1 0 ir to 1 3 ir in dry years respectively for sunflower as soil salinization increased from non saline to moderately saline its suitable irrigation depth increased from 0 7 ir to 1 1 ir in normal years and from 0 7 ir to 1 3 ir in dry years respectively whereas in wet years the suitable irrigation depth remained at 0 7 ir for the three saline conditions it should be noted that the average present groundwater depths for maize and sunflower were 1 39 m and 1 31 m respectively the recommended iws scps for maize are those with cgwd 2 1 m or fgwd of 0 9 m deeper than the present depth i e approximately 2 29 m and the appropriate irrigation depth of 0 9 ir for non saline soils in wet years and 1 1 ir or more for slightly and moderately saline soils in normal and dry years respectively whereas the appropriate iws scps for sunflower are those with cgwd 1 5 m or fgwd of 0 6 0 9 m deeper than the present depth i e approximately 1 91 2 21 m and a 10 30 reduced irrigation depth i e 0 7 0 9 ir for most cases 3 5 2 performance of the framework the results obtained in this study are in a reasonable range compared with the findings of other studies for example an irrigation depth of 124 358 mm obtained by using the isareg model was recommended for silage maize in northern spain cancela et al 2006 with the isareg and srfr models pereira et al 2007 found that maintaining gwd deeper than 1 0 m and combining improved irrigation scheduling could effectively reduce soil salinization for maize growing farmland in the huinong irrigation district of the upper yrb our previous research ren et al 2018 showed that an appropriate gwd of 1 7 2 3 m was recommended for maize and sunflower and compared with the present irrigation depth 20 irrigation water could be saved for sunflower in the upper yrb the framework of coupling the agro hydrological model ahc with the mcdm method shows its reliable applicability to the decision of iws scps however it should be noted that the model based framework used in agriculture is vulnerable to many factors such as the precise prediction of weather conditions the complicated and comprehensive agricultural management practices and the designed scenarios being unable to fully capture the actual situations in addition uncertainties exist in agro hydrological models and their related parameters the selection of indicators and the determination of weights for the mcdm method therefore the determined iws scps should be involved in uncertainties and thus should be adjusted accordingly in real practice 4 conclusion a framework for assessing the iws scps was developed by coupling the ahc model with the vikor method the framework was then used to search the appropriate iws scps for maize and sunflower in the upper yrb with the well calibrated ahc model the simulations were conducted on the basis of the designed scenarios considering irrigation depth and groundwater table depth under the conditions of different hydrological years and degrees of soil salinization the simulated crop yield soil salinity variation and crop water productivity were adopted in the vikor method to generate a comprehensive evaluation index to seek the appropriate iws scps we found in the upper yrb that the appropriate iws scps for maize were those with gwds between 2 1 m and 2 3 m an irrigation depth approximately 10 lower than the present irrigation for non saline soils in wet years and an irrigation depth approximately 10 higher than the present irrigation for slightly and moderately saline soils in normal and dry years whereas in most cases the appropriate iws scps for sunflower were those with gwds between 1 5 m and 2 2 m and irrigation depths approximately 10 30 lower than the present irrigation our findings demonstrated that the developed framework can provide a useful decision tool for improving irrigation water savings

9085,unreasonable irrigation water saving and salinity control practices iws scps have resulted in a shallow groundwater table severe soil salinization and low water use efficiency in the upper yellow river basin yrb northwest china in our study a framework was developed by coupling the agro hydrological model i e ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator with a decision making method i e vikor vlsekriterijuska optimizacija i komoromisno resenje and then a comprehensive evaluation index was calculated to assess the iws scps for maize and sunflower in the upper yrb the ahc model was calibrated and validated with two years of field measured data and then it was used to perform the simulations of agro hydrological processes corresponding to the designed scenarios considering the irrigation depth and groundwater table depth gwd under the conditions of different hydrological years and degrees of soil salinization the simulated crop yield soil salinity variation and crop water productivity were used as the evaluation indicators to search for appropriate iws scps of the target crops the results showed that the recommended iws scps for maize were those with gwds between 2 1 2 3 m and irrigation depths approximately 10 lower for non saline soils in wet years and 10 higher than the present irrigation for slightly and moderately saline soils in normal and dry years whereas the iws scps with gwd between 1 5 2 2 m and an irrigation depth of approximately 10 30 lower than the present situation could be recommended for sunflower in wet years and normal years regardless of saline soils and in dry years of non saline soils the developed framework and the obtained results are expected to provide a decision tool and implications for improving irrigation efficiency and salinity control in the arid upper yrb as well as other areas with similar climate conditions and shallow groundwater keywords irrigation water saving salinity control agro hydrological model decision making method upper yellow river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation is an important factor to ensure agricultural production in semi arid and arid regions kang et al 2017 minhas et al 2020 in these regions large amounts of irrigation water are usually applied for crop production to ensure food supply however inefficient irrigation practices and poor drainage systems result in lower water use efficiency and shallow gwd further resulting in secondary soil salinity due to strong evaporation in arid climatic conditions qadir et al 2009 reported that in recent decades the irrigation efficiency decreased to approximately 40 and the salt accumulation in root zone soils reached 0 6 t ha 1 yr 1 to 10 t ha 1 yr 1 due to mismanagement of irrigation water in the aral sea basin of central asia which has a typically arid climate additionally approximately 30 of the irrigated land was affected by waterlogging induced by shallow gwds in this area reid and brooks 2000 also reported that increasing salinity caused by inappropriate irrigation has resulted in a reduction in agricultural yields and reduced biodiversity in the murray darling basin of australia under arid semi arid conditions it is obvious that unreasonable irrigation water saving and salinity control practices iws scps seriously restrict the sustainable development of agriculture therefore it is necessary to improve the iws scps with the consideration of maximizing the water use efficiency alleviating local water conflicts and maintaining food production in recent decades many methods have been proposed to determine iws scps which can be broadly grouped into two categories the first is direct or indirect measurement methods based on crop water status i e leaf stomatal conductance sap flow and stem diameter variation and soil environmental factors related to crop growth e g soil water content salinity and nutrient status all these parameters can reflect crop responses to the stresses of water salt nutrients and other environmental factors fernandez and cuevas 2010 with the advances of technologies the use of automatic instruments allows us to measure the parameters of crop water and the related environmental factors in more efficient ways facilitating the development of the iws scps more recently thermal image data of crop canopies have been widely used to diagnose the water stress of crops maes and steppe 2012 thermal data can be acquired using visible near infrared nir short wave infrared swir and sensors on uavs and satellite platforms gowda et al 2007 khanal et al 2017 based on direct and indirect measurements of crop water parameters and related environmental factors iws scps can be determined accordingly calera et al 2017 however direct and indirect measurement based methods are usually time consuming and costly the second method is based on agro hydrological modeling with mathematical models in general agro hydrological models can be classified as conceptual water balance models such as isareg pereira et al 2003 aquacrop steduto et al 2009 and simdualkc rosa et al 2012 and physically mechanistic models such as hydrus simunek et al 2012 saltmed ragab 2002 swap kroes and van dam 2003 rzqwm hanson et al 1998 and ahc xu et al 2018 both categories have been used to search for iws scps since the 1980 s pereira et al 2020 for example the isareg model was used to improve the irrigation scheduling for cotton in central asia pereira et al 2009 for silage maize and grass pasture in spain cancela et al 2006 and for maize and wheat in the huinong irrigation district of the upper yellow river basin yrb of china pereira et al 2007 the rzwqm2 model was used to simulate irrigation scheduling and improve water productivity for seed cotton in northwest china chen et al 2019 the aquacrop model was also used in varying field scale irrigation managements in maize farmland abedinpour et al 2012 and sunflower farmland todorovic et al 2009 under different climate conditions the simdualkc model was used to assess the performance of different irrigation schedules on maize water productivity paredes et al 2014 using physically mechanistic models as a decision tool for the iws scps can be found in many previous studies for example swap was used to optimize irrigation scheduling for wheatcorn cropping systems ma et al 2011 and maize pan et al 2020 in china and winter wheat in iran azad et al 2018 under different conditions to achieve sustainable agriculture in water shortage areas karandish and simunek 2019 used hydrus 2d 3d and saltmed to assess the influence of various water saving irrigation strategies on maize water footprints the recently developed ahc model is a numerical model of the physical and chemical fates of water heat solute transport in agro eco hydrological processes xu et al 2018 and has been used in some areas for example liu et al 2020a used ahc to assess the response of crop water productivity to climate change and water saving scenarios in the oasis of the middle heihe river basin additionally ahc was also used to evaluate the agro hydrological processes and water utilization in canal and well irrigated areas in the upper yrb wang et al 2022 all these related studies demonstrated that the ahc model is a promising tool for iws scps with robust computational stability and astringency in the simulation of agro hydrological processes based on the agro hydrological modeling results the appropriate iws scps can be obtained with the help of multi criteria decision making mcdm under different soil climate crop cultivation fertilization irrigation and drainage conditions in general mcdm methods can be classified into two categories i e discrete mcdm or discrete madm multi attribute decision making and continuous modm multi objective decision making methods kumar et al 2017 the madm methods include topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution hwang and yoon 1981 ahp analytic hierarchy process saaty 1990 and vikor vlsekriterijuska optimizacija i komoromisno resenje opricovic 1998 however those methods e g gp goal programming lp linear programming dea data envelopment analysis etc belong to the modm methods ha and do 2016 mcdm methods have been used for decision making in energy and environmental sustainability soltani et al 2015 supply chain management rajesh and ravi 2015 and water resource management golfam et al 2019 with the mcdm methods the problems with various conflicting interests can be addressed facilitating decision making among the mcdm methods the vikor method showed its advantage of objectively determining the weights saad and ahmad 2016 using the critic criteria importance through intercriteria correlation method diakoulaki et al 1995 the upper yrb is an important food production base in china the main crops grown in the upper yrb are wheat maize and sunflower among them the growing area of maize and sunflower showed an increasing trend in the past two decades accounting for approximately 41 0 and 15 6 of the total cropping area in recent years han 2021 water scarcity in this region is increasing due to climate change and the growing demand for water in recent decades excessive irrigation water diverted from the yellow river has resulted in a shallow groundwater table and serious soil salinization in the farmland systems thus appropriate iws scps are urgently required for the sustainably agricultural production the impacts of application of water saving practices e g improving the canal system optimizing irrigation strategies and adjusting cropping patterns on et gwd salinity yield have been investigated for the sustainable agricultural development xu et al 2010 found that canal and farm level irrigation water saving practices might lower the gwd by 0 28 0 48 m and higher declines of gwd occurred when both canal and farm systems were applied water saving practices furthermore 60 of the area implementing canal lining and upgrading hydraulic structures would reduce groundwater evaporation by 43 mm and 20 of present diverted water from the yellow river xu et al 2011 previous researches also revealed that non beneficial evaporation and salt accumulation affecting crop yields were significant due to shallow gwds ren et al 2016 and with optimum gwd ranging from 1 7 2 3 m could save 15 30 of water diversion from the yellow river ren et al 2018 later study found that the 100 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 50 cm are recommended for dry years and the 80 of present irrigation depth combined with increasing initial gwd by 100 cm are recommended for wet years without apparently yield reduction xiong et al 2021a besides shallower gwd slightly higher yield larger actual evapotranspiration and more serious salt accumulation were identified in canal irrigated areas than in well irrigated areas wang et al 2022 however in previous studies appropriate iws scps for various salinization farmlands in different hydrological years were not well addressed nevertheless to our knowledge the multi criteria decision making mcdm method based on agro hydrological model simulation results is barely used to determine the iws scps thus the objectives of this study are 1 to propose a framework for determining the iws scps by coupling the ahc model with the vikor method and 2 to demonstrate its applicability in searching for the appropriate iws scps for maize and sunflower farmlands in the upper yrb 2 methodology 2 1 framework development the framework for the assessment of iws scps was developed by combining the ahc model with an mcdm method i e the vikor method a detailed description of the framework can be found in fig 1 based on the framework the iws scps for the target crop can be assessed as follows 1 calibration and validation of the ahc model with the collected spatial and temporal data including soil crop groundwater and irrigation date 2 scenario design considering the irrigation depth and groundwater table depth gwd under the conditions of different degrees of soil salinization in different hydrological years 3 performing the simulations corresponding to different scenarios then the simulated results of soil water salt dynamics and crop growth indices i e soil salinity variation crop yield and water productivity were used as the evaluation indicators in the vikor method 4 the benefit ratio value corresponding to each scenario was calculated in which the suitable iws scp was determined as the iws scp with the smallest benefit ratio value the ahc model and vikor method are presented as follows 2 2 ahc model the ahc model is a one dimensional agro hydrological model that includes physically based modules for simulating soil water flow solute and heat transport and crop growth xu et al 2018 2 2 1 soil water

transpiration tp based upon the leaf area index lai actual evaporation and transpiration rates are then respectively obtained as a function of the available soil water in the root zone the crop yield is calculated using the harvest index concept based on biomass and the biomass is computed from the solar radiation intercepted by the crop leaf area the plant radiation use efficiency and the water stress and temperature stress during salinity simulation lai is estimated as a function of heat unit water salt or nitrogen stress factor and development stages in the ahc the water and salt stress factors are calculated with the s shaped functions suggested by van genuchten 1987 and a salinity threshold value was adopted from dirksen and augustijn 1988 a more detailed description of the ahc model can be found in xu et al 2018 soil water flow and solute transport were simulated with a soil profile of 300 cm depth the soil profile was discretized into 300 compartments with a thickness of 1 cm for water flow the upper boundary was set as an atmospheric boundary condition specifying daily precipitation and irrigation fluxes and evaporation and transpiration rates the daily groundwater table depth was set as the bottom boundary condition in our simulation the total simulated depth is 300 cm and gwd was determined according to the corresponding designed treatments for solute transport the upper and bottom boundary conditions were specified by a concentration flux i e the observed total dissolved solid concentration of irrigation water precipitation water and groundwater the initial conditions of the soil water and salinity concentrations were set based on field observations the simulation period was from early may to mid september covering the maize and sunflower growing seasons pre and post processing of datasets could be performed by its friendly graphical user interface gui the ahc model can be calibrated and validated by comparing the simulated values and the observed data including soil moisture content salt concentration and crop growth indices crop height leaf area index and yield with a trial and error method after sensitivity analysis the model performance was evaluated in terms of the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse determination coefficient r2 and nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse mre and rmse values close to zero indicated good model performance the r2 values close to 1 0 indicated that the variation in the observed values was well captured by the model the nse values vary from to 1 with nse 1 0 representing a perfect fit and negative nse values indicating that the mean observed value was a better predictor than the simulated value which indicates unacceptable performance r2 larger than 0 5 and nse larger than 0 are generally considered acceptable moriasi et al 2007 2 3 vikor method with the vikor method the iws scp for the target crop was evaluated according to the benefit ratio value q i of each

field observations and data acquisitions can be found in ren et al 2016 2017 2 4 2 scenario design for different hydrological years the details of the treatments corresponding to the designed scenarios are summarized and listed in table 2 groundwater table depth and irrigation depth were the major concerns for scenario design in the following analysis two types of groundwater table depths i e the free groundwater table depth fgwd and the controlled groundwater table depth cgwd were included in the scenario design four fgwds i e fgwd 0 m corresponding to the present groundwater table depth of the calibration period fgwd 0 3 m fgwd 0 6 m and fgwd 0 9 m i e 0 3 m 0 6 m and 0 9 m deeper than the present groundwater table depth of the calibration period respectively were considered controlled groundwater table depth practices simulated the conditions that the groundwater table depth during the simulation period was controlled at a certain fixed depth that adapts to the tile drainage system promoted in the hid five cgwds i e 0 9 m corresponding to the shallowest gwd suitable for crop growth 1 2 m 1 5 m 1 8 m and 2 1 m corresponding to the deepest gwd for crop growth were set for maize the irrigation depth in the calibration period was taken as the benchmark 1 0 ir for determining the irrigation scenarios for sunflower due to the slightly excessive irrigation depth of sunflower the benchmark irrigation depth was adjusted to 203 mm on may 10th and 103 mm on june 25th with reference to previous research results in this area miao et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al

fraction were considered in the scenario design based on real farmland situations three different salinization degree scenarios i e non saline slightly saline and moderately saline farmland soils were set up according to the specific standards wang et al 1993 commonly adopted in the hid the detailed soluble salts in the 0 100 cm soils collected from hao 2015 and referred to xiong et al 2021b table 3 three hydrological years i e wet year wy normal year ny and dry year dy corresponding to precipitation frequencies of 25 50 and 75 respectively were determined with annual precipitation data from linhe national meteorological station of 63 years from 1957 to 2019 the precipitation frequency was analyzed by using the pearson type iii distribution curve bobée and ashkar 1991 smith 2020 then the years 1994 1981 and 1999 were selected as the typical years of wy ny and dy respectively table 4 each treatment considered different soil salinization level irrigation depth gwd in different hydrological years and they were all combined to compose the scenarios with the designed scenarios based on the irrigation depth and groundwater table depth the benefit ratio q i e the comprehensive index proposed by this framework of each scenario corresponding to non slightly and moderately saline soils in wet normal and dry years was calculated the iws scp with the smallest value of q was selected as the appropriate iws scp for the corresponding soil salinization degree and hydrological year of the target crop 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the indicators

period were all acceptable fig s2 for soil water content the mre rmse r2 and nse values were 1 35 0 026 cm3 cm 3 0 72 and 0 71 for maize and 0 24 0 025 cm3 cm 3 0 84 and 0 79 for sunflower respectively for the soil salt concentration the mre rmse r2 and nse values were 11 12 1 34 g l 1 0 72 and 0 69 for maize and 9 55 0 82 g l 1 0 74 and 0 71 for sunflower respectively the simulation of leaf area index lai and crop height ch also achieved relatively ideal results fig s4 for lai the mre rmse and nse values were 5 50 0 84 m2 m 2 and 0 53 for maize and 2 92 0 52 m2 m 2 and 0 89 for sunflower respectively for ch the mre rmse r2 and nse values were 18 03 18 82 cm 0 98 and 0 95 for maize and 4 5 21 03 cm 0 94 and 0 90 for sunflower respectively a comparison of the simulated and measured data of soil water content and soil salt concentration for maize and sunflower during the validation period is presented in fig s3 for the soil water content the fit goodness indicators were acceptable with the mre rmse r2 and nse values in the range of 1 63 2 21 0 036 0 037 cm3 cm 3 0 64 0 69 and 0 50 0 64 respectively the simulated soil salt concentration was in good agreement with the

also acceptable both for lai mre 1 89 10 78 rmse 0 68 1 13 nse 0 58 0 85 and ch mre 13 69 14 78 rmse 14 75 18 64 cm r2 0 93 0 99 nse 0 92 0 97 fig s4 the values of the fitness indicators related to model calibration and validation are listed in table s2 the calibrated parameters of soil hydraulic characteristics solute transport and crop growth in the study area are shown in tables s3 s5 the indicator values of calibration and validation were at an acceptable level referring to previous studies that used the same model xu et al 2018 and wang et al 2022 and the same indicators liu et al 2020a ren et al 2016 xue et al 2018 the calibrated ahc model captured the soil water salt dynamics and crop growth processes well which indicated that ahc could be adopted as a reliable and useful tool for analyzing the agro hydrological processes in this area 3 2 response of eta and bfnet eta to different irs and gwds the simulated values of actual evapotranspiration eta corresponding to normal years are presented in fig 2a maize and fig 2b sunflower the ratio of the net upward bottom flux of the root zone bfnet to evapotranspiration i e bfnet eta was used as the indicator to evaluate the contribution of groundwater to crop growth fig 3 eta increased but bfnet eta decreased as irrigation depth increased for example in the case of 0 3 m deeper than the present gwd in moderately saline soils of normal years the eta of maize and sunflower increased by 16 25 and 9 40 respectively while the bfnet eta of maize and sunflower decreased by 24 33 and 30 21 respectively as the irrigation depth increased from 0 7 ir to 1 3 ir the reason for this result is that a large irrigation depth could increase the soil water content and promote crop water consumption thus increasing eta from the farmland system increasing the irrigation depth could also result in higher water percolation thereby decreasing bfnet similar results were also reported in previous studies by liu et al 2017 and klocke et al 2013 who found that the eta of maize and sunflower increased with increasing irrigation depth gao et al 2017a also reported that as the irrigation depth increased from 294 mm to 410 mm the eta of maize increased from 412 mm to 469 mm but the net upward flux decreased from 62 mm to 3 mm in the hid with the simulation results by using the coupled model of hydrus 1d and dualkc approach ren et al 2016 reported that diverse irrigation schedules and shallow gwds resulted in large capillary rise according for 23 53 of total evapotranspiration for different crop fields in the hid these results indicate that a higher irrigation depth caused a smaller groundwater contribution to eta in contrast crops with small irrigation situations may use groundwater more effectively for their growth eta and bfnet eta decreased as the groundwater table depth increased for example in the slightly saline soils with an irrigation of 0 8 ir in normal years the eta of maize and sunflower decreased by 10 74 and 17 41 respectively and the bfnet eta decreased by 16 59 and 23 66 for these two crops as the free groundwater table depth increased from the present situation fgwd 0 m to a 0 9 m deeper situation fgwd 0 9 m respectively this finding was mainly because the shallower groundwater depth resulted in a higher soil water content and more wet soil surface through capillary rising subsequently causing rapid soil evaporation and finally leading to a higher groundwater contribution in the case of a larger gwd capillary rising carried less water from the deep layer to the topsoil layer which resulted in a lower bfnet eta kahlown et al 2005 reported that the groundwater contribution of maize and sunflower decreased from 40 to 0 and from 80 to 5 in silty loam soils as the gwd increased from 0 5 m to 3 0 m respectively based on the lysimeter measurementd liu et al 2022 reported that groundwater contribution to crop et ranged from 22 to 39 and from 8 to 15 of the actual crop et observed in the shallower and deeper gwd respectively these results indicate that the contribution of groundwater to evapotranspiration in shallow groundwater systems cannot be ignored simulations showed that eta and bfnet eta declined continuously with increasing soil salinity for example in a normal year with 80 of the present irrigation depth 0 8 ir and cgwd of 1 2 m eta decreased approximately 120 mm for maize and 30 mm for sunflower in moderately saline soils compared to those in non saline soils bfnet eta decreased 30 07 for maize and 7 63 for sunflower in moderately saline soils compared to those in non saline soils this result might be attributed to the higher soil salinity resulting in higher osmotic potential in the soil solution and thus significantly reducing evapotranspiration and crop water uptake finally causing a lower bfnet eta karimi et al 2011 found that the groundwater contribution in maize fields decreased by 1 15 as the salinity in groundwater increased from 2 5 ds m 1 to 7 5 ds m 1 under full irrigation conditions 3 3 response of soil salinity variation to irs and gwds the simulated values of δs sini corresponding to wet years are presented in fig 4a maize and fig 4b sunflower compared with the lower irrigation depth the higher irrigation depth resulted in larger salt leaching for example in non saline soils of wet years with cgwd 1 5 m compared with the 0 7 ir treatment the 1 3 ir treatment decreased the δs sini value of the maize and sunflower fields by 0 344 and 0 316 respectively a similar result was also obtained by ren et al 2018 who found that the salt accumulation of the 0 8 ir treatment was 0 19 and 0 14 lower than that of the 0 6 ir treatment respectively for maize and sunflower fields in the hid in addition soil salinity showed a declining trend with increasing groundwater table depth for example for the treatment with an irrigation depth of 0 9 ir in non saline soils in wet years δs sini decreased by 0 233 in maize fields and 0 438 in sunflower fields as cgwd increased from 0 9 m to 2 1 m the reason for this result may be that a deeper gwd not only made it easier for the root zone soil salt to leach into the deep soils but also reduced the soil salt accumulation brought by capillary rise gao et al 2020 found that as cgwd increased from 1 0 m to 4 0 m the soil salinity in the root zone decreased by 17 7 during the crop growth period in the hid therefore appropriately reducing the gwd can effectively mitigate soil salinization especially in shallow groundwater areas 3 4 response of crop yield and water productivity to irs and gwds the simulated yields and wpet of maize and sunflower corresponding to dry years are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively in terms of all scenario results a larger irrigation depth generally resulted in a higher yield and wpet as the irrigation depth increased from 0 7 ir to 1 3 ir in moderately saline soils of the dry year at present gwd fgwd 0 m the crop yield of maize and sunflower increased by 23 22 and 13 28 respectively while the wpet for these two crops increased by 9 20 and 9 03 respectively higher irrigation water could maintain relatively higher soil available water and lower soil salt content which are beneficial to crop growth liu et al 2017 found that the maize yield increased from 6 09 103 kg hm 2 to 15 40 103 kg hm 2 and its wpet increased by 42 8 as the irrigation depth increased from 20 etc to 60 etc in the nearby area however some scenarios also showed that a shallower gwd with excessive irrigation water resulted in lower crop yield and wpet for example the yield and wpet of maize and sunflower decreased by approximately 1 5 as the irrigation depth increased from 0 7 ir to 1 3 ir in the non saline soils of the wet year with cgwd 0 9 m the reason for this result is that a shallower gwd with excessive irrigation caused waterlogging and then soil aeration in the root zone was decreased finally the root activity and crop yield were seriously affected similar findings were also obtained by kang et al 2017 who reported that excessive irrigation reduced crop yield and water productivity compared to deficit irrigation the effect of gwd on yield and wpet cannot be ignored for example in non saline soils with an irrigation depth of 0 8 ir in a dry year the yield of maize increased from 12 86 103 kg hm 2 cgwd 0 9 m to 13 23 103 kg hm 2 cgwd 1 2 m and then decreased to 12 72 103 kg hm 2 cgwd 2 1 m but its wpet continuously increased by 10 40 as cgwd increased from 0 9 m to 2 1 m the reason for this result might be that increasing gwd to some extent could increase deep percolation and reduce capillary rising and thus alleviate waterlogging but continuously increasing gwd e g cgwd 2 1 m might cause soil water stress because the contribution of groundwater to crop growth can be neglected a study by gao et al 2017b also found that the yield of maize decreased from 12 44 103 kg hm 2 to 12 05 103 kg hm 2 but its wpet increased by 8 37 as the gwd increased from 1 0 m to 2 5 m when the irrigation depth equaling to 26 of the potential evapotranspiration approximately 180 mm was applied in the hid increasing soil salinity inhibited crop yield formation and reduced wpet for example in a dry year with an irrigation depth of 0 9 ir at cgwd 1 8 m the yields of maize and sunflower were reduced by 32 44 and 4 51 respectively in moderately saline soils compared with non saline soils the yield reduction of maize was larger than that of sunflower because maize is more sensitive to salt stress than sunflower the corresponding wpet decreased by 14 97 and 4 85 for maize and sunflower respectively the decrease in crop yield and wpet was mainly because crop leaf water potential stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration were significantly affected by salt stress katerji et al 1996 found that higher salinity resulted in lower crop yield based on long term lysimeter experiments xiong et al 2021b also found that higher maize and sunflower yields were obtained in areas with lower soil salt contents and or higher soil water contents throughout the hid detailed simulation results of eta bfnet eta δs sini yield wpet corresponding to each treatment could be found in figs s5 s9 3 5 searching for appropriate iws scps 3 5 1 appropriate iws scps the comprehensive evaluation index i e the benefit ratio q of maize and sunflower for different scenarios is shown in fig 7 the q value showed a declining trend with increasing irrigation depth for example in slightly saline soils of normal years with cgwd 1 5 m the q value of maize decreased from 0 94 to 0 47 as the irrigation depth increased from 0 7 ir to 1 3 ir however in wet years in non saline soils reducing the irrigation depth decreased the q value for example for the case of cgwd 0 9 m the q value decreased from 1 0 to 0 83 as the irrigation depth decreased from 1 3 ir to 1 0 ir this is consistent with the results of wpet and crop yield which decreased as the irrigation depth increased at cgwd 0 9 m the q value significantly decreased with the increase in gwd for maize a deeper gwd cgwd 2 1 m and fgwd of 0 9 m deeper than the present depth resulted in a smaller q for example in non saline soils with an irrigation depth of 0 9 ir in normal years the q value decreased from 0 77 to 0 013 as cgwd increased from 0 9 m to 2 1 m and its value decreased from 0 58 to 0 24 as fgwd increased from the present depth to 0 9 m deeper than the present depth for sunflower a smaller q existed in most scenarios with cgwd 1 5 m and fgwd of 0 3 0 6 m deeper than the present depth for example in non saline soils with an irrigation depth of 0 9 ir in normal years the q value decreased from 0 34 to 0 032 and then increased from 0 032 to 0 94 as cgwd increased from 0 9 m to 1 5 m and then increased to 2 1 m and its value decreased from 0 29 to 0 17 and then increased from 0 17 to 0 86 as fgwd increased from the present depth to 0 3 m deeper than the present depth and then to 0 9 m deeper than the present depth different crops showed different variation patterns of q under the same conditions this may be attributed to the fact that different crops have different responses to the same salt and water stresses that is also why the proper gwd for maize growth was deeper than that for sunflower the above results indicated that deeper gwd and higher ir could result in smaller q values for maize while shallower gwd and lower ir could result in smaller q values for sunflower considering the scenarios with the minimum q values the appropriate iws scps can be determined and the results are listed in table 5 as shown in table 5 except for the cases with moderately saline soils of normal years and slightly saline soils of dry years in most cases the suitable gwds for maize were cgwd 2 1 m and fgwd of 0 9 m deeper than the present depth whereas the suitable gwd for sunflower was cgwd 1 5 m except for the cases with slightly and moderately saline soils in wet years the suitable fgwds for sunflower ranged from 0 6 m deeper than the present depth to 0 9 m deeper than the present depth for wet years from 0 3 m deeper than the present depth to 0 6 deeper than the present depth m for normal years and remained the present depth for dry years the appropriate irrigation depth increased with increasing soil salinization and decreasing annual precipitation for both maize and sunflower as the soil salinity increased from non saline to moderately saline the suitable irrigation depth for maize increased from 0 9 ir to 1 1 ir in wet years from 0 9 ir to approximately 1 2 ir in normal years and from 1 0 ir to 1 3 ir in dry years respectively for sunflower as soil salinization increased from non saline to moderately saline its suitable irrigation depth increased from 0 7 ir to 1 1 ir in normal years and from 0 7 ir to 1 3 ir in dry years respectively whereas in wet years the suitable irrigation depth remained at 0 7 ir for the three saline conditions it should be noted that the average present groundwater depths for maize and sunflower were 1 39 m and 1 31 m respectively the recommended iws scps for maize are those with cgwd 2 1 m or fgwd of 0 9 m deeper than the present depth i e approximately 2 29 m and the appropriate irrigation depth of 0 9 ir for non saline soils in wet years and 1 1 ir or more for slightly and moderately saline soils in normal and dry years respectively whereas the appropriate iws scps for sunflower are those with cgwd 1 5 m or fgwd of 0 6 0 9 m deeper than the present depth i e approximately 1 91 2 21 m and a 10 30 reduced irrigation depth i e 0 7 0 9 ir for most cases 3 5 2 performance of the framework the results obtained in this study are in a reasonable range compared with the findings of other studies for example an irrigation depth of 124 358 mm obtained by using the isareg model was recommended for silage maize in northern spain cancela et al 2006 with the isareg and srfr models pereira et al 2007 found that maintaining gwd deeper than 1 0 m and combining improved irrigation scheduling could effectively reduce soil salinization for maize growing farmland in the huinong irrigation district of the upper yrb our previous research ren et al 2018 showed that an appropriate gwd of 1 7 2 3 m was recommended for maize and sunflower and compared with the present irrigation depth 20 irrigation water could be saved for sunflower in the upper yrb the framework of coupling the agro hydrological model ahc with the mcdm method shows its reliable applicability to the decision of iws scps however it should be noted that the model based framework used in agriculture is vulnerable to many factors such as the precise prediction of weather conditions the complicated and comprehensive agricultural management practices and the designed scenarios being unable to fully capture the actual situations in addition uncertainties exist in agro hydrological models and their related parameters the selection of indicators and the determination of weights for the mcdm method therefore the determined iws scps should be involved in uncertainties and thus should be adjusted accordingly in real practice 4 conclusion a framework for assessing the iws scps was developed by coupling the ahc model with the vikor method the framework was then used to search the appropriate iws scps for maize and sunflower in the upper yrb with the well calibrated ahc model the simulations were conducted on the basis of the designed scenarios considering irrigation depth and groundwater table depth under the conditions of different hydrological years and degrees of soil salinization the simulated crop yield soil salinity variation and crop water productivity were adopted in the vikor method to generate a comprehensive evaluation index to seek the appropriate iws scps we found in the upper yrb that the appropriate iws scps for maize were those with gwds between 2 1 m and 2 3 m an irrigation depth approximately 10 lower than the present irrigation for non saline soils in wet years and an irrigation depth approximately 10 higher than the present irrigation for slightly and moderately saline soils in normal and dry years whereas in most cases the appropriate iws scps for sunflower were those with gwds between 1 5 m and 2 2 m and irrigation depths approximately 10 30 lower than the present irrigation our findings demonstrated that the developed framework can provide a useful decision tool for improving irrigation water savings

positive and significant correlation table 5 cd gave positive and non significant correlation meanwhile non significant and positive correlation showed by ni and mn between wheat grains and soil in current research work significant correlation was observed between cr contents in grains and soil while ashfaq et al 2015 reported the contrary results a positive and significant correlation of heavy metals cu cr co zn and fe was observed between soil and wheat grains 4 assessment of wheat grain contamination and associated health risk 4 1 bio concentration factor the bio concentration factor bcf 1 0 show no accumulation of hm from the soil to the different parts of the plant organs if the value of bcf 1 then it shows accumulation of heavy metals singh et al 2011 bcf values ranged from 0 46 to 0 80 for cd 0 31 to 0 41 for ni 0 29 to 0 44 for fe and 0 15 to 0 73 for mn respectively fig 2 the values of bcf for zn co cu and cr were highest while the values of bcf for mn were lowest in all treatments fig 2 the bio concentration factor values of cd ni fe and mn being less than 1 0 indicates lower ni cd fe and mn concentration in grains which was in line with those found by li et al 2015 hussain and qureshi 2020 documented a significant difference in bcf among the target vegetables and fe exhibit higher bcf in lettuce while cr was lowest in eggplant similar results were documented by qureshi et al 2016 and khan et al 2017 several factors are responsible for heavy metals presence in the plant soil water environment such as atmospheric deposition manure from farm animals use of un treated wastewater or municipal water for irrigation herbicides pesticides and excessive use of phosphate based fertilizers woldetsadik et al 2017 el kady and abdel wahhab 2018 hussain et al 2020a 2020b the long term use of above practices can lead to the severe soil and environment contamination which can cause groundwater contamination and human health impact yang et al 2017 rai et al 2010 2018 hussain and qureshi 2020 4 2 pollution load index the soil contamination was evaluated through pollution load index pli tomlinson et al 1980 documented that a value of zero indicates no hazard while a value of one or more than one indicates a gradual increase in pollution due to un treated wastewater irrigation pli value for irrigated soils with different treatments has shown in table 6 all values were less than one and ranged from a minimum of 0 004 for zn in t i to a maximum of 2 04 for cd in t v pli zn and cd rated as the lowest and highest among the trace metals as for the average number of treatments cd and ni had the highest distribution in soil samples contamination sequence t i cd ni cu cr zn fe co zn in t ii the order was cd ni cu cr zn fe co zn while in t iii t iv and tv the order was cd ni cu cr zn fe co on cd ni cu cr zn fe co zn and cd ni cu cr zn fe co zn respectively table 6 4 3 daily intake of metal dim to assess the health risk of a contaminant we assessed the human exposure of each element through the pathways of the food chain here we assumed that the path of absorption of the studied metals is associated with the consumption of wheat grain meanwhile dim values were calculated based on the average consumption of wheat grains by the adults for adults the mean dim values for cd ni fe mn cu cr zn and co were 0 0071 0 0040 0 0045 0 0026 0 0089 0 0072 0 0138 and 0 0054 mg kg day respectively table 7 dim values in this study were less than the acceptable daily value the dim value was 1 indicating no risk to the human beings when consuming wheat flour or wheat products thus we can assume that the crops of wheat irrigated with sewage do not pose a danger to residents and consumers 4 4 health risk index assessing the human health risk by eating contaminated foods evaluated through proper procedures and protocol usepa united states environmental protection agency 2002 the hri is equally important for all countries particularly in those areas where wastewater operation left unattended if the hri of a particular nutrient was 1 it was believed to be safe for human consumption however if it 1 may pose a serious threat to human health usepa united states environmental protection agency 2002 the results of hri of the metals showed that the hri level for zinc is the highest and it was in the range of 4 611 50 45 in t i and t iv respectively table 8 it means it may pose a potential risk to human health via food consumption this was in line with findings of bansal and singh 2015 whom demonstrated that hri of zinc was higher in the tested food products the hri of cd in all treatments from t i to t v was found elevated than 1 and exceeds than allowable limits that might pose a threat to human health however hris of other metals was below than 1 ni fe mn cu cr and co and showed no danger to human health all of the examined vegetables had target hazard quotients thq for cu zn and fe that are less than one suggesting that they are relatively safe heavy metals had risk index ri values 1 0 indicating a lesser risk to humans hussain and qureshi 2020 4 5 enrichment factor the enrichment factor was calculated to assess the metal contamination cadmium possessed the highest enrichment rate in the soil samples table 9 the t 2 results showed the greatest value for ef with zn followed by cr and cd table 9 if the value of fe is 1 it highlight availability and distribution of metals in the contaminated soil while the lowest ef was observed in mn at t 1ii the trend of ef in the t 1 was co cu ni fe mn mean value of ef 1 indicates an increase in the accumulation of metal in the terrestrial plant species gupta et al 2018 in the present results the ef level was higher than 1 for zn cr and cd therefore it may cause risk of overcrowding of metals in the plants organs growing in the contaminated soil rhizosphere however lower baf value indicates that this risk does not apply to wheat 5 conclusion wheat can accumulate a substantial number of poisonous trace and hazardous elements in various plant tissues particularly in grains in addition to necessary nutrient elements as a result wheat is a vital cereal food grain crop that needs to be handled carefully to minimize any hazards associated with its consumption following irrigated with sewage water highest concentrations detected for cd in the wheat grains that were greater than fao limits that might be a risk for human through the consumption of contaminated foods dim was 1 that indicates a low risk to local inhabitants we came to the conclusion that the primary cause of metal buildup in wheat grains is irrigation with sewage wastewater which might led to serious health effects the hri values 1 observed higher for zn and cd while pli values were greater in zn cr and cd it offer a succinct summary of the current situation for food contamination and potential future health risk to the local population in order to prevent an excessive buildup of toxic metals in the plant soil water system and to safeguard the health of the local population it is urgently necessary to monitor the wastewater irrigation system in the study area declarations

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture sector heavily depends on fresh water resources that are globally scarce for irrigation this situation will adversely affect many countries especially tropical sub tropical and arid regions of asia arabian peninsula and north africa including several regions of sahel ibekwe et al 2018 hussain and al dakheel 2015

vegetables and forages at their farms ofori et al 2020 hussain et al 2020a 2020b in west asia and north african countries about 80 vegetables grown via treated or un treated water irrigation woldetsadik et al 2017 various water sources such as salty water wastewater and grey water have been used in agricultural sector vegetables oilseeds landscaping aquaculture forages food and fiber crops forestry fruit trees and perennial grasses hussain and al dakheel 2015 2018 hussain et al 2018 2019 2020a 2020b the rehabilitated marginalized and degraded areas could be used to meet the growing demand for food through sustainable use of non conventional water for the growing global population but has been poorly studied in the past hussain et al 2020a 2020b according to an estimate non conventional water has been used for agriculture production on about 20 million hectares ibekwe et al 2018 hussain and qureshi 2020 however in order to determine the prospects for the use of wastewater it is necessary to improve soil as a means of treating wastewater as well as to share knowledge about the impact of various wastewaters on physical biochemical and fertility profile of soil with the farming community ibekwe et al 2018 the untreated wastewater and sludge exhibit varying degree of trace metals and pollutants while these water resources can be used after sustainable treatment at a certain level for agriculture oil seed and fiber crops to meet demand from cooking oil and textile industry landscaping and afforestation schemes however it will open the doors for heavy metals to enter into soil plant ecosystem mateo sagasta et al 2013 farhadkhani et al 2018 the reuse of treated wastewater from the water sources like surface water groundwater and seawater salt water desalination should be well examined biological and biochemically before using it as a source of irrigation for field crops diaz sosa et al 2020 deh haghi et al 2020 reznik et al 2017 sewage wastewater irrigation may provide essential nutrients because it possesses these elements in its composition hussain and al dakheel 2015 hussain and al dakheel 2018 qadir and scott 2010 however persistent pollutants may accumulate in the water soil plant environment after wastewater irrigation and can enter in the food web cherfi et al 2015 however long term wastewater supply to agriculture is very harmful to the environment climate and human wellbeing kim et al 2015 trace metals can influence the target plant digestion photosynthesis and stomatal opening and other ecophysiological attributes parveen et al 2015 and can likewise influence microbial networks or cause harmfulness becerra castro et al 2015 the accessibility and portability of trace metals relying upon different

qureshi 2020 show that ingestion of substantial metals was very unique in various vegetables and were higher in leafy vegetables lettuce spinach than root and fruit vegetables such as tomatoes radish pakistan is a country with increasing population with food security issues and that s why soils are intensively cropped nevertheless there is a problem in food production because thousands of hectares of soil in pakistan are infertile jamal et al 2002 wheat satisfies nutritional and food needs of the pakistani people a number of studies reported the contamination of soil and vegetables following irrigation of soil with wastewater treated or untreated hussain et al 2019 however soil contamination and toxicity of heavy metals in food grain crops especially wheat are very scarce xue et al 2019 zhu et al 2011 wheat has been cultivated on several thousand hectares of irrigated and rainfed land but scarcity of fresh water resources is a major hurdle in its cultivation on a wide geographical area of pakistan khan et al 2021 mahmood et al 2020 several authors have recommended using treated wastewater tww as a vital source of irrigation for vegetables but information regarding the use of wastewater for cultivation of wheat are scarce xue et al 2019 huang et al 2008 meanwhile risks associated with the wastewater use in agriculture should be minimized via different means such as wastewater quality improvement controlling human exposure farm level wastewater management through appropriate crop selection and irrigation management these strategies can significantly help to minimize the risk and hazards of entry of heavy metals entry into terrestrial ecosystem system in pakistan understanding the significance of wastewater field study conducted to evaluate the advantages of utilizing metropolitan wastewater for wheat production crop development and yield traits potential trace elements and their associated bioaccumulation in soil and crop system was explored increasing fresh water demand for human consumption in pakistan has accelerated the use of non conventional water for agriculture and forestry the contamination caused by heavy metals not only damages the growth and yield of food crops water and soil ecology nevertheless hazardous to the human and animals health to improve wastewater quality and to avoid human exposure farm level wastewater management through appropriate product selection and irrigation management strategies can significantly help to minimize the risk of wastewater use in agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site sahiwal is a suburban agricultural town of sargodha district and is now a major hot spot of environmental concern due to pollution caused by sewage discharge fig 1 it is situated in

treatments fig 2 the bio concentration factor values of cd ni fe and mn being less than 1 0 indicates lower ni cd fe and mn concentration in grains which was in line with those found by li et al 2015 hussain and qureshi 2020 documented a significant difference in bcf among the target vegetables and fe exhibit higher bcf in lettuce while cr was lowest in eggplant similar results were documented by qureshi et al 2016 and khan et al 2017 several factors are responsible for heavy metals presence in the plant soil water environment such as atmospheric deposition manure from farm animals use of un treated wastewater or municipal water for irrigation herbicides pesticides and excessive use of phosphate based fertilizers woldetsadik et al 2017 el kady and abdel wahhab 2018 hussain et al 2020a 2020b the long term use of above practices can lead to the severe soil and environment contamination which can cause groundwater contamination and human health impact yang et al 2017 rai et al 2010 2018 hussain and qureshi 2020 4 2 pollution load index the soil contamination was evaluated through pollution load index pli tomlinson et al 1980 documented that a value of zero indicates no hazard while a value of one or more than one indicates a gradual increase in pollution due to un treated wastewater irrigation pli value for irrigated soils with different treatments has shown in table 6 all values were less than one and ranged from a minimum of 0 004 for zn in t i to a maximum of 2 04 for cd in t v pli zn and cd rated as the lowest and highest among the trace metals as for the average number of treatments cd and ni had the highest distribution in soil samples contamination sequence t i cd ni cu cr zn fe co zn in t ii the order was cd ni cu cr zn fe co zn while in t iii t iv and tv the order was cd ni cu cr zn fe co on cd ni cu cr zn fe co zn and cd ni cu cr zn fe co zn respectively table 6 4 3 daily intake of metal dim to assess the health risk of a contaminant we assessed the human exposure of each element through the pathways of the food chain here we assumed that the path of absorption of the studied metals is associated with the consumption of wheat grain meanwhile dim values were calculated based on the average consumption of wheat grains by the adults for adults the mean dim values for cd ni fe mn cu cr zn and co were 0 0071 0 0040 0 0045 0 0026 0 0089 0 0072 0 0138 and 0 0054 mg kg day respectively table 7 dim values in this study were less than the acceptable daily value the dim value was 1 indicating no risk to the human beings when consuming wheat flour or wheat products thus we can assume that the crops of wheat irrigated with sewage do not pose a danger to residents and consumers 4 4 health risk index assessing the human health risk by eating contaminated foods evaluated through proper procedures and protocol usepa united states environmental protection agency 2002 the hri is equally important for all countries particularly in those areas where wastewater operation left unattended if the hri of a particular nutrient was 1 it was believed to be safe for human consumption however if it 1 may pose a serious threat to human health usepa united states environmental protection agency 2002 the results of hri of the metals showed that the hri level for zinc is the highest and it was in the range of 4 611 50 45 in t i and t iv respectively table 8 it means it may pose a potential risk to human health via food consumption this was in line with findings of bansal and singh 2015 whom demonstrated that hri of zinc was higher in the tested food products the hri of cd in all treatments from t i to t v was found elevated than 1 and exceeds than allowable limits that might pose a threat to human health however hris of other metals was below than 1 ni fe mn cu cr and co and showed no danger to human health all of the examined vegetables had target hazard quotients thq for cu zn and fe that are less than one suggesting that they are relatively safe heavy metals had risk index ri values 1 0 indicating a lesser risk to humans hussain and qureshi 2020 4 5 enrichment factor the enrichment factor was calculated to assess the metal contamination cadmium possessed the highest enrichment rate in the soil samples table 9 the t 2 results showed the greatest value for ef with zn followed by cr and cd table 9 if the value of fe is 1 it highlight availability and distribution of metals in the contaminated soil while the lowest ef was observed in mn at t 1ii the trend of ef in the t 1 was co cu ni fe mn mean value of ef 1 indicates an increase in the accumulation of metal in the terrestrial plant species gupta et al 2018 in the present results the ef level was higher than 1 for zn cr and cd therefore it may cause risk of overcrowding of metals in the plants organs growing in the contaminated soil rhizosphere however lower baf value indicates that this risk does not apply to wheat 5 conclusion wheat can accumulate a substantial number of poisonous trace and hazardous elements in various plant tissues particularly in grains in addition to necessary nutrient elements as a result wheat is a vital cereal food grain crop that needs to be handled carefully to minimize any hazards associated with its consumption following irrigated with sewage water highest concentrations detected for cd in the wheat grains that were greater than fao limits that might be a risk for human through the consumption of contaminated foods dim was 1 that indicates a low risk to local inhabitants we came to the conclusion that the primary cause of metal buildup in wheat grains is irrigation with sewage wastewater which might led to serious health effects the hri values 1 observed higher for zn and cd while pli values were greater in zn cr and cd it offer a succinct summary of the current situation for food contamination and potential future health risk to the local population in order to prevent an excessive buildup of toxic metals in the plant soil water system and to safeguard the health of the local population it is urgently necessary to monitor the wastewater irrigation system in the study area declarations

9087,field surface temperature are essential input of an evapotranspiration et model crop canopy and soil surface temperatures t c and t s respectively are often mixed in the field surface temperature at early stages due to changes in crop growth and row and plant spacing to ensure the accuracy of et estimation the t c and t s at actual positions included in the field temperatures should be verified and optimized in this study the underlying field surface temperature data were determined from thermal infrared sensors through an automatic monitoring system these were screened and partitioned into actual t c and t s with an algorithm based on maize growth conditions the t c replaced the average temperature of field surface in the seguin itier s i model and the unified air temperature in shuttleworth wallace s w model was substituted by the air temperature t a t c and t s at actual positions field et estimated by the penman monteith model and the soil water balance model were also analyzed based on synchronous monitoring data of maize for comparison experimental data was collected over two years for three record periods within three areas in china these included zhongwei in ningxia autonomous region 2019 2020 changchun in jilin province 2018 2019 and jiefangzha in the inner mongolia autonomous region 2015 2016 results showed that the accuracy of estimating et in the s i model improved subsequent screening the temperature data with the average coefficient of determination and index of agreement increased by 0 13 and 0 08 respectively and the average of the root mean square error and relative error decreased by 0 10 mm d 1 and 2 5 respectively the key parameters a and b in s i model calibrated in early growth stage can be an alternative over application in whole season which can simplify calculations while maintaining accuracy the average values of a and b in the early stage and whole season were a 0 408 b 0 455 and a 0 856 b 0 498 in zhongwei a 0 898 b 0 913 and a 1 039 b 0 936 in changchun and a 0 736 b 0 328 and a 0 672 b 0 310 in jiefangzha respectively soil evaporation and canopy transpiration were estimated more precisely by the revised s w model through field temperature data partitioning the et estimated by the revised s w model is in line with the results from penman monteith model and soil water balance model moreover this study demonstrated that estimating et by s w or rs w model is easily influenced by weather conditions this research provides valuable insight into determination and application of the estimation of et using

land surface processes that defines the relationship between the land and atmosphere influencing the local weather and climate this is an important flux which connects water carbon and energy cycles yan et al 2012 holmes et al 2018 accurate estimation of field et is crucial to precision irrigation drought prediction sustainable management and distribution of water resources nyolei et al 2021 recently the combination of energy balance and aerodynamic component equations have undergone great improvements and widened et estimation applications previously et measurement techniques were costly and required complex physical principles allen et al 2011 the single layer penman monteith p m model depicts a canopy cover as a big leaf which is placed at a certain height within the canopy to estimate et allen et al 1998 2005 the p m model was recommended by food and agricultural organization fao and it has been widely utilized because it conforms to the principles of climatology and aerodynamics raziei and pereira 2013 valipour et al 2017 nyolei et al 2021 the accuracy of et estimation from the p m model relies upon the quality of input weather data accurate canopy representation r c and aerodynamic resistance r a gassmanna et al 2019 the single layer model is generally suitable for areas with a uniform and high degree of vegetation coverage one such model is the surface energy balance algorithm for land model proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 an empirical formula adjusts the temperature gap and iteratively calculates the fitting coefficient by using the surface radiation temperature and meteorological data temperature wind speed radiation and relative humidity under dry and wet conditions zwart et al 2007 rawat et al 2019 the surface energy balance system model has an enhanced process and is suitable for large scale heterogeneous surface composite terrain however its iterative calculations require accurate surface albedo and temperature values su 2002 webster et al 2017 the priestley taylor model is based on the equilibrium evaporation theory and simplifies the aerodynamic and vegetation resistance however the empirical coefficient in the model is one of the sources of uncertainty in et estimation priestley and taylor 1972 miralles et al 2011 although these models have a simple structure and require fewer parameters the underlying surface is complex and uneven which can cause an inaccurate estimation of et through field experiments jackson et al 1977 were the first to demonstrate that et rates directly correlate with the temperature difference between canopy t c and air t a the approach estimates daily crop et et d based on instantaneous canopy air temperature difference t c t a at approximately midday jackson et al 1981 subsequently seguin and itier 1983 simplified the input parameters by excluding the negligible contribution of soil heat flux and created the seguin itier s i model it has since been applied in many areas owing to its simple parameters and accuracy dunkel and szenyán 2000 rivas and carmona 2013 however the empirical parameters of the s i model are affected by wind speed and underlying surface conditions which need to be calibrated and verified before application in different regions huang et al 2019 the s i model uses t c which is obtained by assuming that the underlying surface conditions are uniform therefore the screening of temperature data affects the accuracy of et estimation the two layer model considers the effect of soil and vegetation on surface energy differences which enables the separation and individual simulation of soil evaporation es and canopy transpiration tr such as shuttleworth wallace s w model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 backward averaged iterative two source surface temperature and energy balance solution baitsss model dhungel et al 2016 and so on high resolution thermal imaging is required to directly identify soil and canopy temperatures in two sources model colaizzi et al 2012 gan and gao 2015 bellvert et al 2020 the baitsss model is a physical based et algorithm combining continuous gridded weather data and remote sensing based vegetation indices which was used to estimate and evaluate evapotranspiration in semi arid advection climate dhungel et al 2016 2019 surely some multi sources evapotranspiration models had been also developed to explore more accurate estimation with the assumption of even vegetation distributed on same surface and different distinguished canopy structures for example there were the dolman model dolman 1993 clumping model brenner and incoll 1997 four layer model choudhury and monteith 1988 and so on however these models have very complex structure and involved many parameters zhang et al 2008 and need precision calculation of relevant resistances and further verification for different locations and environments the s w model is a two layer model that considers the effect of soil and vegetation on surface energy differences combines tr and es by formulating different methods through which evaporative flux travels as resistances shuttleworth and wallace 1985 it introduced five resistance parameters to describe the turbulent diffusion processes of water vapor rising from the soil and vegetation layers to a reference height surface resistances were applied to regulate the transfer of energy from crops r s c and soil r s s additionally aerodynamic resistances of air crops and soil r a a r a c r a s respectively were used to regulate the transfer between the surface and atmosphere in the s w model iritz et al 1999 in sparsely vegetated areas large areas of exposed soil may cause a proportionally high value of es these areas include row crops and orchards crops in initial growth stages and sparsely vegetated natural environments kool et al 2014 therefore the s w model is used extensively for crops with a partial ground cover and providing acceptable results stannard 1993 although the s w model can estimate es and tr separately and with a higher accuracy recent studies have found that tr is overestimated and es is underestimated under certain soil surface resistance specific site conditions gong et al 2019 elfarkh et al 2020 research demonstrates that the accuracy of the model is impacted by the extinction coefficient weather conditions and different research areas nadine et al 1998 iritz et al 1999 hu et al 2013 chen et al 2015 bao et al 2021 the extinction coefficient affects the photosynthetic rate of leaves and canopy and is an important input parameter of crop growth model and canopy photosynthetic model hirose 2005 it is sensitive to environmental factors affected by crop species leaf area index irrigation regimes canopy structure and solar altitude angle etc and also affected the estimation of several canopy resistances kiniry et al 2010 amir et al 2016 bao et al 2021 therefore accurately representing parameters of the s w model is challenging when estimating et to optimize s w model parameters scholars have proposed various methods including introducing soil water content the bayesian method and improving the aerodynamic drag coefficient anadranistakis et al 2000 leuning et al 2008 zhu et al 2012 marek et al 2016 chen et al 2022 generally the temperature at different sites would vary and also be impacted by crop growth and leaf expansion neglecting temperature differences while estimating field et would reduce accuracy to calculate the es and tr in the s w model surface and aerodynamic resistances are considered separately and the different temperatures at different points should be taken into account temperature data must be precise to ensure an accurate estimation of et considering of their significant and typical characteristics the s i model single layer source few parameters and relatively simple to use and the s w model two layer sources more accurate estimation but complex resistance parameters were selected to evaluate and verify the performances in assessing et especially after the field temperature data screening results were then compared against the p m model and soil water balance swb model the study was based on the concurrent monitoring of maize the main objectives of this study were 1 to analyze the influence of temperature on the accuracy of s i model before and after data screening and assess the variations of key parameters in the model 2 to compare and verify the estimation of et in the s w model through field temperatures revised by data precision partitioning and 3 to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of estimated et by the s i and revised s w models 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources 2 1 1 overview of study areas this study used three experimental areas which are all mainly agriculture dominated by maize although they are in different regions they are all located north of 35 n in northern china fig 1 1 the areas include the zhongwei station 105 10 91 e 37 46 65 n and jiefangzha irrigation area 106 43 107 27 e 40 34 41 14 n in the yellow river basin the zhongwei station was a temperate continental climate and an average annual precipitation of 200 mm and average annual temperature is 8 8 jiang et al 2018 the jiefangzha irrigation area receives approximately 152 mm of annual precipitation with 70 of annual rainfall typically occurring from july to september and has a mean annual temperature of 9 c huang et al 2019 maize sowing date is always in the end of april to early may and harvest is in middle september both areas irrigate from the yellow river and are supplemented by groundwater which is at a depth of 0 6 2 8 m below surface during the crop growing season the third area is changchun station 125 19 8 e 43 38 40 n and is located in the song liao river basin it has a temperate monsoon climate with average annual temperature of 4 8 most of the precipitation occurs from june to september with average value between 520 and 755 mm gao et al 2019 the water table ranged between 2 6 4 2 m below surface during the research years maize is sown in early may and is harvested in the end of september to early october additionally fig 1 3 shows the variation of average soil water content 0 80 cm in the maize growing seasons this shows slight to zero water deficits compared with the average field capacity θ fc and wilting point θ wp in the crop root zone 0 80 cm in three regions 2 1 2 field monitoring data field data were recorded by the canopy temperature and meteorology monitoring systems ctms fig 1 2 and fig 2 which simultaneously monitor meteorological factors soil water content and crop canopy temperatures field measurements were recorded every 30 min including air temperature humidity and atmospheric pressure hmp60 vaisala finland wind speed 014mini metone usa solar radiation sp110 apogee usa photosynthetically active radiation sq110 apogee usa canopy temperature tpis 1 t 1252b germany and soil temperature and moisture at intervals of 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm of the crop root zone sm10d china on the field a cantilever was installed 0 6 m vertical rod on a rotating platform in the ctms and all sensors were placed 3 0 m above the ground level the rotating platform was able to scan multiple points of maize canopy temperature through a thermal infrared temperature sensor which forms at an angle of 45 with the horizontal line at the end of the cantilever detail seen in the left part of fig 2 subsequent to the experiments in the jiefangzha area 2015 2016 five sets of ctmss were moved from jiefangzha to changchun station for use 2018 2019 and four new sets of the ctmss were set up in field experiments zhongwei station 2019 2020 as shown in fig 1 2 all ctmss were placed in the middle of each maize field in the three regions soil water contents were recorded in each region by automated monitoring systems in situ at depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm in the crop root zone fig 1 2 soil samples were collected at weekly intervals to calibrate instrument measurement data crop canopy height h c leaf width w and leaf area index lai were surveyed manually every 7 10 days during the growing season may september changes in h c and lai for the three areas over the experimental period were shown in fig 1 4 precipitation p data were obtained from the datasets of china meteorological data networks https data cma cn and the groundwater level data were obtained from the local water conservancy bureau in addition the data obtained from instrument monitoring temperature of underlying surface of field air temperature relative humidity atmospheric pressure solar radiation wind speed soil water content temperature precipitation etc and manual measurements leaf area index canopy height groundwater depth etc were assessed with the method of mathematical statistics before data processing abnormal values were deleted and missing data were interpolated linearly by nearby measurements to ensure the quality and integrity of the field experimental data all of these data were tested by independent sample t test the p values of instrument monitoring data were all less than 0 01 while some manual measurement data were less than 0 05 2 1 3 data screening and partitioning for monitoring field temperatures field temperatures were monitored by the ctms concurrently including air temperature soil temperatures and scanning the canopy temperatures at 10 points for each interval time 30 min at a fixed angle 45 and at a reference height 3 0 m however the 10 recorded temperatures of the underlying surface would not necessarily represent the crop canopy or leaf temperature t c especially at the early growing stage sparse vegetation and scans may record the soil surface temperature t s instead of t c therefore data preprocessing needs to be carried out prior to et estimation the screening is implemented to distinguish the 10 scanned temperatures which are measured by the thermal infrared sensor into t c and t s the approach needs to be supported by the indices of the maize growth status such as h c and lai to determine whether these data should be screened or not if h c 1 5 m or lai 2 5 the 10 scanned temperatures measured were defaulted to leaf temperatures which was the average value of the canopy temperature when h c 1 5 m and lai 2 5 the situation of underlying surface was categorized as sparse vegetation therefore the data screening process was required the flow chart of the data screening process was shown in fig 3 first the standard deviation sd of the 10 scanned temperatures of the underlying surface were divided into four categories 1 if the sd 0 05 the average value of these data was used as the t c on the condition that the ctms was running well 2 if sd 1 and some 0 values occurred within the readings this scanning result was classified as rare and was discarded additionally the ctms required inspection for any problems 3 if 0 05 sd 0 1 the 10 scanned data values were stable which indicated that the maize was in a vigorous growth period the average value was used as the t c 4 when 0 1 sd 1 and with h c 1 5 m and lai 2 5 the screening process would be in the next step second an algorithm was used to screen and partition the mixed data of surface temperatures on sunny days the crop canopy and soil surface temperature were measured by a manual hand held thermometer and showed that t s is much greater than t c using the bsxfun function in matlab software https ww2 mathworks cn help matlab ref bsxfun html s tid srchtitle bsxfun 1 the data were inserted into a matrix and divided into two groups of t c and t s matrices using the average value of 10 scanned data routine optimization checks were performed and the data matrix of t c and t s was extracted and finally the temperatures of the actual crop canopy and soil surface were obtained data partitioning for monitoring field temperatures was used to ensure the correct temperature of each position for the surface resistance and aerodynamic resistance in the s w model for example r a c which is the boundary layer resistance in the crop canopy was revised and calculated using the exact temperature in the canopy norman et al 1995 colaizzi et al 2012 where most literature uses air temperature webber et al 2015 dorothee et al 2016 2 2 evapotranspiration models 2 2 1 penman monteith model the penman monteith model was used in this study to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration et o and single crop coefficient method et a compared as a standard result using the following allen et al 1998 1 e t o 0 408 δ rn g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn

calibrated a and b were determined the evapotranspiration would be estimated by the s i model eq 3 using observations in other years 2 2 3 shuttleworth wallace model and its improvements the shuttleworth wallace model assumes that the water vapor at the reference height is from both soil and vegetation layers surface and canopy resistance regulates the mass and heat transfer on soil and plant surfaces and aerodynamic resistance regulates those between the two surfaces and the atmospheric boundary layer expressed as follows shuttleworth and wallace 1985 6 λ e t s w λ es s w λ tr s w c

corsican pine and pinus nigra var in norfolk stannard 1993 on sparsely vegetated with greasewood rabbit brush and salt grass in southern colorado the values of a 1 a 2 and a 3 were recommended for sparse crops therefore for this study the maize a 1 a 2 and a 3 values were set as 0 8 0 02 and 200 respectively the model parameters of b 1 b 2 and b 3 were obtained from relevant studies to estimate r s s where b 1 was fixed at 3 5 based on the research of hu et al 2013 on forest and grassland in the chang bai mountains and qinghai tibet plateau respectively b 2 and b 3 were determined as 1 2 and 500 according to results from the meadow wetland ecosystem tongliao inner mongolia china by bao et al 2021 all main formulas and variables for the s w model are summarized in eqs 6 and 7 air temperature at a reference height was a clean sweep of the temperature variable required for all formulae however the resistances were subdivided into five categories using the ctms all temperatures t

the crop root zone between the water obtained gained and water consumed lost in a certain period the et can be estimated using a swb model et swb by measuring the components of the swb model with the formula given by allen et al 1998 9 et swb i p ro dp cr δ sf δ sw where i is the net irrigation depth in zhongwei 65 mm of water was irrigated at the beginning of june july and august in 2019 and 2020 in jiefangzha the irrigation under its main growing stages june august in 2015 and 2016 was obtained from the research of huang et al 2019 the maize fields in changchun were not irrigated precipitation p is shown in fig 1 3 for the main growth periods in the areas surface runoff ro is the part of i and p which may be lost dp is deep percolation if the θ in root zone is below θ fc the soil will not drain and dp 0 however ro and dp are difficult to assess and short periods cannot be used additionally daily changes were ignored in this study cr is capillary rise the amount of water transported to the root zone which depends on soil type water table depth and root zone wetness considering the differences in soil bulk density the clay content and initial soil water content can be ignored in the same field and the values were replaced by the k parameter therefore based on the daily change of groundwater depth gd the cr was calculated by the empirical formula of cr 597 k gd i 0 082 gd i 1 0 082 as per methodology by zhong et al 2018 the k values were calculated to be 1 83 and 1 98 in zhongwei and jiefangzha respectively the perennial groundwater level exceeds 2 6 m in the changchun area and therefore the influence of cr was ignored in this study the δsf is the variation in subsurface flow which was assumed to be zero owing to the flat topography the δsw is the daily variation in soil water content which was calculated using observed values from a moisture meter installed in each area fig 1 3 2 3 statistical evaluation the coefficient of determination r 2 describes the degree of collinearity between the model and standard values and also indicates the level of variation in given data set the value of the index of agreement d was between 0 and 1 where 1 means a prefect agreement between the predicted and measured values the root mean square error rmse is a statistical test of error indicators that define the correspondence between the predicted and measured values additionally relative error re is used to quantify the difference between the model predictions and measurements which can reflect the reliability of the measurement calculation

model through data screening 3 1 1 performance of key parameters of a and b in the s i model by means of a data screening process observed field temperatures measured by the infrared sensor of the ctms can be distinguished as actual t c and t s subsequently the key parameters of a and b in the s i model can be calibrated through the linear regression between t c t a and et a rn where the et a is calculated using p m model in this study data in the first year were used for the calibrations in the three areas these were shown in fig 4 zhongwei in 2019 fig 5 changchun in 2018 and fig 6 jiefangzha in 2015 identification of the characteristics and changes of a and was performed using two cases of linear regression in the early growth stage june and whole stage june august two cases were assessed before and after data screening scatter plots were shown in fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 which show that extreme values of t c t a decrease after temperature data screening in the early and whole stages the maximum values of the data after screening red and green points were smaller than those of the data before screening black and blue points and have shorter fitting lines the extreme value of t c t a in zhongwei decreased from 14 to 8 with a descend range of 6 the t c t a was strongly affected by weather conditions especially in areas such as changchun where the rainfall is period corresponds with the growing season of the crop the decrease in temperature reached 5 after the temperature data screening the maximum value of t c t a in jiefangzha was 16 c in the early stage owing to the high soil surface temperature in the sensor scanning however after screening it dropped to 8 c which was similar to zhongwei this demonstrates that the process of data screening can effectively separate the scanning records into t c and t s it is also consistent with the results of previous studies which show that the best performance is at 13 00 accompanied by the highest value of r 2 during the day the plot fitting lines for the early and whole stages were more similar after temperature data screening red and green lines especially at 12 00 14 00 this was further displayed by the fitting formulae which show close values of a and b and increasing values of r 2 this novel approach shows that the calibrated values of a and b in early crop stages can be used to directly estimate et in the s i model as opposed to obtaining it after a whole growth season to investigate the features and variations of a and b in the s i model fig 7 summarizes the values from 10 00 16 00 for one day before and after the screening process it shows that b is always at a stable negative value near the average values in early and whole stages and both before and after data screening however variations of a are a slightly larger the a values were positive in zhongwei and changchun but negative in jiefangzha an a value peak always showed close to 13 00 particularly after the screening process this could mean that the calibrated parameters were more applicable for this time of day in summary the values of a and b in each area could be reasonably obtained using the average value between 10 00 and 16 00 3 1 2 verification and accuracy evaluation of s i model in section 3 1 1 it was concluded that the key parameters of a and b in the s i model are close after the data screening process and the fitted lines are very similar in both early stage and whole growth season here the two sets of a and b calibrated in both cases were used to estimate et d of the s i model using observed data from zhongwei in 2020 changchun in 2019 and jiefangzha in 2016 these were the average values of a and b after screening fig 7 the values of a and b in the early and whole stages were a 0 408 b 0 455 and a 0 856 b 0 498 in zhongwei a 0 898 b 0 913 and a 1 039 b 0 936 in changchun and a 0 736 b 0 328 and a 0 672 b 0 310 in jiefangzha to evaluate the performance of the s i model every group of et d was compared with et swb the statistical parameters of r 2 d rmse and re for et d and et swb are listed in table 2 additionally table 2 shows the results of et d at 13 00 which were estimated in best state compared with the calculated et swb in one day this is applicable for the pair of a and b calibrated from both early stage and whole stages in all three areas after temperature screening all statistical parameters improved the average of r 2 and d increased by 0 13 and 0 08 respectively and the average of rmse and re decreased by 0 10 mm d 1 and 2 5 the r 2 d rmse and re values showed a negligible difference from the two sets of a and b from early and whole stages especially in jiefangzha this indicated that the key parameters of a and b calibrated by field observations in the early stage could be applied directly in real time this could simplify the calculation process while maintaining the calculation accuracy to obtain an objective evaluation of the best performance time at 13 00 the calibrated a and b at 13 00 fig 7 were selected to estimate the et d and then compared with the et swb table 3 the data in table 2 at 13 00 shows a slight improvement in r 2 d rmse and re additionally the values at the start and end of each day are not as accurate as those at noon in fact field weather conditions experience more instability in the morning and evening for example a gust of wind or large changes in temperature with more stable conditions at approximately noon however the time limitation could offset this improvement when the method is applied in practice as it would be challenging to ensure consistency regarding precision irrigation management at the site field level the average values of calibrated a and b should still be a more suitable choice the average values of calibrated a and b would be more precise in estimating et when monitoring each hour within the day and the selection of coefficients for 13 00 12 00 14 00 must also show a high quality when only observing the observation in this time 3 2 evaluation of rs w model using precision partitioning of field temperature data 3 2 1 performances of rs w model during maize growth seasons according to fig 2 t c t s and t a can be obtained and distinguished using precision partitioning of field temperature data to calculate the resistances required subsequently the es s w tr s w et s w and es rs w tr rs w et rs w can be estimated using the s w model eq 6 eq 7 and the revised s w model eq 7 eq 8 respectively figs 8 9 and 10 showed the comparisons of es tr and et estimated from the s w and the revised s w models including daily relative errors during the growing season for the three areas the precision partitioning process of the maize field temperatures makes it possible to distinguish t s and t c this lead to larger values for es rs w than es s w especially during the early growth stages june and tr rs w was slightly less than tr s w in the whole growing season july august figs 8 9 10 a b e f this indicated that the resistances of the soil and vegetation layers could be calculated more accurately with the temperature at their positions specifically for the coefficients of r s and r c in eq 8 in the early stage the es rs w was es half of the total et and had an increasing percentage around 5 in et rs w in zhongwei and jiefangzha areas however the changchun area showed a ratio of es rs w et rs w which reached 90 and changed slightly in june compared with es s w et s w this is partially because the phenological phase of maize occurs later than in other regions with smaller lai during this period fig 1 4 when the early stage of june is extended to mid july the ratio of es rs w et rs w decreases sharply to 60 fig 9a e comparing the total et during the whole growth seasons figs 8 9 10 c g the et rs w was very close to the et s w however there were some differences in the early stage with an average value of rmse of 0 151 0 240 and 0 180 mm d 1 for zhongwei changchun and jiefangzha respectively all differences can be seen in fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 d h including the daily relative error owing to the revised s w model es and tr can be estimated with high precision than previously the reasons for a difference in et are due to the increase in es rs w and the decrease in tr rs w accompanied by the generally negative re of tr rs w and those positive values for es rs w the et rs w were often slightly larger than et s w in early stages positive re and lower perhaps underestimated in the following seasons negative re 3 2 2 accuracy evaluation of the rs w model to evaluate the accuracy of rs w model the values of et a determined by single crop coefficient of the p m model and et swb determined by the swb model were calculated during the maize growth seasons based on field observations at the time fig 11 shows the comparative changes of et rs w et s w et a and et swb with their characteristic values mean median minimum and maximum for each experimental year in the three areas the changing trend shows that the actual evapotranspiration estimated by the p m model et a was lowest in the early stage and largest in the following seasons among the four kinds of evapotranspiration especially in zhongwei and changchun this may be the principle of big leaf from the p m model which ignores or underestimates the es in the initial stage of crop growth while overestimating tr during the latter periods however owing to the swb model the et s w shows a temporal hysteresis occurred in the response to daily field situation causing individual variation when precipitation was higher during the crop growing seasons fig 1 3 the et rs w and et s w were close to the et a such as in 2019 in changchun fig 11 g while the et swb was smaller fig 11 shows boxplots of the et rs w and et s w values which were always between those of et a and et swb the maximum was generally closer to the et a and the average were closer to those of et swb these indicated that the performances of et rs w and et s w were well aligned with et swb fig 11 also shows the results of the rmses between et rs w et s w and et a et swb in early stage june and the following seasons july august generally the rmse values which were between et rs w et swb and et s w et swb were smaller than these of et rs w et a and et s w et a whether in early or later stages however in the early stage in zhongwei 2019 and in july to august in changchun 2019 more precipitation occurred in these periods when checked against the field situations fig 1 3 therefore the et s w and et rs w would be closer to et a if the local weather conditions were exposed to additional precipitation the et rs w rmse values were always lower than et s w when compared with et a or et swb which indicated that the et was more accurately estimated in the rs w model generally the precision data partitioning of temperatures improved the accuracy of field et estimation owing to the calculation of each resistance of soil and vegetation layers 4 discussion 4 1 key parameters of a and b in the s i model the b parameter in the s i model is defined as the mean change coefficient weighted by the rn rs ratio which expresses the relative contribution of midday net radiation to the whole day s solar radioactive exchange seguin and itier 1983 based on a single layer approach vidal and perrier 1989 found that b increases with an increase in surface roughness carlson and buffum 1989 used a complex planetary boundary layer model to study the response of b for a range of surface roughness wind speed and vegetation conditions researchers have measured and predicted b values under various roughness circumstances seguin and itier 1983 riou et al 1988 lagouarde et al 1991 carlson et al 1995 in this study the values of b were calibrated hourly from 10 00 16 00 fig 7 the trend of b was reasonably steady based on the local long term experiments in the three areas eq 3 was an improvement on the original equation presented by seguin and itier 1983 where it changed the surface temperature to t c therefore the results from before and after data screening should agree with the calculations from the original s i model and the eq 3 respectively the values of b were more stable from 10 00 16 00 fig 7 before the t s and t c screening data screening created varying b values which decreased during the day the values also decreased during the data screening process however the verification results in tables 2 and 3 show that the average b values during 10 00 16 00 are still the optimum choice for estimating daily et in the s i model rather than the value at 13 00 the research of a parameter in the s i model is minimal because of its weak change rule and high volatility especially within different regions the errors of a may come from the soil heat flux and the absence of the actual synchronized value of t c t a however with the inclusion of ctms monitoring in this research many environmental factors were obtained concurrently in field fig 7 shows that the absolute values of a in the early stage were smaller than those in the whole growing seasons which indicated that the influence of ignoring the soil heat flux was existed in the early stage however the values were in line with the net radiation including the highest value at midday additionally wind speed varies throughout the day which may impact the et process causing the a peak therefore the selection of a daily average value of a would reduce when influenced by these uncertain factors 4 2 application of the s w and rs w models considerable efforts have been put into correcting the parameters in the s w model in this study t c and t s were also quoted in the rs w model in place of the s w model values on the basis of the original air temperature considered fig 2 as shown in fig 8 a b c e f g fig 9 a b c e f g and fig 10 a b c e f g the differences between them were in es rs w es s w in the early stage tr rs w tr s w in following stages and et rs w et s w over the whole growing season during the whole growth period the total soil evaporation accounted for 25 of et and subsequently declined as the canopy coverage increased gong et al 2019 it was also found that the s w model estimated tr accurately when lai was 0 5 2 5 but it was significantly overestimated in the middle stage this is consistent with the results of this study in the early stage crop canopy temperature may be overestimated leading to an overestimation of the available energy intercepted by the canopy due to the weak ability for crops to regulate their own temperature as well as the effected of air temperature hence through the precision temperature partitioning process solving the problem of underestimation es in the early stage and overestimation tr in the middle and later periods is beneficial to improve field et accuracy juhász and hrotkó 2014 compared the tr generated by the s w model with that measured by a stem flow meter on a cherry tree results showed that the simulated results were unsatisfactory in cloudy and rainy weather conditions which is consistent with the findings of this study fig 11 it demonstrates that estimating et by the s w or rs w model is easily influenced by weather conditions the t c and t s were used to adjust temperature dependent water vapor pressure values in this study the t c t a is a useful tool for prediction and consequently early warning for droughts 5 conclusions the major conclusions of this study are i the average values of key parameters a and b during 10 00 16 00 is the optimal choice for estimating daily et in the s i model rather than the value corresponding with 13 00 after field temperatures were distinguished in t s and t c using the ctms data in the screening process the accuracy of et was partially improved upon compared with the et calculated from the soil water balance equation ii the a and b parameters calibrated by field observations in the early stage can be applied directly rather than after the whole growing season which can simplify calculations while maintaining accuracy iii the revised shuttleworth wallace model presented here showed that the resistances of soil and vegetation layers can improve accuracy by using the temperature through precision partitioning of field temperature data this revision also provided a more accurate estimation of soil evaporation and canopy transpiration iv the et rs w is lower than the et swb when concentrated or substantial precipitation occurred while the general trend of et rs w is in line with that of et a during sunny day weather conditions throughout the growing season v this study provides valuable

9087,field surface temperature are essential input of an evapotranspiration et model crop canopy and soil surface temperatures t c and t s respectively are often mixed in the field surface temperature at early stages due to changes in crop growth and row and plant spacing to ensure the accuracy of et estimation the t c and t s at actual positions included in the field temperatures should be verified and optimized in this study the underlying field surface temperature data were determined from thermal infrared sensors through an automatic monitoring system these were screened and partitioned into actual t c and t s with an algorithm based on maize growth conditions the t c replaced the average temperature of field surface in the seguin itier s i model and the unified air temperature in shuttleworth wallace s w model was substituted by the air temperature t a t c and t s at actual positions field et estimated by the penman monteith model and the soil water balance model were also analyzed based on synchronous monitoring data of maize for comparison experimental data was collected over two years for three record periods within three areas in china these included zhongwei in ningxia autonomous region 2019 2020 changchun in jilin province 2018 2019 and jiefangzha in the inner mongolia autonomous region 2015 2016 results showed that the accuracy of estimating et in the s i model improved subsequent screening the temperature data with the average coefficient of determination and index of agreement increased by 0 13 and 0 08 respectively and the average of the root mean square error and relative error decreased by 0 10 mm d 1 and 2 5 respectively the key parameters a and b in s i model calibrated in early growth stage can be an alternative over application in whole season which can simplify calculations while maintaining accuracy the average values of a and b in the early stage and whole season were a 0 408 b 0 455 and a 0 856 b 0 498 in zhongwei a 0 898 b 0 913 and a 1 039 b 0 936 in changchun and a 0 736 b 0 328 and a 0 672 b 0 310 in jiefangzha respectively soil evaporation and canopy transpiration were estimated more precisely by the revised s w model through field temperature data partitioning the et estimated by the revised s w model is in line with the results from penman monteith model and soil water balance model moreover this study demonstrated that estimating et by s w or rs w model is easily influenced by weather conditions this research provides valuable insight into determination and application of the estimation of et using

land surface processes that defines the relationship between the land and atmosphere influencing the local weather and climate this is an important flux which connects water carbon and energy cycles yan et al 2012 holmes et al 2018 accurate estimation of field et is crucial to precision irrigation drought prediction sustainable management and distribution of water resources nyolei et al 2021 recently the combination of energy balance and aerodynamic component equations have undergone great improvements and widened et estimation applications previously et measurement techniques were costly and required complex physical principles allen et al 2011 the single layer penman monteith p m model depicts a canopy cover as a big leaf which is placed at a certain height within the canopy to estimate et allen et al 1998 2005 the p m model was recommended by food and agricultural organization fao and it has been widely utilized because it conforms to the principles of climatology and aerodynamics raziei and pereira 2013 valipour et al 2017 nyolei et al 2021 the accuracy of et estimation from the p m model relies upon the quality of input weather data accurate canopy representation r c and aerodynamic resistance r a gassmanna et al 2019 the single layer model is generally suitable for areas with a uniform and high degree of vegetation coverage one such model is the surface energy balance algorithm for land model proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 an empirical formula adjusts the temperature gap and iteratively calculates the fitting coefficient by using the surface radiation temperature and meteorological data temperature wind speed radiation and relative humidity under dry and wet conditions zwart et al 2007 rawat et al 2019 the surface energy balance system model has an enhanced process and is suitable for large scale heterogeneous surface composite terrain however its iterative calculations require accurate surface albedo and temperature values su 2002 webster et al 2017 the priestley taylor model is based on the equilibrium evaporation theory and simplifies the aerodynamic and vegetation resistance however the empirical coefficient in the model is one of the sources of uncertainty in et estimation priestley and taylor 1972 miralles et al 2011 although these models have a simple structure and require fewer parameters the underlying surface is complex and uneven which can cause an inaccurate estimation of et through field experiments jackson et al 1977 were the first to demonstrate that et rates directly correlate with the temperature difference between canopy t c and air t a the approach estimates daily crop et et d based on instantaneous canopy air temperature difference t c t a at approximately midday jackson et al 1981 subsequently seguin and itier 1983 simplified the input parameters by excluding the negligible contribution of soil heat flux and created the seguin itier s i model it has since been applied in many areas owing to its simple parameters and accuracy dunkel and szenyán 2000 rivas and carmona 2013 however the empirical parameters of the s i model are affected by wind speed and underlying surface conditions which need to be calibrated and verified before application in different regions huang et al 2019 the s i model uses t c which is obtained by assuming that the underlying surface conditions are uniform therefore the screening of temperature data affects the accuracy of et estimation the two layer model considers the effect of soil and vegetation on surface energy differences which enables the separation and individual simulation of soil evaporation es and canopy transpiration tr such as shuttleworth wallace s w model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 backward averaged iterative two source surface temperature and energy balance solution baitsss model dhungel et al 2016 and so on high resolution thermal imaging is required to directly identify soil and canopy temperatures in two sources model colaizzi et al 2012 gan and gao 2015 bellvert et al 2020 the baitsss model is a physical based et algorithm combining continuous gridded weather data and remote sensing based vegetation indices which was used to estimate and evaluate evapotranspiration in semi arid advection climate dhungel et al 2016 2019 surely some multi sources evapotranspiration models had been also developed to explore more accurate estimation with the assumption of even vegetation distributed on same surface and different distinguished canopy structures for example there were the dolman model dolman 1993 clumping model brenner and incoll 1997 four layer model choudhury and monteith 1988 and so on however these models have very complex structure and involved many parameters zhang et al 2008 and need precision calculation of relevant resistances and further verification for different locations and environments the s w model is a two layer model that considers the effect of soil and vegetation on surface energy differences combines tr and es by formulating different methods through which evaporative flux travels as resistances shuttleworth and wallace 1985 it introduced five resistance parameters to describe the turbulent diffusion processes of water vapor rising from the soil and vegetation layers to a reference height surface resistances were applied to regulate the transfer of energy from crops r s c and soil r s s additionally aerodynamic resistances of air crops and soil r a a r a c r a s respectively were used to regulate the transfer between the surface and atmosphere in the s w model iritz et al 1999 in sparsely vegetated areas large areas of exposed soil may cause a proportionally high value of es these areas include row crops and orchards crops in initial growth stages and sparsely vegetated natural environments kool et al 2014 therefore the s w model is used extensively for crops with a partial ground cover and providing acceptable results stannard 1993 although the s w model can estimate es and tr separately and with a higher accuracy recent studies have found that tr is overestimated and es is underestimated under certain soil surface resistance specific site conditions gong et al 2019 elfarkh et al 2020 research demonstrates that the accuracy of the model is impacted by the extinction coefficient weather conditions and different research areas nadine et al 1998 iritz et al 1999 hu et al 2013 chen et al 2015 bao et al 2021 the extinction coefficient affects the photosynthetic rate of leaves and canopy and is an important input parameter of crop growth model and canopy photosynthetic model hirose 2005 it is sensitive to environmental factors affected by crop species leaf area index irrigation regimes canopy structure and solar altitude angle etc and also affected the estimation of several canopy resistances kiniry et al 2010 amir et al 2016 bao et al 2021 therefore accurately representing parameters of the s w model is challenging when estimating et to optimize s w model parameters scholars have proposed various methods including introducing soil water content the bayesian method and improving the aerodynamic drag coefficient anadranistakis et al 2000 leuning et al 2008 zhu et al 2012 marek et al 2016 chen et al 2022 generally the temperature at different sites would vary and also be impacted by crop growth and leaf expansion neglecting temperature differences while estimating field et would reduce accuracy to calculate the es and tr in the s w model surface and aerodynamic resistances are considered separately and the different temperatures at different points should be taken into account temperature data must be precise to ensure an accurate estimation of et considering of their significant and typical characteristics the s i model single layer source few parameters and relatively simple to use and the s w model two layer sources more accurate estimation but complex resistance parameters were selected to evaluate and verify the performances in assessing et especially after the field temperature data screening results were then compared against the p m model and soil water balance swb model the study was based on the concurrent monitoring of maize the main objectives of this study were 1 to analyze the influence of temperature on the accuracy of s i model before and after data screening and assess the variations of key parameters in the model 2 to compare and verify the estimation of et in the s w model through field temperatures revised by data precision partitioning and 3 to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of estimated et by the s i and revised s w models 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources 2 1 1 overview of study areas this study used three experimental areas which are all mainly agriculture dominated by maize although they are in different regions they are all located north of 35 n in northern china fig 1 1 the areas include the zhongwei station 105 10 91 e 37 46 65 n and jiefangzha irrigation area 106 43 107 27 e 40 34 41 14 n in the yellow river basin the zhongwei station was a temperate continental climate and an average annual precipitation of 200 mm and average annual temperature is 8 8 jiang et al 2018 the jiefangzha irrigation area receives approximately 152 mm of annual precipitation with 70 of annual rainfall typically occurring from july to september and has a mean annual temperature of 9 c huang et al 2019 maize sowing date is always in the end of april to early may and harvest is in middle september both areas irrigate from the yellow river and are supplemented by groundwater which is at a depth of 0 6 2 8 m below surface during the crop growing season the third area is changchun station 125 19 8 e 43 38 40 n and is located in the song liao river basin it has a temperate monsoon climate with average annual temperature of 4 8 most of the precipitation occurs from june to september with average value between 520 and 755 mm gao et al 2019 the water table ranged between 2 6 4 2 m below surface during the research years maize is sown in early may and is harvested in the end of september to early october additionally fig 1 3 shows the variation of average soil water content 0 80 cm in the maize growing seasons this shows slight to zero water deficits compared with the average field capacity θ fc and wilting point θ wp in the crop root zone 0 80 cm in three regions 2 1 2 field monitoring data field data were recorded by the canopy temperature and meteorology monitoring systems ctms fig 1 2 and fig 2 which simultaneously monitor meteorological factors soil water content and crop canopy temperatures field measurements were recorded every 30 min including air temperature humidity and atmospheric pressure hmp60 vaisala finland wind speed 014mini metone usa solar radiation sp110 apogee usa photosynthetically active radiation sq110 apogee usa canopy temperature tpis 1 t 1252b germany and soil temperature and moisture at intervals of 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm of the crop root zone sm10d china on the field a cantilever was installed 0 6 m vertical rod on a rotating platform in the ctms and all sensors were placed 3 0 m above the ground level the rotating platform was able to scan multiple points of maize canopy temperature through a thermal infrared temperature sensor which forms at an angle of 45 with the horizontal line at the end of the cantilever detail seen in the left part of fig 2 subsequent to the experiments in the jiefangzha area 2015 2016 five sets of ctmss were moved from jiefangzha to changchun station for use 2018 2019 and four new sets of the ctmss were set up in field experiments zhongwei station 2019 2020 as shown in fig 1 2 all ctmss were placed in the middle of each maize field in the three regions soil water contents were recorded in each region by automated monitoring systems in situ at depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm in the crop root zone fig 1 2 soil samples were collected at weekly intervals to calibrate instrument measurement data crop canopy height h c leaf width w and leaf area index lai were surveyed manually every 7 10 days during the growing season may september changes in h c and lai for the three areas over the experimental period were shown in fig 1 4 precipitation p data were obtained from the datasets of china meteorological data networks https data cma cn and the groundwater level data were obtained from the local water conservancy bureau in addition the data obtained from instrument monitoring temperature of underlying surface of field air temperature relative humidity atmospheric pressure solar radiation wind speed soil water content temperature precipitation etc and manual measurements leaf area index canopy height groundwater depth etc were assessed with the method of mathematical statistics before data processing abnormal values were deleted and missing data were interpolated linearly by nearby measurements to ensure the quality and integrity of the field experimental data all of these data were tested by independent sample t test the p values of instrument monitoring data were all less than 0 01 while some manual measurement data were less than 0 05 2 1 3 data screening and partitioning for monitoring field temperatures field temperatures were monitored by the ctms concurrently including air temperature soil temperatures and scanning the canopy temperatures at 10 points for each interval time 30 min at a fixed angle 45 and at a reference height 3 0 m however the 10 recorded temperatures of the underlying surface would not necessarily represent the crop canopy or leaf temperature t c especially at the early growing stage sparse vegetation and scans may record the soil surface temperature t s instead of t c therefore data preprocessing needs to be carried out prior to et estimation the screening is implemented to distinguish the 10 scanned temperatures which are measured by the thermal infrared sensor into t c and t s the approach needs to be supported by the indices of the maize growth status such as h c and lai to determine whether these data should be screened or not if h c 1 5 m or lai 2 5 the 10 scanned temperatures measured were defaulted to leaf temperatures which was the average value of the canopy temperature when h c 1 5 m and lai 2 5 the situation of underlying surface was categorized as sparse vegetation therefore the data screening process was required the flow chart of the data screening process was shown in fig 3 first the standard deviation sd of the 10 scanned temperatures of the underlying surface were divided into four categories 1 if the sd 0 05 the average value of these data was used as the t c on the condition that the ctms was running well 2 if sd 1 and some 0 values occurred within the readings this scanning result was classified as rare and was discarded additionally the ctms required inspection for any problems 3 if 0 05 sd 0 1 the 10 scanned data values were stable which indicated that the maize was in a vigorous growth period the average value was used as the t c 4 when 0 1 sd 1 and with h c 1 5 m and lai 2 5 the screening process would be in the next step second an algorithm was used to screen and partition the mixed data of surface temperatures on sunny days the crop canopy and soil surface temperature were measured by a manual hand held thermometer and showed that t s is much greater than t c using the bsxfun function in matlab software https ww2 mathworks cn help matlab ref bsxfun html s tid srchtitle bsxfun 1 the data were inserted into a matrix and divided into two groups of t c and t s matrices using the average value of 10 scanned data routine optimization checks were performed and the data matrix of t c and t s was extracted and finally the temperatures of the actual crop canopy and soil surface were obtained data partitioning for monitoring field temperatures was used to ensure the correct temperature of each position for the surface resistance and aerodynamic resistance in the s w model for example r a c which is the boundary layer resistance in the crop canopy was revised and calculated using the exact temperature in the canopy norman et al 1995 colaizzi et al 2012 where most literature uses air temperature webber et al 2015 dorothee et al 2016 2 2 evapotranspiration models 2 2 1 penman monteith model the penman monteith model was used in this study to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration et o and single crop coefficient method et a compared as a standard result using the following allen et al 1998 1 e t o 0 408 δ rn g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn

that a crop can extract from the root zone without suffering water stress when d r raw then k s 1 the total available water in the root zone is the difference between the θ fc and θ wp after the calibrated a and b were determined the evapotranspiration would be estimated by the s i model eq 3 using observations in other years 2 2 3 shuttleworth wallace model and its improvements the shuttleworth wallace model assumes that the water vapor at the reference height is from both soil and vegetation layers surface and canopy resistance regulates the mass and heat transfer on soil and plant surfaces and aerodynamic resistance regulates those between the two surfaces and the atmospheric boundary layer expressed as follows shuttleworth and wallace 1985 6 λ e t s w λ es s w λ tr s w c

corsican pine and pinus nigra var in norfolk stannard 1993 on sparsely vegetated with greasewood rabbit brush and salt grass in southern colorado the values of a 1 a 2 and a 3 were recommended for sparse crops therefore for this study the maize a 1 a 2 and a 3 values were set as 0 8 0 02 and 200 respectively the model parameters of b 1 b 2 and b 3 were obtained from relevant studies to estimate r s s where b 1 was fixed at 3 5 based on the research of hu et al 2013 on forest and grassland in the chang bai mountains and qinghai tibet plateau respectively b 2 and b 3 were determined as 1 2 and 500 according to results from the meadow wetland ecosystem tongliao inner mongolia china by bao et al 2021 all main formulas and variables for the s w model are summarized in eqs 6 and 7 air temperature at a reference height was a clean sweep of the temperature variable required for all formulae however the resistances were subdivided into five categories using the ctms all temperatures t

the crop root zone between the water obtained gained and water consumed lost in a certain period the et can be estimated using a swb model et swb by measuring the components of the swb model with the formula given by allen et al 1998 9 et swb i p ro dp cr δ sf δ sw where i is the net irrigation depth in zhongwei 65 mm of water was irrigated at the beginning of june july and august in 2019 and 2020 in jiefangzha the irrigation under its main growing stages june august in 2015 and 2016 was obtained from the research of huang et al 2019 the maize fields in changchun were not irrigated precipitation p is shown in fig 1 3 for the main growth periods in the areas surface runoff ro is the part of i and p which may be lost dp is deep percolation if the θ in root zone is below θ fc the soil will not drain and dp 0 however ro and dp are difficult to assess and short periods cannot be used additionally daily changes were ignored in this study cr is capillary rise the amount of water transported to the root zone which depends on soil type water table depth and root zone wetness considering the differences in soil bulk density the clay content and initial soil water content can be ignored in the same field and the values were replaced by the k parameter therefore based on the daily change of groundwater depth gd the cr was calculated by the empirical formula of cr 597 k gd i 0 082 gd i 1 0 082 as per methodology by zhong et al 2018 the k values were calculated to be 1 83 and 1 98 in zhongwei and jiefangzha respectively the perennial groundwater level exceeds 2 6 m in the changchun area and therefore the influence of cr was ignored in this study the δsf is the variation in subsurface flow which was assumed to be zero owing to the flat topography the δsw is the daily variation in soil water content which was calculated using observed values from a moisture meter installed in each area fig 1 3 2 3 statistical evaluation the coefficient of determination r 2 describes the degree of collinearity between the model and standard values and also indicates the level of variation in given data set the value of the index of agreement d was between 0 and 1 where 1 means a prefect agreement between the predicted and measured values the root mean square error rmse is a statistical test of error indicators that define the correspondence between the predicted and measured values additionally relative error re is used to quantify the difference between the model predictions and measurements which can reflect the reliability of the measurement calculation

samples p i and o i were the predicted and measured values of the model on day i respectively i 1 2 n o was the average of the measured values 3 results 3 1 evaluation and verification of the s i model through data screening 3 1 1 performance of key parameters of a and b in the s i model by means of a data screening process observed field temperatures measured by the infrared sensor of the ctms can be distinguished as actual t c and t s subsequently the key parameters of a and b in the s i model can be calibrated through the linear regression between t c t a and et a rn where the et a is calculated using p m model in this study data in the first year were used for the calibrations in the three areas these were shown in fig 4 zhongwei in 2019 fig 5 changchun in 2018 and fig 6 jiefangzha in 2015 identification of the characteristics and changes of a and was performed using two cases of linear regression in the early growth stage june and whole stage june august two cases were assessed before and after data screening scatter plots were shown in fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 which show that extreme values of t c t a decrease after temperature data screening in the early and whole stages the maximum values of the data after screening red and green points were smaller than those of the data before screening black and blue points and have shorter fitting lines the extreme value of t c t a in zhongwei decreased from 14 to 8 with a descend range of 6 the t c t a was strongly affected by weather conditions especially in areas such as changchun where the rainfall is period corresponds with the growing season of the crop the decrease in temperature reached 5 after the temperature data screening the maximum value of t c t a in jiefangzha was 16 c in the early stage owing to the high soil surface temperature in the sensor scanning however after screening it dropped to 8 c which was similar to zhongwei this demonstrates that the process of data screening can effectively separate the scanning records into t c and t s it is also consistent with the results of previous studies which show that the best performance is at 13 00 accompanied by the highest value of r 2 during the day the plot fitting lines for the early and whole stages were more similar after temperature data screening red and green lines especially at 12 00 14 00 this was further displayed by the fitting formulae which show close values of a and b and increasing values of r 2 this novel approach shows that the calibrated values of a and b in early crop stages can be used to directly estimate et in the s i model as opposed to obtaining it after a whole growth season to investigate the features and variations of a and b in the s i model fig 7 summarizes the values from 10 00 16 00 for one day before and after the screening process it shows that b is always at a stable negative value near the average values in early and whole stages and both before and after data screening however variations of a are a slightly larger the a values were positive in zhongwei and changchun but negative in jiefangzha an a value peak always showed close to 13 00 particularly after the screening process this could mean that the calibrated parameters were more applicable for this time of day in summary the values of a and b in each area could be reasonably obtained using the average value between 10 00 and 16 00 3 1 2 verification and accuracy evaluation of s i model in section 3 1 1 it was concluded that the key parameters of a and b in the s i model are close after the data screening process and the fitted lines are very similar in both early stage and whole growth season here the two sets of a and b calibrated in both cases were used to estimate et d of the s i model using observed data from zhongwei in 2020 changchun in 2019 and jiefangzha in 2016 these were the average values of a and b after screening fig 7 the values of a and b in the early and whole stages were a 0 408 b 0 455 and a 0 856 b 0 498 in zhongwei a 0 898 b 0 913 and a 1 039 b 0 936 in changchun and a 0 736 b 0 328 and a 0 672 b 0 310 in jiefangzha to evaluate the performance of the s i model every group of et d was compared with et swb the statistical parameters of r 2 d rmse and re for et d and et swb are listed in table 2 additionally table 2 shows the results of et d at 13 00 which were estimated in best state compared with the calculated et swb in one day this is applicable for the pair of a and b calibrated from both early stage and whole stages in all three areas after temperature screening all statistical parameters improved the average of r 2 and d increased by 0 13 and 0 08 respectively and the average of rmse and re decreased by 0 10 mm d 1 and 2 5 the r 2 d rmse and re values showed a negligible difference from the two sets of a and b from early and whole stages especially in jiefangzha this indicated that the key parameters of a and b calibrated by field observations in the early stage could be applied directly in real time this could simplify the calculation process while maintaining the calculation accuracy to obtain an objective evaluation of the best performance time at 13 00 the calibrated a and b at 13 00 fig 7 were selected to estimate the et d and then compared with the et swb table 3 the data in table 2 at 13 00 shows a slight improvement in r 2 d rmse and re additionally the values at the start and end of each day are not as accurate as those at noon in fact field weather conditions experience more instability in the morning and evening for example a gust of wind or large changes in temperature with more stable conditions at approximately noon however the time limitation could offset this improvement when the method is applied in practice as it would be challenging to ensure consistency regarding precision irrigation management at the site field level the average values of calibrated a and b should still be a more suitable choice the average values of calibrated a and b would be more precise in estimating et when monitoring each hour within the day and the selection of coefficients for 13 00 12 00 14 00 must also show a high quality when only observing the observation in this time 3 2 evaluation of rs w model using precision partitioning of field temperature data 3 2 1 performances of rs w model during maize growth seasons according to fig 2 t c t s and t a can be obtained and distinguished using precision partitioning of field temperature data to calculate the resistances required subsequently the es s w tr s w et s w and es rs w tr rs w et rs w can be estimated using the s w model eq 6 eq 7 and the revised s w model eq 7 eq 8 respectively figs 8 9 and 10 showed the comparisons of es tr and et estimated from the s w and the revised s w models including daily relative errors during the growing season for the three areas the precision partitioning process of the maize field temperatures makes it possible to distinguish t s and t c this lead to larger values for es rs w than es s w especially during the early growth stages june and tr rs w was slightly less than tr s w in the whole growing season july august figs 8 9 10 a b e f this indicated that the resistances of the soil and vegetation layers could be calculated more accurately with the temperature at their positions specifically for the coefficients of r s and r c in eq 8 in the early stage the es rs w was es half of the total et and had an increasing percentage around 5 in et rs w in zhongwei and jiefangzha areas however the changchun area showed a ratio of es rs w et rs w which reached 90 and changed slightly in june compared with es s w et s w this is partially because the phenological phase of maize occurs later than in other regions with smaller lai during this period fig 1 4 when the early stage of june is extended to mid july the ratio of es rs w et rs w decreases sharply to 60 fig 9a e comparing the total et during the whole growth seasons figs 8 9 10 c g the et rs w was very close to the et s w however there were some differences in the early stage with an average value of rmse of 0 151 0 240 and 0 180 mm d 1 for zhongwei changchun and jiefangzha respectively all differences can be seen in fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 d h including the daily relative error owing to the revised s w model es and tr can be estimated with high precision than previously the reasons for a difference in et are due to the increase in es rs w and the decrease in tr rs w accompanied by the generally negative re of tr rs w and those positive values for es rs w the et rs w were often slightly larger than et s w in early stages positive re and lower perhaps underestimated in the following seasons negative re 3 2 2 accuracy evaluation of the rs w model to evaluate the accuracy of rs w model the values of et a determined by single crop coefficient of the p m model and et swb determined by the swb model were calculated during the maize growth seasons based on field observations at the time fig 11 shows the comparative changes of et rs w et s w et a and et swb with their characteristic values mean median minimum and maximum for each experimental year in the three areas the changing trend shows that the actual evapotranspiration estimated by the p m model et a was lowest in the early stage and largest in the following seasons among the four kinds of evapotranspiration especially in zhongwei and changchun this may be the principle of big leaf from the p m model which ignores or underestimates the es in the initial stage of crop growth while overestimating tr during the latter periods however owing to the swb model the et s w shows a temporal hysteresis occurred in the response to daily field situation causing individual variation when precipitation was higher during the crop growing seasons fig 1 3 the et rs w and et s w were close to the et a such as in 2019 in changchun fig 11 g while the et swb was smaller fig 11 shows boxplots of the et rs w and et s w values which were always between those of et a and et swb the maximum was generally closer to the et a and the average were closer to those of et swb these indicated that the performances of et rs w and et s w were well aligned with et swb fig 11 also shows the results of the rmses between et rs w et s w and et a et swb in early stage june and the following seasons july august generally the rmse values which were between et rs w et swb and et s w et swb were smaller than these of et rs w et a and et s w et a whether in early or later stages however in the early stage in zhongwei 2019 and in july to august in changchun 2019 more precipitation occurred in these periods when checked against the field situations fig 1 3 therefore the et s w and et rs w would be closer to et a if the local weather conditions were exposed to additional precipitation the et rs w rmse values were always lower than et s w when compared with et a or et swb which indicated that the et was more accurately estimated in the rs w model generally the precision data partitioning of temperatures improved the accuracy of field et estimation owing to the calculation of each resistance of soil and vegetation layers 4 discussion 4 1 key parameters of a and b in the s i model the b parameter in the s i model is defined as the mean change coefficient weighted by the rn rs ratio which expresses the relative contribution of midday net radiation to the whole day s solar radioactive exchange seguin and itier 1983 based on a single layer approach vidal and perrier 1989 found that b increases with an increase in surface roughness carlson and buffum 1989 used a complex planetary boundary layer model to study the response of b for a range of surface roughness wind speed and vegetation conditions researchers have measured and predicted b values under various roughness circumstances seguin and itier 1983 riou et al 1988 lagouarde et al 1991 carlson et al 1995 in this study the values of b were calibrated hourly from 10 00 16 00 fig 7 the trend of b was reasonably steady based on the local long term experiments in the three areas eq 3 was an improvement on the original equation presented by seguin and itier 1983 where it changed the surface temperature to t c therefore the results from before and after data screening should agree with the calculations from the original s i model and the eq 3 respectively the values of b were more stable from 10 00 16 00 fig 7 before the t s and t c screening data screening created varying b values which decreased during the day the values also decreased during the data screening process however the verification results in tables 2 and 3 show that the average b values during 10 00 16 00 are still the optimum choice for estimating daily et in the s i model rather than the value at 13 00 the research of a parameter in the s i model is minimal because of its weak change rule and high volatility especially within different regions the errors of a may come from the soil heat flux and the absence of the actual synchronized value of t c t a however with the inclusion of ctms monitoring in this research many environmental factors were obtained concurrently in field fig 7 shows that the absolute values of a in the early stage were smaller than those in the whole growing seasons which indicated that the influence of ignoring the soil heat flux was existed in the early stage however the values were in line with the net radiation including the highest value at midday additionally wind speed varies throughout the day which may impact the et process causing the a peak therefore the selection of a daily average value of a would reduce when influenced by these uncertain factors 4 2 application of the s w and rs w models considerable efforts have been put into correcting the parameters in the s w model in this study t c and t s were also quoted in the rs w model in place of the s w model values on the basis of the original air temperature considered fig 2 as shown in fig 8 a b c e f g fig 9 a b c e f g and fig 10 a b c e f g the differences between them were in es rs w es s w in the early stage tr rs w tr s w in following stages and et rs w et s w over the whole growing season during the whole growth period the total soil evaporation accounted for 25 of et and subsequently declined as the canopy coverage increased gong et al 2019 it was also found that the s w model estimated tr accurately when lai was 0 5 2 5 but it was significantly overestimated in the middle stage this is consistent with the results of this study in the early stage crop canopy temperature may be overestimated leading to an overestimation of the available energy intercepted by the canopy due to the weak ability for crops to regulate their own temperature as well as the effected of air temperature hence through the precision temperature partitioning process solving the problem of underestimation es in the early stage and overestimation tr in the middle and later periods is beneficial to improve field et accuracy juhász and hrotkó 2014 compared the tr generated by the s w model with that measured by a stem flow meter on a cherry tree results showed that the simulated results were unsatisfactory in cloudy and rainy weather conditions which is consistent with the findings of this study fig 11 it demonstrates that estimating et by the s w or rs w model is easily influenced by weather conditions the t c and t s were used to adjust temperature dependent water vapor pressure values in this study the t c t a is a useful tool for prediction and consequently early warning for droughts 5 conclusions the major conclusions of this study are i the average values of key parameters a and b during 10 00 16 00 is the optimal choice for estimating daily et in the s i model rather than the value corresponding with 13 00 after field temperatures were distinguished in t s and t c using the ctms data in the screening process the accuracy of et was partially improved upon compared with the et calculated from the soil water balance equation ii the a and b parameters calibrated by field observations in the early stage can be applied directly rather than after the whole growing season which can simplify calculations while maintaining accuracy iii the revised shuttleworth wallace model presented here showed that the resistances of soil and vegetation layers can improve accuracy by using the temperature through precision partitioning of field temperature data this revision also provided a more accurate estimation of soil evaporation and canopy transpiration iv the et rs w is lower than the et swb when concentrated or substantial precipitation occurred while the general trend of et rs w is in line with that of et a during sunny day weather conditions throughout the growing season v this study provides valuable

9088,nitrogen n and water availability are the two crucial factors confining tree growth and forest productivity irrigation fertilization and combined fertigation are commonly applied to plantation forests for improving productivity however how xylem vasculature responds to these management practices remains poorly understood here we investigated the responses of tree growth xylem anatomical structure and hydraulics of the upper middle and lower canopy branches in a 6 year old populus tomentosa plantation subjected to four years of irrigation and fertigation treatments the results showed that an improvement in tree growth only occurred in the irrigation treatment while the addition of n in fertigation treatments did not have a cumulative effect on tree growth most of the xylem anatomical traits including vessel hydraulic diameter d h vessel density vd vessel fraction vf double vessel wall thickness t potential specific sapwood hydraulic conductivity k p fiber wall to lumen ratio t f d f vessel wall reinforcement t b 2 and wood density wd all showed conserved plasticity to long term irrigation and fertigation despite different tree growth rate implying that aboveground biomass accumulation may have decoupled from the branch level xylem traits besides the alterations of other factors including stomatal regulation strategy and crown structure with soil water and n availabilities might better explain the variation in tree growth in contrast greater variations in branch xylem traits were detected across canopy layers the upper canopy showed greater hydraulic safety characterized by narrower and denser vessels higher cell wall to lumen ratio and higher wood density compared to the lower canopy while hydraulic efficiency k p remained constant across the crown thus highlighting the priority of hydraulic safety over efficiency in the construction of branch xylem overall our study revealed the response pattern of p tomentosa xylem structure to long term water and n management which facilitates a comprehensive understanding on the mechanisms underpinning the influence of water and nutrients regulation on the performance of fast growing tree species plantations keywords xylem anatomy hydraulic function phenotypic plasticity irrigation fertilization canopy position data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction xylem is the primary water transport system of vascular plants serving as the basis for plant water relations and carbon acquisition in angiosperms vessel fiber and parenchyma are the main components of xylem although vessels and fibers accounting for the largest area of xylem are mostly dead tissues they play a crucial role in tree physiological activities and underpin the hydraulic and mechanical functions plavcová et al 2019 vessels are specialized in water transportation and their structure primarily determines the hydraulic properties of xylem network according to the hagen poiseuille s law hydraulic efficiency is proportional to the fourth power of vessel diameter however wider vessels are also thought to be more vulnerable to embolism due to their low capacity in withstanding negative pressure tyree and zimmermann 2002 besides vertical movement water also moves radially between adjacent connected vessels via inter vessel pits thus the vessel connectivity and pit properties also affect the hydraulic functions of xylem loepfe et al 2007 lemaire et al 2021 mrad et al 2021 in addition fiber primarily offers mechanical support the properties of which are closely linked to the mechanical strength of xylem therefore providing an indirect but important protective effect on the bordering vessels by reducing the risk of partial wall implosion under negative pressure jacobsen et al 2005 janssen et al 2020 as a functional adaptive structure xylem is highly responsive to various environmental factors including co2 concentration luo et al 2005 temperature gea izquierdo et al 2013 light condition plavcová et al 2011 air humidity jasińska et al 2015 soil water and nutrient availabilities zhang et al 2020 the plastic responses of xylem to these environmental factors can strongly influence plant water relations and in turn forest productivity due to the multiple roles of xylem as water transport system carbon storage and main forest products meanwhile these responses also indicative of the adaptive strategies of plant hydraulics which is of great significance for a thorough understanding of the acclimation and tolerance of plants to the surrounding environment water and nitrogen n are two main factors limiting of plant growth and their effects on plant hydraulics and xylem anatomical structure have been investigated in several species with mixed results for example awad et al 2010 found that severe drought reduced the plant height and vessel diameter of hybrid poplar saplings while vessel density vessel wall thickness and bordered pit field strengthening increased changes in these anatomical traits help plants sustain a stable water status under different water conditions n was found to exhibit a significant effect on the formation progress of xylem hacke et al 2010 reported upregulated aquaporin aqp expression under high n conditions which consequently facilitated vessel expansion to form wider vessels the widened vessels subsequently supported higher xylem hydraulic efficiency and tree growth under high n availability zhang et al 2018 2020 lignin deposition was also found to be influenced by n availability pitre et al 2007a with fiber wall thickness being significantly decreased in many cases after high n addition luo et al 2005 plavcová et al 2013 however most studies only focused on the influence of one of these two factors on xylem structure in most cases plants are growing under the environment with the co variation of both water and n availabilities such as the cooccurring drought and nitrogen deposition in the context of global climate change or the combination of irrigation and fertilization in forest cultivation the prediction of xylem responses under these conditions is complicated as an interactive effect of n and water on plant hydraulics and xylem structure possibly exists zhang et al 2020 however to date research on the effects of both factors is much less in parallel with the plastic responses to the growing environments xylem structure also exhibits evident variations within a plant hacke et al 2017 long distance water transport in xylem comprises sequential movement of water through root stem branch and leaf the increased path length and the accumulation of gravitational force will bring resistance for water to flow upwards and the risk of hydraulic dysfunction will also be higher towards apices due to the decrease of negative pressure with height a base to tip vessel tapering has been observed in a handful of species anfodillo et al 2006 petit et al 2008 lechthaler et al 2018 pfautsch et al 2018 such intra plant xylem structural adjustment can efficiently offset the negative effect of path length on flow resistance with minimum carbon cost west et al 1999 anfodillo et al 2013 koçillari et al 2021 however vessel tapering was mostly observed in the main stem while branches distributed in a wide range of canopy heights may exhibit quite different axial variation patterns in many cases vessels or tracheids were wider in the upper branches than the lower ones burgess et al 2006 bettiati et al 2012 alber et al 2019 the increased vessel diameter can help the apical branches to overcome higher hydraulic resistance caused by longer path length and thus benefits the maintenance of an equal water allocation in the whole crown bettiati et al 2012 besides vessel size other anatomical traits like vessel frequency vessel connection and fiber structure may also vary within the crown however the within organ variation pattern of xylem anatomical structure has only been investigated in very limited species burgess et al 2006 bettiati et al 2012 jasińska et al 2015 alber et al 2019 which hindered us from a better understanding of the crown level hydraulic adjustment strategy poplar is a fast growing and high yielding tree species that is widely afforested in temperate zone around the world according to the national ninth forest resources report the total area of poplar forests in china has reached over 8 25 million ha of which 7 57 million ha are plantation forests contributing to over 546 million m3 of stock volume forest resources management division 2018 many studies have demonstrated that poplars are sensitive to the growing environment that even a moderate deficit in soil water or and n availability will limit their growth awad et al 2010 hacke et al 2010 xi et al 2016 consequently irrigation and n fertilization have been widely adopted as crucial silvicultural practices to sustain and promote the productivity and quality of poplar plantations wang et al 2015 xi et al 2021 the combination of irrigation and fertilization i e fertigation is also recommended for their positive cumulative effect on poplar biomass production coyle and coleman 2005 wang et al 2015 yan et al 2018 however the effectiveness of irrigation and fertigation was questioned in some other studies for example in northern china he et al 2020 2021 found that irrigation combined fertilization did not improve the growth of a 2 3 year old poplar plantation the positive effect of irrigation on growth also disappeared in a 7 year old poplar plantation as reported by guo et al 2023 these uncertainties regarding the effects of the water and n regimes on plantations urge a deeper understanding on the mechanisms regulating tree growth yet early studies investigating the effect of water and n on xylem hydraulics and anatomy mostly focused on saplings subjected to short term treatments awad et al 2010 pitre et al 2007a b hacke et al 2010 plavcová and hacke 2012 plavcová et al 2013 studies focusing on multi year treatment and field grown mature trees are urgently required to better understand the response mechanisms of plantation growth to water and n management based on the knowledge gaps mentioned above we collected branches from six year old populus tomentosa plantations which were specially established to assess the long term effects of irrigation and n addition on tree growth the overarching aim of current study was to test the response and plasticity of xylem to long term irrigation with and without nitrogen addition besides variations in xylem anatomical and hydraulic traits within the canopy were also investigated given the known high phenotypic plasticity of poplar species we hypothesized that 1 xylem hydraulic architecture in poplars would show evident plasticity to the irrigation and fertigation treatments such that the xylem traits would vary to shape a more conductive hydraulic system which benefits the utilization and transportation of water and nutrients following irrigation and fertilization 2 xylem anatomical and hydraulic traits would vary axially along canopy layers in particular branches from different layers would be constructed in different hydraulic strategies to optimize the hydraulic efficiency and safety through the whole crown 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted on a state owned forest farm in gaotang county liaocheng city shandong province 36 58 n 116 14 e in northern china the region is dominated by semi humid temperate continental monsoon climate with annual average temperature annual average precipitation and annual average free water surface evaporation being 13 41 c and of 553 mm 40 year average from 1981 to 2020 peng 2020 and of 1880 mm respectively the groundwater level in the study site fluctuates between 6 and 9 m liu et al 2022 the soil layer of 0 140 cm depth is sandy loam while the 140 300 cm layer is silt loam details of the physical and chemical properties of the soil were given in he et al 2021 2 2 plant material and experimental design six year old triploid p tomentosa clone s86 p tomentosa p bolleana p alba p glandulosa was used in this study two year old bare root stem cuttings were planted in the spring of 2016 with a spacing of 2 m 3 m and planting density of 1666 trees ha 1 the experimental plantation was established for a large scale research project which aims to assess the long term effects of furrow irrigation and additional n fertilization wn treatments on stand productivity of short rotation poplar plantations the entire experimental design includes twelve wn treatments and a control blank treatment which are repeated in five replicated blocks each block incorporates all the treatment plots consisting of 32 trees the design of irrigation and fertilization levels were the same as he et al 2020 in short the irrigation furrow was 1 0 m wide and 0 2 m deep and trees were planted in the center of the furrow the irrigation regimes were set according to the quantitative relationship between plant growth and transpiration in p tomentosa as well as soil water availability xi et al 2016 2017 irrigation was initiated when the tensiometer measured soil matric potential smp at 40 cm depth beneath the furrow surface reached 20 kpa for full irrigation and 45 kpa for deficit irrigation these smp thresholds for triggering irrigation correspond to 79 20 kpa and 60 45 kpa of field capacity urea based fertilizer was dissolved in the water and applied with irrigation three wn treatments and one ck treatment were chosen for this study to specifically investigate the effects of irrigation and additional fertilization on tree growth xylem anatomy and hydraulics of the plantation i control treatment ck rain fed without any fertilization ii high irrigation treatment wh full irrigation 20 kpa without any fertilization iii high irrigation plus high fertigation treatment whn full irrigation 20 kpa with 260 kg n ha 1 fertilization per year iv low irrigation plus high fertigation treatment wln deficit irrigation 45 kpa with 260 kg n ha 1 fertilization per year all the treatments set in from april 2017 in the early growing season of each year around late march one irrigation was conducted for all treatments to promote budburst and then the designed treatments were initiated irrigation was applied from late march to mid october in 2018 2019 and from late march to late july in 2020 due to the change in irrigation scheduling fertilizer was applied five times in each year on 20th april 10th may 30th may 19th june 9th july and 29th july plastic sheets were buried at 40 cm deep between adjacent treatment plots to prevent soil water and n migration herbicides were sprayed regularly and evenly during the growing season to eliminate potential confounding effects of weeds and pests on tree physiology and growth 2 3 soil water content from late may to late july soil water content swc cm3 cm 3 was monitored four times to clarify the difference in soil water availability between treatments with different irrigation thresholds three average sized trees were chosen in each irrigation threshold 20 kpa 45 kpa ck and 3 m long access tubes were installed at 25 50 and 100 cm distances from each sample tree a tdr tube probe trime iph imko inc ettlingen germany was used to measure the in situ swc at 10 30 50 70 100 120 140 180 220 and 260 cm depths the swc of the four time measurements was averaged as shown in fig s1 furrow irrigation evidently affected the vertical swc distributions swc in shallow soil layers was enhanced obviously in the wh whn and wh and wl treatments which provided a higher soil water availability for tree growth compared to ck 2 4 tree growth measurement and branch sampling in late june 2020 32 trees per treatment were randomly selected from five blocks to measure the diameter at breast height of 1 3 m dbh cm and 18 of them were selected for measuring tree height h m then three average sized trees in each treatment were selected to measure the crown length i e the vertical distance from the lowest living branch to the highest apical shoot the crown was equally divided into upper middle and lower canopy layers and five to six healthy branches per canopy layer were sampled in each treatment with high branch scissors two adjacent 4 cm long specimens were cut from each branch for xylem anatomy and wood density measurements only the branch segments with diameter of 1 2 cm were selected to reduce the influence of organ size on anatomical structure related information on the sample trees is shown in table 1 to detect the possible difference in crown characteristics among treatments one tree per treatment was harvested the measured structural indices included the number and basal diameter cm of the first order branches then the basal cross sectional area cm2 of each branch was calculated with its diameter and the total branch cross sectional area of each canopy layer cm2 was summed after measuring the crown structure all branches were cut off from the trunk the total branch biomass kg of the upper middle and lower canopies were then calculated from the fresh branch weight and the tissue water content measured from representative subsamples 2 5 xylem anatomy and wood density measurements branch samples for anatomy measurement were fixed in faa 50 ethanol 10 formaldehyde and 5 acetic acid after transported back to the laboratory one segment from each branch sample was embedded in paraffin then cross sections of 10 25 µm thick were sliced by a rotary microtome leica rm2016 leica nusslock germany washed with xylene stained with safranin o 1 w v dehydrated with an ethanol series 50 75 100 and finally mounted with neutral balsam the whole slides were scanned with a panoramic scanner pannoramic midi 3dhistech inc budapest hungary for each image four fields of the two outermost growth rings were captured at 10 and 100 magnifications using software pannoramic viewer v 1 15 3 3dhistech inc budapest hungary the secondary xylem of p tomentosa was mainly composed of vessels and fibers fig 1 so the present study focused on the anatomical structure of these two types of cells according to the measurement criteria summarized by scholz et al 2013 imagej software national institutes of health bethesda md usa was used to measure the vessel arithmetic diameter d μm the equivalent circle diameter calculated from each single vessel lumen area vessel density vd n mm 2 vessel number per unit

thickness of the double wall between adjacent fibers fiber lumen diameter d f μm the arithmetic diameter of fiber and fiber wall to lumen ratio t f d f vessel hydraulic diameter d h μm was calculated by eq 1 tyree and zimmermann 2002 a total of over 30000 vessels and 7000 fibers were measured in this study 1 d h d 4 n 4 where d μm and n are the diameter and number of vessels in the same micrograph branch samples for wood density measurement were debarked and the fresh volume cm3 of the remaining sapwood was measured by the water displacement method the sample was then oven dried at 65 c for at least 48 h until constant weight wood density wd g cm 3 was expressed as the ratio of dry mass to fresh volume 2 6 theoretical hydraulic traits the potential sapwood specific hydraulic conductivity k p kg m 1 mpa 1 s 1 was calculated according to the hagen poiseuille equation eq 2 poorter et al 2010 2 k p π ρ w 128 η vd d h 4 where vd is vessel density n mm 2 d h is vessel hydraulic diameter μm ρ w is density of water at 20 c 998 2 kg m 3 and η is viscosity of water at 20 c 1 002 10 3 pa s although the theoretical parameter overestimates the actual specific sapwood conductivity due to its assumption of all vessels in the sapwood having ideal structure and being fully functional it was widely adopted as a comparative measure and proved to be well correlated with the empirical sapwood hydraulic conductivity chen et al 2020 vessel wall reinforcement t b 2 was calculated by the square of the ratio of double vessel wall thickness t to vessel arithmetic diameter treat d as b this trait indicates the vessel wall resistance to implosion induced by xylem negative pressure which was a wide applied proxy for xylem embolism resistance hacke et al 2001 guet et al 2015 all anatomical and hydraulic traits measured or calculated in the present study are listed in table 2 2 7 data analysis data analyses were performed using r v 4 1 2 r development core team 2021 and origin 2021 originlab northampton ma usa prior to statistical analyses all the data were tested for normality and homoscedasticity with the levenetest function of the car package and shapiro test function among all traits the original data of vd t f t f d f k p and t b 2 were log10 transformed to meet the normality and homoscedasticity two way analysis of variance anova was carried out to determine the effect of treatment t and canopy position cp and their interactions on the eleven selected xylem traits with the following linear model trait t cp t cp for the variables which had no significant interaction effect one way anova was used to test the main effects of canopy position and treatment one way anova was also used to test the difference in plant growth among treatments multi comparisons among values were conducted using the tukey s hsd post hoc correlations between traits were analyzed by pearson correlation test with the cor test function the linear regression model was performed using lm function all differences were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 effects of irrigation and fertigation on tree growth and canopy structure long term irrigation and fertigation affected the tree growth and canopy structure to different degrees compared to ck both the dbh and tree height were improved by irrigation wh and the two fertigation treatments whn and wln but the significance only exists between ck and wh p 0 05 table 1 the observation of crown structure from one tree per treatment showed that although the number of the first order branch was similar among treatments branch biomass and cross sectional area were evidently enhanced in wh and wln fig s2 a supplementary anatomical study proved that the basal cross sectional area was positively related to the secondary xylem area mm2 measured from anatomical photos r 2 0 907 p 0 001 fig s3 indicating that trees with higher total branch cross sectional area had more potential xylem transport area thus wh and wln might improve the total water conducting area of the branches appropriately however in whn both branch biomass and cross sectional area decreased slightly fig s2 3 2 xylem features of p tomentosa as a diffuse porous tree species there was no evident radial variation in d within a growth ring of p tomentosa except for a single row of larger vessels at the ring boundary fig 1 vessel diameter distribution showed a unimodal shape in each canopy layer for all treatments with 96 of the vessels being distributed within the diameter range of 20 60 µm fig 2 vessels were primarily grouped in radial multiples and clusters fig 1 fibers were the main component of xylem and exhibited specific strengthening and protective tissue features with thick walls and narrow lumens the average values of each xylem trait on the species level are shown in table 2 3 3 variations in xylem traits across canopy layers and treatments according to the results of two way anova xylem traits were significantly affected by the main factor of canopy position or treatment except for t and k p however the interaction effect between canopy position and treatment was not found in all traits p 0 05 indicating that the responses of xylem traits to treatment and canopy position were mutually independent table 3 therefore comparisons were made between canopy layers and between treatments separately across canopy heights d h vd vf d f t f d f and t b 2 varied significantly p 0 05 both vessel d h and fiber d f exhibited the largest cell diameter in the lower canopy then decreased acropetally and showed the smallest values in the upper canopy fig 3a f reverse axial variations were observed for vd and t f d f which increased from the bottom to the top of canopy fig 3b h there were also increasing trends in vf and t b 2 with canopy height but the highest t b 2 was found in the middle canopy fig 3c b v g t t f and k p showed no significant variations within the crown figs 3d 3e 3g 4a wood density also varied with canopy height with upper and middle canopy layers showing significantly denser wood compared to the lower canopy fig 4c when comparing among treatments none of traits showed significant difference between wn treatments and ck figs 3 4 however there was still a significant effect of treatment on v g d f and t f p 0 05 but the differences only emerged between high irrigation plus high fertilization treatment whn and high irrigation treatment wh with whn exhibiting significantly lower values p 0 05 fig 3d f g this suggested a negative effect of n addition on these traits under well water conditions other anatomical and hydraulic traits including d h vd vf t t f d f k p and t b 2 all revealed limited plasticity and showed no significant variations among treatments p 0 05 figs 3 4 3 4 correlations between xylem traits significant correlations were observed between traits fig 5 across treatments wd was positively correlated to vd v g t f t f d f and t b 2 but negatively correlated to d h d f and k p p 0 05 among all anatomical traits t f d f vd and d h explained the highest variations indicated by the highest r 2 of wd fig 6 anatomical and hydraulic functional traits were also closely related hydraulic efficiency of sapwood k p was positively correlated to d h vf and t but negatively correlated to vd and v g p 0 05 fig 5 embolism resistance t b 2 was positively correlated to vd v g t t f and t f d f while negatively correlated to d h and d f p 0 05 fig 5 a tight negative correlation trade off between vessel diameter and vessel density was also found p 0 05 fig 5 the core information of our findings is summarized in fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 response of tree growth to irrigation and fertigation after applying irrigation and fertigation for four years both the height and diameter growth of p tomentosa plantation was significantly improved by irrigation treatment wh while n fertilization under both high whn and low wln watering regimes did not show a significantly promotive effect on tree growth table 1 additional input of n fertilizer whn even diminished the significant positive effect of full irrigation on tree growth table 1 this result was consistent with our previous finding in an adjacent plantation with the same clone but different irrigation method drip irrigation at younger ages 2 3 years old he et al 2020 2021 indicating that soil water availability rather than soil n was the primary factor confining p tomentosa plantation growth in this region nonetheless symptoms of drought stress such as leaf shedding or canopy dieback which have been found widespread in poplar plantations in northern china ji et al 2019 fang et al 2020 were not observed in our plantations under rain fed condition ck this suggested that water limitation to p tomentosa growth was not severe in the study region having the semi humid climate with relatively adequate precipitation but the improvement of water availability in shallow soil by appropriate irrigation regimes can still effectively help poplar plantations reach higher growth potential xi et al 2021 he et al 2021 this finding is consistent with the observation by xi et al 2016 which showed that the growth of p tomentosa was mostly determined by soil water availability in the shallow layer besides our finding implies that the necessity of n fertigation for cultivating p tomentosa plantations in this region needs further consideration given that little growth promotion benefit has been found 4 2 plasticity of xylem to irrigation and fertigation contrary to our first hypothesis none of the xylem traits showed significant differences in wh whn and wln when compared to ck indicating a conserved plasticity of branch xylem after four year treatments figs 3 4 as the principal anatomical basis and good proxies for xylem hydraulic efficiency vessel hydraulic diameter vessel density vessel fraction and specific hydraulic conductivity were not enhanced by any treatment even in wh which achieved the highest growth in both tree height and diameter figs 3 4 table 1 high growth rate is always facilitated by high levels of transpiration and hydraulic efficiency poorter et al 2010 hoeber et al 2014 hajek et al 2014 changes in xylem anatomical structure under increasing decreasing soil water availabilities have also been widely documented awad et al 2010 de oliveira et al 2018 however in the present study these traditional efficiency linked traits showed limited response to environmental change and exhibited a decoupling pattern with tree growth in fact the water delivery capacity of tree canopies can be determined by factors beyond xylem anatomical traits our recent study showed that p tomentosa exhibited a plastic stomatal behavior so increasing soil water availability by both irrigation and precipitation could result in a more anisohydric stomatal regulation strategy guo et al 2023 the looser stomatal control of anisohydric plants allows for continuous carbon acquisition under a wide range of water conditions and thus may help to achieve a higher growth rate attia et al 2015 found that the anisohydric poplar genotypes achieved higher growth rate than isohydric genotypes under well water condition hence it can be inferred that the promoted growth of full irrigated plantation wh may benefit from the alteration of stomatal regulation strategy besides at the organ level difference in crown structure was also detected among treatments with the full irrigated trees wh showed a doubled xylem area in the first order branch than ck fig s2 plavcová and hacke 2012 found that stem hydraulic conductivity was mainly driven by the size of xylem cross sectional area so the evidently enlarged branch xylem area in wh will facilitate the water transport capacity of the whole crown for a given stable specific hydraulic conductivity the effect of irrigation and fertigation on crown structure has also been reported in a previous study albaugh et al 2006 however only one tree was harvested for crown measurement in each treatment for the present study future research with more replications is still needed to confirm the aforementioned inference in our study n fertigation under neither high whn nor low wln water conditions showed evident effect on xylem anatomical and hydraulic traits figs 3 4 the result was similar to yu et al 2022 who found that nitrogen addition did not alter the earlywood vessel anatomical structure and potential hydraulic conductivity of quercus acutissima regardless of precipitation indeed the effect of n on plant xylem is complex given that the responses may depend on the n addition level in the study of wang et al 2016 and zhang et al 2021 the most evident responses of vessel structure and hydraulic function to n addition appeared at medium n addition level therefore that the amount of n applied in the current study may be insufficient or excessive to trigger anatomical response in p tomentosa however an effect of n still emerged on vessel grouping index fiber lumen diameter and double fiber wall thickness specifically under high irrigation condition with significantly lower values being in whn than in wh fig 3 vessel grouping index is a measure of vessel connection but the role of inter vessel connections in hydraulic function both efficiency and safety is still under debate some views perceive that greater connections can improve xylem hydraulic integration so that more alternative ways are available for water flow to bypass the embolized vessels through the connected functional ones thus reducing the loss of hydraulic conductivity under cavitation events levionnois et al 2021 lemaire et al 2021 whereas an opposite theory deems that these pathways can also facilitate the spread of air bubbles between adjacent vessels subsequently increasing the vulnerability of embolism loepfe et al 2007 based on the xylem traits investigated here we cannot directly clarify the actual correlation between vessel connection and hydraulic function yet our results revealed that both tree growth and branch biomass were higher in wh compared to whn fig s2 table 1 thus it can be inferred that a more connected vessel network possibly reduced the negative effect of embolism and promoted crown development in wh the decrease in fiber lumen diameter and fiber wall thickness by n addition were consist with some previous studies nyakuengama et al 2003 luo et al 2005 plavcová et al 2013 found that in hybrid poplar high n treatment downregulated genes encoding known transcriptional regulators of secondary cell wall deposition which would result in thinner fiber walls as we observed here however rather than the effect on xylem hydraulic function changes in these fiber characteristics were more likely to influence the quality and utilization suitability of wood which are just the wood properties that people are very concerned about since p tomentosa is considered as an excellent pulping material ma et al 2015 sang et al 2021 4 3 spatial variations of xylem traits within the crown unlike the conserved plasticity found among treatments canopy height served as a stronger predictor of trait variations in branch xylem in accordance with our second hypothesis most of the anatomical and hydraulic traits varied axially within the canopy toward the treetop vessel diameter d h decreased while vessel density vd increased in tandem the increased vd in part compensated for the loss of vessel fraction vf ensued from the reduced vessel size leading to a higher conducting area in the uppermost branches fig 3 however hydraulic conductivity k p remained constant across the vertical gradients of the canopy the axial variations of vessel structure and hydraulic conductivity recorded here differed from many previous studies showing that the upper branches developing under conditions of higher radiation heat loading and wind speed environment were more conductive than the lower shaded branches burgess et al 2006 sellin et al 2010 sellin and lubenets 2010 and vessel diameter also increased acropetally to facilitate transport efficiency and photosynthesis alber et al 2019 the decrease tendency of vessel diameter observed in the present study was similar to the tapering pattern usually found in the main stem jasińska et al 2015 alber et al 2019 or along aridity gradients pfautsch et al 2016 this suggests that the upper branches were exposed to some extent of water limitation which was possibly induced by the longer pathlength and decreasing xylem pressure with increasing canopy height ryan and yoder 1997 koch et al 2004 changes in other xylem traits supported this inference the wall to lumen ratio of both fiber t f d f and vessel t b 2 increased evidently with canopy height p 0 05 fig 3 such improvements provided xylem with better mechanical support which consequently improves embolism resistance by preventing vessel implosion under extreme negative pressure hacke et al 2001 jacobsen et al 2005 due to the changes in vessel and fiber anatomical structure branch wood density also increased with canopy height p 0 05 fig 4 as an integral trait summarizing the variation of multiple anatomical characteristics wood density shows complex correlations with wood functional traits barotto et al 2018 plavcová et al 2019 and is closely linked to the growth and survival of plants chave et al 2009 poorter et al 2010 greenwood et al 2017 serra maluquer et al 2022 denser wood was proved to have better embolism resistance and drought tolerance hacke et al 2001 on the basis of all the trait variations mentioned above it is obvious that branches from different canopy layers were constructed with different hydraulic strategies the upper canopy showed greater hydraulic and mechanical safety compared to the middle and lower canopies while hydraulic efficiency was similar along the canopy height due to the flexible adjustment of vessel size and frequency these findings suggested that p tomentosa perhaps prioritize hydraulic safety over efficiency when constructing branch xylem which may benefit a constant and balanced water allocation in the whole tree crown and further optimize carbon assimilation and tree growth admittedly there were still limitations of the current study given that the conclusion was built mostly on the analysis of xylem anatomical traits at the microscopic level while the in situ plant hydraulics and growth may be affected by broader traits and their interactions with the environment for example the ultrastructure of pits also strongly affects xylem hydraulic functions levionnois et al 2021 besides compared to the conserved plasticity of xylem structural traits physiological traits such as sap flow dynamics xylem embolism stomatal control and gas exchange might respond more readily to the environmental stimuli and thus are better proxies for predicting tree growth consequently further investigation should shed light on these traits which could help to better understand the response mechanisms of p tomentosa plantation to the management practices and changing environment 5 conclusion the present study investigated the effects of long term irrigation and additional n fertilization on the xylem anatomical structure and hydraulic function of branches from different canopy layers in p tomentosa we found that tree growth was only significantly improved by irrigation while the additional n fertilization showed no cumulation effect and even diminished the positive effect of irrigation this finding suggests that water rather than soil n was the main limiting factor for p tomentosa plantation growth in this region so sufficient irrigation is required to enhance forest productivity branch xylem anatomy and hydraulics exhibited conserved plasticity to all the irrigation and fertigation treatments and seems to be decoupled with tree growth other factors like the alterations of stomatal regulation strategy and crown structure with soil water and n availabilities might better explain the difference of tree growth in contrary to the effect of irrigation and fertigation canopy height played a greater influence on branch xylem traits resulting in increased hydraulic safety towards apices without compromising hydraulic efficiency the adjustments of hydraulic safety and efficiency along canopy profile can potentially be translated into resistance and productivity at the whole tree level therefore branches at different canopy heights may contribute differently to the overall tree growth resistance and resilience overall findings of this study offer additional insights into the influence mechanisms of water and fertilizer management on the growth of fast growing tree species from the perspective of plant hydraulics and would also help to predict the dynamics of structure and function of plantation forests under environmental change the structure function relationship observed in this study could provide a guidance on designing and refining the pruning practice given pruning branches of different canopy layers may result in different influences on tree performance and stand structure with consequences to the productivity and sustainability of poplar plantations

9088,nitrogen n and water availability are the two crucial factors confining tree growth and forest productivity irrigation fertilization and combined fertigation are commonly applied to plantation forests for improving productivity however how xylem vasculature responds to these management practices remains poorly understood here we investigated the responses of tree growth xylem anatomical structure and hydraulics of the upper middle and lower canopy branches in a 6 year old populus tomentosa plantation subjected to four years of irrigation and fertigation treatments the results showed that an improvement in tree growth only occurred in the irrigation treatment while the addition of n in fertigation treatments did not have a cumulative effect on tree growth most of the xylem anatomical traits including vessel hydraulic diameter d h vessel density vd vessel fraction vf double vessel wall thickness t potential specific sapwood hydraulic conductivity k p fiber wall to lumen ratio t f d f vessel wall reinforcement t b 2 and wood density wd all showed conserved plasticity to long term irrigation and fertigation despite different tree growth rate implying that aboveground biomass accumulation may have decoupled from the branch level xylem traits besides the alterations of other factors including stomatal regulation strategy and crown structure with soil water and n availabilities might better explain the variation in tree growth in contrast greater variations in branch xylem traits were detected across canopy layers the upper canopy showed greater hydraulic safety characterized by narrower and denser vessels higher cell wall to lumen ratio and higher wood density compared to the lower canopy while hydraulic efficiency k p remained constant across the crown thus highlighting the priority of hydraulic safety over efficiency in the construction of branch xylem overall our study revealed the response pattern of p tomentosa xylem structure to long term water and n management which facilitates a comprehensive understanding on the mechanisms underpinning the influence of water and nutrients regulation on the performance of fast growing tree species plantations keywords xylem anatomy hydraulic function phenotypic plasticity irrigation fertilization canopy position data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction xylem is the primary water transport system of vascular plants serving as the basis for plant water relations and carbon acquisition in angiosperms vessel fiber and parenchyma are the main components of xylem although vessels and fibers accounting for the largest area of xylem are mostly dead tissues they play a crucial role in tree physiological activities and underpin the hydraulic and mechanical functions plavcová et al 2019 vessels are specialized in water transportation and their structure primarily determines the hydraulic properties of xylem network according to the hagen poiseuille s law hydraulic efficiency is proportional to the fourth power of vessel diameter however wider vessels are also thought to be more vulnerable to embolism due to their low capacity in withstanding negative pressure tyree and zimmermann 2002 besides vertical movement water also moves radially between adjacent connected vessels via inter vessel pits thus the vessel connectivity and pit properties also affect the hydraulic functions of xylem loepfe et al 2007 lemaire et al 2021 mrad et al 2021 in addition fiber primarily offers mechanical support the properties of which are closely linked to the mechanical strength of xylem therefore providing an indirect but important protective effect on the bordering vessels by reducing the risk of partial wall implosion under negative pressure jacobsen et al 2005 janssen et al 2020 as a functional adaptive structure xylem is highly responsive to various environmental factors including co2 concentration luo et al 2005 temperature gea izquierdo et al 2013 light condition plavcová et al 2011 air humidity jasińska et al 2015 soil water and nutrient availabilities zhang et al 2020 the plastic responses of xylem to these environmental factors can strongly influence plant water relations and in turn forest productivity due to the multiple roles of xylem as water transport system carbon storage and main forest products meanwhile these responses also indicative of the adaptive strategies of plant hydraulics which is of great significance for a thorough understanding of the acclimation and tolerance of plants to the surrounding environment water and nitrogen n are two main factors limiting of plant growth and their effects on plant hydraulics and xylem anatomical structure have been investigated in several species with mixed results for example awad et al 2010 found that severe drought reduced the plant height and vessel diameter of hybrid poplar saplings while vessel density vessel wall thickness and bordered pit field strengthening increased changes in these anatomical traits help plants sustain a stable water status under different water conditions n was found to exhibit a significant effect on the formation progress of xylem hacke et al 2010 reported upregulated aquaporin aqp expression under high n conditions which consequently facilitated vessel expansion to form wider vessels the widened vessels subsequently supported higher xylem hydraulic efficiency and tree growth under high n availability zhang et al 2018 2020 lignin deposition was also found to be influenced by n availability pitre et al 2007a with fiber wall thickness being significantly decreased in many cases after high n addition luo et al 2005 plavcová et al 2013 however most studies only focused on the influence of one of these two factors on xylem structure in most cases plants are growing under the environment with the co variation of both water and n availabilities such as the cooccurring drought and nitrogen deposition in the context of global climate change or the combination of irrigation and fertilization in forest cultivation the prediction of xylem responses under these conditions is complicated as an interactive effect of n and water on plant hydraulics and xylem structure possibly exists zhang et al 2020 however to date research on the effects of both factors is much less in parallel with the plastic responses to the growing environments xylem structure also exhibits evident variations within a plant hacke et al 2017 long distance water transport in xylem comprises sequential movement of water through root stem branch and leaf the increased path length and the accumulation of gravitational force will bring resistance for water to flow upwards and the risk of hydraulic dysfunction will also be higher towards apices due to the decrease of negative pressure with height a base to tip vessel tapering has been observed in a handful of species anfodillo et al 2006 petit et al 2008 lechthaler et al 2018 pfautsch et al 2018 such intra plant xylem structural adjustment can efficiently offset the negative effect of path length on flow resistance with minimum carbon cost west et al 1999 anfodillo et al 2013 koçillari et al 2021 however vessel tapering was mostly observed in the main stem while branches distributed in a wide range of canopy heights may exhibit quite different axial variation patterns in many cases vessels or tracheids were wider in the upper branches than the lower ones burgess et al 2006 bettiati et al 2012 alber et al 2019 the increased vessel diameter can help the apical branches to overcome higher hydraulic resistance caused by longer path length and thus benefits the maintenance of an equal water allocation in the whole crown bettiati et al 2012 besides vessel size other anatomical traits like vessel frequency vessel connection and fiber structure may also vary within the crown however the within organ variation pattern of xylem anatomical structure has only been investigated in very limited species burgess et al 2006 bettiati et al 2012 jasińska et al 2015 alber et al 2019 which hindered us from a better understanding of the crown level hydraulic adjustment strategy poplar is a fast growing and high yielding tree species that is widely afforested in temperate zone around the world according to the national ninth forest resources report the total area of poplar forests in china has reached over 8 25 million ha of which 7 57 million ha are plantation forests contributing to over 546 million m3 of stock volume forest resources management division 2018 many studies have demonstrated that poplars are sensitive to the growing environment that even a moderate deficit in soil water or and n availability will limit their growth awad et al 2010 hacke et al 2010 xi et al 2016 consequently irrigation and n fertilization have been widely adopted as crucial silvicultural practices to sustain and promote the productivity and quality of poplar plantations wang et al 2015 xi et al 2021 the combination of irrigation and fertilization i e fertigation is also recommended for their positive cumulative effect on poplar biomass production coyle and coleman 2005 wang et al 2015 yan et al 2018 however the effectiveness of irrigation and fertigation was questioned in some other studies for example in northern china he et al 2020 2021 found that irrigation combined fertilization did not improve the growth of a 2 3 year old poplar plantation the positive effect of irrigation on growth also disappeared in a 7 year old poplar plantation as reported by guo et al 2023 these uncertainties regarding the effects of the water and n regimes on plantations urge a deeper understanding on the mechanisms regulating tree growth yet early studies investigating the effect of water and n on xylem hydraulics and anatomy mostly focused on saplings subjected to short term treatments awad et al 2010 pitre et al 2007a b hacke et al 2010 plavcová and hacke 2012 plavcová et al 2013 studies focusing on multi year treatment and field grown mature trees are urgently required to better understand the response mechanisms of plantation growth to water and n management based on the knowledge gaps mentioned above we collected branches from six year old populus tomentosa plantations which were specially established to assess the long term effects of irrigation and n addition on tree growth the overarching aim of current study was to test the response and plasticity of xylem to long term irrigation with and without nitrogen addition besides variations in xylem anatomical and hydraulic traits within the canopy were also investigated given the known high phenotypic plasticity of poplar species we hypothesized that 1 xylem hydraulic architecture in poplars would show evident plasticity to the irrigation and fertigation treatments such that the xylem traits would vary to shape a more conductive hydraulic system which benefits the utilization and transportation of water and nutrients following irrigation and fertilization 2 xylem anatomical and hydraulic traits would vary axially along canopy layers in particular branches from different layers would be constructed in different hydraulic strategies to optimize the hydraulic efficiency and safety through the whole crown 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted on a state owned forest farm in gaotang county liaocheng city shandong province 36 58 n 116 14 e in northern china the region is dominated by semi humid temperate continental monsoon climate with annual average temperature annual average precipitation and annual average free water surface evaporation being 13 41 c and of 553 mm 40 year average from 1981 to 2020 peng 2020 and of 1880 mm respectively the groundwater level in the study site fluctuates between 6 and 9 m liu et al 2022 the soil layer of 0 140 cm depth is sandy loam while the 140 300 cm layer is silt loam details of the physical and chemical properties of the soil were given in he et al 2021 2 2 plant material and experimental design six year old triploid p tomentosa clone s86 p tomentosa p bolleana p alba p glandulosa was used in this study two year old bare root stem cuttings were planted in the spring of 2016 with a spacing of 2 m 3 m and planting density of 1666 trees ha 1 the experimental plantation was established for a large scale research project which aims to assess the long term effects of furrow irrigation and additional n fertilization wn treatments on stand productivity of short rotation poplar plantations the entire experimental design includes twelve wn treatments and a control blank treatment which are repeated in five replicated blocks each block incorporates all the treatment plots consisting of 32 trees the design of irrigation and fertilization levels were the same as he et al 2020 in short the irrigation furrow was 1 0 m wide and 0 2 m deep and trees were planted in the center of the furrow the irrigation regimes were set according to the quantitative relationship between plant growth and transpiration in p tomentosa as well as soil water availability xi et al 2016 2017 irrigation was initiated when the tensiometer measured soil matric potential smp at 40 cm depth beneath the furrow surface reached 20 kpa for full irrigation and 45 kpa for deficit irrigation these smp thresholds for triggering irrigation correspond to 79 20 kpa and 60 45 kpa of field capacity urea based fertilizer was dissolved in the water and applied with irrigation three wn treatments and one ck treatment were chosen for this study to specifically investigate the effects of irrigation and additional fertilization on tree growth xylem anatomy and hydraulics of the plantation i control treatment ck rain fed without any fertilization ii high irrigation treatment wh full irrigation 20 kpa without any fertilization iii high irrigation plus high fertigation treatment whn full irrigation 20 kpa with 260 kg n ha 1 fertilization per year iv low irrigation plus high fertigation treatment wln deficit irrigation 45 kpa with 260 kg n ha 1 fertilization per year all the treatments set in from april 2017 in the early growing season of each year around late march one irrigation was conducted for all treatments to promote budburst and then the designed treatments were initiated irrigation was applied from late march to mid october in 2018 2019 and from late march to late july in 2020 due to the change in irrigation scheduling fertilizer was applied five times in each year on 20th april 10th may 30th may 19th june 9th july and 29th july plastic sheets were buried at 40 cm deep between adjacent treatment plots to prevent soil water and n migration herbicides were sprayed regularly and evenly during the growing season to eliminate potential confounding effects of weeds and pests on tree physiology and growth 2 3 soil water content from late may to late july soil water content swc cm3 cm 3 was monitored four times to clarify the difference in soil water availability between treatments with different irrigation thresholds three average sized trees were chosen in each irrigation threshold 20 kpa 45 kpa ck and 3 m long access tubes were installed at 25 50 and 100 cm distances from each sample tree a tdr tube probe trime iph imko inc ettlingen germany was used to measure the in situ swc at 10 30 50 70 100 120 140 180 220 and 260 cm depths the swc of the four time measurements was averaged as shown in fig s1 furrow irrigation evidently affected the vertical swc distributions swc in shallow soil layers was enhanced obviously in the wh whn and wh and wl treatments which provided a higher soil water availability for tree growth compared to ck 2 4 tree growth measurement and branch sampling in late june 2020 32 trees per treatment were randomly selected from five blocks to measure the diameter at breast height of 1 3 m dbh cm and 18 of them were selected for measuring tree height h m then three average sized trees in each treatment were selected to measure the crown length i e the vertical distance from the lowest living branch to the highest apical shoot the crown was equally divided into upper middle and lower canopy layers and five to six healthy branches per canopy layer were sampled in each treatment with high branch scissors two adjacent 4 cm long specimens were cut from each branch for xylem anatomy and wood density measurements only the branch segments with diameter of 1 2 cm were selected to reduce the influence of organ size on anatomical structure related information on the sample trees is shown in table 1 to detect the possible difference in crown characteristics among treatments one tree per treatment was harvested the measured structural indices included the number and basal diameter cm of the first order branches then the basal cross sectional area cm2 of each branch was calculated with its diameter and the total branch cross sectional area of each canopy layer cm2 was summed after measuring the crown structure all branches were cut off from the trunk the total branch biomass kg of the upper middle and lower canopies were then calculated from the fresh branch weight and the tissue water content measured from representative subsamples 2 5 xylem anatomy and wood density measurements branch samples for anatomy measurement were fixed in faa 50 ethanol 10 formaldehyde and 5 acetic acid after transported back to the laboratory one segment from each branch sample was embedded in paraffin then cross sections of 10 25 µm thick were sliced by a rotary microtome leica rm2016 leica nusslock germany washed with xylene stained with safranin o 1 w v dehydrated with an ethanol series 50 75 100 and finally mounted with neutral balsam the whole slides were scanned with a panoramic scanner pannoramic midi 3dhistech inc budapest hungary for each image four fields of the two outermost growth rings were captured at 10 and 100 magnifications using software pannoramic viewer v 1 15 3 3dhistech inc budapest hungary the secondary xylem of p tomentosa was mainly composed of vessels and fibers fig 1 so the present study focused on the anatomical structure of these two types of cells according to the measurement criteria summarized by scholz et al 2013 imagej software national institutes of health bethesda md usa was used to measure the vessel arithmetic diameter d μm the equivalent circle diameter calculated from each single vessel lumen area vessel density vd n mm 2 vessel number per unit

v g the ratio of the total vessel number to the sum of vessel groupings and solitary vessels with a higher v g indicating a greater degree of vessel connection double fiber wall thickness t f μm thickness of the double wall between adjacent fibers fiber lumen diameter d f μm the arithmetic diameter of fiber and fiber wall to lumen ratio t f d f vessel hydraulic diameter d h μm was calculated by eq 1 tyree and zimmermann 2002 a total of over 30000 vessels and 7000 fibers were measured in this study 1 d h d 4 n 4 where d μm and n are the diameter and number of vessels in the same micrograph branch samples for wood density measurement were debarked and the fresh volume cm3 of the remaining sapwood was measured by the water displacement method the sample was then oven dried at 65 c for at least 48 h until constant weight wood density wd g cm 3 was expressed as the ratio of dry mass to fresh volume 2 6 theoretical hydraulic traits the potential sapwood specific hydraulic conductivity k p kg m 1 mpa 1 s 1 was calculated according to the hagen poiseuille equation eq 2 poorter et al 2010 2 k p π ρ w 128 η vd d h 4 where vd is vessel density n mm 2 d h is vessel hydraulic diameter μm ρ w is density of water at 20 c 998 2 kg m 3 and η is viscosity of water at 20 c 1 002 10 3 pa s although the theoretical parameter overestimates the actual specific sapwood conductivity due to its assumption of all vessels in the sapwood having ideal structure and being fully functional it was widely adopted as a comparative measure and proved to be well correlated with the empirical sapwood hydraulic conductivity chen et al 2020 vessel wall reinforcement t b 2 was calculated by the square of the ratio of double vessel wall thickness t to vessel arithmetic diameter treat d as b this trait indicates the vessel wall resistance to implosion induced by xylem negative pressure which was a wide applied proxy for xylem embolism resistance hacke et al 2001 guet et al 2015 all anatomical and hydraulic traits measured or calculated in the present study are listed in table 2 2 7 data analysis data analyses were performed using r v 4 1 2 r development core team 2021 and origin 2021 originlab northampton ma usa prior to statistical analyses all the data were tested for normality and homoscedasticity with the levenetest function of the car package and shapiro test function among all traits the original data of vd t f t f d f k p and t b 2 were log10 transformed to meet the normality and homoscedasticity two way analysis of variance anova was carried out to determine the effect of treatment t and canopy position cp and their interactions on the eleven selected xylem traits with the following linear model trait t cp t cp for the variables which had no significant interaction effect one way anova was used to test the main effects of canopy position and treatment one way anova was also used to test the difference in plant growth among treatments multi comparisons among values were conducted using the tukey s hsd post hoc correlations between traits were analyzed by pearson correlation test with the cor test function the linear regression model was performed using lm function all differences were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 effects of irrigation and fertigation on tree growth and canopy structure long term irrigation and fertigation affected the tree growth and canopy structure to different degrees compared to ck both the dbh and tree height were improved by irrigation wh and the two fertigation treatments whn and wln but the significance only exists between ck and wh p 0 05 table 1 the observation of crown structure from one tree per treatment showed that although the number of the first order branch was similar among treatments branch biomass and cross sectional area were evidently enhanced in wh and wln fig s2 a supplementary anatomical study proved that the basal cross sectional area was positively related to the secondary xylem area mm2 measured from anatomical photos r 2 0 907 p 0 001 fig s3 indicating that trees with higher total branch cross sectional area had more potential xylem transport area thus wh and wln might improve the total water conducting area of the branches appropriately however in whn both branch biomass and cross sectional area decreased slightly fig s2 3 2 xylem features of p tomentosa as a diffuse porous tree species there was no evident radial variation in d within a growth ring of p tomentosa except for a single row of larger vessels at the ring boundary fig 1 vessel diameter distribution showed a unimodal shape in each canopy layer for all treatments with 96 of the vessels being distributed within the diameter range of 20 60 µm fig 2 vessels were primarily grouped in radial multiples and clusters fig 1 fibers were the main component of xylem and exhibited specific strengthening and protective tissue features with thick walls and narrow lumens the average values of each xylem trait on the species level are shown in table 2 3 3 variations in xylem traits across canopy layers and treatments according to the results of two way anova xylem traits were significantly affected by the main factor of canopy position or treatment except for t and k p however the interaction effect between canopy position and treatment was not found in all traits p 0 05 indicating that the responses of xylem traits to treatment and canopy position were mutually independent table 3 therefore comparisons were made between canopy layers and between treatments separately across canopy heights d h vd vf d f t f d f and t b 2 varied significantly p 0 05 both vessel d h and fiber d f exhibited the largest cell diameter in the lower canopy then decreased acropetally and showed the smallest values in the upper canopy fig 3a f reverse axial variations were observed for vd and t f d f which increased from the bottom to the top of canopy fig 3b h there were also increasing trends in vf and t b 2 with canopy height but the highest t b 2 was found in the middle canopy fig 3c b v g t t f and k p showed no significant variations within the crown figs 3d 3e 3g 4a wood density also varied with canopy height with upper and middle canopy layers showing significantly denser wood compared to the lower canopy fig 4c when comparing among treatments none of traits showed significant difference between wn treatments and ck figs 3 4 however there was still a significant effect of treatment on v g d f and t f p 0 05 but the differences only emerged between high irrigation plus high fertilization treatment whn and high irrigation treatment wh with whn exhibiting significantly lower values p 0 05 fig 3d f g this suggested a negative effect of n addition on these traits under well water conditions other anatomical and hydraulic traits including d h vd vf t t f d f k p and t b 2 all revealed limited plasticity and showed no significant variations among treatments p 0 05 figs 3 4 3 4 correlations between xylem traits significant correlations were observed between traits fig 5 across treatments wd was positively correlated to vd v g t f t f d f and t b 2 but negatively correlated to d h d f and k p p 0 05 among all anatomical traits t f d f vd and d h explained the highest variations indicated by the highest r 2 of wd fig 6 anatomical and hydraulic functional traits were also closely related hydraulic efficiency of sapwood k p was positively correlated to d h vf and t but negatively correlated to vd and v g p 0 05 fig 5 embolism resistance t b 2 was positively correlated to vd v g t t f and t f d f while negatively correlated to d h and d f p 0 05 fig 5 a tight negative correlation trade off between vessel diameter and vessel density was also found p 0 05 fig 5 the core information of our findings is summarized in fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 response of tree growth to irrigation and fertigation after applying irrigation and fertigation for four years both the height and diameter growth of p tomentosa plantation was significantly improved by irrigation treatment wh while n fertilization under both high whn and low wln watering regimes did not show a significantly promotive effect on tree growth table 1 additional input of n fertilizer whn even diminished the significant positive effect of full irrigation on tree growth table 1 this result was consistent with our previous finding in an adjacent plantation with the same clone but different irrigation method drip irrigation at younger ages 2 3 years old he et al 2020 2021 indicating that soil water availability rather than soil n was the primary factor confining p tomentosa plantation growth in this region nonetheless symptoms of drought stress such as leaf shedding or canopy dieback which have been found widespread in poplar plantations in northern china ji et al 2019 fang et al 2020 were not observed in our plantations under rain fed condition ck this suggested that water limitation to p tomentosa growth was not severe in the study region having the semi humid climate with relatively adequate precipitation but the improvement of water availability in shallow soil by appropriate irrigation regimes can still effectively help poplar plantations reach higher growth potential xi et al 2021 he et al 2021 this finding is consistent with the observation by xi et al 2016 which showed that the growth of p tomentosa was mostly determined by soil water availability in the shallow layer besides our finding implies that the necessity of n fertigation for cultivating p tomentosa plantations in this region needs further consideration given that little growth promotion benefit has been found 4 2 plasticity of xylem to irrigation and fertigation contrary to our first hypothesis none of the xylem traits showed significant differences in wh whn and wln when compared to ck indicating a conserved plasticity of branch xylem after four year treatments figs 3 4 as the principal anatomical basis and good proxies for xylem hydraulic efficiency vessel hydraulic diameter vessel density vessel fraction and specific hydraulic conductivity were not enhanced by any treatment even in wh which achieved the highest growth in both tree height and diameter figs 3 4 table 1 high growth rate is always facilitated by high levels of transpiration and hydraulic efficiency poorter et al 2010 hoeber et al 2014 hajek et al 2014 changes in xylem anatomical structure under increasing decreasing soil water availabilities have also been widely documented awad et al 2010 de oliveira et al 2018 however in the present study these traditional efficiency linked traits showed limited response to environmental change and exhibited a decoupling pattern with tree growth in fact the water delivery capacity of tree canopies can be determined by factors beyond xylem anatomical traits our recent study showed that p tomentosa exhibited a plastic stomatal behavior so increasing soil water availability by both irrigation and precipitation could result in a more anisohydric stomatal regulation strategy guo et al 2023 the looser stomatal control of anisohydric plants allows for continuous carbon acquisition under a wide range of water conditions and thus may help to achieve a higher growth rate attia et al 2015 found that the anisohydric poplar genotypes achieved higher growth rate than isohydric genotypes under well water condition hence it can be inferred that the promoted growth of full irrigated plantation wh may benefit from the alteration of stomatal regulation strategy besides at the organ level difference in crown structure was also detected among treatments with the full irrigated trees wh showed a doubled xylem area in the first order branch than ck fig s2 plavcová and hacke 2012 found that stem hydraulic conductivity was mainly driven by the size of xylem cross sectional area so the evidently enlarged branch xylem area in wh will facilitate the water transport capacity of the whole crown for a given stable specific hydraulic conductivity the effect of irrigation and fertigation on crown structure has also been reported in a previous study albaugh et al 2006 however only one tree was harvested for crown measurement in each treatment for the present study future research with more replications is still needed to confirm the aforementioned inference in our study n fertigation under neither high whn nor low wln water conditions showed evident effect on xylem anatomical and hydraulic traits figs 3 4 the result was similar to yu et al 2022 who found that nitrogen addition did not alter the earlywood vessel anatomical structure and potential hydraulic conductivity of quercus acutissima regardless of precipitation indeed the effect of n on plant xylem is complex given that the responses may depend on the n addition level in the study of wang et al 2016 and zhang et al 2021 the most evident responses of vessel structure and hydraulic function to n addition appeared at medium n addition level therefore that the amount of n applied in the current study may be insufficient or excessive to trigger anatomical response in p tomentosa however an effect of n still emerged on vessel grouping index fiber lumen diameter and double fiber wall thickness specifically under high irrigation condition with significantly lower values being in whn than in wh fig 3 vessel grouping index is a measure of vessel connection but the role of inter vessel connections in hydraulic function both efficiency and safety is still under debate some views perceive that greater connections can improve xylem hydraulic integration so that more alternative ways are available for water flow to bypass the embolized vessels through the connected functional ones thus reducing the loss of hydraulic conductivity under cavitation events levionnois et al 2021 lemaire et al 2021 whereas an opposite theory deems that these pathways can also facilitate the spread of air bubbles between adjacent vessels subsequently increasing the vulnerability of embolism loepfe et al 2007 based on the xylem traits investigated here we cannot directly clarify the actual correlation between vessel connection and hydraulic function yet our results revealed that both tree growth and branch biomass were higher in wh compared to whn fig s2 table 1 thus it can be inferred that a more connected vessel network possibly reduced the negative effect of embolism and promoted crown development in wh the decrease in fiber lumen diameter and fiber wall thickness by n addition were consist with some previous studies nyakuengama et al 2003 luo et al 2005 plavcová et al 2013 found that in hybrid poplar high n treatment downregulated genes encoding known transcriptional regulators of secondary cell wall deposition which would result in thinner fiber walls as we observed here however rather than the effect on xylem hydraulic function changes in these fiber characteristics were more likely to influence the quality and utilization suitability of wood which are just the wood properties that people are very concerned about since p tomentosa is considered as an excellent pulping material ma et al 2015 sang et al 2021 4 3 spatial variations of xylem traits within the crown unlike the conserved plasticity found among treatments canopy height served as a stronger predictor of trait variations in branch xylem in accordance with our second hypothesis most of the anatomical and hydraulic traits varied axially within the canopy toward the treetop vessel diameter d h decreased while vessel density vd increased in tandem the increased vd in part compensated for the loss of vessel fraction vf ensued from the reduced vessel size leading to a higher conducting area in the uppermost branches fig 3 however hydraulic conductivity k p remained constant across the vertical gradients of the canopy the axial variations of vessel structure and hydraulic conductivity recorded here differed from many previous studies showing that the upper branches developing under conditions of higher radiation heat loading and wind speed environment were more conductive than the lower shaded branches burgess et al 2006 sellin et al 2010 sellin and lubenets 2010 and vessel diameter also increased acropetally to facilitate transport efficiency and photosynthesis alber et al 2019 the decrease tendency of vessel diameter observed in the present study was similar to the tapering pattern usually found in the main stem jasińska et al 2015 alber et al 2019 or along aridity gradients pfautsch et al 2016 this suggests that the upper branches were exposed to some extent of water limitation which was possibly induced by the longer pathlength and decreasing xylem pressure with increasing canopy height ryan and yoder 1997 koch et al 2004 changes in other xylem traits supported this inference the wall to lumen ratio of both fiber t f d f and vessel t b 2 increased evidently with canopy height p 0 05 fig 3 such improvements provided xylem with better mechanical support which consequently improves embolism resistance by preventing vessel implosion under extreme negative pressure hacke et al 2001 jacobsen et al 2005 due to the changes in vessel and fiber anatomical structure branch wood density also increased with canopy height p 0 05 fig 4 as an integral trait summarizing the variation of multiple anatomical characteristics wood density shows complex correlations with wood functional traits barotto et al 2018 plavcová et al 2019 and is closely linked to the growth and survival of plants chave et al 2009 poorter et al 2010 greenwood et al 2017 serra maluquer et al 2022 denser wood was proved to have better embolism resistance and drought tolerance hacke et al 2001 on the basis of all the trait variations mentioned above it is obvious that branches from different canopy layers were constructed with different hydraulic strategies the upper canopy showed greater hydraulic and mechanical safety compared to the middle and lower canopies while hydraulic efficiency was similar along the canopy height due to the flexible adjustment of vessel size and frequency these findings suggested that p tomentosa perhaps prioritize hydraulic safety over efficiency when constructing branch xylem which may benefit a constant and balanced water allocation in the whole tree crown and further optimize carbon assimilation and tree growth admittedly there were still limitations of the current study given that the conclusion was built mostly on the analysis of xylem anatomical traits at the microscopic level while the in situ plant hydraulics and growth may be affected by broader traits and their interactions with the environment for example the ultrastructure of pits also strongly affects xylem hydraulic functions levionnois et al 2021 besides compared to the conserved plasticity of xylem structural traits physiological traits such as sap flow dynamics xylem embolism stomatal control and gas exchange might respond more readily to the environmental stimuli and thus are better proxies for predicting tree growth consequently further investigation should shed light on these traits which could help to better understand the response mechanisms of p tomentosa plantation to the management practices and changing environment 5 conclusion the present study investigated the effects of long term irrigation and additional n fertilization on the xylem anatomical structure and hydraulic function of branches from different canopy layers in p tomentosa we found that tree growth was only significantly improved by irrigation while the additional n fertilization showed no cumulation effect and even diminished the positive effect of irrigation this finding suggests that water rather than soil n was the main limiting factor for p tomentosa plantation growth in this region so sufficient irrigation is required to enhance forest productivity branch xylem anatomy and hydraulics exhibited conserved plasticity to all the irrigation and fertigation treatments and seems to be decoupled with tree growth other factors like the alterations of stomatal regulation strategy and crown structure with soil water and n availabilities might better explain the difference of tree growth in contrary to the effect of irrigation and fertigation canopy height played a greater influence on branch xylem traits resulting in increased hydraulic safety towards apices without compromising hydraulic efficiency the adjustments of hydraulic safety and efficiency along canopy profile can potentially be translated into resistance and productivity at the whole tree level therefore branches at different canopy heights may contribute differently to the overall tree growth resistance and resilience overall findings of this study offer additional insights into the influence mechanisms of water and fertilizer management on the growth of fast growing tree species from the perspective of plant hydraulics and would also help to predict the dynamics of structure and function of plantation forests under environmental change the structure function relationship observed in this study could provide a guidance on designing and refining the pruning practice given pruning branches of different canopy layers may result in different influences on tree performance and stand structure with consequences to the productivity and sustainability of poplar plantations

9089,on poorly drained grassland farms in ireland stone aggregates remain the only in field drain envelope material used by contractors a variety of aggregate sizes and lithologies are currently in use but their performance in clay textured mineral soils is unknown in practice this may result in ad hoc system performance and a varied lifespan due to sediment ingress the aim of this study was to evaluate the hydraulic and filter performance of a range of aggregate gradations in clay textured mineral soils nine aggregates three replicates of each were examined in laboratory units containing clay textured soil with a perforated drainpipe surrounded by an aggregate envelope ranging in size from 0 7 to 62 mm and a constant 0 4 m head of water above the soil surface to determine the hydraulic performance of the envelope the discharge rate of water through the drainage pipe outlet was measured over 38 days to determine the filter performance sediment loss sediment settlement in the drainpipe and ingress of sediment into the envelope were measured the results indicated that only aggregates in the 0 7 19 mm size range performed adequately from both the hydraulic and filter perspectives and were deemed suitable for use with a clay textured soil discharge appeared to be inversely related to aggregate size with larger discharges being measured in the smaller aggregate sizes and smaller discharges measured in the larger aggregate sizes exception aggregate 2 for all aggregates examined discharge was greatest at the start of the experiment before reducing over time

and filter performance is an appropriate type and size of envelope material to surround the drainage pipe yannopoulos et al 2020 the drain envelope must offer proficiency in a number of functions such as protecting the drainpipe from excessive sedimentation and reducing water entry resistance around the pipe and surrounding soil an envelope with a higher hydraulic conductivity than the surrounding soil reduces the entrance resistance resistance of approach flow into the pipe so that no hydraulic pressure will build up in the surrounding soil stuyt et al 2005 vlotman et al 2020 in theory the entrance resistance of a drainage system is a material constant but in practice it may be seriously reduced due to particle deposits at the soil envelope interface or in the envelope the entrance resistance of a drainage system depends on soil texture and evolves with time dierickx 1993 aggregates such as river run gravel or crushed stone are commonly used in temperate climates with moderate to heavy lower hydraulic conductivity soil textures to keep the water table below a depth of 0 45 m in order to maximise grass growth and trafficability teagasc 2022 they improve the hydraulic

combination of factors such as the scale and system of farming undertaken the type of drainage system the abundance of mineral aggregate and the historical use of aggregate for drainage byrne et al 2022 typical aggregate sizes used in different regions range from 0 2 to 4 0 mm in finland luoko 2020 5 50 mm in the united kingdom ahdb 2018 and 10 40 mm is recommended in ireland teagasc 2022 byrne et al 2022 conducted a review of the availability of aggregate throughout ireland eighty six quarries across ireland were surveyed which classified the distribution type popularity size and availability of aggregates for land drainage systems the average size of the aggregate available was 41 mm the most commonly used sizes ranged from 2 to 62 mm representing the vast majority of aggregate sizes available throughout ireland this study found that the most commonly used aggregate size is unsuitable for the majority of moderate to heavy lower hydraulic conductivity soil types encountered using 74 aggregates characterised in the study three filter design criteria scs 1988 sherard et al 1984 terzaghi and peck 1961 were applied to five soil types clay clay loam loam silty clay loam and silt loam only 31 met the scs 1988 criterion and 11 met the terzaghi and peck 1961 criterion for a loam soil texture the sherard et al 1984 design criterion was not applicable for this soil texture the study concluded that there was a need for guidelines for aggregates based on both the hydraulic and filter performance of the drainage envelope in moderate to lower hydraulic conductivity soil types currently the recommended 10 40 mm aggregate sizes are based on field observations teagasc 2022 but no data exist on their applicability and suitability in clay textured soils these recommendations are primarily based on filtration recommendations and although clay textured soils have a higher structural strength after settlement they may be needed to provide temporary filtering functions it has been suggested that soil with a clay content of 30 does not need an envelope around a drainpipe stuyt et al 2005 vlotman et al 2020 however the use of an aggregate envelope increases drain spacing by increasing the effective radius of the drainpipe and provides other additional benefits such as a conduit of flow in shallow drainage systems where mole ploughs and sub soilers have a direct connection to the drainpipe through the aggregate envelope therefore there is a need to identify if hydraulic conductivity and effective radius can be maximised based on choosing a more suitable aggregate size along with providing initial filtering capabilities laboratory evaluation of an envelope system is useful as a simple and easily reproducible method for evaluating various envelope materials and scenarios at a low cost dierickx 1989 it is also useful to test the functional properties of drain envelopes such as their ability to retain soil particles and prevent invasion of soil particles into the envelope the blocking or immediate reduction of hydraulic conductivity of an envelope in contact with soil and the decrease in hydraulic conductivity of an envelope over time due to particle accumulation or if the envelope material is too fine el sadany salem et al 1995 in the current study the range of aggregate gradations from 0 7 to 62 mm in size representing the most commonly available aggregate sizes throughout ireland 2 62 mm and a 0 7 3 mm aggregate satisfying the scs 1988 criterion were tested in laboratory units to identify a subset of optimal aggregate ranges for use in clay textured soils which should subsequently be tested in situ in the field the overall objective of this study was to evaluate the hydraulic and filter performance of a range of aggregate gradations in clay textured mineral soils to achieve this objective the experiments aimed to 1 assess the hydraulic and 2 filter performance of commonly used gravel aggregates as envelope materials for use in clay textured soils and 3 rank the aggregates based on their hydraulic and filter performance and cost for use in clay textured soils 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and stone aggregate selection a clay textured soil was collected from the teagasc solohead research farm latitude 52 51 n 08 21 w altitude 95 m a s l and dried in 2 kg batches for 24 hr at 110 ºc then milled to pass a 2 mm sieve grade the textural class was determined according to astm 2021 7 sand silt 37 clay 56 clay texture eight commonly used envelope material aggregates in ireland were selected table 1 an additional aggregate was used in the experiments aggregate 1 in table 1 which satisfied the aggregate selection criteria for a clay textured soil as defined by the soil conservation service scs 1988 this allowed for comparison with an idealised aggregate 2 2 experimental set up and performance criteria in total 27 units fig 1 each 0 57 m in diameter and 0 93 m deep were constructed and replicated at n 3 for each aggregate size examined each unit consisted of three components clay textured soil an aggregate treatment and a drainpipe a standard 80 mm corrugated pipe with perforations 2 mm 15 mm in size discharging to a collection tank a 0 08 m diameter drainpipe was located 0 15 m from the bottom of the tank in order to obtain reproducibility and determine aggregate suitability based on the soil textural component dry milled soil 2 mm was filled to a depth of 0 02 m at the bottom of the tank which was overlain by 0 21 m of the chosen aggregate to the top of the drainpipe and compacted using a tamping device 0 3 m diameter round base with a 5 kg weight dropped from a height of 0 6 m in order to ensure no settlement around the drainpipe occurred during the experiment an additional 0 15 m of aggregate was added over the drainpipe and tamping was repeated finally the aggregate was overlain by a 0 15 m deep layer of soil compacted in incremental layers to a wet density of 964 6 kg m 3 the edges of each layer of soil were pressed against the walls of the container by hand to ensure no by pass flow occurred during the experiment nylon straps were added to the tank to prevent bulging at the soil layer and paraffin wax was applied at the edges of the top layer to prevent by pass flow each unit was filled with potable water to a height of 0 4 m above the soil surface which remained constant over the duration of the experiment using an overflow pipe in order to prevent damage to the top layer of soil during the initial flow of water into the tank an aluminium tray 0 2 0 2 0 05 m was used to disperse the water this tray was subsequently removed once a constant head was achieved the units were routinely monitored for discharge rate and sediment loss over a total experimental duration of 38 days in order to normalise data units are expressed as l m 1 of pipe cumulatively 0 08 m dia sediment loss was measured in accordance with standard methods bs 2005 the sediment loss concentrations were multiplied by the discharge rate to estimate the total sediment loss g m 1 of drainpipe daily and cumulatively at the end of the experiment all the sediment that had settled in the drainpipe was collected and weighed and the experimental units were destructively sampled the top soil layer and a 0 05 m layer of aggregate were discarded samples of the remaining envelope material from directly above the pipe were then taken all of the fine material 2 mm was washed from the gravel and subsequently dried and weighed with the results expressed in g of soil in this study failure of the envelope was defined after stuyt et al 2005 as when the soil structure was observed to collapse or when there was excessive movement of soil through the envelope material within the first 24 hr of operation the hydraulic performance was assessed on the ability of the drain setup to discharge at least 0 54 mm hr 1 mean intensity of rainfall across 7 sites during a high rainfall period tuohy et al 2018 and the filter performance was assessed by the amount of sediment settled in the drainpipe during the experiment this should be 25 of the total volume of the drainpipe in order to ensure an excessive reduction in discharge does not occur vlotman et al 2020 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa a univariate analysis of the data was conducted to determine normality the data were shown to be non normally distributed following this the effects of envelope function in relation to daily drainpipe discharge rate and daily drainpipe sediment loss across 9 aggregate distributions were measured using the proc mixed procedure reml estimation method profile residual variance method model based fixed effects se method and residual degrees of freedom method with repeated measures where time was a factor t 10 19 and 38 statistical significance was assumed at a value of p 0 05 3 results aggregates 6 7 8 and 9 were deemed to have met the criteria for failure within the first 24 hr of starting the experiment aggregates 1 5 achieved the hydraulic and filter performance criteria for the entire 38 day experimental period the cumulative discharge from the five aggregates over the experiment duration ranged from 17751 to 27542 l m 1 of pipe the cumulative sediment losses ranged from 13 to 62 g m 1 of pipe 3 1 hydraulic discharge and sediment loss performance the majority of discharge 67 average across all treatments occurred within the initial 14 day period of the experiment fig 2 on day 38 the five aggregates had an average daily difference of 0 74 mm hr 1 between the highest and lowest discharges the lowest discharge was observed from aggregate 5 on day 38 where a discharge rate of 1 3 mm hr 1 was observed fig 3 most of the sediment loss occurred within the first 8 days of the experiment aggregate 1 lost 34 g m 1 of pipe 55 of the total loss within this time period followed by aggregates 4 67 3 68 and 5 82 fig 4 3 2 envelope and pipe sedimentation sampling of the envelope after completion of the experiment fig 5a indicated that aggregate 1 had the lowest incursion of soil into the envelope 640 g while the worst performing aggregate was aggregate 3 5699 g three other aggregates had soil incursions ranging between 3406 g aggregate 2 and 4251 g aggregate 4 fig 5b shows the amount of sediment deposited in the pipe after the end of the experiment values ranged from 0 54 g m 1 of pipe aggregate 1 to 1 31 g m 1 of pipe aggregate 4 the amount of sediment settled within the pipe was insufficient to reduce the drainpipe volume by 25 across any of the treatments so therefore it was judged to pass the sediment function criterion 3 3 data aggregation for aggregate selection in order to determine the suitability of the aggregates across the three factors of discharge sediment loss and pipe envelope sedimentation a ranking system was developed table 2 shows the overall suitability of each aggregate range results showed that aggregates 19 mm in size while cost effective are not suitable for use as drainage envelopes due to their early failure aggregates in the 0 7 19 mm range performed favourably from both hydraulic and filter performance perspectives and are deemed suitable 4 discussion 4 1 hydraulic and filter performance aggregates 6 7 8 and 9 were deemed to have met the criteria for failure which occurred within the first 24 hr of starting the experiment and are considered unsuitable for use the ability of the envelope to hold back sediment in the unstructured clay textured soil similar to trench backfill was compromised above an aggregate size of 20 mm resulting in soil incursion into the envelope dierickx 1993 the envelope should function initially during the settlement period to prevent excessive incursion of sediment into the aggregate envelope and provide a filter function therefore a balance between the hydraulic and filter performance of the envelope is needed initially during settlement these findings have the following implications larger aggregate sizes 20 mm when used as envelope material enable backfill topsoil to pass through the stone envelope and into the drainpipe during the settlement period some of this sediment will remain in the aggregate envelope reducing permeability and may be available to be mobilised over time the most commonly used aggregate sizes in ireland are 50 mm and 20 to 40 mm stone aggregate respectively byrne et al 2022 the teagasc drainage manual teagasc 2022 recommends an aggregate size in the 10 40 mm range with optimum performance in the 10 20 mm range based on these findings pending field trials aggregates greater than 20 mm in diameter should not be recommended in the future aggregate sizes greater than 20 mm in diameter are more cost effective which may deter the use of aggregate sizes less than 20 mm in diameter byrne et al 2023 have conducted a laboratory experiment to determine the suitability of geotextile materials as an alternative or complement to stone aggregate in clay textured soils in an effort to reduce drainage system costs the remaining discussion will relate to aggregate 1 5 only due to the stable nature of clay textured soils in situ incursion of sediment into the envelope is considered low risk in the long term however the potential for blocking during the initial period of settlement is the major risk associated with the introduction of trench backfill before equilibrium within the soil is achieved vlotman et al 1993 where an envelope prevents excessive incursion of sediment in clay textured soils the envelope should then function to maximise the hydraulic performance of the entire system ahdb 2018 and teagasc 2022 recommend the use of permeable backfill even in consolidated clay textured soils to maintain the permeability in the drain trench and maintain an increased effective radius even as the permeability of the trench backfill reduces over time it is suggested that stable clay soils do not need an envelope stuyt et al 2005 vlotman et al 2020 but in turkey for example aggregate envelopes are used to improve the hydraulic conditions around the pipe in clay textured soils bahceci et al 2018 all five aggregates aggregate 1 5 prevented excessive sediment incursion so the focus of in situ field research should be to increase the effective radius in the stable clay soils once settlement has occurred as aggregate 1 5 exceeded the hydraulic performance criterion of 0 54 mm hr 1 they are suitable from a hydraulic performance perspective and are recommended for in situ field trials discharge appeared to be inversely related to aggregate size with larger discharges being measured in the smaller aggregate sizes and smaller discharges measured in the larger aggregate sizes exception aggregate 2 unlike the discharge measurements there was no relationship between aggregate size and sediment loss all five aggregates performed effectively to limit sediment incursion into the envelope and the drainpipe and were deemed suitable based on the filter performance criterion 25 reduction in drainpipe capacity but aggregate 1 0 7 3 mm lost the most amount of sediment through the drainpipe fig 2 this can be assumed to be fine material lost from the envelope itself 2 mm and may be attributed to the envelope material being lost through the 2 15 mm drainpipe perforations this shows the importance of selecting a granular material based on both the base soil and the drainpipe perforations dierickx 1993 aggregate 1 was selected to meet the scs 1988 criterion but was not fully suitable for the drainpipe perforations commonly used although it performed effectively as an envelope some washing of the envelope material into and through the drainpipe at this gradation occurred and should be expected when using 2 15 mm drainage perforations with this loss of fine material from the envelope itself aggregate 1 still performed effectively as a filter and the sediment lost into the drainpipe was not in large enough quantities to violate the filter performance criterion 25 reduction 5 conclusions overall aggregates ranging in size from 0 7 to 19 mm performed adequately in terms of hydraulic and filter performance and were deemed suitable for subsequent in situ field trials the results showed that increasing aggregate size resulted in decreased hydraulic performance the lowest amount of soil in the pipe and in the envelope at the end of the experimental period was observed in aggregate 1 0 7 3 mm and cumulative discharge rates were aligned with initial sediment incursion rates at the start of the experimental period when the cost of the aggregate material is also considered aggregates in the lower range are 18 50 more expensive than aggregates in the higher range which would be optimal from a performance and cost point of view contractors and landowners

the most commonly available aggregate sizes throughout ireland 2 62 mm and a 0 7 3 mm aggregate satisfying the scs 1988 criterion were tested in laboratory units to identify a subset of optimal aggregate ranges for use in clay textured soils which should subsequently be tested in situ in the field the overall objective of this study was to evaluate the hydraulic and filter performance of a range of aggregate gradations in clay textured mineral soils to achieve this objective the experiments aimed to 1 assess the hydraulic and 2 filter performance of commonly used gravel aggregates as envelope materials for use in clay textured soils and 3 rank the aggregates based on their hydraulic and filter performance and cost for use in clay textured soils 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and stone aggregate selection a clay textured soil was collected from the teagasc solohead research farm latitude 52 51 n 08 21 w altitude 95 m a s l and dried in 2 kg batches for 24 hr at 110 ºc then milled to pass a 2 mm sieve grade the textural class was determined according to astm 2021 7 sand silt 37 clay 56 clay texture eight commonly used envelope material aggregates in ireland were selected table 1 an additional aggregate was used in the experiments aggregate 1 in table 1 which satisfied the aggregate selection criteria for a clay textured soil as defined by the soil conservation service scs 1988 this allowed for comparison with an idealised aggregate 2 2 experimental set up and performance criteria in total 27 units fig 1 each 0 57 m in diameter and 0 93 m deep were constructed and replicated at n 3 for each aggregate size examined each unit consisted of three components clay textured soil an aggregate treatment and a drainpipe a standard 80 mm corrugated pipe with perforations 2 mm 15 mm in size discharging to a collection tank a 0 08 m diameter drainpipe was located 0 15 m from the bottom of the tank in order to obtain reproducibility and determine aggregate suitability based on the soil textural component dry milled soil 2 mm was filled to a depth of 0 02 m at the bottom of the tank which was overlain by 0 21 m of the chosen aggregate to the top of the drainpipe and compacted using a tamping device 0 3 m diameter round base with a 5 kg weight dropped from a height of 0 6 m in order to ensure no settlement around the drainpipe occurred during the experiment an additional 0 15 m of aggregate was added over the drainpipe and tamping was repeated finally the aggregate was overlain by a 0 15 m deep layer of soil compacted in incremental layers to a wet density of 964 6 kg m 3 the edges of each layer of soil were pressed against the walls of the container by hand to ensure no by pass flow occurred during the experiment nylon straps were added to the tank to prevent bulging at the soil layer and paraffin wax was applied at the edges of the top layer to prevent by pass flow each unit was filled with potable water to a height of 0 4 m above the soil surface which remained constant over the duration of the experiment using an overflow pipe in order to prevent damage to the top layer of soil during the initial flow of water into the tank an aluminium tray 0 2 0 2 0 05 m was used to disperse the water this tray was subsequently removed once a constant head was achieved the units were routinely monitored for discharge rate and sediment loss over a total experimental duration of 38 days in order to normalise data units are expressed as l m 1 of pipe cumulatively 0 08 m dia sediment loss was measured in accordance with standard methods bs 2005 the sediment loss concentrations were multiplied by the discharge rate to estimate the total sediment loss g m 1 of drainpipe daily and cumulatively at the end of the experiment all the sediment that had settled in the drainpipe was collected and weighed and the experimental units were destructively sampled the top soil layer and a 0 05 m layer of aggregate were discarded samples of the remaining envelope material from directly above the pipe were then taken all of the fine material 2 mm was washed from the gravel and subsequently dried and weighed with the results expressed in g of soil in this study failure of the envelope was defined after stuyt et al 2005 as when the soil structure was observed to collapse or when there was excessive movement of soil through the envelope material within the first 24 hr of operation the hydraulic performance was assessed on the ability of the drain setup to discharge at least 0 54 mm hr 1 mean intensity of rainfall across 7 sites during a high rainfall period tuohy et al 2018 and the filter performance was assessed by the amount of sediment settled in the drainpipe during the experiment this should be 25 of the total volume of the drainpipe in order to ensure an excessive reduction in discharge does not occur vlotman et al 2020 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa a univariate analysis of the data was conducted to determine normality the data were shown to be non normally distributed following this the effects of envelope function in relation to daily drainpipe discharge rate and daily drainpipe sediment loss across 9 aggregate distributions were measured using the proc mixed procedure reml estimation method profile residual variance method model based fixed effects se method and residual degrees of freedom method with repeated measures where time was a factor t 10 19 and 38 statistical significance was assumed at a value of p 0 05 3 results aggregates 6 7 8 and 9 were deemed to have met the criteria for failure within the first 24 hr of starting the experiment aggregates 1 5 achieved the hydraulic and filter performance criteria for the entire 38 day experimental period the cumulative discharge from the five aggregates over the experiment duration ranged from 17751 to 27542 l m 1 of pipe the cumulative sediment losses ranged from 13 to 62 g m 1 of pipe 3 1 hydraulic discharge and sediment loss performance the majority of discharge 67 average across all treatments occurred within the initial 14 day period of the experiment fig 2 on day 38 the five aggregates had an average daily difference of 0 74 mm hr 1 between the highest and lowest discharges the lowest discharge was observed from aggregate 5 on day 38 where a discharge rate of 1 3 mm hr 1 was observed fig 3 most of the sediment loss occurred within the first 8 days of the experiment aggregate 1 lost 34 g m 1 of pipe 55 of the total loss within this time period followed by aggregates 4 67 3 68 and 5 82 fig 4 3 2 envelope and pipe sedimentation sampling of the envelope after completion of the experiment fig 5a indicated that aggregate 1 had the lowest incursion of soil into the envelope 640 g while the worst performing aggregate was aggregate 3 5699 g three other aggregates had soil incursions ranging between 3406 g aggregate 2 and 4251 g aggregate 4 fig 5b shows the amount of sediment deposited in the pipe after the end of the experiment values ranged from 0 54 g m 1 of pipe aggregate 1 to 1 31 g m 1 of pipe aggregate 4 the amount of sediment settled within the pipe was insufficient to reduce the drainpipe volume by 25 across any of the treatments so therefore it was judged to pass the sediment function criterion 3 3 data aggregation for aggregate selection in order to determine the suitability of the aggregates across the three factors of discharge sediment loss and pipe envelope sedimentation a ranking system was developed table 2 shows the overall suitability of each aggregate range results showed that aggregates 19 mm in size while cost effective are not suitable for use as drainage envelopes due to their early failure aggregates in the 0 7 19 mm range performed favourably from both hydraulic and filter performance perspectives and are deemed suitable 4 discussion 4 1 hydraulic and filter performance aggregates 6 7 8 and 9 were deemed to have met the criteria for failure which occurred within the first 24 hr of starting the experiment and are considered unsuitable for use the ability of the envelope to hold back sediment in the unstructured clay textured soil similar to trench backfill was compromised above an aggregate size of 20 mm resulting in soil incursion into the envelope dierickx 1993 the envelope should function initially during the settlement period to prevent excessive incursion of sediment into the aggregate envelope and provide a filter function therefore a balance between the hydraulic and filter performance of the envelope is needed initially during settlement these findings have the following implications larger aggregate sizes 20 mm when used as envelope material enable backfill topsoil to pass through the stone envelope and into the drainpipe during the settlement period some of this sediment will remain in the aggregate envelope reducing permeability and may be available to be mobilised over time the most commonly used aggregate sizes in ireland are 50 mm and 20 to 40 mm stone aggregate respectively byrne et al 2022 the teagasc drainage manual teagasc 2022 recommends an aggregate size in the 10 40 mm range with optimum performance in the 10 20 mm range based on these findings pending field trials aggregates greater than 20 mm in diameter should not be recommended in the future aggregate sizes greater than 20 mm in diameter are more cost effective which may deter the use of aggregate sizes less than 20 mm in diameter byrne et al 2023 have conducted a laboratory experiment to determine the suitability of geotextile materials as an alternative or complement to stone aggregate in clay textured soils in an effort to reduce drainage system costs the remaining discussion will relate to aggregate 1 5 only due to the stable nature of clay textured soils in situ incursion of sediment into the envelope is considered low risk in the long term however the potential for blocking during the initial period of settlement is the major risk associated with the introduction of trench backfill before equilibrium within the soil is achieved vlotman et al 1993 where an envelope prevents excessive incursion of sediment in clay textured soils the envelope should then function to maximise the hydraulic performance of the entire system ahdb 2018 and teagasc 2022 recommend the use of permeable backfill even in consolidated clay textured soils to maintain the permeability in the drain trench and maintain an increased effective radius even as the permeability of the trench backfill reduces over time it is suggested that stable clay soils do not need an envelope stuyt et al 2005 vlotman et al 2020 but in turkey for example aggregate envelopes are used to improve the hydraulic conditions around the pipe in clay textured soils bahceci et al 2018 all five aggregates aggregate 1 5 prevented excessive sediment incursion so the focus of in situ field research should be to increase the effective radius in the stable clay soils once settlement has occurred as aggregate 1 5 exceeded the hydraulic performance criterion of 0 54 mm hr 1 they are suitable from a hydraulic performance perspective and are recommended for in situ field trials discharge appeared to be inversely related to aggregate size with larger discharges being measured in the smaller aggregate sizes and smaller discharges measured in the larger aggregate sizes exception aggregate 2 unlike the discharge measurements there was no relationship between aggregate size and sediment loss all five aggregates performed effectively to limit sediment incursion into the envelope and the drainpipe and were deemed suitable based on the filter performance criterion 25 reduction in drainpipe capacity but aggregate 1 0 7 3 mm lost the most amount of sediment through the drainpipe fig 2 this can be assumed to be fine material lost from the envelope itself 2 mm and may be attributed to the envelope material being lost through the 2 15 mm drainpipe perforations this shows the importance of selecting a granular material based on both the base soil and the drainpipe perforations dierickx 1993 aggregate 1 was selected to meet the scs 1988 criterion but was not fully suitable for the drainpipe perforations commonly used although it performed effectively as an envelope some washing of the envelope material into and through the drainpipe at this gradation occurred and should be expected when using 2 15 mm drainage perforations with this loss of fine material from the envelope itself aggregate 1 still performed effectively as a filter and the sediment lost into the drainpipe was not in large enough quantities to violate the filter performance criterion 25 reduction 5 conclusions overall aggregates ranging in size from 0 7 to 19 mm performed adequately in terms of hydraulic and filter performance and were deemed suitable for subsequent in situ field trials the results showed that increasing aggregate size resulted in decreased hydraulic performance the lowest amount of soil in the pipe and in the envelope at the end of the experimental period was observed in aggregate 1 0 7 3 mm and cumulative discharge rates were aligned with initial sediment incursion rates at the start of the experimental period when the cost of the aggregate material is also considered aggregates in the lower range are 18 50 more expensive than aggregates in the higher range which would be optimal from a performance and cost point of view contractors and landowners should provisionally source aggregates in these ranges for better performance and lifespan outcomes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
