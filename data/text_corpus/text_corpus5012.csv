25060,it is important to investigate the sustainability nexus using composite ecological efficiency eco efficiency indicators from quantitative and computational modeling perspectives to provide a more comprehensive measure of eco efficiency this paper develops three data envelopment analysis dea models incorporating metafrontier and undesirable outputs into a slacks based measure sbm an epsilon based measure ebm and minimum distance to weak efficient frontier mindw respectively named meta u sbm meta u ebm and meta u mindw we show theoretically if a decision making unit dmu is being meta u sbm efficient it is also being meta u ebm efficient and meta u mindw efficient and vice versa for each dmu its score measured by meta u mindw is the highest while its score measured by meta u sbm is the lowest using the proposed models we make a first empirical attempt at measuring the eco efficiency of the key environmental protection prefecture level cities in china from 2003 to 2015 the results show that 1 the eco efficiency of eastern cities performs the best followed by central cities and western cities cities not listed as resource based rb outperform rb cities 2 eastern cities are closer to metafrontier than central and western cities and 3 efficiency change and technological progress dominate the basic trend of the eco efficiency growth results derived from the proposed methodologies can help managers and policymakers in the city to assess sustainability development quantitatively and comprehensively they can also provide implications for the environmental management of sustainability development at city level policy implementations are presented based on the empirical results keywords eco efficiency metafrontier analysis ecological modeling sustainability nexus 1 introduction it is crucial to consider economic environmental and social systems holistically and simultaneously as a sustainability nexus which combines various sustainability principles related to resource economic and environmental aspects that have been developed ecological efficiency eco efficiency is an indicator which includes the scope of resource exhaustion economic growth and environmental protection though it may consist more than these perspectives we employ it to reflect the sustainable development of resource economy environmental system to some extent essentially the promotion of eco efficiency indicates the sustainability of resource economic and environmental and this is in line with the connotation of sustainability nexus thus there is a great need for quantitative and computational modeling to investigate the sustainability nexus using composite eco efficiency indicators originated from schaltegger and sturn 1990 the concept of eco efficiency has gained great popularity in the literature on sustainable development eco efficiency means doing more with less or producing economic outputs within minimal natural resources and environmental degradation kuosmanen 2005 monitoring eco efficiency on the macro level is useful in order to make sustainability accountable mahlberg and luptacik 2014 scholars have proposed numerous methods for measuring eco efficiency such as the ratio approach vogtländer et al 2002 wang et al 2011 material flow analysis yue et al 2014 the ecological footprint method lenzen and murray 2001 cerutti et al 2013 and data envelopment analysis dea dyckhoff and allen 2001 korhonen and luptacik 2004 kuosmanen and kortelainen 2005 picazo tadeo et al 2012 among these dea is the most widely used because it may provide objective and comprehensive measurement when dealing with multi input and multi output zhang et al 2008 being different from energy efficiency and environmental performance zaim 2004 zhou et al 2006 2007 hoang and nguyen 2013 picazo tadeo et al 2014 eco efficiency should be assessed by combining indicators from the economic and ecological or more dimensions mickwitz et al 2006 these are the reasons we investigate the sustainability nexus using composite eco efficiency indicators to obtain objective and accurate results many researchers have attempted to improve the dea models huang et al 2014 recently heterogeneous technology and the slacks based measure sbm have been addressed in the literature huang et al 2018a b yu et al 2018 however estimation results of eco efficiency may vary across different measurement methods furthermore comprehensive comparison of different eco efficiency measurement models across their theoretical and empirical aspects remains lacking to the best of our knowledge the traditional dea model is based on the assumption that all decision making units dmus use the same production technology however technological heterogeneity among dmus may be significant which invalidates the assumption of technological homogeneity without considering heterogeneity technology the estimated efficiency score may be biased battese et al 2004 o donnell et al 2008 the metafrontier approach can overcome this issue by incorporating technology heterogeneities beltrán esteve et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 mei et al 2015 wang et al 2017 in this approach all dmus are divided into groups based on the source of their technological heterogeneity such as regional attributes a group frontier is then formed for each group i e the dmus in each group all have the same production technology the metafrontier is obtained through enveloping the frontiers of different groups wang et al 2013a b to date both parametric and nonparametric metafrontier approaches zhang and wang 2015 kontolaimou and tsekouras 2010 have been applied to analyze malmquist index and measure energy efficiency by researchers zhang and choi 2013 choi et al 2015 li and lin 2015 yao et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 2015 yet it has seldom been used in the eco efficiency literature especially in china whose regions exhibit vast differences see section 5 1 this paper proposes three comprehensive alternative models to measure eco efficiency considering heterogeneity and other issues together first we propose a model which combines the metafrontier approach sbm and the undesirable outputs named meta u sbm different from the directional distance function for which a direction vector must be pre specified the sbm model measures the dmus objectively when dealing with undesirable outputs or byproducts such as pollutants since sbm omits the radial characteristics of inputs and or outputs tone 2004 and cooper et al 2007 advocate a mixture of their models having considered the diversity of input output variable and their relative importance tone and tsutsui 2010 propose an epsilon based measure ebm model by introducing two parameters which connect the radial and non radial models given that we propose our second model which combines the metafrontier approach and ebm named meta u ebm for the sbm model a projection for the evaluated dmu that is at maximum distance to the frontier must be chosen which may lead to underestimation of efficiency jahanshahloo et al 2012 using the minimum distance to the weak efficiency frontier method mindw enables the dmus being assessed to reach the frontier with less improvement in inputs and outputs wang et al 2013a b following this idea and pioneering studies briec 1999 cheng 2014 we further propose a third model which uses minimum distance to the weak efficient frontier named meta u mindw this paper makes two major contributions we propose three comprehensive alternative eco efficiency models by simultaneously incorporating metafrontier technology and undesirable outputs in the sbm ebm mindw model 1 1 our study differs significantly from mei et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 in at least three aspects first we evaluate eco efficiency based on two extra alternative measures ebm and mindw in addition to sbm second the research themes of mei et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 are regional environmental efficiency and regional energy efficiency rather than eco efficiency third we measure the eco efficiency from a more microscopic perspective instead of regional eco efficiency and make a first attempt to compare them across their theoretical and empirical perspectives this will help scholars better understand the relationships between the three models additionally it is also expected to improve resources management magnitude and management efficiency and achieve efficient resources allocation besides it will help managers or policy makers to recognize the differences of eco efficiency among regions as showed that the middle west region is the short slab in promoting eco efficiency thus to realize the regional coordinated development the central or local government should implement policy tilt in different regions when conducting environmental taxes and investment we also perform empirical research on eco efficiency in china using a dataset of prefecture level cities listed as key environmental protection kep cities considering their regional differences thus far many researchers remain focused on provincial eco efficiency this city level analysis may provide micro evidence on sustainability in china crucial to the world since it is the largest developing country the remainder of this study is organized as follows section 2 briefly reviews relevant literature on eco efficiency evaluation of china section 3 describes the three proposed dea models section 4 compares the results of these models from a theoretical perspective an empirical comparison is performed based on the measurement of eco efficiency in 117 chinese prefectures over the period 2003 2015 in section 5 section 6 is conclusions and policy implications 2 research on eco efficiency evaluation of china in this section existing dea applications for measuring eco efficiency in china are reviewed selected according to the research topic of this paper table 1 summarizes these applications scholars have surrounded the scope of measuring eco efficiency from both regions and industries observing the regional or industry disparities of eco efficiency in china investigating the determinants of eco efficiency and achieve excellent results from a methodology perspective such dea models as metafrontier sbm and directional distance function are the common methods in numerous studies besides malmquist luenberger index is utilized to decompose eco efficiency so as to explore the sources of efficiency growth from an application standpoint scholars have focused on eco efficiency measurement spatiotemporal variation and regional disparity along with the factors that affect eco efficiency both huang et al 2014 and yang and zhang 2018 suggest that the eco efficiency of china have improved recently and that technological progress plays a key role in promoting eco efficiency yet great differences in eco efficiency among different regions remain huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 derive a metafrontier slack based efficiency measure approach to model ecological total factor energy efficiency and find it has significant regional technology gaps across different regions previous studies have also confirmed that the spatial distribution of eco efficiency in china presents a gradient development in addition from a more microcosmic point of view fan et al 2017 find large differences exist in the eco efficiency of 40 chinese industrial parks in 2012 yu et al 2016 employ malmquist luenberger index to uncover the underlying causes of eco efficiency performance and discover the drivers of productivity growth of china s pulp paper industry at the national and provincial levels and find the pollution treatment of china s pulp and paper industry has made progress in water consumption and water pollution furthermore the productivity of pulp and paper industry was underestimated when the undesirable outputs are ignored based on a metafrontier slack based dea model lin and tan 2016 measure the ecological total factor energy efficiency as well as the energy conservation potential of china four energy intensive subsectors non metallic mineral products manufacturing industry raw chemical materials and chemical products manufacturing industry smelting and pressing of ferrous metals industry and smelting and pressing of non ferrous metals industry and find that ecological energy efficiency in east china is the highest long et al 2015 study the malmquist luenberger productivity index of china s cement manufactures over the period 2005 2010 and find there are gaps between malmquist and malmquist luenberger for china s cement manufactures the above findings have prompted us to reflect on why there is such a great difference in regional and or industrial eco efficiency in china and the influence mechanisms of eco efficiency which has become another research topic liu et al 2012 examine the relationship between urban form and urban eco efficiency and find urban form aspects of form and compactness ratios are positively correlated with urban eco efficiency fujii and managi 2013 propose a weighted russell directional distance model to measure eco efficiency using production technology empirical results of panel tobit analysis suggest that both foreign direct investment and investment for pollutant abatement improve eco efficiency yuan et al 2017 introduce eco efficiency to reflect the degree of the coordinated development of economy and environment in china and find that the effects of environmental regulation on technical innovation and eco efficiency are nonlinear in their latest work ren et al 2018 use the stirpat model to test the effects of three systems of environmental regulation command and control regulation market based regulation and voluntary regulation on eco efficiency in the eastern central and western regions of china they find that the effects of different types of environmental regulation on eco efficiency differ across regions in addition to extending the existing measurement method scholars have been exploring the mechanisms of eco efficiency eco efficiency indicators and the combinations of ecological footprint and dea are also used to measure specific aspects of eco efficiency in china with studies by li et al yu et al 2013 yin et al 2014 liu and lin 2016 and yue et al 2017 further scholars have employed the same method to evaluate energy consumption lin et al 2015 food waste management cristóbal et al 2016 and sustainable development he et al 2016 it is worth noting that sustainable development contains at least four aspects society resources environment and economy to reflect regional sustainable development eco efficiency is a composite indicator which also includes the above four aspects thus measuring eco efficiency precisely is a complex undertaking some researchers have used a two stage dea model to study eco efficiency halkos et al 2015 li et al 2017 moreover to eliminate interference from the external environment and statistical noise with industrial eco efficiency measurement zhang et al 2016 adopt a three stage dea model to assess the industrial eco efficiency of 30 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities in china between 2005 and 2013 they find china s national average industrial eco efficiency declines by 30 after eliminating the impacts of external environment and statistical noise yu et al 2018 employ an extended dea model with consideration of a non convex metafrontier to measure the industrial eco efficiency of 30 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities in china between 2001 and 2015 the results indicate the existence of a significant regional disparity 3 dea models considering the heterogeneity 3 1 meta u sbm model assume that there is a total of n dmus each dmu uses m inputs to produce r desirable outputs and j undesirable outputs matrix x x 1 x 2 x m ℝ m y y 1 y 2 y r ℝ r and b b 1 b 2 b j ℝ j represent the input desirable output and undesirable output variables respectively based on their production technologies all dmus can be divided into h h 1 technology heterogeneous groups and n h dmus in the hth group we have h 1 h n h n following wang et al 2013a b and zhang et al 2015 the frontier production technology of the hth group can be expressed as follows 1 p h x h y h b h n 1 n h λ n h x n h x h n 1 n h λ n h y n h y h n 1 n h λ n h b n h b h λ n h 0 n 1 2 n h we can also express the metafrontier production technology as follows 2 p m e t a x y b h 1 h n 1 n h ξ n h x n h x h h 1 h n 1 n h ξ n h y n h y h h 1 h n 1 n h ξ n h b n h b h ξ n h 0 n 1 2 n h h 1 2 h where p m e t a p 1 p 2 p h λ n h and ξ n h stand for the weights of the nth dmu of the hth group with reference to the group frontier and metafrontier technology respectively we first introduce the group u sbm and meta u sbm models which combine group frontier and metafrontier technologies with undesirable output based on sbm the eco efficiency of the oth dmuko in group k with reference to the group frontier ρ k o g u s is estimated as 3 group u sbm ρ k o g u s min 1 1 m m 1 m t m k o x x m

t j k o b respectively and the same for the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the metafrontier ρ k o m u s is estimated as 4 meta u sbm ρ k o m u s min 1 1 m m 1 m t m k o x x m k o 1 1 r j r 1

m k o x t r k o y t j k o b 0 m 1 2 m r 1 2 r j 1 2 j where x mko y rko and b jko are the inputs desirable outputs and undesirable outputs of dmu ko and slacks are denoted as t m k o x t r k o y and t j k o b respectively adding the constraints n 1 n k λ n k 1 to 3 and h 1 h n 1 n h ξ n h 1 to 4 will impose the variable returns to scale vrs assumption to understand the eco efficiency improvement potential we can also compute the technology gap ratio tgr between the group frontier and metafrontier technologies which is defined as 5 t g r k o s b m ρ k o m u s ρ k o g u s where ρ k o m u s and ρ k o g u s denote the optimal solutions of models 4 and 3 the tgr is between 0 and 1 a higher tgr indicates the group frontier technology is closer to the metafrontier technology zhang et al 2015 3 2 meta u ebm model on the basis of ebm model tone and tsutsui 2010 the eco efficiency of the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the group frontier ρ k o g u e is estimated as 6 group u ebm ρ k o g u e min θ ε 1 m 1 m ω m k o x m 1 m ω m k o x s m k o x x m k o η ε 1 r 1 r ω r k o y j 1 j ω j k o b r 1 r ω r k o y s r k o y y r k o j 1 j ω j k o b s j k o b b j k o s t θ x m k o n 1 n k λ n k x

m 1 2 m r 1 2 r j 1 2 j simultaneously considering both the radial and non radial measures of efficiency along with heterogeneous technology and undesirable outputs we extend ebm model to meta u ebm model the efficiency scores of the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the metafrontier ρ k o m u e can be obtained from the following programming 7 meta u ebm ρ k o m u e min θ ε 1 m 1 m ω m k o

r j 1 2 j where x mko y rko and b jko are the inputs desirable outputs and undesirable outputs of dmu ko and the slacks are denoted as s m k o x s r k o y and s j k o b respectively ε and ε are the key parameters with an interval of 0 1 which indicates the importance of the non radial part in the evaluation and is supplied prior to eco efficiency measurements the above model is equivalent to the radial model if and only if iif ε and ε are both zero it reduces to the sbm model iif both ε and ε are equal to one ω m k o x 0 m ω r k o y 0 r and ω j k o b 0 j represent the relative importance units invariant values of inputs desirable outputs and undesirable outputs respectively it is worth noting that the meta u ebm model is different from the model proposed by tone and tsutsui 2010 as they do not consider metafrontier technology and undesirable outputs simultaneously thus we added extra constraints of θ and η to avoid the presence of optimal solutions θ 1 but η 1 that is the projections of the inputs outputs among inefficient target dmus may be higher lower than the original value thus the logical error of the target movement being increase inputs or decrease outputs may occur which runs counter to our goal to address this problem we use model 6 to compute eco efficiency which explicitly takes the constraint conditions 0 θ 1 and η 1 into account as discussed above technological heterogeneity and undesirable output have not been simultaneously considered in ebm in the literature doing so is another objective of this study given that we can further compute the corresponding tgr as follows 8 t g r k o e b m ρ k o m u e ρ k o g u e where ρ k o m u e and ρ k o g u e denote the optimal solutions of models 7 and 3 3 meta u mindw model following briec 1999 charnes et al 1996 and cheng 2014 we first solve the linear programming of the oth dmu ko in group k as follows 9 max β z k o z 1 2 m r j s t n 1 n k λ n k x m k n β z k o e m k o x m k o n 1 n k λ n k y r k n β z k o e r k o y r k o n 1 n k λ n k b j k n β z k o e j k o b j k o λ n k 0 m 1 2 m r 1 2 r j 1 2 j where the e ko of the oth dmu ko in group k satisfies similarly hereafter e m k o 0 if m z 1 if m z e r k o 0 if r z m 1 if r z m e j k o 0 if j z m r 1 if j z m r the efficiency scores of each model may then be expressed as 10 ρ z k o 1 1 m m 1 m β z k o e m k o x m k o 1 1 r j r 1 r β z k o e r k o y r k o j 1 j β z k o e j k o b j k o thus the efficiency score of group u mindw can be given by ρ k o g u m max ρ z k o z 1 2 m r j which indicates that the maximum efficiency score corresponds to the minimum β z k o i e the minimum distance to the group frontier we can integrate the above process to evaluate eco efficiency with reference to the group frontier ρ k o g u m which is modeled as 11 group u mindw ρ k o g u m max 1 1 m m 1 m β z k o e m k o x m k o 1 1 r j r 1 r β z k o e r k o y r k o j 1 j β z k o e j k o b j k o s t n 1 n k λ n k x m k n β z k o e m k o x m k o

to the metafrontier ρ k o m u m can be obtained by solving the following dea problem 12 meta u mindw ρ k o m u m max 1 1 m m 1 m β z k o e m k o x m k o 1 1 r j r 1 r β z k o e r k o y r k o j 1 j β z

2 r j 1 2 j finally we can further compute the corresponding tgr as follows 13 t g r k o m i n d w ρ k o m u m ρ k o g u m where ρ k o m u m and ρ k o g u m denote the optimal solutions of models 12 and 11 3 4 metafrontier malmquist model oh and lee 2010 introduce the metafrontier method into the global benchmarking of the malmquist model and its decomposition in order to verify whether the decrease in eco efficiency over the years resulted primarily from technological change tc or efficiency change ec we further compute the malmquist luenberger index choi et al 2015 of each dea model and then obtained the proportion of contribution to eco efficiency scores from period t to period t 1 first the global malmquist index and its decomposition with reference to the group frontier can be given by 14 m global group x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 x t y t b t e group x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group x t y t b t e group t 1 x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group t x t y t b t e group x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group t 1 x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group x t y t b t e group t x t y t b t t e group t 1 t e group t b p g group t 1 b p g group t e c t t 1 b p c t t 1 where m global group defines the global malmquist index of each group e represents eco efficiency measured by the proposed three models bpg best practice gap denotes the gap between the group frontier and the global frontier at the current period ec t t 1 efficiency change represents the efficiency change in eco efficiency from period t to t 1 bpc t t 1 best practice change denotes the change in bpg from period t to t 1 te group t 1 is the technological efficiency with reference to the group frontier at period t 1 second based on eq 14 we can further decompose the metafrontier malmquist index which defined as follows 15 m global meta x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 x t y t b t e meta x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e meta x t y t b t e group t 1 x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group t x t y t b t e meta x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group t 1 x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e meta x t y t b t e group t x t y

period t to t 1 third we can define the contribution rates of ec bpc and tgc based on the following equations 16 c e c t t 1 e c t t 1 e c t t 1 b p c t t 1 t g c t t 1 100 17 c b p c t t 1 b p c t t

tgc from period t to t 1 respectively and c e c t t 1 c b p c t t 1 c t g c t t 1 1 4 theoretical comparison of the three dea models in this section the relationship between ρ k o m u s ρ k o m u e and ρ k o m u m is discussed and clarified before we perform the empirical analysis comparing the meta u mindw model with the meta u ebm model and the meta u sbm model we can derive the following theorems theorem 1 the efficiency scores of the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the metafrontier have the following relationship ρ k o m u s ρ k o m u e ρ k o m u m proof of this theorem is provided in appendix a 1 theorem 2 if and only if the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the metafrontier is meta u sbm efficient it is also meta u ebm efficient proof of this theorem is provided in appendix a 2 theorem 3 if and only if the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the metafrontier is meta u ebm efficient and is also meta u mindw efficient proof of this theorem is provided in appendix a 3 5 empirical performance of the three dea models 5 1 variables data and heterogeneous groups the sample includes 117 chinese prefecture level cities which are listed or used to be listed as kep cities 2 2 kep cities are subject to more stringent environmental regulations and are required to provide the state environmental protection agency with additional disclosure about their environmental quality on a more regular basis huang et al 2018b the quantity of kep cities increased from 47 in 2000 to 120 in 2013 however we are unable to collect full information on three cities jinzhou weihai and lhasa on the list our final sample thus includes 117 kep cities over the period 2003 2015 because they are under similar environmental policies and their data is accessible to make the skies blue again is the top priority for pollution control in china and numerous measures and efforts to comprehensively and efficiently enforce the air pollution control law and control pollution through legal means exist these include listing the 169 prefecture level cities 3 3 for official interpretation of scope for national air quality ranking by the ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china in chinese please see http www gov cn zhengce 2018 07 23 5308504 files 12e30f20a16443d7832722229d13e2e2 pdf to construct the national urban air quality ranking aqr in 2018 these include 55 from the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration and its surroundings 41 from the yangtze river delta urban agglomeration 22 from the urban agglomeration in the middle of the yangtze river 16 from the cheng yu urban agglomeration and 9 from the pearl river delta urban agglomeration 91 cities in our sample are on this list these cities face similar environmental policies and regulations to improve environmental quantity through making full use of compulsory mechanisms moreover 93 cities in our sample are defined as members of urban agglomerations uas the sustainable development of cities relying on natural resources formally became central to china s economic agenda and environmental protection plans the first list of 12 resource based cities rb was announced in 2008 while the second list of 32 and the third list of 25 rb cities were announced in 2009 and 2011 respectively among the 117 prefectures in our sample 39 are on the list listed rb cities and regions typically have extraction and processing of natural resources as the pillar of their economies they also receive financial support from the central government which is a key policy to address the difficulty for these rb cities to transition to less resource intensive development pathways fig 1 also differentiates the sampled prefecture level cities following previous studies we use four input variables labor force and capital stock computed by the perpetual inventory method see chowdhury 2008 wu et al 2014 berlemann and wesselhöft 2014 primary energy consumption wang and feng 2015 huang et al 2018b and land usage total land area of administrative region huang et al 2014 the gdp is used to represent desirable output while the emissions of environmental pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand cod wastewater exhaust gas so2 dust solid waste and smoke and dust are treated as the undesirable outputs we employed the entropy weight method to generate a composite environmental pollution index pi of four pollutants carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide soot dust and waste water which helps to alleviate the influence of extreme values 4 4 a potentially unfortunate consequence of the conventional dea is that extreme values of inputs or outputs result in extreme weights such that some dmus become efficient by default asmild and zhu 2016 a widely applied approach to address this issue is generate an entropy weighted index of multiple factors bian and yang 2010 ludovisi 2014 we also used four pollutants as bad outputs to measure eco efficiency and the results are highly correlation correlation coefficient is above 0 88 to pi as bad output we discuss only pi as bad output in measuring eco efficiency for the sake of brevity the procedure for calculating pi is provided in appendix b all the data were collected from the china city statistical yearbooks ccsy 2004 2016 the china environment yearbooks cey 2004 2016 the china energy statistical yearbooks cesy 2004 2016 and the bulletin of statistics table 2 reports descriptive statistics of the input and output variables more detailed description of these variables can be referred to huang et al 2018b which shows significant differences between the cities for example the maximum values of gdp and labor input are about ten times their mean values the eastern area accounts for slightly more than half of china s total gdp almost half of china s energy usage and more than half its investments in capital stock and employment while the developing central western area contributes little further the mean gdp for the eastern cities is far higher than that of central and western cities indicating that heterogeneity across chinese cities should be considered when assessing eco efficiency consistent with the classifications of chinese regions we first divided the sample is into three groups eastern central and western including 49 32 and 36 cities respectively the study sample also classified into two clusters based on environmental policies rb cities and non rb cities including 39 and 78 cities respectively 5 2 empirical comparisons of dea models we calculate the eco efficiency of cities by meta u sbm meta u ebm and meta u mindw respectively table 3 depicts the eco efficiency scores of the three dea models and presents a significance test of their differences 5 5 we also compute the eco efficiency scores by meta u ccr and meta u ddf direction vector is chosen as mean of all dmus showing that the eco efficiency scores have the following descending order meta u mindw meta u ccr meta u ebm meta u sbm the relationship between meta u ddf and meta u ebm is ambiguous moreover the correlation coefficient between meta u ccr and meta u mindw is greater than 0 97 when evaluating eco efficiency scores meta u ccr and meta u mindw may overestimate the eco efficiency because these two methods do not consider the non radial slacks variables furthermore meta u sbm may underestimate eco efficiency scores since it completely ignores the radial movement given this meta u ebm may more properly to reflect the regional eco efficiency while taking heterogeneity into account it is clear that the mean of eco efficiency by meta u mindw is the highest 0 897 followed by meta u ebm 0 645 and meta u sbm 0 440 another numerical characteristic the minimum yields the same conclusion consistent with theorem 1 the paired t tests mean tests show that the differences in eco efficiency between meta u sbm meta u ebm and meta u mindw are significant at the 1 level which provides statistical evidence for theorem 1 the results also show that if a city is efficient in the meta u sbm it is also efficient in meta u ebm while the efficient dmu in the meta u ebm also is rated as efficient in meta u mindw and vice versa based on the empirical analysis of theorem 1 the numbers for the efficient dmus obtained from three dea models are the same in each year table 4 summarized the efficient cities from 2003 to 2015 as shown in table 4 one of the interesting findings is that only 23 cities located on the efficient frontier at least once or more during 2003 2015 and there are no cities that are efficient in any of these years among the efficient cities 20 of them are aqr cities and 4 of them are both aqr and rb cities further details may be found in the supplementary materials the above results provide empirical support for theorems 2 and 3 5 3 dynamics of eco efficiency and tgr 5 3 1 dynamics of eco efficiency fig 2 depicts the dynamics of eco efficiency as measured by the three dea models fig 2a for meta u sbm fig 2b for meta u ebm and fig 2c for meta u mindw for the three regions in general the eco efficiency score measured by meta u mindw is the highest above 0 8 followed by meta u ebm averages ranged from 0 6 to 0 8 and meta u sbm below 0 6 further eco efficiency has the tendency to fall first and then rise however the tendency of eco efficiency of the three regions is generally consistent with the tendency of the national one the eco efficiency gaps between the eastern and central regions and the eastern and western regions have grown while between central and western regions they become closer over time moreover the eco efficiency of cities located in the eastern region exhibits the best performance followed by the central region and the western region this is primarily because the central western regions are located inland with a weak economic foundation and a low level of science and technology they are less attractive to foreign capital and experience serious problems such as extensive economic development models outstanding environmental problems and low resource recycling additionally industries in the central western regions are dominated by heavy industry and high energy consuming industries furthermore we also graphically report the dynamics of eco efficiency measured by three dea models for rb and non rb cities as shown in fig 3 on average the eco efficiency of non rb cities is significantly higher than that of the total sample and rb cities evidently the gap between the non rb and rb cities significantly expanded after 2008 one potential explanation is that rb cities are mostly located in central western regions fig 1 where the rate of economic development is relatively sluggish the environmental pollution is much serious and the resource utilization efficiency is much lower resulting in low eco efficiency 5 3 2 dynamics of tgr to investigate the proximity of group frontier and metafrontier technological gap ratio for each city are also examined based on eqs 5 8 and 13 fig 4 presents the dynamics of tgr for three regions rb and non rb cities using meta u sbm measure see fig 4 a tgrs of prefecture level cities located in eastern central and western regions with three average values of 87 4 ranges from 34 6 to 100 61 2 ranges from 33 7 to 100 and 73 0 ranges from 25 3 to 100 respectively the average tgr of cities listed as rb is 75 4 and ranges from 35 1 to 100 while the average tgr of cities are not listed as rb is 76 0 and ranges from 25 3 to 100 moreover the average tgrs are correspondingly increased to 94 1 77 8 80 1 85 5 85 2 for meta u ebm measurement see fig 4 b and 98 2 95 1 95 7 96 7 96 6 for meta u mindw measurement see fig 4 c the statistics indicate eastern cities are closer to the metafrontier than central western cities as shown in fig 4 a the average tgr of eastern cities increases while the average tgrs of central and western cities fall over time evidently the average tgr of central cities is much lower than that of the total sample non rb cities outperform rb cities after 2007 and the former exceeds the national average similar conclusions can also be made from fig 4 b and c 5 4 the main source of eco efficiency growth based on metafrontier malmquist model we calculate the eco efficiency growth and its decomposition indicators i e ec bpc and tgc along with the corresponding contributions based on eqs 16 18 in general with regard to meta u sbm the ec dominates the basic trend of the eco efficiency growth 2003 2015 with an average value of 0 336 indicating that technological progress is a key promoter of eco efficiency for meta u ebm the ec and bpc dominates the basic trend of the eco efficiency growth 2003 2015 with average values of 0 334 and 0 334 respectively showing that the efficiency change and technological progress are key promoters of eco efficiency however for meta u mindw the efficiency change technological progress and technological gap change are equally important in the eco efficiency growth 2003 2015 since their average values are equal to one third furthermore the main sources of eco efficiency growth for different periods vary as shown in table 5 but eco efficiency growth in most periods relies largely on efficiency change or technological progress or both the contributions of ec bpc and tgc for each city are provided in the supplementary materials 6 conclusions and policy implications the radial movement and non radial slacks variables in dea models may affect the eco efficiency measurement simultaneously incorporating heterogeneous technology and undesirable output into sbm ebm and mindw respectively this paper proposes three extended dea models to measure eco efficiency and compares the three models theoretically and empirically based on a dataset of 117 chinese prefecture level cities during the years 2003 2015 the main findings of this paper are as follows first the optimal objective values of meta u mindw meta u ebm and meta u sbm are ranked from largest to smallest second both theoretical analysis and empirical study shows that if a dmu is efficient in model meta u sbm then it must also be efficient in the meta u ebm and meta u mindw models third the eco efficiency of eastern cities is best followed by that of central cities and that of western cities indicating a significant gap in eco efficiency across different regions further in eco efficiency non rb cities outperform rb cities the average tgr of eastern cities is higher than that of central and western cities implying that cities in the eastern region are closer to metafrontier than the rest finally the ec and bpc dominate the basic trend of eco efficiency growth 2003 2015 indicating that the efficiency change and technological progress are key promoters of eco efficiency the main sources of eco efficiency growth for different periods are vary however further work such as using a super efficiency model to distinguish efficient dmus for their scores is needed when the sample is small bootstrap methodology simar and wilson 2007 should be considered to overcome the estimation bias our results indicate that eco efficiency scores exhibit significant differences in chinese prefecture level cities to realize the regional coordinated development and avoid the double collapse of eco efficiency and economy growth the central and local government should pay more attention to the development of central western regions in environmental protection and economy growth as noted above the eco efficiency of prefectures in eastern area is the highest due to the distinctive location conditions and the magnitude of openness to international high tech cleaner production the policy implications are clear prefectures in the eastern region should play an active role in the eco efficiency spatial spillovers technology diffusion and the role of growth pole rather than merely that of backflow moreover the regional gap in eco efficiency suggests that the chinese government should pursue heterogeneous policies to improve the eco efficiencies of the central and western regions the idea of an economy first model without considering the environmental and social aspects should be changed to eco efficiency first model in the pursuit of sustainable

set t m k o x s m k o x θ 1 x m k o t r k o y s r k o y η 1 y r k o t j k o b s j k o b η 1 b j k o we then can obtain the slack variables t m k o x t r k o y t j k o b of the meta u sbm model while the intensity variable is treated as ξ n h in the three dea models if not we can perform a linear transformation of this parameter the value of the efficiency measurement is ρ k o m u s 1 1 m m 1 m s

meta u ebm we have ρ k o m u s ρ k o m u e with the following inequality equations a 1 4 0 ε 1 m 1 m ω m k o x m 1 m ω m k o x s m k o x x m k o 1 m m 1 m s m k o x x m k o a 1 5 0 ε 1 r 1 r ω r k o y

computed by ε m max ψ x m 1 if m 1 0 if m 1 where ψ x is an eigenvalue of the affinity matrix m m s which is defined as s 1 2 1 2 r and where the elements of s are in the area from 0 to 1 r represents the pearson correlation coefficient matrix between each of two input indices the affinity matrix s is non negative definite and the gershgorin circle theorem salas 1999 ψ x lies in the interval of 1 m where m is the order of affinity matrix or the number of inputs actually given that we have 0 ε 1 or 0 mε m in addition the weight relative importance of input m is constructed from the corresponding eigenvector of the new affinity matrix with the largest eigenvalue where the dimension of the subspace of each eigenvalue is not larger than the number of eigenvalues of the multiple root which is multiplied by all eigenvalues is smaller than the dimension m of the affinity matrix as a sequence the sum of the subspace dimension of the eigenvalues is not more than m that is we have 0 m 1 m ω m k o x m let v be the eigenvector of the maximum eigenvalue ψ x then the weights relative importance of inputs under evaluation dmu ko with metafrontier reference can be calculated by ω m k o x v m m 1 m v m note that 1 ψ x m and 0 m 1 m ω m k o x m we have 1 max ψ x m and 0 m 1 m ω m k o x m 2 consequently we obtain 1 max ψ x m 1 m ω m k o x 2 m and m 1 m ω m k o x m max ψ x in reality we have max ψ x m 1 m ω m k o x let n 1 2 m be chosen so that v n max m v m that is choose n such that it is the largest in absolute value number in the vector v then v n 0 since v is an eigenvector sv ψ x v and thus m 1 m s n m v m ψ x v n n 1 2 m where s nm denotes as the elements of affinity matrix s we may then divide both sides by v n and take the absolute formation to obtain ψ x m 1 m s n m v m v n m 1 m s n m ω m k o x m 1 m v m v n m 1 m 1 2 1 2 r n m ω m k o x m 1 m v m v n m 1 m ω m k o x which indicates max ψ x m 1 m ω m k o x since both ψ x and m 1 m ω m k o x are greater than zero r nm represents the nth row and mth column element of pearson correlation coefficient matrix r combined with the formulation of ε i e ε m max ψ x m 1 we derive m 2 m 1 m ω m k o x m max ψ x m 1 m ω m k o x 2 m 2 that is to say m 2 m 1 m ω m k o x m max ψ x m 1 m ω m k o x m 2 m max ψ x m m 1 m ω m k o x m 1 m ω m k o x 0 m m max ψ x m 1 m 1 m ω m k o x 0 m m max ψ x m 1 m 1 m ω m k o x which is equivalent to a 1 6 m max ψ x m 1 m 1 m ω m k o x m therefore we have ε m 1 m ω m k o x m or m ε m 1 m ω m k o x 0 for m 1 then ε 0 the inequality reduces to 0 m 1 m ω m k o x which also holds according to the previous specification the above procedures may be applied to the output alternative analysis the first inequality formulated as a 1 4 is obvious since 0 ω m k o x 1 and m ε m 1 m ω m k o x 0 we then have 0 ω m k o x s m k o x s m k o x and 0 ε m 1 m ω m k o x 1 m on the basis of the multiplicative property of inequality with equidirectional the inequality 0 ε 1 m 1 m ω m k o x m 1 m ω m k o x s m k o x x m k o 1 m m 1 m s m k o x x m k o holds the second inequality equation formulated as a 1 5 hold is grounded in the fact that 0 ω r k o y s r k o y s r k o y 0 ω j k o b s j k o

efficient either as can be seen above if and only if dmu ko is meta u sbm efficient meta u ebm efficient it is also meta u ebm efficient meta u mindw efficient therefore the theorem has been proved remark on the basis of the proof of theorem 1 we obtain the conclusion that the feasible optimal solution of the meta u mindw model is also a feasible optimal solution for the meta u ebm model furthermore the feasible optimal solution of the meta u ebm model is also a feasible optimal solution for the meta u sbm model thus we obtain the result of theorems 2 and 3 from this point of view appendix b entropy weighted approach to environmental pollution index a potentially unfortunate consequence of the conventional dea is that extreme values of inputs or outputs results in extreme weights such that some dmus become efficient by default asmild and zhu 2016 a widely applied approach to address this issue is generating an entropy weighted index of multiple factors bian and yang 2010 ludovisi 2014 we follow this approach and generate a composite environmental pollution index of four pollutants carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide soot dust and waste water which helps to alleviate the influence of extreme values of individual factors the calculation process involves four steps let v iqt denote the emission volume of pollutant q q 1 2 q at region i i 1 2 i in year t t 1 2 t this is first normalized over entire sample b 1 p i q t v i q t i 1 i t 1 t v i q t the entropy of pollutant q at region i is defined as b 2 e i q t 1 l n i t t 1 t p i q t l n p i q t next we calculate the weight of pollutant q at region i as b 3 w i q t 1 e i q t q 1 q 1 e i q t the composite pollution index pi covering four pollutants of region i in year t is given by b 4 p i i t q 1 q p i q t w i

25060,it is important to investigate the sustainability nexus using composite ecological efficiency eco efficiency indicators from quantitative and computational modeling perspectives to provide a more comprehensive measure of eco efficiency this paper develops three data envelopment analysis dea models incorporating metafrontier and undesirable outputs into a slacks based measure sbm an epsilon based measure ebm and minimum distance to weak efficient frontier mindw respectively named meta u sbm meta u ebm and meta u mindw we show theoretically if a decision making unit dmu is being meta u sbm efficient it is also being meta u ebm efficient and meta u mindw efficient and vice versa for each dmu its score measured by meta u mindw is the highest while its score measured by meta u sbm is the lowest using the proposed models we make a first empirical attempt at measuring the eco efficiency of the key environmental protection prefecture level cities in china from 2003 to 2015 the results show that 1 the eco efficiency of eastern cities performs the best followed by central cities and western cities cities not listed as resource based rb outperform rb cities 2 eastern cities are closer to metafrontier than central and western cities and 3 efficiency change and technological progress dominate the basic trend of the eco efficiency growth results derived from the proposed methodologies can help managers and policymakers in the city to assess sustainability development quantitatively and comprehensively they can also provide implications for the environmental management of sustainability development at city level policy implementations are presented based on the empirical results keywords eco efficiency metafrontier analysis ecological modeling sustainability nexus 1 introduction it is crucial to consider economic environmental and social systems holistically and simultaneously as a sustainability nexus which combines various sustainability principles related to resource economic and environmental aspects that have been developed ecological efficiency eco efficiency is an indicator which includes the scope of resource exhaustion economic growth and environmental protection though it may consist more than these perspectives we employ it to reflect the sustainable development of resource economy environmental system to some extent essentially the promotion of eco efficiency indicates the sustainability of resource economic and environmental and this is in line with the connotation of sustainability nexus thus there is a great need for quantitative and computational modeling to investigate the sustainability nexus using composite eco efficiency indicators originated from schaltegger and sturn 1990 the concept of eco efficiency has gained great popularity in the literature on sustainable development eco efficiency means doing more with less or producing economic outputs within minimal natural resources and environmental degradation kuosmanen 2005 monitoring eco efficiency on the macro level is useful in order to make sustainability accountable mahlberg and luptacik 2014 scholars have proposed numerous methods for measuring eco efficiency such as the ratio approach vogtländer et al 2002 wang et al 2011 material flow analysis yue et al 2014 the ecological footprint method lenzen and murray 2001 cerutti et al 2013 and data envelopment analysis dea dyckhoff and allen 2001 korhonen and luptacik 2004 kuosmanen and kortelainen 2005 picazo tadeo et al 2012 among these dea is the most widely used because it may provide objective and comprehensive measurement when dealing with multi input and multi output zhang et al 2008 being different from energy efficiency and environmental performance zaim 2004 zhou et al 2006 2007 hoang and nguyen 2013 picazo tadeo et al 2014 eco efficiency should be assessed by combining indicators from the economic and ecological or more dimensions mickwitz et al 2006 these are the reasons we investigate the sustainability nexus using composite eco efficiency indicators to obtain objective and accurate results many researchers have attempted to improve the dea models huang et al 2014 recently heterogeneous technology and the slacks based measure sbm have been addressed in the literature huang et al 2018a b yu et al 2018 however estimation results of eco efficiency may vary across different measurement methods furthermore comprehensive comparison of different eco efficiency measurement models across their theoretical and empirical aspects remains lacking to the best of our knowledge the traditional dea model is based on the assumption that all decision making units dmus use the same production technology however technological heterogeneity among dmus may be significant which invalidates the assumption of technological homogeneity without considering heterogeneity technology the estimated efficiency score may be biased battese et al 2004 o donnell et al 2008 the metafrontier approach can overcome this issue by incorporating technology heterogeneities beltrán esteve et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 mei et al 2015 wang et al 2017 in this approach all dmus are divided into groups based on the source of their technological heterogeneity such as regional attributes a group frontier is then formed for each group i e the dmus in each group all have the same production technology the metafrontier is obtained through enveloping the frontiers of different groups wang et al 2013a b to date both parametric and nonparametric metafrontier approaches zhang and wang 2015 kontolaimou and tsekouras 2010 have been applied to analyze malmquist index and measure energy efficiency by researchers zhang and choi 2013 choi et al 2015 li and lin 2015 yao et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 2015 yet it has seldom been used in the eco efficiency literature especially in china whose regions exhibit vast differences see section 5 1 this paper proposes three comprehensive alternative models to measure eco efficiency considering heterogeneity and other issues together first we propose a model which combines the metafrontier approach sbm and the undesirable outputs named meta u sbm different from the directional distance function for which a direction vector must be pre specified the sbm model measures the dmus objectively when dealing with undesirable outputs or byproducts such as pollutants since sbm omits the radial characteristics of inputs and or outputs tone 2004 and cooper et al 2007 advocate a mixture of their models having considered the diversity of input output variable and their relative importance tone and tsutsui 2010 propose an epsilon based measure ebm model by introducing two parameters which connect the radial and non radial models given that we propose our second model which combines the metafrontier approach and ebm named meta u ebm for the sbm model a projection for the evaluated dmu that is at maximum distance to the frontier must be chosen which may lead to underestimation of efficiency jahanshahloo et al 2012 using the minimum distance to the weak efficiency frontier method mindw enables the dmus being assessed to reach the frontier with less improvement in inputs and outputs wang et al 2013a b following this idea and pioneering studies briec 1999 cheng 2014 we further propose a third model which uses minimum distance to the weak efficient frontier named meta u mindw this paper makes two major contributions we propose three comprehensive alternative eco efficiency models by simultaneously incorporating metafrontier technology and undesirable outputs in the sbm ebm mindw model 1 1 our study differs significantly from mei et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 in at least three aspects first we evaluate eco efficiency based on two extra alternative measures ebm and mindw in addition to sbm second the research themes of mei et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 are regional environmental efficiency and regional energy efficiency rather than eco efficiency third we measure the eco efficiency from a more microscopic perspective instead of regional eco efficiency and make a first attempt to compare them across their theoretical and empirical perspectives this will help scholars better understand the relationships between the three models additionally it is also expected to improve resources management magnitude and management efficiency and achieve efficient resources allocation besides it will help managers or policy makers to recognize the differences of eco efficiency among regions as showed that the middle west region is the short slab in promoting eco efficiency thus to realize the regional coordinated development the central or local government should implement policy tilt in different regions when conducting environmental taxes and investment we also perform empirical research on eco efficiency in china using a dataset of prefecture level cities listed as key environmental protection kep cities considering their regional differences thus far many researchers remain focused on provincial eco efficiency this city level analysis may provide micro evidence on sustainability in china crucial to the world since it is the largest developing country the remainder of this study is organized as follows section 2 briefly reviews relevant literature on eco efficiency evaluation of china section 3 describes the three proposed dea models section 4 compares the results of these models from a theoretical perspective an empirical comparison is performed based on the measurement of eco efficiency in 117 chinese prefectures over the period 2003 2015 in section 5 section 6 is conclusions and policy implications 2 research on eco efficiency evaluation of china in this section existing dea applications for measuring eco efficiency in china are reviewed selected according to the research topic of this paper table 1 summarizes these applications scholars have surrounded the scope of measuring eco efficiency from both regions and industries observing the regional or industry disparities of eco efficiency in china investigating the determinants of eco efficiency and achieve excellent results from a methodology perspective such dea models as metafrontier sbm and directional distance function are the common methods in numerous studies besides malmquist luenberger index is utilized to decompose eco efficiency so as to explore the sources of efficiency growth from an application standpoint scholars have focused on eco efficiency measurement spatiotemporal variation and regional disparity along with the factors that affect eco efficiency both huang et al 2014 and yang and zhang 2018 suggest that the eco efficiency of china have improved recently and that technological progress plays a key role in promoting eco efficiency yet great differences in eco efficiency among different regions remain huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 derive a metafrontier slack based efficiency measure approach to model ecological total factor energy efficiency and find it has significant regional technology gaps across different regions previous studies have also confirmed that the spatial distribution of eco efficiency in china presents a gradient development in addition from a more microcosmic point of view fan et al 2017 find large differences exist in the eco efficiency of 40 chinese industrial parks in 2012 yu et al 2016 employ malmquist luenberger index to uncover the underlying causes of eco efficiency performance and discover the drivers of productivity growth of china s pulp paper industry at the national and provincial levels and find the pollution treatment of china s pulp and paper industry has made progress in water consumption and water pollution furthermore the productivity of pulp and paper industry was underestimated when the undesirable outputs are ignored based on a metafrontier slack based dea model lin and tan 2016 measure the ecological total factor energy efficiency as well as the energy conservation potential of china four energy intensive subsectors non metallic mineral products manufacturing industry raw chemical materials and chemical products manufacturing industry smelting and pressing of ferrous metals industry and smelting and pressing of non ferrous metals industry and find that ecological energy efficiency in east china is the highest long et al 2015 study the malmquist luenberger productivity index of china s cement manufactures over the period 2005 2010 and find there are gaps between malmquist and malmquist luenberger for china s cement manufactures the above findings have prompted us to reflect on why there is such a great difference in regional and or industrial eco efficiency in china and the influence mechanisms of eco efficiency which has become another research topic liu et al 2012 examine the relationship between urban form and urban eco efficiency and find urban form aspects of form and compactness ratios are positively correlated with urban eco efficiency fujii and managi 2013 propose a weighted russell directional distance model to measure eco efficiency using production technology empirical results of panel tobit analysis suggest that both foreign direct investment and investment for pollutant abatement improve eco efficiency yuan et al 2017 introduce eco efficiency to reflect the degree of the coordinated development of economy and environment in china and find that the effects of environmental regulation on technical innovation and eco efficiency are nonlinear in their latest work ren et al 2018 use the stirpat model to test the effects of three systems of environmental regulation command and control regulation market based regulation and voluntary regulation on eco efficiency in the eastern central and western regions of china they find that the effects of different types of environmental regulation on eco efficiency differ across regions in addition to extending the existing measurement method scholars have been exploring the mechanisms of eco efficiency eco efficiency indicators and the combinations of ecological footprint and dea are also used to measure specific aspects of eco efficiency in china with studies by li et al yu et al 2013 yin et al 2014 liu and lin 2016 and yue et al 2017 further scholars have employed the same method to evaluate energy consumption lin et al 2015 food waste management cristóbal et al 2016 and sustainable development he et al 2016 it is worth noting that sustainable development contains at least four aspects society resources environment and economy to reflect regional sustainable development eco efficiency is a composite indicator which also includes the above four aspects thus measuring eco efficiency precisely is a complex undertaking some researchers have used a two stage dea model to study eco efficiency halkos et al 2015 li et al 2017 moreover to eliminate interference from the external environment and statistical noise with industrial eco efficiency measurement zhang et al 2016 adopt a three stage dea model to assess the industrial eco efficiency of 30 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities in china between 2005 and 2013 they find china s national average industrial eco efficiency declines by 30 after eliminating the impacts of external environment and statistical noise yu et al 2018 employ an extended dea model with consideration of a non convex metafrontier to measure the industrial eco efficiency of 30 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities in china between 2001 and 2015 the results indicate the existence of a significant regional disparity 3 dea models considering the heterogeneity 3 1 meta u sbm model assume that there is a total of n dmus each dmu uses m inputs to produce r desirable outputs and j undesirable outputs matrix x x 1 x 2 x m ℝ m y y 1 y 2 y r ℝ r and b b 1 b 2 b j ℝ j represent the input desirable output and undesirable output variables respectively based on their production technologies all dmus can be divided into h h 1 technology heterogeneous groups and n h dmus in the hth group we have h 1 h n h n following wang et al 2013a b and zhang et al 2015 the frontier production technology of the hth group can be expressed as follows 1 p h x h y h b h n 1 n h λ n h x n h x h n 1 n h λ n h y n h y h n 1 n h λ n h b n h b h λ n h 0 n 1 2 n h we can also express the metafrontier production technology as follows 2 p m e t a x y b h 1 h n 1 n h ξ n h x n h x h h 1 h n 1 n h ξ n h y n h y h h 1 h n 1 n h ξ n h b n h b h ξ n h 0 n 1 2 n h h 1 2 h where p m e t a p 1 p 2 p h λ n h and ξ n h stand for the weights of the nth dmu of the hth group with reference to the group frontier and metafrontier technology respectively we first introduce the group u sbm and meta u sbm models which combine group frontier and metafrontier technologies with undesirable output based on sbm the eco efficiency of the oth dmuko in group k with reference to the group frontier ρ k o g u s is estimated as 3 group u sbm ρ k o g u s min 1 1 m m 1 m t m k o x x m

t j k o b respectively and the same for the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the metafrontier ρ k o m u s is estimated as 4 meta u sbm ρ k o m u s min 1 1 m m 1 m t m k o x x m k o 1 1 r j r 1

m k o x t r k o y t j k o b 0 m 1 2 m r 1 2 r j 1 2 j where x mko y rko and b jko are the inputs desirable outputs and undesirable outputs of dmu ko and slacks are denoted as t m k o x t r k o y and t j k o b respectively adding the constraints n 1 n k λ n k 1 to 3 and h 1 h n 1 n h ξ n h 1 to 4 will impose the variable returns to scale vrs assumption to understand the eco efficiency improvement potential we can also compute the technology gap ratio tgr between the group frontier and metafrontier technologies which is defined as 5 t g r k o s b m ρ k o m u s ρ k o g u s where ρ k o m u s and ρ k o g u s denote the optimal solutions of models 4 and 3 the tgr is between 0 and 1 a higher tgr indicates the group frontier technology is closer to the metafrontier technology zhang et al 2015 3 2 meta u ebm model on the basis of ebm model tone and tsutsui 2010 the eco efficiency of the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the group frontier ρ k o g u e is estimated as 6 group u ebm ρ k o g

m 1 2 m r 1 2 r j 1 2 j simultaneously considering both the radial and non radial measures of efficiency along with heterogeneous technology and undesirable outputs we extend ebm model to meta u ebm model the efficiency scores of the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the metafrontier ρ k o m u e can be obtained from the following programming 7 meta u ebm ρ k o m u e min θ ε 1 m 1 m ω m k o

r j 1 2 j where x mko y rko and b jko are the inputs desirable outputs and undesirable outputs of dmu ko and the slacks are denoted as s m k o x s r k o y and s j k o b respectively ε and ε are the key parameters with an interval of 0 1 which indicates the importance of the non radial part in the evaluation and is supplied prior to eco efficiency measurements the above model is equivalent to the radial model if and only if iif ε and ε are both zero it reduces to the sbm model iif both ε and ε are equal to one ω m k o x 0 m ω r k o y 0 r and ω j k o b 0 j represent the relative importance units invariant values of inputs desirable outputs and undesirable outputs respectively it is worth noting that the meta u ebm model is different from the model proposed by tone and tsutsui 2010 as they do not consider metafrontier technology and undesirable outputs simultaneously thus we added extra constraints of θ and η to avoid the presence of optimal solutions θ 1 but η 1 that is the projections of the inputs outputs among inefficient target dmus may be higher lower than the original value thus the logical error of the target movement being increase inputs or decrease outputs may occur which runs counter to our goal to address this problem we use model 6 to compute eco efficiency which explicitly takes the constraint conditions 0 θ 1 and η 1 into account as discussed above technological heterogeneity and undesirable output have not been simultaneously considered in ebm in the literature doing so is another objective of this study given that we can further compute the corresponding tgr as follows 8 t g r k o e b m ρ k o m u e ρ k o g u e where ρ k o m u e and ρ k o g u e denote the optimal solutions of models 7 and 3 3 meta u mindw model following briec 1999 charnes et al 1996 and cheng 2014 we first solve the linear programming of the oth dmu ko in group k as follows 9 max β z k o z 1 2 m r j s t n 1 n k λ n k x m k n β z k o e m k o x m k o n 1 n k λ n k y r k n β z k o e r k o y r k o n 1 n k λ n k b j k n β z k o e j k o b j k o λ n k 0 m 1 2 m r 1 2 r j 1 2 j where the e ko of the oth dmu ko in group k satisfies similarly hereafter e m k o 0 if m z 1 if m z e r k o 0 if r z m 1 if r z m e j k o 0 if j z m r 1 if j z m r the efficiency scores of each model may then be expressed as 10 ρ z k o 1 1 m m 1 m β z k o e m k o x m k o 1 1 r j r 1 r β z k o e r k o y r k o j 1 j β z k o e j k o b j k o thus the efficiency score of group u mindw can be given by ρ k o g u m max ρ z k o z 1 2 m r j which indicates that the maximum efficiency score corresponds to the minimum β z k o i e the minimum distance to the group frontier we can integrate the above process to evaluate eco efficiency with reference to the group frontier ρ k o g u m which is modeled as 11 group u mindw ρ k o g u m max 1 1 m m 1 m β z k o e m k o x m k o 1 1 r j r 1 r β z k o e r k o y r k o j 1 j β z k o e j k o b j k o s t n 1 n k λ n k x m k n β z k o e m k o x m k o

to the metafrontier ρ k o m u m can be obtained by solving the following dea problem 12 meta u mindw ρ k o m u m max 1 1 m m 1 m β z k o e m k o x m k o 1 1 r j r 1 r β z k o e r k o y r k o j 1 j β z

2 r j 1 2 j finally we can further compute the corresponding tgr as follows 13 t g r k o m i n d w ρ k o m u m ρ k o g u m where ρ k o m u m and ρ k o g u m denote the optimal solutions of models 12 and 11 3 4 metafrontier malmquist model oh and lee 2010 introduce the metafrontier method into the global benchmarking of the malmquist model and its decomposition in order to verify whether the decrease in eco efficiency over the years resulted primarily from technological change tc or efficiency change ec we further compute the malmquist luenberger index choi et al 2015 of each dea model and then obtained the proportion of contribution to eco efficiency scores from period t to period t 1 first the global malmquist index and its decomposition with reference to the group frontier can be given by 14 m global group x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 x t y t b t e group x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group x t y t b t e group t 1 x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group t x t y t b t e group x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group t 1 x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group x t y t b t e group t x t y t b t t e group t 1 t e group t b p g group t 1 b p g group t e c t t 1 b p c t t 1 where m global group defines the global malmquist index of each group e represents eco efficiency measured by the proposed three models bpg best practice gap denotes the gap between the group frontier and the global frontier at the current period ec t t 1 efficiency change represents the efficiency change in eco efficiency from period t to t 1 bpc t t 1 best practice change denotes the change in bpg from period t to t 1 te group t 1 is the technological efficiency with reference to the group frontier at period t 1 second based on eq 14 we can further decompose the metafrontier malmquist index which defined as follows 15 m global meta x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 x t y t b t e meta x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e meta x t y t b t e group t 1 x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group t x t y t b t e meta x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e group t 1 x t 1 y t 1 b t 1 e meta x t y t b t e group t x t y

period t to t 1 third we can define the contribution rates of ec bpc and tgc based on the following equations 16 c e c t t 1 e c t t 1 e c t t 1 b p c t t 1 t g c t t 1 100 17 c b p c t t 1 b p c t t

tgc from period t to t 1 respectively and c e c t t 1 c b p c t t 1 c t g c t t 1 1 4 theoretical comparison of the three dea models in this section the relationship between ρ k o m u s ρ k o m u e and ρ k o m u m is discussed and clarified before we perform the empirical analysis comparing the meta u mindw model with the meta u ebm model and the meta u sbm model we can derive the following theorems theorem 1 the efficiency scores of the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the metafrontier have the following relationship ρ k o m u s ρ k o m u e ρ k o m u m proof of this theorem is provided in appendix a 1 theorem 2 if and only if the oth dmu ko in group k with reference to the metafrontier is meta u sbm efficient it is also meta u ebm efficient proof of this theorem is provided

environmental quality on a more regular basis huang et al 2018b the quantity of kep cities increased from 47 in 2000 to 120 in 2013 however we are unable to collect full information on three cities jinzhou weihai and lhasa on the list our final sample thus includes 117 kep cities over the period 2003 2015 because they are under similar environmental policies and their data is accessible to make the skies blue again is the top priority for pollution control in china and numerous measures and efforts to comprehensively and efficiently enforce the air pollution control law and control pollution through legal means exist these include listing the 169 prefecture level cities 3 3 for official interpretation of scope for national air quality ranking by the ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china in chinese please see http www gov cn zhengce 2018 07 23 5308504 files 12e30f20a16443d7832722229d13e2e2 pdf to construct the national urban air quality ranking aqr in 2018 these include 55 from the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration and its surroundings 41 from the yangtze river delta urban agglomeration 22 from the urban agglomeration in the middle of the yangtze river 16 from the cheng yu urban agglomeration and 9 from the pearl river delta urban agglomeration 91 cities in our sample are on this list these cities face similar environmental policies and regulations to improve environmental quantity through making full use of compulsory mechanisms moreover 93 cities in our sample are defined as members of urban agglomerations uas the sustainable development of cities relying on natural resources formally became central to china s economic agenda and environmental protection plans the first list of 12 resource based cities rb was announced in 2008 while the second list of 32 and the third list of 25 rb cities were announced in 2009 and 2011 respectively among the 117 prefectures in our sample 39 are on the list listed rb cities and regions typically have extraction and processing of natural resources as the pillar of their economies they also receive financial support from the central government which is a key policy to address the difficulty for these rb cities to transition to less resource intensive development pathways fig 1 also differentiates the sampled prefecture level cities following previous studies we use four input variables labor force and capital stock computed by the perpetual inventory method see chowdhury 2008 wu et al 2014 berlemann and wesselhöft 2014 primary energy consumption wang and feng 2015 huang et al 2018b and land usage total land area of administrative region huang et al 2014 the gdp is used to represent desirable output while the emissions of environmental pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand cod wastewater exhaust gas so2 dust solid waste and smoke and dust are treated as the undesirable outputs we employed the entropy weight method to generate a composite environmental pollution index pi of four pollutants carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide soot dust and waste water which helps to alleviate the influence of extreme values 4 4 a potentially unfortunate consequence of the conventional dea is that extreme values of inputs or outputs result in extreme weights such that some dmus become efficient by default asmild and zhu 2016 a widely applied approach to address this issue is generate an entropy weighted index of multiple factors bian and yang 2010 ludovisi 2014 we also used four pollutants as bad outputs to measure eco efficiency and the results are highly correlation correlation coefficient is above 0 88 to pi as bad output we discuss only pi as bad output in measuring eco efficiency for the sake of brevity the procedure for calculating pi is provided in appendix b all the data were collected from the china city statistical yearbooks ccsy 2004 2016 the china environment yearbooks cey 2004 2016 the china energy statistical yearbooks cesy 2004 2016 and the bulletin of statistics table 2 reports descriptive statistics of the input and output variables more detailed description of these variables can be referred to huang et al 2018b which shows significant differences between the cities for example the maximum values of gdp and labor input are about ten times their mean values the eastern area accounts for slightly more than half of china s total gdp almost half of china s energy usage and more than half its investments in capital stock and employment while the developing central western area contributes little further the mean gdp for the eastern cities is far higher than that of central and western cities indicating that heterogeneity across chinese cities should be considered when assessing eco efficiency consistent with the classifications of chinese regions we first divided the sample is into three groups eastern central and western including 49 32 and 36 cities respectively the study sample also classified into two clusters based on environmental policies rb cities and non rb cities including 39 and 78 cities respectively 5 2 empirical comparisons of dea models we calculate the eco efficiency of cities by meta u sbm meta u ebm and meta u mindw respectively table 3 depicts the eco efficiency scores of the three dea models and presents a significance test of their differences 5 5 we also compute the eco efficiency scores by meta u ccr and meta u ddf direction vector is chosen as mean of all dmus showing that the eco efficiency scores have the following descending order meta u mindw meta u ccr meta u ebm meta u sbm the relationship between meta u ddf and meta u ebm is ambiguous moreover the correlation coefficient between meta u ccr and meta u mindw is greater than 0 97 when evaluating eco efficiency scores meta u ccr and meta u mindw may overestimate the eco efficiency because these two methods do not consider the non radial slacks variables furthermore meta u sbm may underestimate eco efficiency scores since it completely ignores the radial movement given this meta u ebm may more properly to reflect the regional eco efficiency while taking heterogeneity into account it is clear that the mean of eco efficiency by meta u mindw is the highest 0 897 followed by meta u ebm 0 645 and meta u sbm 0 440 another numerical characteristic the minimum yields the same conclusion consistent with theorem 1 the paired t tests mean tests show that the differences in eco efficiency between meta u sbm meta u ebm and meta u mindw are significant at the 1 level which provides statistical evidence for theorem 1 the results also show that if a city is efficient in the meta u sbm it is also efficient in meta u ebm while the efficient dmu in the meta u ebm also is rated as efficient in meta u mindw and vice versa based on the empirical analysis of theorem 1 the numbers for the efficient dmus obtained from three dea models are the same in each year table 4 summarized the efficient cities from 2003 to 2015 as shown in table 4 one of the interesting findings is that only 23 cities located on the efficient frontier at least once or more during 2003 2015 and there are no cities that are efficient in any of these years among the efficient cities 20 of them are aqr cities and 4 of them are both aqr and rb cities further details may be found in the supplementary materials the above results provide empirical support for theorems 2 and 3 5 3 dynamics of eco efficiency and tgr 5 3 1 dynamics of eco efficiency fig 2 depicts the dynamics of eco efficiency as measured by the three dea models fig 2a for meta u sbm fig 2b for meta u ebm and fig 2c for meta u mindw for the three regions in general the eco efficiency score measured by meta u mindw is the highest above 0 8 followed by meta u ebm averages ranged from 0 6 to 0 8 and meta u sbm below 0 6 further eco efficiency has the tendency to fall first and then rise however the tendency of eco efficiency of the three regions is generally consistent with the tendency of the national one the eco efficiency gaps between the eastern and central regions and the eastern and western regions have grown while between central and western regions they become closer over time moreover the eco efficiency of cities located in the eastern region exhibits the best performance followed by the central region and the western region this is primarily because the central western regions are located inland with a weak economic foundation and a low level of science and technology they are less attractive to foreign capital and experience serious problems such as extensive economic development models outstanding environmental problems and low resource recycling additionally industries in the central western regions are dominated by heavy industry and high energy consuming industries furthermore we also graphically report the dynamics of eco efficiency measured by three dea models for rb and non rb cities as shown in fig 3 on average the eco efficiency of non rb cities is significantly higher than that of the total sample and rb cities evidently the gap between the non rb and rb cities significantly expanded after 2008 one potential explanation is that rb cities are mostly located in central western regions fig 1 where the rate of economic development is relatively sluggish the environmental pollution is much serious and the resource utilization efficiency is much lower resulting in low eco efficiency 5 3 2 dynamics of tgr to investigate the proximity of group frontier and metafrontier technological gap ratio for each city are also examined based on eqs 5 8 and 13 fig 4 presents the dynamics of tgr for three regions rb and non rb cities using meta u sbm measure see fig 4 a tgrs of prefecture level cities located in eastern central and western regions with three average values of 87 4 ranges from 34 6 to 100 61 2 ranges from 33 7 to 100 and 73 0 ranges from 25 3 to 100 respectively the average tgr of cities listed as rb is 75 4 and ranges from 35 1 to 100 while the average tgr of cities are not listed as rb is 76 0 and ranges from 25 3 to 100 moreover the average tgrs are correspondingly increased to 94 1 77 8 80 1 85 5 85 2 for meta u ebm measurement see fig 4 b and 98 2 95 1 95 7 96 7 96 6 for meta u mindw measurement see fig 4 c the statistics indicate eastern cities are closer to the metafrontier than central western cities as shown in fig 4 a the average tgr of eastern cities increases while the average tgrs of central and western cities fall over time evidently the average tgr of central cities is much lower than that of the total sample non rb cities outperform rb cities after 2007 and the former exceeds the national average similar conclusions can also be made from fig 4 b and c 5 4 the main source of eco efficiency growth based on metafrontier malmquist model we calculate the eco efficiency growth and its decomposition indicators i e ec bpc and tgc along with the corresponding contributions based on eqs 16 18 in general with regard to meta u sbm the ec dominates the basic trend of the eco efficiency growth 2003 2015 with an average value of 0 336 indicating that technological progress is a key promoter of eco efficiency for meta u ebm the ec and bpc dominates the basic trend of the eco efficiency growth 2003 2015 with average values of 0 334 and 0 334 respectively showing that the efficiency change and technological progress are key promoters of eco efficiency however for meta u mindw the efficiency change technological progress and technological gap change are equally important in the eco efficiency growth 2003 2015 since their average values are equal to one third furthermore the main sources of eco efficiency growth for different periods vary as shown in table 5 but eco efficiency growth in most periods relies largely on efficiency change or technological progress or both the contributions of ec bpc and tgc for each city are provided in the supplementary materials 6 conclusions and policy implications the radial movement and non radial slacks variables in dea models may affect the eco efficiency measurement simultaneously incorporating heterogeneous technology and undesirable output into sbm ebm and mindw respectively this paper proposes three extended dea models to measure eco efficiency and compares the three models theoretically and empirically based on a dataset of 117 chinese prefecture level cities during the years 2003 2015 the main findings of this paper are as follows first the optimal objective values of meta u mindw meta u ebm and meta u sbm are ranked from largest to smallest second both theoretical analysis and empirical study shows that if a dmu is efficient in model meta u sbm then it must also be efficient in the meta u ebm and meta u mindw models third the eco efficiency of eastern cities is best followed by that of central cities and that of western cities indicating a significant gap in eco efficiency across different regions further in eco efficiency non rb cities outperform rb cities the average tgr of eastern cities is higher than that of central and western cities implying that cities in the eastern region are closer to metafrontier than the rest finally the ec and bpc dominate the basic trend of eco efficiency growth 2003 2015 indicating that the efficiency change and technological progress are key promoters of eco efficiency the main sources of eco efficiency growth for different periods are vary however further work such as using a super efficiency model to distinguish efficient dmus for their scores is needed when the sample is small bootstrap methodology simar and wilson 2007 should be considered to overcome the estimation bias our results indicate that eco efficiency scores exhibit significant differences in chinese prefecture level cities to realize the regional coordinated development and avoid the double collapse of eco efficiency and economy growth the central and local government should pay more attention to the development of central western regions in environmental protection and economy growth as noted above the eco efficiency of prefectures in eastern area is the highest due to the distinctive location conditions and the magnitude of openness to international high tech cleaner production the policy implications are clear prefectures in the eastern region should play an active role in the eco efficiency spatial spillovers technology diffusion and the role of growth pole rather than merely that of backflow moreover the regional gap in eco efficiency suggests that the chinese government should pursue heterogeneous policies to improve the eco efficiencies of the central and western regions the idea of an economy first model without considering the environmental and social aspects should be changed to eco efficiency first model in the pursuit of sustainable

set t m k o x s m k o x θ 1 x m k o t r k o y s r k o y η 1 y r k o t j k o b s j k o b η 1 b j k o we then can obtain the slack variables t m k o x t r k o y t j k o b of the meta u sbm model while the intensity variable is treated as ξ n h in the three dea models if not we can perform a linear transformation of this parameter the value of the efficiency measurement is ρ k o m u s 1 1 m m 1 m s

meta u ebm we have ρ k o m u s ρ k o m u e with the following inequality equations a 1 4 0 ε 1 m 1 m ω m k o x m 1 m ω m k o x s m k o x x m k o 1 m m 1 m s m k o x x m k o a 1 5 0 ε 1 r 1 r ω r k o y

computed by ε m max ψ x m 1 if m 1 0 if m 1 where ψ x is an eigenvalue of the affinity matrix m m s which is defined as s 1 2 1 2 r and where the elements of s are in the area from 0 to 1 r represents the pearson correlation coefficient matrix between each of two input indices the affinity matrix s is non negative definite and the gershgorin circle theorem salas 1999 ψ x lies in the interval of 1 m where m is the order of affinity matrix or the number of inputs actually given that we have 0 ε 1 or 0 mε m in addition the weight relative importance of input m is constructed from the corresponding eigenvector of the new affinity matrix with the largest eigenvalue where the dimension of the subspace of each eigenvalue is not larger than the number of eigenvalues of the multiple root which is multiplied by all eigenvalues is smaller than the dimension m of the affinity matrix as a sequence the sum of the subspace dimension of the eigenvalues is not more than m that is we have 0 m 1 m ω m k o x m let v be the eigenvector of the maximum eigenvalue ψ x then the weights relative importance of inputs under evaluation dmu ko with metafrontier reference can be calculated by ω m k o x v m m 1 m v m note that 1 ψ x m and 0 m 1 m ω m k o x m we have 1 max ψ x m and 0 m 1 m ω m k o x m 2 consequently we obtain 1 max ψ x m 1 m ω m k o x 2 m and m 1 m ω m k o x m max ψ x in reality we have max ψ x m 1 m ω m k o x let n 1 2 m be chosen so that v n max m v m that is choose n such that it is the largest in absolute value number in the vector v then v n 0 since v is an eigenvector sv ψ x v and thus m 1 m s n m v m ψ x v n n 1 2 m where s nm denotes as the elements of affinity matrix s we may then divide both sides by v n and take the absolute formation to obtain ψ x m 1 m s n m v m v n m 1 m s n m ω m k o x m 1 m v m v n m 1 m 1 2 1 2 r n m ω m k o x m 1 m v m v n m 1 m ω m k o x which indicates max ψ x m 1 m ω m k o x since both ψ x and m 1 m ω m k o x are greater than zero r nm represents the nth row and mth column element of pearson correlation coefficient matrix r combined with the formulation of ε i e ε m max ψ x m 1 we derive m 2 m 1 m ω m k o x m max ψ x m 1 m ω m k o x 2 m 2 that is to say m 2 m 1 m ω m k o x m max ψ x m 1 m ω m k o x m 2 m max ψ x m m 1 m ω m k o x m 1 m ω m k o x 0 m m max ψ x m 1 m 1 m ω m k o x 0 m m max ψ x m 1 m 1 m ω m k o x which is equivalent to a 1 6 m max ψ x m 1 m 1 m ω m k o x m therefore we have ε m 1 m ω m k o x m or m ε m 1 m ω m k o x 0 for m 1 then ε 0 the inequality reduces to 0 m 1 m ω m k o x which also holds according to the previous specification the above procedures may be applied to the output alternative analysis the first inequality formulated as a 1 4 is obvious since 0 ω m k o x 1 and m ε m 1 m ω m k o x 0 we then have 0 ω m k o x s m k o x s m k o x and 0 ε m 1 m ω m k o x 1 m on the basis of the multiplicative property of inequality with equidirectional the inequality 0 ε 1 m 1 m ω m k o x m 1 m ω m k o x s m k o x x m k o 1 m m 1 m s m k o x x m k o holds the second inequality equation formulated as a 1 5 hold is grounded in the fact that 0 ω r k o y s r k o y s r k o y 0 ω j k o b s j k o

appendix b entropy weighted approach to environmental pollution index a potentially unfortunate consequence of the conventional dea is that extreme values of inputs or outputs results in extreme weights such that some dmus become efficient by default asmild and zhu 2016 a widely applied approach to address this issue is generating an entropy weighted index of multiple factors bian and yang 2010 ludovisi 2014 we follow this approach and generate a composite environmental pollution index of four pollutants carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide soot dust and waste water which helps to alleviate

25061,state space geolocation models can provide valuable information on the large scale movements of many fish species the sensitivity of such complex models to model assumptions and fixed parameters is rarely assessed quantitatively yet is important for interpretation of results and adaptation for new species and different geographic regions we hypothesized that parameterization and performance of a discrete hidden markov model hmm with a gaussian depth based data likelihood for demersal fishes first implemented in the flat terrain of the north sea would be affected by the more heterogeneous depths found in the north pacific ocean we ran the hmm on depth data from simulated random walk movement trajectories in flat sloping and heterogeneous study areas in the north pacific ocean where known depth distributions in each model grid cell were provided by high resolution 5 m multibeam bathymetry data performance was compared among different data likelihood specifications and grid sizes in each area we found that model performance decreased when grid cell depth distributions departed from normal distributions performance decreased with increasing grid size in the heterogeneous and sloping study areas but not the flat study area a new method for specifying grid cell depth variance based on study area slope performed better than the standard method of obtaining variance from adjacent grid cell values for larger grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas overall model performance was highest in the heterogeneous and sloping areas at small grid sizes and in the flat area at large grid sizes the estimated value of diffusion was also sensitive to bathymetric heterogeneity and variance specification method these results suggest that the degree of study area heterogeneity should be considered when choosing fixed parameters such as likelihood and grid size and when interpreting the model results in addition this approach demonstrates the need for sensitivity analyses when using the model on a new species and in a new study area keywords archival tags demersal fish fish geolocation fish movement hidden markov model state space model 1 introduction demersal fishes are a major component of commercial fisheries in the north pacific ocean particularly in alaska usa in 2015 2 2 million tons of groundfishes comprised 80 of the total commercial harvest and 52 of the total ex vessel revenue from commercial fisheries off alaska fissel et al 2016 demersal fish species such as pacific halibut hippoglossus stenolepis pacific cod gadus macrocephalus and sablefish anoplopoma fimbria are known to undertake large scale ontogenetic and seasonal spawning migrations hanselman et al 2014 loher and seitz 2006 shimada and kimura 1994 webster et al 2013 during which fish may move among management areas or cross international boundaries therefore understanding migration characteristics such as timing pathways and spawning locations is important for the management of these demersal fish species detailed information on fish migrations can be provided by electronic tags that continuously record data on environmental variables such as depth and temperature while attached to fishes at liberty data collected by the tags are matched to maps of environmental variables in the study area to determine likely locations of the tagged fish between release and recovery a process known as geolocation geolocation methods vary based on fish behavior tag type and geographical region for example light intensity and sea surface temperature sst data are commonly used for estimating position of pelagic fishes such as tuna scombridae teo et al 2004 however methods for geolocation of demersal fish species rely primarily on depth data hunter et al 2004 pedersen et al 2008 but may include light based longitude if fish occupy depths 150 m seitz et al 2006 as well as bottom temperature le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 or salinity information neuenfeldt et al 2007 geolocation models estimate plausible movement paths of fishes by combining tag data with knowledge about how animals are likely to move through the study area e g swim speed or movement pattern most recently developed geolocation models are state space models ssms which consist of 1 a fish movement model that predicts possible locations of the tagged fish at the next time step and 2 a data likelihood model that matches data from the tagged fish to features of the study area at each time step ssms are ideal for geolocation because they can accommodate noisy data as well as quantify uncertainty in fish location estimates and other movement parameters such as movement speed patterson et al 2008 ssms for geolocation can either be parametric such as a kalman filter or non parametric such as a hidden markov model hmm or a particle filter parametric ssms are useful for geolocation of open ocean pelagic fishes which are characterized by gaussian data types light and unconstrained behavior nielsen et al 2006 non linear ssms are more suitable for demersal fishes which are characterized by non linear data types such as depth and potentially constrained near shore behavior andersen et al 2007 pedersen et al 2008 an hmm developed for geolocation of atlantic cod in the north sea pedersen et al 2008 thygesen et al 2009 has provided a flexible model framework that can be readily adapted for geolocation of different fish species in different regions biais et al 2017 le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 neat et al 2014 neilson et al 2014 strøm et al 2017 woillez et al 2016 adapting this hmm for different applications primarily involves changes to the data likelihood model i e the specific way in which tag data are matched to maps of environmental variables in the study area and selection of the appropriate model grid size however adapting the hmm for different geolocation applications is not a trivial process because both data likelihood and grid size specifications depend on characteristics of the study area tag data and fish behavior for example data likelihood models depend on the type of geolocation data collected by the tag tag measurement resolution and frequency strength of environmental gradients in the study area and accuracy and resolution of available maps of environmental characteristics an understanding of fish behavior is also important for the specification of data likelihood e g whether the fish is expected to be at the surface at the bottom or moving throughout the water column the optimal model grid size depends on the spatial gradients of geolocation variables in the study area as well as the speed at which fish are expected to move through it to adapt the pedersen et al 2008 hmm for the geolocation of demersal fishes in the north pacific ocean we chose a data likelihood model that is based on matching the maximum depth of the fish at each time step to bathymetric maps of the study area for this likelihood method demersal fishes are assumed to be on or near the bottom at some point during each time step the maximum depth likelihood method was chosen because bathymetry gradients can be steep in the north pacific ocean and bathymetric map resolution and accuracy are improving steadily in many areas zimmermann and prescott 2015 as additional data are collected in contrast gradients in tidal amplitude and phase required for the tidal geolocation method that has been utilized for geolocation of demersal fishes in other geographic regions hunter et al 2004 pedersen et al 2008 are weak in many areas of the north pacific ocean danielson et al 2011 in addition because the maximum depth likelihood can be used for both detailed e g physically recovered and summarized data from pop up satellite archival tags e g transmitted through argos satellites it can be applied to most demersal fish geolocation data sets therefore our data likelihood model is based on maximum daily depth but other types of geolocation data e g bottom temperature light based longitude or tidal amplitude and phase can be added when available the use of depth records and bathymetry maps as the primary source of geolocation data has several potential implications for data likelihood and grid size specification depending on the degree and nature of bathymetric heterogeneity present in the study area for example the maximum depth data likelihood described in greater detail below assumes a normal distribution of depths within each bathymetry grid cell le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 pedersen et al 2008 although this assumption may be valid in the flat terrain where the model was originally developed the north sea it may not be valid in the more heterogeneous areas found in the north pacific ocean the choice of model grid size also may affect the validity of this assumption for example large grid cell sizes may not provide the optimal resolution for detecting depth gradients in areas with highly heterogeneous depths e g if all cells have similar means and variances at larger grid cell sizes although data likelihoods and grid sizes are reported in previous studies that use an hmm for geolocation e g le bris et al 2013 woillez et al 2016 sensitivity analyses that explore the effect on model accuracy and precision of choosing different options for data likelihood or grid size are rarely reported but see braun et al 2017 appendix s1 such analyses are important for selecting optimal grid sizes and likelihoods as well as for identifying potential strengths and weaknesses of the model given the degree of bathymetry heterogeneity in the study area in addition such analyses provide a measure of confidence in model outputs such as uncertainty estimates to guide choices about data likelihood specification methods and model grid sizes in the north pacific ocean we perform a series of sensitivity analyses in three regions of alaska that differ in degree of bathymetric heterogeneity in each area we apply the hmm to simulated trajectories of fish movement and compare performance estimated location and location error for different likelihood and grid size specifications we present a new method for determining grid cell depth variance used in likelihood specification we anticipate that the sensitivity analysis procedures performed here will serve as a guideline for researchers planning studies of demersal fish movement in other regions based on the degree of depth heterogeneity present in their study area or studies that involve other gridded geolocation variables such as sst 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the hmm geolocation model pedersen et al 2008 consists of a general model framework that is modified for different applications primarily through specification of the data likelihood model and selection of the appropriate grid size the hmm geolocation model operates in discrete time and space where the study area is divided into discrete grid cells the data likelihood model specifies the way data measured by the tag are related to environmental conditions present in each grid cell at each time step the underlying movement model is a random walk applied to grid cells as a two dimensional symmetrical diffusion kernel the model can incorporate multiple behavioral states by allowing the size of the diffusion kernel to vary for different types of behavior e g foraging vs migrating behavioral states are not estimated by the model but are specified prior to modeling based on auxiliary analyses that vary depending on the species and type of data available this approach greatly simplifies the model and preserves generality for application to different species or tag types however the model can estimate the size of the diffusion kernel used for each movement state through maximum likelihood the model is executed through a forward filter fig 1 that is initiated with a study area grid that has a value of 1 in the grid cell where the tagged fish was released and zero for all other grid cells the model iteratively 1 advances the probability of the fish location in the study area at the next time step by convolution with an isotropic diffusion kernel movement update and 2 updates the cell probabilities by element wise multiplication with the data likelihood model for the next time step data update following the data update probabilities are normalized and the recursion alternating movement model and data likelihood model updates continues at the next time step once the last time step is reached a backward smoothing step is performed that adjusts probability estimates obtained from the forward filter to reflect knowledge of the end location the smoothed probability estimates can be viewed directly for each time step or they can be summarized over certain time periods by calculating a residence distribution movement pathways are reconstructed by global decoding with the viterbi algorithm viterbi 1967 to produce the most probable track liu et al 2017 pedersen et al 2008 strøm et al 2017 thygesen et al 2009 woillez et al 2016 or by local decoding based on the maximum mean or mode of the smoothed probability distribution at each time step biais et al 2017 thygesen et al 2009 woillez et al 2016 local decoding methods for path reconstruction such as the weighted mean of the smoothed probability at each time step provide an estimate of uncertainty in the form of 95 probability ellipses calculated from the weighted covariance at each time step biais et al 2017 doherty et al 2017 the data likelihood model for geolocation of demersal fishes in the north pacific ocean is based on the maximum depth likelihood method that assumes fish are in contact with the sea floor at some point during each time step the likelihood of observing the maximum recorded depth of the fish at each time step given the depth distribution in each cell in the study area is obtained by integrating the probability distribution of depths in each cell between the limits of the tag maximum depth value the tag measurement uncertainty le bris et al 2013 likelihoods for different geolocation variables are combined by cell wise multiplication at each time step as long as they are not correlated le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 in the event of missing data all grid cells for the likelihood of that geolocation variable are assigned a value of one for that time step 2 2 study areas to determine the sensitivity of the model to grid size choice likelihood specification and study area depth heterogeneity we assessed model performance on simulated movement paths in three regions of the north pacific ocean that vary in degree of depth heterogeneity fig 2 in each region we simulated movement paths within 6 x 12 km study areas where high resolution 5 m multibeam sonar bathymetry sets were available high resolution bathymetry data sets provided a known distribution of depths for each grid cell size and allowed accurate depths to be extracted from simulated trajectories in the norton sound study area located in northwestern alaska fig 2a large expanses of relatively flat terrain are present and depths range from 52 to 61 m noaa ncei 2004 this study area is referred to as flat in the analyses in the central gulf of alaska study area fig 2b the bathymetry is primarily sloping and depths range from 48 m to 179 m national ocean service hydrographic surveys 2004 we refer to this area as sloping in the analyses the glacier bay study area located in the eastern gulf of alaska fig 2c features heterogeneous glacial topography depths in this study area range from 13 m to 340 m carlson et al 2002 we refer to this area as heterogeneous in the analyses in each study area the hmm was applied to the depths extracted from simulated trajectories with different combinations of grid sizes and likelihood specifications and estimated locations were then compared to known simulated locations 2 3 study area bathymetric characteristics for each study area we characterized depth gradients and depth distribution characteristics for different grid cell sizes first we aggregated the multibeam sonar bathymetry 5 m resolution data into a series of larger grid sizes by calculating the mean of the 5 m bathymetry values within each larger grid size then we calculated slope for each grid size using the aggregated bathymetry grids with the r package sdmtools vanderwal et al 2014 to characterize properties of statistical depth distributions in aggregated grid cells e g all 5 m grid cell depth values within each larger grid size we determined skewness a measure of asymmetry and kurtosis a measure of tail thickness values using the r package fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 we plotted slope skewness and kurtosis values for all grid sizes in each area as empirical cumulative frequency distributions to allow comparison with typical values for uniform normal logistic lognormal exponential gamma and beta distributions we summarized skewness and kurtosis values in cullen and frey plots cullen and frey 1999 for comparison we also visualized the observed distribution of depths across all cells in a given study area for each grid size 2 4 hmm performance comparisons 2 4 1 simulated trajectories to assess model performance under different conditions study area depth heterogeneity likelihood specification and model grid size we generated simulated fish movement pathways that allowed a direct comparison between estimated and known simulated locations in each study area we chose a random walk equivalent to diffusion as the underlying movement pattern for the simulations to match the movement model used in the hmm trajectories were simulated using the formula xt xt 1 εxt yt yt 1 εyt and εt n 0 σ2 where xt and yt are the x and y coordinates at time t xt 1 and yt 1 are the x and y coordinates at the previous time step and εt is normally distributed error with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of σ trajectories were simulated using σ 200 m which corresponded to a diffusion coefficient d of 0 02 km2 per time step at each time step the new location was compared to bathymetry to ensure that simulated tracks did not fall on land and a new location was simulated otherwise each simulation consisted of 200 steps we extracted depth at each time step from high resolution 5 m bathymetry and used those extracted depths to simulate data that would be recorded by an archival tag attached to the simulated fish tidal stage data specific to each study area were obtained from the nearest noaa water level station available at tidesandcurrents noaa gov and added at 30 min intervals to extracted depths in the simulated movement trajectories random uniform error between the interval of typical archival tag measurement resolution e g 1 m was added to the depth record to simulate noise due to tag measurement resolution the result was a simulated known movement trajectory accompanied by a simulated set of tag depth data 2 4 2 likelihood and grid size treatments maximum depth likelihood values were obtained by integrating the probability density of depths in each grid cell by the limits of the simulated tag maximum depth plus and minus the tag measurement uncertainty le bris et al 2013 conceptually this is the intersection of a uniform probability distribution representing the measurement uncertainty of the tag with the probability distribution of depths in each cell fig 3 this approach allowed incorporation of measurement uncertainty due to the tag measurement resolution and change in depth due to tides decisions needed to specify this likelihood were 1 the type of statistical distribution used to define the probability density function for depths in the study area e g normal vs log normal 2 methods for estimating parameters for each statistical distribution e g variance of a normal distribution and 3 the value of tag measurement uncertainty used to integrate the probability distribution we conducted preliminary analyses to narrow the number of potential treatments to those for which model performance was the most sensitive because model performance with statistical distributions other than the normal distribution did not have an appreciable effect on performance in the preliminary analysis we used the normal distribution for all treatments however preliminary analyses did suggest that the model was sensitive to the method used to determine the variance of the normal distribution and the value used for tag measurement uncertainty therefore our likelihood treatments consisted of three methods for specifying the variance of the normal distribution used to describe the statistical distribution of depths in each cell first because our bathymetry data sets had a higher resolution than the model grid sizes we employed a within cell method that consisted of the standard deviation of high resolution depth values used to form each aggregated grid cell second the roughness method consisted of calculating the standard deviation of the depths in the eight adjacent grid cells the roughness method has been utilized to specify the variance in previous hmm applications where the bathymetry resolution is the same as the model grid size le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 finally as an alternative to the roughness method we developed a slope method where variance in each cell was estimated based on relating the observed slope to observed within cell variances using a generalized additive model gam in areas where high resolution multibeam bathymetry data were available detailed descriptions of the different likelihood treatments are provided in supplementary data appendix a we compared model results using within cell roughness and slope methods for determining variance in the heterogeneous and sloping study areas in the flat study area we compared only the within cell and roughness methods as slopes were negligible in this area we also tested three values of depth uncertainty for each region each study area has a known depth uncertainty that is a combination of tag depth resolution assumed to be 1 m in simulations and the tidal range used for simulations flat 1 m sloping 2 m heterogeneous 4 m we tested a low value half the magnitude of the known uncertainty a true value known uncertainty and a high value twice the magnitude of the known uncertainty to understand the effects of grid size on model performance we ran the model with a progression of grid sizes 100 200 400 1000 and 2000 m in each study area 2 4 3 hmm estimation we ran the hmm on the extracted depths from simulated trajectories n 100 per area using different combinations of data likelihoods and bathymetry grid sizes data likelihoods were produced in r and sent to matlab to run the model forward filter backward smoothing and mpt computation with the hmm toolbox code provided by martin pedersen dtu denmark each hmm run produced a 3 d array of smoothed probability estimates e g spatial probability distribution of the simulated trajectory location at each time step a residency distribution that summarized the estimated locations over all time steps an estimate of diffusion and uncertainty in the diffusion estimate probability polygons for each time step and reconstructed movement paths from both the viterbi algorithm mpt and the weighted mean methods an example of a simulated trajectory in the heterogeneous study area processed with the same likelihood treatment at 200 m and 1000 m grid cell sizes demonstrates resulting reconstructed pathways fig 4 a and residence distributions fig 4b an upper limit of twice the value of diffusion used to simulate trajectories 0 04 km2 was imposed on the simulations to prevent unrealistic diffusion estimates 2 4 4 assessing hmm performance to assess the performance of different likelihood grid size combinations we calculated four metrics derived from hmm estimates and known parameters from the simulations performance metrics assessed accuracy of reconstructed pathways depth bias for reconstructed pathways whether or not probability polygons at each time step contained the simulated trajectory location coverage probability and the accuracy of model estimates for the diffusion coefficient d 2 4 4 1 mean absolute error of reconstructed movement paths we assessed accuracy of reconstructed movement paths using a mean absolute error mae performance metric this metric calculates the mean absolute distance between the known locations from simulated trajectories and positions estimated by the hmm at each time step n 200 per trajectory we calculated mae for both the mpt most probable track and the weighted mean methods of obtaining location estimates because mpt estimated locations are individual grid cells we used the center of each grid cell to measure the distance between simulated and estimated tracks 2 4 4 2 depth bias to determine whether different likelihood and grid size treatments resulted in a systemic bias toward deeper or shallower depths for reconstructed movement paths we compared the depth from estimated pathways to depth at simulated trajectory locations at each time step the depth at the simulated trajectory location was subtracted from the depth at the model estimated location using the 5 m resolution multibeam bathymetry and the average difference over all time steps was calculated the bias metric was calculated for both the mpt and the weighted mean methods of path reconstruction negative values correspond to bias toward shallower depths results from the bias performance metric were tested for significant difference from zero using a two tailed wilcoxon rank sums test for treatments found to be significantly different from zero the direction of the bias was recorded 2 4 4 3 coverage probability to determine whether probability quantiles at each time step were either over or underestimating actual error we assessed the coverage probability at the 80 and 99 probability quantiles we constructed polygons around the smallest number of grid cells that together encompassed 80 and 99 of the probability at each time step and determined whether or not the known location at that time step was within each polygon the proportion of locations that were inside their respective error polygons at each time step were reported as the coverage probability metric to determine whether coverage probability at large grid sizes could be improved in the heterogeneous areas we applied a range of additional likelihood treatments to the 1000 m grid size additional treatments consisted of different combinations of statistical distribution types for bathymetry normal lognormal t distribution adding extra variance to the bathymetry probability distribution switching from a uniform to a gaussian distribution for tag measurement error and using a fixed value of diffusion boxplots of additional treatment results were produced for 80 and 99 coverage probability metrics 2 4 4 4 diffusion we compared the value of diffusion estimated by the hmm for different treatments to the value used to simulate fish movement trajectories because simulating pathways in a bounded area could result in a different effective value of d than was used to generate the simulated paths we calculated an empirical value to use for comparison with values estimated by the hmm the empirical value for d was determined by calculating the mean squared displacement msd from the initial and final locations of simulated paths for all three areas combined n 300 using the formula msd 4dt börger and fryxell 2012 results from the diffusion performance metric were tested for significant difference from the empirical value of diffusion for simulated trajectories using a two tailed wilcoxon rank sums test for treatments found to be significantly different the direction e g higher or lower was recorded 2 4 4 5 summarizing performance to summarize results among treatments by grid size treatments were ranked according to their performance for each metric the best performance was defined for each metric as 1 mae lowest values 2 bias closest to zero 3 coverage probability closest to 80 or 99 and 4 treatment estimated diffusion closest to the empirical value of diffusion treatments were ranked by calculating decile values for each treatment ranking all treatments by decile then averaging rank scores from all deciles for each treatment for the bias metric only the median was used to rank treatments because the full range of bias measurements reflects the degree of depth heterogeneity in each study area all statistics and analyses were computed using the r program r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 study area characteristics study area slope distributions differed strongly among the three study areas slope values were greater in the heterogeneous area compared to the sloping area by a factor of 10 and values in the sloping area were greater than the flat area by a factor of 10 fig 5 in the heterogeneous area slopes were largest in the 100 m grid size but decreased as grid size increased in the sloping area 100 m 400 m grid sizes had similar slopes but slope decreased for 1000 m and 2000 m grid sizes in the flat area slopes were very small for all grid sizes differences in kurtosis and skewness values for depth distributions in each grid cell were also apparent among study areas in the heterogeneous area kurtosis values increased with grid cell size values for the 1000 m and 2000 m grid sizes were similar and larger than 100 m 400 m grid sizes kurtosis values in the sloping area were slightly smaller than the heterogeneous area and values for the 1000 m grid were more similar to values for the 400 m grid negative skew i e skew toward shallower depths was observed for the 1000 m and 2000 m grid sizes in the heterogeneous areas and the 2000 m grid size in the sloping area in the flat area both kurtosis and skewness values were low and similar among all grid sizes when compared with various types of distributions in the cullen frey plots small grid cell sizes in all study areas were concentrated in the vicinity characteristic of uniform to normal fig 6 as grid cell size increased distributions in the heterogeneous fig 6a and sloping fig 6b areas became more consistent with non normal and non uniform distributions however distributions in the flat area were similar across all grid cell sizes and consistent with normal or uniform distributions fig 6c 3 2 assessing hmm performance 3 2 1 mean absolute error of reconstructed movement paths in general mean absolute error mae for the weighted mean method of path reconstruction increased as grid size increased for the heterogeneous and sloping areas but was consistent across grid size for the flat area fig 7 a model performance was best smallest mae values in the heterogeneous area intermediate in the sloping area and lowest in the flat area for the 100 m 200 m grid sizes within each grid size treatment performance varied most by variance method in the heterogeneous and sloping areas where the roughness method consistently had lower performance compared to within cell and slope methods in the sloping area the within cell and slope methods had similar performance whereas the within cell method consistently performed better in the heterogeneous area in the flat area treatment performance varied most by depth uncertainty where the true value performed best the high value was intermediate and the low value performed the worst however the within cell method of variance outperformed the roughness method for the true and high values of depth uncertainty in general trends for the mpt method of reconstruction were similar to the weighted mean method fig 7b however the weighted mean performed better than the mpt method in the 100 m 200 m grid sizes in the heterogeneous and sloping areas for mpt reconstruction the roughness variance method performed better than the within cell and slope methods in the smallest grid sizes in the heterogeneous and sloping areas overall best results for both the weighted mean and mpt methods of path reconstruction were observed for the heterogeneous area at small grid sizes and the flat area at the largest grid sizes fig 8 a and b 3 2 2 depth bias in general the median values for depth bias e g the mean difference between depth at simulated locations and the depth at model estimated locations were small for both the weighted mean and mpt methods of path reconstruction table 1 a and 1b the greatest biases were observed in the heterogeneous area in the direction of deeper water for grid sizes 400 m 1000 m the roughness method of variance was not biased in the 1000 m 2000 m grid sizes for either the weighted mean or the mpt paths some bias in the direction of shallower water was observed in the smaller grid sizes in the heterogeneous area although many treatments in the sloping and flat areas were observed to have significant bias the magnitude of the difference from zero consisted of only a few cm although median bias values were similar between the weighted mean and mpt methods of path reconstruction the range in mpt bias tended to be much smaller than the range in weighted mean bias values supplementary data figure b 1 in general bias was lowest in the flat study area for both the weighted mean and mpt path reconstruction methods fig 8c and d 3 2 3 coverage probability in general coverage probability at nominal levels 80 and 99 error polygons was only achieved for the 99 error polygons at the smallest grid sizes 100 m 200 m in the heterogeneous study area fig 9 coverage probability approached nominal levels for the 99 error polygon for some treatments at the 400 m grid size in the heterogeneous area at grid sizes 100 m 400 m in the sloping area and at grid sizes 100 m 1000 m in the flat study area the true and high levels of depth uncertainty outperformed the low level of depth uncertainty for grid sizes 100 m 400 m in all areas and the 1000 m 2000 m grid size in the flat area but performance did not vary by depth uncertainty in the 1000 m 2000 m grid sizes in the heterogeneous and sloping areas in general the within cell and slope variance methods outperformed the roughness method for grid sizes 400 m 2000 m in the heterogeneous and sloping areas the slope method performed as well or better than the within cell method for the 2000 m grid size in both heterogeneous and sloping areas performance trends by treatment for 80 error polygons were the same as for the 99 error polygons but the magnitude of coverage probability was substantially lower than nominal levels compared to performance for the 99 error polygons of the additional treatments performed to achieve increased coverage probability in a large 1000 m grid cell size in the heterogeneous area the best result was achieved by introducing a gaussian tag measurement uncertainty distribution with a s d of 5 m a gaussian bathymetry grid cell distribution with an extra 5 m of variance and a fixed diffusion coefficient of 0 04 km2 table 2 supplementary data figure b 2 however the best performing treatment only increased the median 80 coverage probability from 52 to 60 fixing the value of diffusion at 0 012 km2 the empirical value of diffusion for simulated trajectories resulted in substantial improvements in mae but not coverage probability in general treatments that increased mae resulted in decreased performance for coverage probability adding extra variance to the grid cell variance had little effect on performance by itself but when combined with use of the gaussian tag measurement error performance was increased specifying other types of distributions lognormal t distribution with 1 and 2 df for the grid cell probability density function resulted in reduced coverage probability compared to gaussian distribution overall performance was highest in the heterogeneous area for the smallest grid sizes 100 m and 200 m the sloping area for the 400 m grid size and the flat study area for the largest grid sizes 1000 m and 2000 m fig 8e and f 3 2 4 diffusion in general diffusion was overestimated for all grid sizes in the heterogeneous area and larger grid cells 400 2000 m of the sloping area table 1c fig 10 performance was best for the 100 m 200 m grid sizes in the sloping area where the high level of uncertainty performed better than the true and the low in the flat area performance differed strongly by level of depth uncertainty diffusion estimates for the low treatment consistently approached the diffusion threshold value of 0 04 km2 while estimates were closest to actual values for the true and high treatments in contrast differences in performance in the heterogeneous area were mostly due to variance method where the roughness method consistently provided estimates that were closer to the actual value of diffusion compared to the within cell or slope methods overall optimal performance was observed in the heterogeneous and sloping areas at small grid sizes and in the flat area at larger grid sizes fig 8g 4 discussion the hmm geolocation model developed by pedersen et al 2008 has provided a robust framework that can be adapted for different geolocation applications e g study areas or fish species when adapting the hmm for specific applications it is necessary to 1 choose an appropriate data likelihood model 2 select a grid size and 3 decide whether to estimate diffusion with the model or to use prior knowledge to designate the size of the diffusion kernel the results of our simulation exercises suggest that the degree of bathymetric heterogeneity in the study area can impact the model results and should be considered when making these decisions in addition our work provides several implications for interpretation of results given grid size likelihood specification methods and degree of habitat heterogeneity 4 1 data likelihood model parameterization 4 1 1 variance specification the choice of method used to specify grid cell variance affected model performance for large grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas where grid cell depth distributions departed from normal this is an important finding because the roughness method which performed worse than the other two methods has frequently been employed in other hmm geolocation studies braun et al 2017 le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 our research suggests that in areas with heterogeneous topography different methods for obtaining variance should be explored and the method that provides the most realistic values should be chosen in the current study the method of obtaining grid cell variance by linking known grid cell variance to grid cell bathymetric slope in areas with high resolution multibeam data provided better results than the roughness approach for larger grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas performance with the slope method was sometimes equivalent and sometimes better than the within cell method therefore this study has provided a potential alternative method for specifying variance based on auxiliary data however additional verification is required to ensure the validity of applying the method outside of areas with high resolution depth data the multibeam areas that were used to determine the relationship between s d and grid cell slope for example the relationship between cell variance and slope could be determined by one multibeam area and tested in another multibeam area within the same larger geographic region the approach of using auxiliary data to define variance may be helpful for other gridded geolocation variables aside from depth for example some sst data sets such as multi scale ultra high resolution mur sst are accompanied by estimates of error in each grid cell these should be investigated for use in specifying cell variance rather than or perhaps in addition to utilizing the roughness method in heterogeneous areas using an expectation maximization framework to fit the model woillez et al 2016 where variance parameters are estimated rather than specified a priori may also be an option for using the hmm in heterogeneous areas although the roughness method of determining variance decreased performance at larger grid sizes for the mae metric it did have advantages in other situations because it performed best in the smallest grid sizes where variance values tended to be larger than the other two methods supplementary data figure a 2 adding extra variance to the within cell variance may increase performance at smaller grid sizes the roughness method also performed better in the diffusion coefficient estimation and bias performance metrics which suggests that increasing the grid cell variance may also improve performance in these areas improved performance of the coverage probability metric for treatments with extra added variance table 2 supports this observation 4 1 2 depth measurement uncertainty determining the likelihood value by integrating between the limits of tag measurement resolution le bris et al 2013 has been featured in several recent applications of the hmm braun et al 2017 2018 liu et al 2017 this approach is valuable in that it allows explicit incorporation of tag measurement uncertainty into the calculation of the likelihood however our research demonstrates that the performance of the model can be sensitive to the magnitude of the value chosen in general all around performance was best when the chosen value reflected the true level of uncertainty associated with tag measurement although the low value resulted in slight increases in performance for the mae metric in the 100 m 400 m grid sizes of the heterogeneous and sloping areas performance for the coverage probability and diffusion metrics was worse for the low value compared to the true and high values for larger grid cells our results indicate that it is better to overestimate than underestimate the depth measurement uncertainty this may be more important for flat areas where differences in performance by depth uncertainty level were more pronounced than the heterogeneous and sloping areas the use of a gaussian distribution to represent tag measurement uncertainty may represent an improvement in the model for our application tag measurement resolution may be uniform for some types of tag sensors but with added tidal data the depth measurement uncertainty becomes gaussian demersal fish data likelihood models that include tidal geolocation pedersen et al 2008 explicitly account for change in depth due to tides in contrast our data likelihood model does not include tidal data and therefore we must account for uncertainty in tag measurement due to tidal fluctuations in another way in areas of the north pacific ocean the tidal amplitude can exceed 3 m depending on geographic location danielson et al 2011 for large scale demersal fish applications in this region it may be desirable to use a gaussian depth uncertainty distribution that is wide enough to incorporate potential movement of the fish to areas with a greater range of tides than are found at the starting location 4 2 grid size selection selection of grid size is a key consideration for implementation of the hmm the resolution of available maps the size of the study area in which the animal moves the strength of geolocation gradients in the study area the movement speed of the fish and spatial resolution required by research goals e g residence time in marine protected areas should all be considered when selecting a grid size in addition when the data likelihood model combines multiple environmental variables e g both depth and bottom temperature the choice of grid size is constrained to the lowest grid resolution available for each variable increases in time and computer power needed for processing are also a consideration for grid size selection but with modern computing power this is becoming less of a concern our research suggests that in addition to these other considerations the statistical distribution of depths for each cell size plays a role in grid size selection grid cells with an approximately normal distribution provided a range of cell sizes where model performance was similar within each area optimal statistical distribution grid sizes were 100 m 200 m in the heterogeneous area 100 m 400 m in the sloping area and all grid sizes in the flat area reduced performance of the 2000 m grid in the flat area despite an approximately normal depth distribution within grid cells indicates that other factors such as movement rate relative to grid size in low gradient areas may play a role in performance our range of grid sizes tested did not include grid sizes substantially smaller than the movement rate used to simulate the trajectories so insights into whether this could adversely affect performance were not provided by this simulation exercise 4 3 diffusion the decision to estimate the diffusion coefficient d in the model or to use a pre determined value is influenced by study area gradients grid size and likelihood specification methods as well as whether prior information on fish movement rates is available some hmm applications estimate d in the model le bris et al 2013 woillez et al 2016 while others pick a value based on known animal movement speeds braun et al 2017 liu et al 2017 the model is known to be sensitive to the value of the diffusion coefficient woillez et al 2016 so making this decision is a critical aspect of adapting the model for different applications the results of our simulations suggest that estimating diffusion in large grid cells in heterogeneous and sloping areas is associated with decreased model performance that may be compounded by the method used to specify likelihood the model overestimated diffusion in these situations frequently approaching its fixed upper threshold but optimal performance for other metrics e g mae and coverage probability was associated with estimated values of diffusion that were closer to the value used to create the trajectories therefore if accurate information on the movement of fish is available using a known value of d might result in better model performance in these situations however for small grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas where gradients are strong and grid depth distributions are approximately normal estimating diffusion is likely to provide reasonable results for other performance metrics as well in this case estimating d makes sense and estimated values of d can then be used in areas where gradients are less strong or in heterogeneous areas where larger grid cell sizes are necessary if estimated in the model the diffusion coefficient should not be taken as reflecting actual animal movement speed but rather viewed as the engine that drives the movement model in contrast to heterogeneous and sloping areas estimated diffusion values in the flat area tended to be underestimated as much as overestimated in the absence of strong environmental gradients the model will tend to favor more direct movement pathways connecting the release and recovery locations so the size of the diffusion coefficient will be strongly related to net displacement the exception to this occurred for the low value of depth measurement uncertainty which frequently approached the threshold value set for diffusion this may have been caused by high ratio of added noise to study area depth gradients e g added noise was 1 m for tag resolution and 0 2 m for tide and the median slope for the 100 m grid was 0 1 m per 100 m and reduced intersection of depth measurements with bathymetry grid cell probability density functions therefore in low gradient areas it might be worthwhile to specify a reasonable diffusion size from prior data sources rather than risk under or over estimating it with the model 4 4 implications for interpreting model output 4 4 1 movement path reconstruction our comparison of two different methods for reconstructing movement paths suggests that at small spatial scales with complete data sets the weighted mean method performs either better or equivalently to the mpt method although few advantages for mpt over the weighted mean method were observed in this small scale simulation study the mpt may have advantages in larger scale applications or situations with missing data or low spatial gradients the two types of paths are calculated using fundamentally different approaches where the mpt is the most likely sequence of states e g grid cells and the weighted mean is derived from the 3d array of smoothed probability estimates the mpt may diverge from the smoothed estimates in areas where gradients are weak pedersen et al 2011 locations estimated with the weighted mean method may have low probability if they happen to fall between two areas of high probability thygesen et al 2009 in our study this phenomenon was demonstrated by the much reduced range in depth differences between the simulated and estimated locations for the mpt compared to the weighted mean method therefore it may be beneficial to reconstruct movement paths with both methods in situations where geolocation data are sparse or in areas of low gradients 4 4 2 coverage probability understanding error associated with location estimates is an important aspect of geolocation and a primary benefit of using complicated state space models with the hmm estimated locations of the tagged fish can be represented by probability quantiles e g 95 and 50 at each time step pedersen et al 2008 in addition some researchers prefer to use the daily probability estimates or summarized residence distributions as indications of fish locations rather than reconstructing movement pathways le bris et al 2013 therefore understanding the ways in which the probability surface actually corresponds to the area that is likely to contain the true location of the fish at a specific time is crucial for interpreting hmm results we found that the probability quantiles derived from the probability surface at each time step did not include the true location as often as expected from the nominal coverage probability this suggests that the model tends to underestimate the true uncertainty in location at a given time step this was noticeable particularly for the larger grid sizes in the heterogeneous and sloping areas it is possible that these results are due to some aspect of the model such as backward smoothing from the recovery location that tends to result in a direct path between release and recovery locations when geolocation gradients are not informative it is also possible that these results are due to some artifact of the simulations or the small and confined nature of that study area in this study however we believe this should be an area for future investigation because probability contours are a common way to interpret probability surfaces one option for increasing coverage probability is to make changes to the data likelihood model our results suggest that coverage probability may be improved by using a gaussian distribution for tag measurement uncertainty instead of a uniform distribution adding extra variance to the bathymetry probability or increasing the depth measurement uncertainty however these changes to the likelihood resulted in only marginal improvement in coverage probability and came at a cost of decreased accuracy of the reconstructed pathways for the 1000 m grid size in the heterogeneous area this indicates that a trade off between coverage probability and model accuracy may exist simulations conducted over larger scales in space and time may be needed to more fully understand potential trade offs for coverage probability and accuracy at scales relevant to fish migration coverage probability may also be increased by increasing the diffusion coefficient d a previous study that examined aspects of model sensitivity found that increasing values of d led to greater spread of probability values across the probability surface and resulted in local but not global changes to the probability surface woillez et al 2016 one potential caution about increasing d is the poor performance for both mae and coverage probability that were observed with high values of d for large grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas however our simulations do indicate that for small grid sizes in areas with high gradients an increase in d should increase coverage probability with only small reduction in mae performance another option for addressing the discrepancy between probability quantiles and coverage probability is to determine which probability quantile actually corresponds to the coverage probability desired for example a 99 probability polygon would provide a 95 coverage probability for some treatments in the 100 m and 200 m grid sizes in the heterogeneous area probability values are typically so small that increasing the quantile from 99 to 99 99 would add many more grid cells to probability polygons this option would preserve the accuracy of the reconstructed pathways however additional work would be needed to verify this approach preferably in a larger study area without potentially confounding boundary issues in addition this result should be confirmed for recently developed hmm geolocation software packages such as hmmoce braun et al 2017 that utilize a slightly different method for constructing the movement kernel compared to the matlab version provided by pedersen et al 2008 4 5 caveats the simulation exercises reported here are primarily aimed at providing insight into the mechanisms and relative performance of different likelihood and grid size treatments and should not be taken as indications of specific values for precision or accuracy expected in each area there are a number of caveats that should be kept in mind when considering this work first edge effects from conducting simulations in relatively small study areas may be present however all areas should be equally affected by edge effects as study areas were all the same shape and size second multibeam bathymetry was assumed to be known without error for simulations but error could be present in multibeam data sets in particular the multibeam area in the flat area of norton sound has such little variation in depth that artifacts from the multibeam mapping may influence study area attributes such as slope and skewness finally this work is a small subset of questions about model sensitivity other issues that should be tested include the effect of map error different movement patterns of fish e g non dispersive or directed or the effects of gaps in data 4 6 implications for other hmm applications the hmm originally developed for geolocation of atlantic cod in the north sea pedersen et al 2008 thygesen et al 2009 is a powerful flexible method for characterizing fish movement at multiple spatial and temporal scales and is ideal for the use of gridded geolocation data sources it has been adapted to study the movement of demersal fish species such as atlantic cod gadus morhua in the gulf of maine groger et al 2007 liu et al 2017 zemeckis et al 2017 the british isles neat et al 2014 the north sea hobson et al 2009 wright et al 2018 the gulf of st lawrence le bris et al 2013 and the faroe plateau ottosen et al 2017 it has provided insights into seasonal movement of atlantic halibut hippoglossus hippoglossus in the gulf of st lawrence le bris et al 2018 and relationships with sea floor structure for atlantic cod plaice pleuronectes platessa and thornback ray raja clavata in the north sea wright et al 2018 the hmm has also been employed to study the movement of pelagic fish such as european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax off the coast of france de pontual et al 2018 woillez et al 2016 atlantic salmon salmo salar in iceland guðjónsson et al 2015 canada strøm et al 2017 and norway strøm et al 2018 the porbeagle shark lamna nasus in northeast atlantic biais et al 2017 saunders et al 2011 and blue prionace glauca mako isurus oxyrinchus and basking cetorhinus maximus sharks in the western atlantic braun et al 2017 2018 in addition to studies in temperate and sub arctic latitudes hmm has been used to study a multitude of tropical and sub tropical fishes arostegui et al 2018 eveson et al 2018 patterson et al 2018a b the broad range of species and geographic regions over which the hmm has been applied in recent years indicates that it is becoming a major tool in the study of fish movement and behavior however adapting the hmm for different applications is not always a straightforward process it involves obtaining an understanding of study area attributes fish movement rates precision and accuracy of bathymetric maps and an accurate estimate of uncertainty in tag measurement grid size data likelihood model and diffusion coefficients are usually reported in manuscripts that utilize the hmm but little guidance is available for choosing them to suit specific applications although our work focuses on one type of application depth based geolocation of demersal fishes our findings on model sensitivity to these parameterization choices suggest that the degree of study area heterogeneity should be considered when using other gridded geolocation variables such as sst ocean heat content temperature depth profiles braun et al 2017 or geomagnetic data nielsen 2019 this study also points to the value of customizing data likelihood model parameters grid size and diffusion for each species and or study area for achieving maximum performance and interpretation of model results the original code provided by m w pedersen in the matlab programming language has been modified to suit specific demersal fish applications liu et al 2017 the matlab code has also been translated into r code r package hmmoce and expanded to include multiple geolocation variables available for pelagic species braun et al 2017 this r code implementation readily allows customization of hmm parameters such as grid size and diffusion coefficients and r scripts may be altered if additional changes to the data likelihood model are needed however this package generally specifies grid cell variance as the standard deviation of adjacent grid cells i e roughness method in our study which performed worse than the other methods we tested in heterogeneous and sloping study areas our findings on model sensitivity to study area attributes and the need to customize model parameters are relevant for other researchers because several black box geolocation services have recently become available to researchers that may not allow adequate customization for specific applications for example wildlife computers redmond wa usa includes an hmm as part of its analysis package for psat data the model has a fixed grid size 0 25 and minimum speed of movement 1 m s that may be faster than the fish is likely to move the track loc data processing service provided by argos cls toulouse france can estimate locations from multiple types of archival tags but few details about data likelihood models or other model parameters are publicly available neither company has provided a peer reviewed description of the models they employ for the geolocation services although the use of these services is a convenience for researchers without a full understanding of the parameterization of those models it is difficult to interpret their results with respect to how accurately they might characterize true movement pathways and habitat use and the relative trade offs that they incorporate it is unlikely that any single parameterization will perform equivalently across species and among diverse habitats 5 conclusions we adapted a hmm for geolocation of demersal fishes in the north pacific ocean using a maximum depth likelihood our simulation study indicates that the model is sensitive to the degree of bathymetry heterogeneity in the study area and performance tends to decrease in heterogeneous areas when depth distributions within model grid cells depart from a normal distribution we found that a new way of specifying grid cell variance based on study area slope improved performance in larger grid cells over standard variance specification methods our work demonstrates the importance of understanding model assumptions and the ability to customize model grid size data likelihood model specification and diffusion for specific applications although our simulations were focused on geolocation of demersal fishes based on bathymetry our insights into model sensitivity and parameterization are applicable to other gridded geolocation variables such as sst ocean heat content temperature depth profiles and geomagnetic geolocation that have wider application for pelagic fishes acknowledgments we thank martin pedersen for his work developing the

article 
25061,state space geolocation models can provide valuable information on the large scale movements of many fish species the sensitivity of such complex models to model assumptions and fixed parameters is rarely assessed quantitatively yet is important for interpretation of results and adaptation for new species and different geographic regions we hypothesized that parameterization and performance of a discrete hidden markov model hmm with a gaussian depth based data likelihood for demersal fishes first implemented in the flat terrain of the north sea would be affected by the more heterogeneous depths found in the north pacific ocean we ran the hmm on depth data from simulated random walk movement trajectories in flat sloping and heterogeneous study areas in the north pacific ocean where known depth distributions in each model grid cell were provided by high resolution 5 m multibeam bathymetry data performance was compared among different data likelihood specifications and grid sizes in each area we found that model performance decreased when grid cell depth distributions departed from normal distributions performance decreased with increasing grid size in the heterogeneous and sloping study areas but not the flat study area a new method for specifying grid cell depth variance based on study area slope performed better than the standard method of obtaining variance from adjacent grid cell values for larger grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas overall model performance was highest in the heterogeneous and sloping areas at small grid sizes and in the flat area at large grid sizes the estimated value of diffusion was also sensitive to bathymetric heterogeneity and variance specification method these results suggest that the degree of study area heterogeneity should be considered when choosing fixed parameters such as likelihood and grid size and when interpreting the model results in addition this approach demonstrates the need for sensitivity analyses when using the model on a new species and in a new study area keywords archival tags demersal fish fish geolocation fish movement hidden markov model state space model 1 introduction demersal fishes are a major component of commercial fisheries in the north pacific ocean particularly in alaska usa in 2015 2 2 million tons of groundfishes comprised 80 of the total commercial harvest and 52 of the total ex vessel revenue from commercial fisheries off alaska fissel et al 2016 demersal fish species such as pacific halibut hippoglossus stenolepis pacific cod gadus macrocephalus and sablefish anoplopoma fimbria are known to undertake large scale ontogenetic and seasonal spawning migrations hanselman et al 2014 loher and seitz 2006 shimada and kimura 1994 webster et al 2013 during which fish may move among management areas or cross international boundaries therefore understanding migration characteristics such as timing pathways and spawning locations is important for the management of these demersal fish species detailed information on fish migrations can be provided by electronic tags that continuously record data on environmental variables such as depth and temperature while attached to fishes at liberty data collected by the tags are matched to maps of environmental variables in the study area to determine likely locations of the tagged fish between release and recovery a process known as geolocation geolocation methods vary based on fish behavior tag type and geographical region for example light intensity and sea surface temperature sst data are commonly used for estimating position of pelagic fishes such as tuna scombridae teo et al 2004 however methods for geolocation of demersal fish species rely primarily on depth data hunter et al 2004 pedersen et al 2008 but may include light based longitude if fish occupy depths 150 m seitz et al 2006 as well as bottom temperature le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 or salinity information neuenfeldt et al 2007 geolocation models estimate plausible movement paths of fishes by combining tag data with knowledge about how animals are likely to move through the study area e g swim speed or movement pattern most recently developed geolocation models are state space models ssms which consist of 1 a fish movement model that predicts possible locations of the tagged fish at the next time step and 2 a data likelihood model that matches data from the tagged fish to features of the study area at each time step ssms are ideal for geolocation because they can accommodate noisy data as well as quantify uncertainty in fish location estimates and other movement parameters such as movement speed patterson et al 2008 ssms for geolocation can either be parametric such as a kalman filter or non parametric such as a hidden markov model hmm or a particle filter parametric ssms are useful for geolocation of open ocean pelagic fishes which are characterized by gaussian data types light and unconstrained behavior nielsen et al 2006 non linear ssms are more suitable for demersal fishes which are characterized by non linear data types such as depth and potentially constrained near shore behavior andersen et al 2007 pedersen et al 2008 an hmm developed for geolocation of atlantic cod in the north sea pedersen et al 2008 thygesen et al 2009 has provided a flexible model framework that can be readily adapted for geolocation of different fish species in different regions biais et al 2017 le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 neat et al 2014 neilson et al 2014 strøm et al 2017 woillez et al 2016 adapting this hmm for different applications primarily involves changes to the data likelihood model i e the specific way in which tag data are matched to maps of environmental variables in the study area and selection of the appropriate model grid size however adapting the hmm for different geolocation applications is not a trivial process because both data likelihood and grid size specifications depend on characteristics of the study area tag data and fish behavior for example data likelihood models depend on the type of geolocation data collected by the tag tag measurement resolution and frequency strength of environmental gradients in the study area and accuracy and resolution of available maps of environmental characteristics an understanding of fish behavior is also important for the specification of data likelihood e g whether the fish is expected to be at the surface at the bottom or moving throughout the water column the optimal model grid size depends on the spatial gradients of geolocation variables in the study area as well as the speed at which fish are expected to move through it to adapt the pedersen et al 2008 hmm for the geolocation of demersal fishes in the north pacific ocean we chose a data likelihood model that is based on matching the maximum depth of the fish at each time step to bathymetric maps of the study area for this likelihood method demersal fishes are assumed to be on or near the bottom at some point during each time step the maximum depth likelihood method was chosen because bathymetry gradients can be steep in the north pacific ocean and bathymetric map resolution and accuracy are improving steadily in many areas zimmermann and prescott 2015 as additional data are collected in contrast gradients in tidal amplitude and phase required for the tidal geolocation method that has been utilized for geolocation of demersal fishes in other geographic regions hunter et al 2004 pedersen et al 2008 are weak in many areas of the north pacific ocean danielson et al 2011 in addition because the maximum depth likelihood can be used for both detailed e g physically recovered and summarized data from pop up satellite archival tags e g transmitted through argos satellites it can be applied to most demersal fish geolocation data sets therefore our data likelihood model is based on maximum daily depth but other types of geolocation data e g bottom temperature light based longitude or tidal amplitude and phase can be added when available the use of depth records and bathymetry maps as the primary source of geolocation data has several potential implications for data likelihood and grid size specification depending on the degree and nature of bathymetric heterogeneity present in the study area for example the maximum depth data likelihood described in greater detail below assumes a normal distribution of depths within each bathymetry grid cell le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 pedersen et al 2008 although this assumption may be valid in the flat terrain where the model was originally developed the north sea it may not be valid in the more heterogeneous areas found in the north pacific ocean the choice of model grid size also may affect the validity of this assumption for example large grid cell sizes may not provide the optimal resolution for detecting depth gradients in areas with highly heterogeneous depths e g if all cells have similar means and variances at larger grid cell sizes although data likelihoods and grid sizes are reported in previous studies that use an hmm for geolocation e g le bris et al 2013 woillez et al 2016 sensitivity analyses that explore the effect on model accuracy and precision of choosing different options for data likelihood or grid size are rarely reported but see braun et al 2017 appendix s1 such analyses are important for selecting optimal grid sizes and likelihoods as well as for identifying potential strengths and weaknesses of the model given the degree of bathymetry heterogeneity in the study area in addition such analyses provide a measure of confidence in model outputs such as uncertainty estimates to guide choices about data likelihood specification methods and model grid sizes in the north pacific ocean we perform a series of sensitivity analyses in three regions of alaska that differ in degree of bathymetric heterogeneity in each area we apply the hmm to simulated trajectories of fish movement and compare performance estimated location and location error for different likelihood and grid size specifications we present a new method for determining grid cell depth variance used in likelihood specification we anticipate that the sensitivity analysis procedures performed here will serve as a guideline for researchers planning studies of demersal fish movement in other regions based on the degree of depth heterogeneity present in their study area or studies that involve other gridded geolocation variables such as sst 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the hmm geolocation model pedersen et al 2008 consists of a general model framework that is modified for different applications primarily through specification of the data likelihood model and selection of the appropriate grid size the hmm geolocation model operates in discrete time and space where the study area is divided into discrete grid cells the data likelihood model specifies the way data measured by the tag are related to environmental conditions present in each grid cell at each time step the underlying movement model is a random walk applied to grid cells as a two dimensional symmetrical diffusion kernel the model can incorporate multiple behavioral states by allowing the size of the diffusion kernel to vary for different types of behavior e g foraging vs migrating behavioral states are not estimated by the model but are specified prior to modeling based on auxiliary analyses that vary depending on the species and type of data available this approach greatly simplifies the model and preserves generality for application to different species or tag types however the model can estimate the size of the diffusion kernel used for each movement state through maximum likelihood the model is executed through a forward filter fig 1 that is initiated with a study area grid that has a value of 1 in the grid cell where the tagged fish was released and zero for all other grid cells the model iteratively 1 advances the probability of the fish location in the study area at the next time step by convolution with an isotropic diffusion kernel movement update and 2 updates the cell probabilities by element wise multiplication with the data likelihood model for the next time step data update following the data update probabilities are normalized and the recursion alternating movement model and data likelihood model updates continues at the next time step once the last time step is reached a backward smoothing step is performed that adjusts probability estimates obtained from the forward filter to reflect knowledge of the end location the smoothed probability estimates can be viewed directly for each time step or they can be summarized over certain time periods by calculating a residence distribution movement pathways are reconstructed by global decoding with the viterbi algorithm viterbi 1967 to produce the most probable track liu et al 2017 pedersen et al 2008 strøm et al 2017 thygesen et al 2009 woillez et al 2016 or by local decoding based on the maximum mean or mode of the smoothed probability distribution at each time step biais et al 2017 thygesen et al 2009 woillez et al 2016 local decoding methods for path reconstruction such as the weighted mean of the smoothed probability at each time step provide an estimate of uncertainty in the form of 95 probability ellipses calculated from the weighted covariance at each time step biais et al 2017 doherty et al 2017 the data likelihood model for geolocation of demersal fishes in the north pacific ocean is based on the maximum depth likelihood method that assumes fish are in contact with the sea floor at some point during each time step the likelihood of observing the maximum recorded depth of the fish at each time step given the depth distribution in each cell in the study area is obtained by integrating the probability distribution of depths in each cell between the limits of the tag maximum depth value the tag measurement uncertainty le bris et al 2013 likelihoods for different geolocation variables are combined by cell wise multiplication at each time step as long as they are not correlated le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 in the event of missing data all grid cells for the likelihood of that geolocation variable are assigned a value of one for that time step 2 2 study areas to determine the sensitivity of the model to grid size choice likelihood specification and study area depth heterogeneity we assessed model performance on simulated movement paths in three regions of the north pacific ocean that vary in degree of depth heterogeneity fig 2 in each region we simulated movement paths within 6 x 12 km study areas where high resolution 5 m multibeam sonar bathymetry sets were available high resolution bathymetry data sets provided a known distribution of depths for each grid cell size and allowed accurate depths to be extracted from simulated trajectories in the norton sound study area located in northwestern alaska fig 2a large expanses of relatively flat terrain are present and depths range from 52 to 61 m noaa ncei 2004 this study area is referred to as flat in the analyses in the central gulf of alaska study area fig 2b the bathymetry is primarily sloping and depths range from 48 m to 179 m national ocean service hydrographic surveys 2004 we refer to this area as sloping in the analyses the glacier bay study area located in the eastern gulf of alaska fig 2c features heterogeneous glacial topography depths in this study area range from 13 m to 340 m carlson et al 2002 we refer to this area as heterogeneous in the analyses in each study area the hmm was applied to the depths extracted from simulated trajectories with different combinations of grid sizes and likelihood specifications and estimated locations were then compared to known simulated locations 2 3 study area bathymetric characteristics for each study area we characterized depth gradients and depth distribution characteristics for different grid cell sizes first we aggregated the multibeam sonar bathymetry 5 m resolution data into a series of larger grid sizes by calculating the mean of the 5 m bathymetry values within each larger grid size then we calculated slope for each grid size using the aggregated bathymetry grids with the r package sdmtools vanderwal et al 2014 to characterize properties of statistical depth distributions in aggregated grid cells e g all 5 m grid cell depth values within each larger grid size we determined skewness a measure of asymmetry and kurtosis a measure of tail thickness values using the r package fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 we plotted slope skewness and kurtosis values for all grid sizes in each area as empirical cumulative frequency distributions to allow comparison with typical values for uniform normal logistic lognormal exponential gamma and beta distributions we summarized skewness and kurtosis values in cullen and frey plots cullen and frey 1999 for comparison we also visualized the observed distribution of depths across all cells in a given study area for each grid size 2 4 hmm performance comparisons 2 4 1 simulated trajectories to assess model performance under different conditions study area depth heterogeneity likelihood specification and model grid size we generated simulated fish movement pathways that allowed a direct comparison between estimated and known simulated locations in each study area we chose a random walk equivalent to diffusion as the underlying movement pattern for the simulations to match the movement model used in the hmm trajectories were simulated using the formula xt xt 1 εxt yt yt 1 εyt and εt n 0 σ2 where xt and yt are the x and y coordinates at time t xt 1 and yt 1 are the x and y coordinates at the previous time step and εt is normally distributed error with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of σ trajectories were simulated using σ 200 m which corresponded to a diffusion coefficient d of 0 02 km2 per time step at each time step the new location was compared to bathymetry to ensure that simulated tracks did not fall on land and a new location was simulated otherwise each simulation consisted of 200 steps we extracted depth at each time step from high resolution 5 m bathymetry and used those extracted depths to simulate data that would be recorded by an archival tag attached to the simulated fish tidal stage data specific to each study area were obtained from the nearest noaa water level station available at tidesandcurrents noaa gov and added at 30 min intervals to extracted depths in the simulated movement trajectories random uniform error between the interval of typical archival tag measurement resolution e g 1 m was added to the depth record to simulate noise due to tag measurement resolution the result was a simulated known movement trajectory accompanied by a simulated set of tag depth data 2 4 2 likelihood and grid size treatments maximum depth likelihood values were obtained by integrating the probability density of depths in each grid cell by the limits of the simulated tag maximum depth plus and minus the tag measurement uncertainty le bris et al 2013 conceptually this is the intersection of a uniform probability distribution representing the measurement uncertainty of the tag with the probability distribution of depths in each cell fig 3 this approach allowed incorporation of measurement uncertainty due to the tag measurement resolution and change in depth due to tides decisions needed to specify this likelihood were 1 the type of statistical distribution used to define the probability density function for depths in the study area e g normal vs log normal 2 methods for estimating parameters for each statistical distribution e g variance of a normal distribution and 3 the value of tag measurement uncertainty used to integrate the probability distribution we conducted preliminary analyses to narrow the number of potential treatments to those for which model performance was the most sensitive because model performance with statistical distributions other than the normal distribution did not have an appreciable effect on performance in the preliminary analysis we used the normal distribution for all treatments however preliminary analyses did suggest that the model was sensitive to the method used to determine the variance of the normal distribution and the value used for tag measurement uncertainty therefore our likelihood treatments consisted of three methods for specifying the variance of the normal distribution used to describe the statistical distribution of depths in each cell first because our bathymetry data sets had a higher resolution than the model grid sizes we employed a within cell method that consisted of the standard deviation of high resolution depth values used to form each aggregated grid cell second the roughness method consisted of calculating the standard deviation of the depths in the eight adjacent grid cells the roughness method has been utilized to specify the variance in previous hmm applications where the bathymetry resolution is the same as the model grid size le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 finally as an alternative to the roughness method we developed a slope method where variance in each cell was estimated based on relating the observed slope to observed within cell variances using a generalized additive model gam in areas where high resolution multibeam bathymetry data were available detailed descriptions of the different likelihood treatments are provided in supplementary data appendix a we compared model results using within cell roughness and slope methods for determining variance in the heterogeneous and sloping study areas in the flat study area we compared only the within cell and roughness methods as slopes were negligible in this area we also tested three values of depth uncertainty for each region each study area has a known depth uncertainty that is a combination of tag depth resolution assumed to be 1 m in simulations and the tidal range used for simulations flat 1 m sloping 2 m heterogeneous 4 m we tested a low value half the magnitude of the known uncertainty a true value known uncertainty and a high value twice the magnitude of the known uncertainty to understand the effects of grid size on model performance we ran the model with a progression of grid sizes 100 200 400 1000 and 2000 m in each study area 2 4 3 hmm estimation we ran the hmm on the extracted depths from simulated trajectories n 100 per area using different combinations of data likelihoods and bathymetry grid sizes data likelihoods were produced in r and sent to matlab to run the model forward filter backward smoothing and mpt computation with the hmm toolbox code provided by martin pedersen dtu denmark each hmm run produced a 3 d array of smoothed probability estimates e g spatial probability distribution of the simulated trajectory location at each time step a residency distribution that summarized the estimated locations over all time steps an estimate of diffusion and uncertainty in the diffusion estimate probability polygons for each time step and reconstructed movement paths from both the viterbi algorithm mpt and the weighted mean methods an example of a simulated trajectory in the heterogeneous study area processed with the same likelihood treatment at 200 m and 1000 m grid cell sizes demonstrates resulting reconstructed pathways fig 4 a and residence distributions fig 4b an upper limit of twice the value of diffusion used to simulate trajectories 0 04 km2 was imposed on the simulations to prevent unrealistic diffusion estimates 2 4 4 assessing hmm performance to assess the performance of different likelihood grid size combinations we calculated four metrics derived from hmm estimates and known parameters from the simulations performance metrics assessed accuracy of reconstructed pathways depth bias for reconstructed pathways whether or not probability polygons at each time step contained the simulated trajectory location coverage probability and the accuracy of model estimates for the diffusion coefficient d 2 4 4 1 mean absolute error of reconstructed movement paths we assessed accuracy of reconstructed movement paths using a mean absolute error mae performance metric this metric calculates the mean absolute distance between the known locations from simulated trajectories and positions estimated by the hmm at each time step n 200 per trajectory we calculated mae for both the mpt most probable track and the weighted mean methods of obtaining location estimates because mpt estimated locations are individual grid cells we used the center of each grid cell to measure the distance between simulated and estimated tracks 2 4 4 2 depth bias to determine whether different likelihood and grid size treatments resulted in a systemic bias toward deeper or shallower depths for reconstructed movement paths we compared the depth from estimated pathways to depth at simulated trajectory locations at each time step the depth at the simulated trajectory location was subtracted from the depth at the model estimated location using the 5 m resolution multibeam bathymetry and the average difference over all time steps was calculated the bias metric was calculated for both the mpt and the weighted mean methods of path reconstruction negative values correspond to bias toward shallower depths results from the bias performance metric were tested for significant difference from zero using a two tailed wilcoxon rank sums test for treatments found to be significantly different from zero the direction of the bias was recorded 2 4 4 3 coverage probability to determine whether probability quantiles at each time step were either over or underestimating actual error we assessed the coverage probability at the 80 and 99 probability quantiles we constructed polygons around the smallest number of grid cells that together encompassed 80 and 99 of the probability at each time step and determined whether or not the known location at that time step was within each polygon the proportion of locations that were inside their respective error polygons at each time step were reported as the coverage probability metric to determine whether coverage probability at large grid sizes could be improved in the heterogeneous areas we applied a range of additional likelihood treatments to the 1000 m grid size additional treatments consisted of different combinations of statistical distribution types for bathymetry normal lognormal t distribution adding extra variance to the bathymetry probability distribution switching from a uniform to a gaussian distribution for tag measurement error and using a fixed value of diffusion boxplots of additional treatment results were produced for 80 and 99 coverage probability metrics 2 4 4 4 diffusion we compared the value of diffusion estimated by the hmm for different treatments to the value used to simulate fish movement trajectories because simulating pathways in a bounded area could result in a different effective value of d than was used to generate the simulated paths we calculated an empirical value to use for comparison with values estimated by the hmm the empirical value for d was determined by calculating the mean squared displacement msd from the initial and final locations of simulated paths for all three areas combined n 300 using the formula msd 4dt börger and fryxell 2012 results from the diffusion performance metric were tested for significant difference from the empirical value of diffusion for simulated trajectories using a two tailed wilcoxon rank sums test for treatments found to be significantly different the direction e g higher or lower was recorded 2 4 4 5 summarizing performance to summarize results among treatments by grid size treatments were ranked according to their performance for each metric the best performance was defined for each metric as 1 mae lowest values 2 bias closest to zero 3 coverage probability closest to 80 or 99 and 4 treatment estimated diffusion closest to the empirical value of diffusion treatments were ranked by calculating decile values for each treatment ranking all treatments by decile then averaging rank scores from all deciles for each treatment for the bias metric only the median was used to rank treatments because the full range of bias measurements reflects the degree of depth heterogeneity in each study area all statistics and analyses were computed using the r program r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 study area characteristics study area slope distributions differed strongly among the three study areas slope values were greater in the heterogeneous area compared to the sloping area by a factor of 10 and values in the sloping area were greater than the flat area by a factor of 10 fig 5 in the heterogeneous area slopes were largest in the 100 m grid size but decreased as grid size increased in the sloping area 100 m 400 m grid sizes had similar slopes but slope decreased for 1000 m and 2000 m grid sizes in the flat area slopes were very small for all grid sizes differences in kurtosis and skewness values for depth distributions in each grid cell were also apparent among study areas in the heterogeneous area kurtosis values increased with grid cell size values for the 1000 m and 2000 m grid sizes were similar and larger than 100 m 400 m grid sizes kurtosis values in the sloping area were slightly smaller than the heterogeneous area and values for the 1000 m grid were more similar to values for the 400 m grid negative skew i e skew toward shallower depths was observed for the 1000 m and 2000 m grid sizes in the heterogeneous areas and the 2000 m grid size in the sloping area in the flat area both kurtosis and skewness values were low and similar among all grid sizes when compared with various types of distributions in the cullen frey plots small grid cell sizes in all study areas were concentrated in the vicinity characteristic of uniform to normal fig 6 as grid cell size increased distributions in the heterogeneous fig 6a and sloping fig 6b areas became more consistent with non normal and non uniform distributions however distributions in the flat area were similar across all grid cell sizes and consistent with normal or uniform distributions fig 6c 3 2 assessing hmm performance 3 2 1 mean absolute error of reconstructed movement paths in general mean absolute error mae for the weighted mean method of path reconstruction increased as grid size increased for the heterogeneous and sloping areas but was consistent across grid size for the flat area fig 7 a model performance was best smallest mae values in the heterogeneous area intermediate in the sloping area and lowest in the flat area for the 100 m 200 m grid sizes within each grid size treatment performance varied most by variance method in the heterogeneous and sloping areas where the roughness method consistently had lower performance compared to within cell and slope methods in the sloping area the within cell and slope methods had similar performance whereas the within cell method consistently performed better in the heterogeneous area in the flat area treatment performance varied most by depth uncertainty where the true value performed best the high value was intermediate and the low value performed the worst however the within cell method of variance outperformed the roughness method for the true and high values of depth uncertainty in general trends for the mpt method of reconstruction were similar to the weighted mean method fig 7b however the weighted mean performed better than the mpt method in the 100 m 200 m grid sizes in the heterogeneous and sloping areas for mpt reconstruction the roughness variance method performed better than the within cell and slope methods in the smallest grid sizes in the heterogeneous and sloping areas overall best results for both the weighted mean and mpt methods of path reconstruction were observed for the heterogeneous area at small grid sizes and the flat area at the largest grid sizes fig 8 a and b 3 2 2 depth bias in general the median values for depth bias e g the mean difference between depth at simulated locations and the depth at model estimated locations were small for both the weighted mean and mpt methods of path reconstruction table 1 a and 1b the greatest biases were observed in the heterogeneous area in the direction of deeper water for grid sizes 400 m 1000 m the roughness method of variance was not biased in the 1000 m 2000 m grid sizes for either the weighted mean or the mpt paths some bias in the direction of shallower water was observed in the smaller grid sizes in the heterogeneous area although many treatments in the sloping and flat areas were observed to have significant bias the magnitude of the difference from zero consisted of only a few cm although median bias values were similar between the weighted mean and mpt methods of path reconstruction the range in mpt bias tended to be much smaller than the range in weighted mean bias values supplementary data figure b 1 in general bias was lowest in the flat study area for both the weighted mean and mpt path reconstruction methods fig 8c and d 3 2 3 coverage probability in general coverage probability at nominal levels 80 and 99 error polygons was only achieved for the 99 error polygons at the smallest grid sizes 100 m 200 m in the heterogeneous study area fig 9 coverage probability approached nominal levels for the 99 error polygon for some treatments at the 400 m grid size in the heterogeneous area at grid sizes 100 m 400 m in the sloping area and at grid sizes 100 m 1000 m in the flat study area the true and high levels of depth uncertainty outperformed the low level of depth uncertainty for grid sizes 100 m 400 m in all areas and the 1000 m 2000 m grid size in the flat area but performance did not vary by depth uncertainty in the 1000 m 2000 m grid sizes in the heterogeneous and sloping areas in general the within cell and slope variance methods outperformed the roughness method for grid sizes 400 m 2000 m in the heterogeneous and sloping areas the slope method performed as well or better than the within cell method for the 2000 m grid size in both heterogeneous and sloping areas performance trends by treatment for 80 error polygons were the same as for the 99 error polygons but the magnitude of coverage probability was substantially lower than nominal levels compared to performance for the 99 error polygons of the additional treatments performed to achieve increased coverage probability in a large 1000 m grid cell size in the heterogeneous area the best result was achieved by introducing a gaussian tag measurement uncertainty distribution with a s d of 5 m a gaussian bathymetry grid cell distribution with an extra 5 m of variance and a fixed diffusion coefficient of 0 04 km2 table 2 supplementary data figure b 2 however the best performing treatment only increased the median 80 coverage probability from 52 to 60 fixing the value of diffusion at 0 012 km2 the empirical value of diffusion for simulated trajectories resulted in substantial improvements in mae but not coverage probability in general treatments that increased mae resulted in decreased performance for coverage probability adding extra variance to the grid cell variance had little effect on performance by itself but when combined with use of the gaussian tag measurement error performance was increased specifying other types of distributions lognormal t distribution with 1 and 2 df for the grid cell probability density function resulted in reduced coverage probability compared to gaussian distribution overall performance was highest in the heterogeneous area for the smallest grid sizes 100 m and 200 m the sloping area for the 400 m grid size and the flat study area for the largest grid sizes 1000 m and 2000 m fig 8e and f 3 2 4 diffusion in general diffusion was overestimated for all grid sizes in the heterogeneous area and larger grid cells 400 2000 m of the sloping area table 1c fig 10 performance was best for the 100 m 200 m grid sizes in the sloping area where the high level of uncertainty performed better than the true and the low in the flat area performance differed strongly by level of depth uncertainty diffusion estimates for the low treatment consistently approached the diffusion threshold value of 0 04 km2 while estimates were closest to actual values for the true and high treatments in contrast differences in performance in the heterogeneous area were mostly due to variance method where the roughness method consistently provided estimates that were closer to the actual value of diffusion compared to the within cell or slope methods overall optimal performance was observed in the heterogeneous and sloping areas at small grid sizes and in the flat area at larger grid sizes fig 8g 4 discussion the hmm geolocation model developed by pedersen et al 2008 has provided a robust framework that can be adapted for different geolocation applications e g study areas or fish species when adapting the hmm for specific applications it is necessary to 1 choose an appropriate data likelihood model 2 select a grid size and 3 decide whether to estimate diffusion with the model or to use prior knowledge to designate the size of the diffusion kernel the results of our simulation exercises suggest that the degree of bathymetric heterogeneity in the study area can impact the model results and should be considered when making these decisions in addition our work provides several implications for interpretation of results given grid size likelihood specification methods and degree of habitat heterogeneity 4 1 data likelihood model parameterization 4 1 1 variance specification the choice of method used to specify grid cell variance affected model performance for large grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas where grid cell depth distributions departed from normal this is an important finding because the roughness method which performed worse than the other two methods has frequently been employed in other hmm geolocation studies braun et al 2017 le bris et al 2013 liu et al 2017 our research suggests that in areas with heterogeneous topography different methods for obtaining variance should be explored and the method that provides the most realistic values should be chosen in the current study the method of obtaining grid cell variance by linking known grid cell variance to grid cell bathymetric slope in areas with high resolution multibeam data provided better results than the roughness approach for larger grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas performance with the slope method was sometimes equivalent and sometimes better than the within cell method therefore this study has provided a potential alternative method for specifying variance based on auxiliary data however additional verification is required to ensure the validity of applying the method outside of areas with high resolution depth data the multibeam areas that were used to determine the relationship between s d and grid cell slope for example the relationship between cell variance and slope could be determined by one multibeam area and tested in another multibeam area within the same larger geographic region the approach of using auxiliary data to define variance may be helpful for other gridded geolocation variables aside from depth for example some sst data sets such as multi scale ultra high resolution mur sst are accompanied by estimates of error in each grid cell these should be investigated for use in specifying cell variance rather than or perhaps in addition to utilizing the roughness method in heterogeneous areas using an expectation maximization framework to fit the model woillez et al 2016 where variance parameters are estimated rather than specified a priori may also be an option for using the hmm in heterogeneous areas although the roughness method of determining variance decreased performance at larger grid sizes for the mae metric it did have advantages in other situations because it performed best in the smallest grid sizes where variance values tended to be larger than the other two methods supplementary data figure a 2 adding extra variance to the within cell variance may increase performance at smaller grid sizes the roughness method also performed better in the diffusion coefficient estimation and bias performance metrics which suggests that increasing the grid cell variance may also improve performance in these areas improved performance of the coverage probability metric for treatments with extra added variance table 2 supports this observation 4 1 2 depth measurement uncertainty determining the likelihood value by integrating between the limits of tag measurement resolution le bris et al 2013 has been featured in several recent applications of the hmm braun et al 2017 2018 liu et al 2017 this approach is valuable in that it allows explicit incorporation of tag measurement uncertainty into the calculation of the likelihood however our research demonstrates that the performance of the model can be sensitive to the magnitude of the value chosen in general all around performance was best when the chosen value reflected the true level of uncertainty associated with tag measurement although the low value resulted in slight increases in performance for the mae metric in the 100 m 400 m grid sizes of the heterogeneous and sloping areas performance for the coverage probability and diffusion metrics was worse for the low value compared to the true and high values for larger grid cells our results indicate that it is better to overestimate than underestimate the depth measurement uncertainty this may be more important for flat areas where differences in performance by depth uncertainty level were more pronounced than the heterogeneous and sloping areas the use of a gaussian distribution to represent tag measurement uncertainty may represent an improvement in the model for our application tag measurement resolution may be uniform for some types of tag sensors but with added tidal data the depth measurement uncertainty becomes gaussian demersal fish data likelihood models that include tidal geolocation pedersen et al 2008 explicitly account for change in depth due to tides in contrast our data likelihood model does not include tidal data and therefore we must account for uncertainty in tag measurement due to tidal fluctuations in another way in areas of the north pacific ocean the tidal amplitude can exceed 3 m depending on geographic location danielson et al 2011 for large scale demersal fish applications in this region it may be desirable to use a gaussian depth uncertainty distribution that is wide enough to incorporate potential movement of the fish to areas with a greater range of tides than are found at the starting location 4 2 grid size selection selection of grid size is a key consideration for implementation of the hmm the resolution of available maps the size of the study area in which the animal moves the strength of geolocation gradients in the study area the movement speed of the fish and spatial resolution required by research goals e g residence time in marine protected areas should all be considered when selecting a grid size in addition when the data likelihood model combines multiple environmental variables e g both depth and bottom temperature the choice of grid size is constrained to the lowest grid resolution available for each variable increases in time and computer power needed for processing are also a consideration for grid size selection but with modern computing power this is becoming less of a concern our research suggests that in addition to these other considerations the statistical distribution of depths for each cell size plays a role in grid size selection grid cells with an approximately normal distribution provided a range of cell sizes where model performance was similar within each area optimal statistical distribution grid sizes were 100 m 200 m in the heterogeneous area 100 m 400 m in the sloping area and all grid sizes in the flat area reduced performance of the 2000 m grid in the flat area despite an approximately normal depth distribution within grid cells indicates that other factors such as movement rate relative to grid size in low gradient areas may play a role in performance our range of grid sizes tested did not include grid sizes substantially smaller than the movement rate used to simulate the trajectories so insights into whether this could adversely affect performance were not provided by this simulation exercise 4 3 diffusion the decision to estimate the diffusion coefficient d in the model or to use a pre determined value is influenced by study area gradients grid size and likelihood specification methods as well as whether prior information on fish movement rates is available some hmm applications estimate d in the model le bris et al 2013 woillez et al 2016 while others pick a value based on known animal movement speeds braun et al 2017 liu et al 2017 the model is known to be sensitive to the value of the diffusion coefficient woillez et al 2016 so making this decision is a critical aspect of adapting the model for different applications the results of our simulations suggest that estimating diffusion in large grid cells in heterogeneous and sloping areas is associated with decreased model performance that may be compounded by the method used to specify likelihood the model overestimated diffusion in these situations frequently approaching its fixed upper threshold but optimal performance for other metrics e g mae and coverage probability was associated with estimated values of diffusion that were closer to the value used to create the trajectories therefore if accurate information on the movement of fish is available using a known value of d might result in better model performance in these situations however for small grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas where gradients are strong and grid depth distributions are approximately normal estimating diffusion is likely to provide reasonable results for other performance metrics as well in this case estimating d makes sense and estimated values of d can then be used in areas where gradients are less strong or in heterogeneous areas where larger grid cell sizes are necessary if estimated in the model the diffusion coefficient should not be taken as reflecting actual animal movement speed but rather viewed as the engine that drives the movement model in contrast to heterogeneous and sloping areas estimated diffusion values in the flat area tended to be underestimated as much as overestimated in the absence of strong environmental gradients the model will tend to favor more direct movement pathways connecting the release and recovery locations so the size of the diffusion coefficient will be strongly related to net displacement the exception to this occurred for the low value of depth measurement uncertainty which frequently approached the threshold value set for diffusion this may have been caused by high ratio of added noise to study area depth gradients e g added noise was 1 m for tag resolution and 0 2 m for tide and the median slope for the 100 m grid was 0 1 m per 100 m and reduced intersection of depth measurements with bathymetry grid cell probability density functions therefore in low gradient areas it might be worthwhile to specify a reasonable diffusion size from prior data sources rather than risk under or over estimating it with the model 4 4 implications for interpreting model output 4 4 1 movement path reconstruction our comparison of two different methods for reconstructing movement paths suggests that at small spatial scales with complete data sets the weighted mean method performs either better or equivalently to the mpt method although few advantages for mpt over the weighted mean method were observed in this small scale simulation study the mpt may have advantages in larger scale applications or situations with missing data or low spatial gradients the two types of paths are calculated using fundamentally different approaches where the mpt is the most likely sequence of states e g grid cells and the weighted mean is derived from the 3d array of smoothed probability estimates the mpt may diverge from the smoothed estimates in areas where gradients are weak pedersen et al 2011 locations estimated with the weighted mean method may have low probability if they happen to fall between two areas of high probability thygesen et al 2009 in our study this phenomenon was demonstrated by the much reduced range in depth differences between the simulated and estimated locations for the mpt compared to the weighted mean method therefore it may be beneficial to reconstruct movement paths with both methods in situations where geolocation data are sparse or in areas of low gradients 4 4 2 coverage probability understanding error associated with location estimates is an important aspect of geolocation and a primary benefit of using complicated state space models with the hmm estimated locations of the tagged fish can be represented by probability quantiles e g 95 and 50 at each time step pedersen et al 2008 in addition some researchers prefer to use the daily probability estimates or summarized residence distributions as indications of fish locations rather than reconstructing movement pathways le bris et al 2013 therefore understanding the ways in which the probability surface actually corresponds to the area that is likely to contain the true location of the fish at a specific time is crucial for interpreting hmm results we found that the probability quantiles derived from the probability surface at each time step did not include the true location as often as expected from the nominal coverage probability this suggests that the model tends to underestimate the true uncertainty in location at a given time step this was noticeable particularly for the larger grid sizes in the heterogeneous and sloping areas it is possible that these results are due to some aspect of the model such as backward smoothing from the recovery location that tends to result in a direct path between release and recovery locations when geolocation gradients are not informative it is also possible that these results are due to some artifact of the simulations or the small and confined nature of that study area in this study however we believe this should be an area for future investigation because probability contours are a common way to interpret probability surfaces one option for increasing coverage probability is to make changes to the data likelihood model our results suggest that coverage probability may be improved by using a gaussian distribution for tag measurement uncertainty instead of a uniform distribution adding extra variance to the bathymetry probability or increasing the depth measurement uncertainty however these changes to the likelihood resulted in only marginal improvement in coverage probability and came at a cost of decreased accuracy of the reconstructed pathways for the 1000 m grid size in the heterogeneous area this indicates that a trade off between coverage probability and model accuracy may exist simulations conducted over larger scales in space and time may be needed to more fully understand potential trade offs for coverage probability and accuracy at scales relevant to fish migration coverage probability may also be increased by increasing the diffusion coefficient d a previous study that examined aspects of model sensitivity found that increasing values of d led to greater spread of probability values across the probability surface and resulted in local but not global changes to the probability surface woillez et al 2016 one potential caution about increasing d is the poor performance for both mae and coverage probability that were observed with high values of d for large grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas however our simulations do indicate that for small grid sizes in areas with high gradients an increase in d should increase coverage probability with only small reduction in mae performance another option for addressing the discrepancy between probability quantiles and coverage probability is to determine which probability quantile actually corresponds to the coverage probability desired for example a 99 probability polygon would provide a 95 coverage probability for some treatments in the 100 m and 200 m grid sizes in the heterogeneous area probability values are typically so small that increasing the quantile from 99 to 99 99 would add many more grid cells to probability polygons this option would preserve the accuracy of the reconstructed pathways however additional work would be needed to verify this approach preferably in a larger study area without potentially confounding boundary issues in addition this result should be confirmed for recently developed hmm geolocation software packages such as hmmoce braun et al 2017 that utilize a slightly different method for constructing the movement kernel compared to the matlab version provided by pedersen et al 2008 4 5 caveats the simulation exercises reported here are primarily aimed at providing insight into the mechanisms and relative performance of different likelihood and grid size treatments and should not be taken as indications of specific values for precision or accuracy expected in each area there are a number of caveats that should be kept in mind when considering this work first edge effects from conducting simulations in relatively small study areas may be present however all areas should be equally affected by edge effects as study areas were all the same shape and size second multibeam bathymetry was assumed to be known without error for simulations but error could be present in multibeam data sets in particular the multibeam area in the flat area of norton sound has such little variation in depth that artifacts from the multibeam mapping may influence study area attributes such as slope and skewness finally this work is a small subset of questions about model sensitivity other issues that should be tested include the effect of map error different movement patterns of fish e g non dispersive or directed or the effects of gaps in data 4 6 implications for other hmm applications the hmm originally developed for geolocation of atlantic cod in the north sea pedersen et al 2008 thygesen et al 2009 is a powerful flexible method for characterizing fish movement at multiple spatial and temporal scales and is ideal for the use of gridded geolocation data sources it has been adapted to study the movement of demersal fish species such as atlantic cod gadus morhua in the gulf of maine groger et al 2007 liu et al 2017 zemeckis et al 2017 the british isles neat et al 2014 the north sea hobson et al 2009 wright et al 2018 the gulf of st lawrence le bris et al 2013 and the faroe plateau ottosen et al 2017 it has provided insights into seasonal movement of atlantic halibut hippoglossus hippoglossus in the gulf of st lawrence le bris et al 2018 and relationships with sea floor structure for atlantic cod plaice pleuronectes platessa and thornback ray raja clavata in the north sea wright et al 2018 the hmm has also been employed to study the movement of pelagic fish such as european sea bass dicentrarchus labrax off the coast of france de pontual et al 2018 woillez et al 2016 atlantic salmon salmo salar in iceland guðjónsson et al 2015 canada strøm et al 2017 and norway strøm et al 2018 the porbeagle shark lamna nasus in northeast atlantic biais et al 2017 saunders et al 2011 and blue prionace glauca mako isurus oxyrinchus and basking cetorhinus maximus sharks in the western atlantic braun et al 2017 2018 in addition to studies in temperate and sub arctic latitudes hmm has been used to study a multitude of tropical and sub tropical fishes arostegui et al 2018 eveson et al 2018 patterson et al 2018a b the broad range of species and geographic regions over which the hmm has been applied in recent years indicates that it is becoming a major tool in the study of fish movement and behavior however adapting the hmm for different applications is not always a straightforward process it involves obtaining an understanding of study area attributes fish movement rates precision and accuracy of bathymetric maps and an accurate estimate of uncertainty in tag measurement grid size data likelihood model and diffusion coefficients are usually reported in manuscripts that utilize the hmm but little guidance is available for choosing them to suit specific applications although our work focuses on one type of application depth based geolocation of demersal fishes our findings on model sensitivity to these parameterization choices suggest that the degree of study area heterogeneity should be considered when using other gridded geolocation variables such as sst ocean heat content temperature depth profiles braun et al 2017 or geomagnetic data nielsen 2019 this study also points to the value of customizing data likelihood model parameters grid size and diffusion for each species and or study area for achieving maximum performance and interpretation of model results the original code provided by m w pedersen in the matlab programming language has been modified to suit specific demersal fish applications liu et al 2017 the matlab code has also been translated into r code r package hmmoce and expanded to include multiple geolocation variables available for pelagic species braun et al 2017 this r code implementation readily allows customization of hmm parameters such as grid size and diffusion coefficients and r scripts may be altered if additional changes to the data likelihood model are needed however this package generally specifies grid cell variance as the standard deviation of adjacent grid cells i e roughness method in our study which performed worse than the other methods we tested in heterogeneous and sloping study areas our findings on model sensitivity to study area attributes and the need to customize model parameters are relevant for other researchers because several black box geolocation services have recently become available to researchers that may not allow adequate customization for specific applications for example wildlife computers redmond wa usa includes an hmm as part of its analysis package for psat data the model has a fixed grid size 0 25 and minimum speed of movement 1 m s that may be faster than the fish is likely to move the track loc data processing service provided by argos cls toulouse france can estimate locations from multiple types of archival tags but few details about data likelihood models or other model parameters are publicly available neither company has provided a peer reviewed description of the models they employ for the geolocation services although the use of these services is a convenience for researchers without a full understanding of the parameterization of those models it is difficult to interpret their results with respect to how accurately they might characterize true movement pathways and habitat use and the relative trade offs that they incorporate it is unlikely that any single parameterization will perform equivalently across species and among diverse habitats 5 conclusions we adapted a hmm for geolocation of demersal fishes in the north pacific ocean using a maximum depth likelihood our simulation study indicates that the model is sensitive to the degree of bathymetry heterogeneity in the study area and performance tends to decrease in heterogeneous areas when depth distributions within model grid cells depart from a normal distribution we found that a new way of specifying grid cell variance based on study area slope improved performance in larger grid cells over standard variance specification methods our work demonstrates the importance of understanding model assumptions and the ability to customize model grid size data likelihood model specification and diffusion for specific applications although our simulations were focused on geolocation of demersal fishes based on bathymetry our insights into model sensitivity and parameterization are applicable to other gridded geolocation variables such as sst ocean heat content temperature depth profiles and geomagnetic geolocation that have wider application for pelagic fishes acknowledgments we thank martin pedersen for his work developing the

25062,various studies have proven that the flow rising processes play a significant role in the fish spawning stimulus instead of seizing the flow rise as an integrated process consisting of a flow rising edge and falling edge the current publication focus on the daily flow it is necessary to identify the effective flow rising process to learn the flow feature and guide the water resources management in this study a fluctuation identification algorithm fia is proposed based on the identification of flow rising and falling edges with only three parameters in total on the strength of those identified flow rising processes a group of fish oriented indicators are defined to describe the features of the rising including the number of the rising processes in the whole spawning season the average duration of each rising process the daily average flow in the flow rising processes the average flow rising ratio the average flow increment and the average growth rate of the flow rising processes in the spawning season the application on the upper reaches of the yellow river over recent 10 years verifies the validity of the proposed fluctuation identification algorithm the statistics of those indicators indicates the regularities of the flow rising processes in the fish spawning seasons in different hydrological years which helps the ecological protection in the water resources development keywords fish spawning stimulus flow rising process fluctuation identification algorithm fia fish oriented indicators upper reaches of the yellow river 1 introduction stream flows that are sufficient for fisheries are usually adequate for macro invertebrate and other aquatic life liu et al 2011 as in the top position of the food chain fish can be appropriate ecosystem indicators providing an integrative view of the environment wu et al 2014 zhao et al 2015a existing studies have demonstrated that over the whole life span of fish some specific seasons are crucial for fish reproduction such as spawning season when fish community are sensitive to flow velocity and water level to spawn and for the successful survival of their eggs larvae liu et al 2011 chen et al 2015 reported that the spawning activity of indigenous fish schizothorax chongi in the yalong river in china is sensitive to the flow variations during the spawning period koster et al 2018 examined the influence of hydrological variables such as flow magnitude temporal variables and spatial variables on migration and spawn using data collected from 2008 to 2015 in the bunyip tarago river system in victoria and found that rising discharge act as a cue to downstream migration and spawn leira and cantonati 2008 concluded that water level fluctuations wlf in lakes and rivers especially their extent frequency and duration are dominant forces controlling the functioning of these ecosystems by reviewing the relevant literatures from 1991 to 2008 ondrej and ludek 2004 found that slow and steady flow helps the migration without spawn while the great change of flow provokes spawning for brown trout in china along with the developing construction of water conservancy facilities various evidence have also been reported that the change of hydrological conditions greatly impact the spawning of fishes tao et al 2017 reported that fish aggregated into the spawning grounds for spawning during the flood and departed after the flood in the yangtze river in china du et al 2011 stated that the sites where the embryo of the chinese sturgeon occur can be predicted with the three physical variables embeddedness of the sediment water velocity and river bottom elevation xu et al 2015 investigated the fish spawning activities of the four major chinese carps in the middle mainstream of the yangtze river from may to july and concluded that the flood amplitude and river transparency were significantly positive correlated with egg abundance and the flooding occasions was significantly and negatively correlated with the time of spawning according to the book freshwater pisciculture in china mainly edited by academician liu jiakang there is a certain velocity required to enable fish to spawn liu and he 1992 the calculations based on the observed data as well as the result of the research on fish ecology the appropriate velocity for most fish to spawn is about 0 3 0 4 m s liu 1999 there are two perspectives to understand the flow ecology relationships one is to estimate the timing and magnitude of fish movements relative to environmental factors which is from the perspective of the fish such as adapted ecological hydraulic radius approach aehra habitat suitability index hsi and index of biological integrity ibi aehra selects key fish species subjectively thus uncertainties will be unavoidably be introduces in e flows assessment zhao et al 2017 although zhao et al 2015b developed a multi species based hsi mhsi model to estimate responses of multi species to a habitat environmental factor the omission of the relative frequency of available habitat in mhsi brought uncertainties to findings although ibi has been widely applied across the world wu et al 2014 its direct application is problematic in regions having a rich and diverse ichthyofauna and where the knowledge of fish species ecology is incomplete tejerina garro et al 2006 these studies based on fish either used fish captures at dams ladders weirs and traps to quantify migration timing or make and recapture techniques vehanen et al 2000 heggenes and traaen 1988 the difficulty lies in 1 to capture free range fish 2 to quantify the movement of the fishes 3 to collect adequate data over long term monitoring besides such studies introduced uncertainties derived from the selection of the representative fish species and the studies often focused on single events with few examples which limits the temporal applicability and robustness of findings koster et al 2018 growns and james 2005 the other way is from the perspective of flow the oldest and the most studied element of the flows is biological minimum taking the minimum discharge for maintaining river scale as large as possible chen et al 2012 while it was realized that ecological status is influenced by a set of other hydrological features corresponding to appropriate ecological flow barbalic and kuspilic 2015 more than 200 methods for assessing ecological flow were reported liu et al 2011 such as methodologies of tennant river 2d and indicators of hydrological alterations iha although a steady state solution can be derived from river 2d the unattainable discrepancy of velocities and depth between the measured value and the river 2d yielded values occurs markgard 2009 boavida et al 2013 iha richter et al 1997 consisting of 33 parameters is considered to be good descriptors of hydrological regime characteristics which influence ecological status of rivers as in iha some studies use high low pulse of flow to describe the characteristics of flow alteration i e finding peaks before a global rise and after a global decrease such statistics regard the flow pulses as independent occurrence and every flow pulse is counted the significant merit of iha lies in its independency of a variety of other data except for daily streamflow nevertheless these studies are not fish oriented without specific identification of the key factors influencing the spawning or migrating in this study the flow process in fish spawning season is studied as a continuous and complete flow regime with some white noises several criteria are proposed to distinguish the noise and the fluctuation effective for fish spawning stimulus based on the proposed fluctuation identification algorithm fia a group of fish oriented indicators is presented to describe the characteristics of flows in the specific crucial seasons for fish reproduction the natural flow process in the spawning season is firstly analyzed by fia and the significant flow increasing process is identified which has been proven to be a crucial stimulus signal for fish to spawn the feature of the flow increasing process is then extracted by a group of indicators proposed in this study the upper stream of the yellow river in china where almost no disturb of human activities occurs is selected to verify the proposed method the selected years are classified into dry normal and wet years and the indicators for each kind of years are presented and analyzed 2 methodology 2 1 fluctuation identification algorithm fia 2 1 1 identification of flow rising edge the rising edge and the falling edge of natural flow increasing process are identified and extracted respectively the flow rising edge is classified into three modes including single sharp rising continuous rising and follow up rising the single sharp rising refers to a flow rising with an amplitude larger than a certain threshold as defined below and there is no following flow rising subsequently the continuous rising is composed of multiple single sharp risings with small drops in between and the amplitude of these drops needs to be smaller than a certain threshold as defined below the follow up rising refers to the situation that a sharp rising is followed by multiple small and successive risings the original flow sequence is firstly preprocessed by the findpeaks function in software matlab to find all the local valleys q v i and local peaks q p i then the three modes illustrated above are identified successively and the details are illustrated as follows 1 step 1 identification of single sharp flow rising process the natural flow process is a non stationary time series and the fluctuation range is quite different small fluctuations do not produce reproductive stimuli to fish and thus are not taken into account in the identification of rising flow only those rising process with a certain degree of fluctuation is considered the flow increment δ q r i described in fig 1 and eq 1 is used as an indicator to identify the rising edge of the flow as shown in eq 2 1 δ q r i q p i q v i 2 δ q r i q r c r i where q is the streamflow the index r refers to the variables related to the flow rising edge i is the index of the number of the flow rising processes in a certain year the subscript p and v refer to peak and valley values in the flow process respectively q r c r i is the increment threshold and if the increment δ q r i is larger than q r c r i the corresponding rising process is recognized as an effective stimulus for fish spawning increment threshold q r c r i relates to the maximum value of the flow process and is also relevant to the hydrological characteristics of the year thus q r c r i should be noted q r c r i h but for the sake of simplicity the dependency to h is implicit and q r c r i is defined as the mean of the maximum flow of the similar hydrological years i e wet years normal years or dry years as shown in eq 3 3 q r c r i α 1 m e a n max m q h m where α 1 is the sensitive factor of the identification of flow rising process h is the index of different hydrological years and h 1 2 3 indicate wet years normal years and dry years respectively m is the index of the year the smaller α 1 is the more likely the flow increment is identified as a single sharp flow rising process by our tests the recommended value of α 1 is between 0 15 to 0 35 and in this study α 1 0 20 fig 2 is the daily flow sequence of a certain hydrometric station during the fish spawning season where the red circle indicates the flow incremental process identified by single sharp rising identification 2 step 2 identification of continuous flow rising process the natural streamflow accomplishes the rising process on the basis of fluctuations the same rising process may consist of multiple continuous fluctuations that are connected end to end only using fluctuation amplitude q r c r i as the criterion may lead to misjudgment which recognizes the same continuous rising process as multiple independent rising processes as shown in fig 2 therefore if the rising edge of the adjacent flow rising process identified in the previous step is continuous it is necessary to determine whether the two rising edges are independent another sensitive factor of the identification of continuous flow rising process α 2 0 α 2 1 is set in this study to recognize continuous rising process with the help of the flow increment δ q r i defined in the previous step as shown in fig 3 a and eq 4 4 δ q f i α 2 q r c r i where δ q f i q f i j q f i j 1 is the flow decrement α 2 is the sensitive factor of the identification of continuous rising process the larger α 2 is the more likely the flow is identified as a continuous flow rising process by our tests the recommended value of α 2 is between 0 1 to 0 15 and in this study α 2 0 10 if the change of flow in the adjacent rising processes determined in the first step is relatively gentle the condition in eq 4 is satisfied and it is recognized as the same continuous flow rising process as shown in fig 3 b while if the flow fluctuation in the adjacent flow rising processes is drastic eq 4 cannot be satisfied and it is identified as two independent rising processes as illustrated in fig 3 c fig 4 shows the natural daily flow series during april to june at a certain hydrologic station where there exists a natural spawning ground downstream and the laying season lasts from april to june if only step 1 is carried out to identify rising flow process without recognition of continuous rising flow process in step 2 the increasing process indicated in the red circle will be judged as two independent rising processes as shown in fig 4 a however such result is obviously inconsistent with empirical understanding of the flow incremental stimulus for fish spawning adding the recognition of step 2 the two adjacent processes in red circles in fig 4 a is considered to be the same continuous rising process as shown in fig 4 b 3 step 3 identification of follow up flow rising process after the foregoing two steps the derived flow rising edge might link to small fluctuations and in such case the rising process is considered to end only when the subsequent increase rate becomes more and more severe the rising process is deemed to continue eqs 5 and 6 describe the criteria above for judging the end position of the rising edge by the characteristics of subsequent rising process 5 q p i j q p i j 1 2 n where q p i j indicates the j th follow up peaks in the i th flow rising process as illustrated in fig 5 when the fluctuation begin to decline the flow rising process can be judged to end as eq 5 cannot be satisfied however the case that a local peak links to a steady fluctuation instead of a sudden decline is not excluded by eq 5 which should also be the end of a rising process in case the follow up rising process is too gentle to be included in a rising process for spawning stimulus the criteria of classifying the follow up peaks into the rising process needs to be enhanced as shown in eq 6 6 q p i j q p i j 1 α 3 j 1 e j 1 j q r c r i j 1 2 n by convention q p i 0 q p i in eq 6 j 1 e j 1 j is a criterion enhancement factor whose value increases exponentially with the progressive increase of j this factor is used to ensure that the flow rising edge derived from step 1 and step 2 links to a follow up rising process whose increment becomes more and more severe when the same rising process is judged to continue the parameter α 3 is the sensitive factor of the identification of follow up flow rising process which is set to be 0 1 in this study by our tests the smaller α 3 is the more likely a steady follow up process is included in the rising process in addition there should not be any superposition of the rising edges to avoid repeated statistics of the flow rising processes that is the subsequent peak is always before the following rising process as indicated in eq 7 7 d a y q p i j d a y q p i 1 where d a y indicates the julian date when occurs fig 6 compares the identification results of the flow rising process with and without step 3 fig 6 a shows the flow rising process identified by step 1 and step 2 without the follow up rising process recognition where the first decline is considered to be the end of the rising process in the red circle such result is clearly inconsistent with empirical judgments fig 6 b takes the subsequent flooding process into account and assumes that a large flow peak following a small flow fluctuation is the end of the rising edge of this rising process as indicated in the red circle the rising process identified in fig 6 b is more reasonable going with our subjective judgment to be a spawning stimulus for fish 2 1 2 identification of flow falling edge 1 step 4 identification of the first flow falling edge due to the continuity of the rising and falling process of the streamflow each identified rising edge is followed by a falling edge which is extracted directly and named the first falling edge as shown in fig 7 and the red circle in fig 8 2 step 5 identification of the follow up flow falling edge there may exists subsequent falling process following the first flow falling edge as shown in fig 9 if the follow up falling process is connected to a smooth flow process with small fluctuation the process is considered to end after the first falling edge while if continuous falling occurs and the falling the process is considered to continue eq 8 and 9 describe the criteria above for judging the end position of the falling edge based on the characteristics of the subsequent falling process which are 1 the peak value of the local fluctuations in the subsequent falling process cannot exceed the peak of the rising edge as in eqs 8 and 2 the follow up falling process should not be too steady otherwise the whole rising process is considered to end to enhance the requirement of identifying the follow up falling process as a part of the rising process e j 1 j is taken as the amplification factor as shown in eq 9 if j 1 eq 9 is used to describe the first follow up peak which is the same as eq 8 while if j 1 eq 9 is stricter than eq 8 to determine whether the follow up peaks can be identified as the falling edge of the flow rising process 8 q p i j q p i j 1 2 n 9 e j 1 j q p i j q p i j 1 2 n fig 10 compares the recognition results with and without considerations of the subsequent falling process the falling process in fig 10 a satisfies the conditions defined in eq 8 which is that the peak in falling process is smaller than that in the rising edge and the subsequent valley is smaller than the first flow falling edge hence it is identified as the same flow falling process however the rising process is clearly not ended since the falling process continues with ever increasing amplitude the flow rising process effective for fish spawning stimulus is recognized to continue by eq 9 as shown in fig 10 b which is apparently more reasonable 2 2 characteristic indicators of the flow rising process for the identified natural flow rising process characteristic indicators need to be defined to describe the features of the rising process the physical characteristics represented by those indicators in common in different hydrological years can be regarded as the key factors for fish spawning stimulus if there is l flow rising processes in a spawning season in total in which the j th rising process covers nj daily flow data and the whole spawning season lasts for s days the parameter set in this study to characterize the flow rising process includes 1 n the total number of rising processes in the spawning season 2 t the average duration in days of each flow rising process in the spawning season 3 q daily average flow in the flow rising processes in the spawning season as defined below 11 q j 1 l i 1 n j q i j j 1 l n j where q i j is the flow of the i th day in the j th rising process 4 η average flow rising ratio in a spawning season it is defined as the ratio between the average flow in the flow rising processes and the average flow in the whole spawning season describing the relative intensity of the flow rising as in eq 12 12 η q i 1 s q i s 5 δ q r average flow increment in a spawning season which reflects the absolute intensity of the flow increment as shown in eq 13 13 δ q r j 1 l max q i j min q i j l i 1 2 n 6 v average growth rate which reflects both the increment and the temporal effect as in eq 14 14 v j 1 l max q i j min q i j d a y max q i j d a y min q i j 1 l i 1 2 n the larger the v is the more severe the fish perceives the flow rising thus v is deemed to be an important parameter for fish spawning 3 study case china renewable energy engineering institute 2017 the yellow river ranks as the sixth largest river in the world with a total length of 5464 km the source area of the yellow river is located at the eastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau and is bordered by the cross section of the tangnaihai hydrological station the drainage area of the source area is 121 972 km2 accounting for 16 2 of the area of the yellow river basin the average annual runoff of the source area is 2 1010 m3 accounting for 34 5 of the total runoff in the yellow river basin the upper reaches of the yellow river provide abundant water resources in recent years with the rapid development of the yellow river basin several large scale hydropower stations have been planned in the upper reaches of the yellow river the development and construction of these hydropower stations will affect the fishes in the corresponding river reaches greatly it is necessary to analyze the natural flow processes which are suitable for fish survival and reproduction to guide the operation of those projects the tangnaihe hydrological station is an important control station in the upper reaches of the yellow river the river length above the control section is 1553 km accounting for 28 4 of the whole river there is no national protected fish around the tangnaihe station other endangered and local protected fish mainly include chuanchia labiosa platypharodon extremus gymnocypris eckloni schizopygopsis pylzovi triplophysa siluroides gymnodiptychus pvery singleycheilus acanthogobio guentheri etc the gymnodiptychus pvery singleycheilus migrate against the stream and spawn after the ice melt in april while all the other kinds of fish spawn from may to june most of the protected fish above are cold water fish spawning adhesive and demersal eggs the flowing environment of the river is an important factor for the existence of the spawning ground for these fish long term observations indicate that the fish spawning requires not only flow pulses but also a continuous rising process during the pulse and there also have to be enough flood peaks in addition the spawning grounds of the above fish are mostly slow flow water area with pebbles and gravel sediments i e spawning grounds also have certain requirements on flow velocity and water depth which can be reflected through the flow besides the dynamic characteristics of the flow above appropriate water temperature is also an essential condition for the survival and hatching of the fish eggs taking the yehuxia spawning grounds around the tangaihai station as the study subject as shown in fig 11 the fish spawning season lasts from april to june the key ecological requirements for the water environment mainly include 1 flow requirement the sexual maturation of the fish requires stimulation of flow rising process with daily duration 2 water depth requirements the hatching of the adhesive and demersal eggs requires a gentle shallow water with hourly duration and thus the flow fluctuation within one day should not be too large 3 water temperature requirement the spawning as well as the survival and hatching of the eggs needs appropriate temperature and the suitable temperature for the protected fish spawning ground is about 14 15 c under the gentle and shallow water condition the river reach can receive sufficient sunniness during the spawning season and its water temperature can satisfy the demand therefore we focus on analyzing the characteristics of the flow process 4 results and discussion 4 1 classification of different hydrological years the streamflow generally complies with the pearson iii probability distribution and the statistical parameters and the design values of each frequency determined by frequency analysis are taken as the criteria for the classification of hydrological years cohen 1979 the flow sequence are classified into wet years normal years and dry years based on the historical flow from 2006 to 2016 at the tangnaihai station the frequency curve is plotted and the corresponding parameters are shown in table 1 according to the frequency parameters the ten years between the year of 2007 to 2016 are classified into wet years normal years and dry years half time of the recent 10 years lasting from 2007 to 2016 the normal years are normal years and wet years and dry years account for 30 and 20 respectively 4 2 identification results of the flow rising processes based on the natural daily flow of the yehuxia fish spawning ground during the spawning season from april to june in the past 10 years 2007 2016 the flow rising processes are identified for each year the results are shown in fig 12 where identified flow rising processes are labeled by pentagrams the three pentagrams in the same color represent the same rising process indicating the start point the peak point and the end point respectively these three important points in a rising process are linked by dash lines in the same flow sequence different rising processes are indicated by different colors taking the year of 2007 as the representative of the normal years it can be seen in fig 12 a that from the 1st to the 50th day the flow process kept steady around 300 400 m3 s without obvious rising process on the 51st day there began a small flow rising process followed by a moderate rise and then a strong rising process occurred these three flow rising processes are precisely identified by the proposed algorithm taking the year of 2009 as the representative of the wet years fig 12 c shows that there are four flow rising processes identified by the proposed algorithm resulting the flow rise from 350 m3 s at the beginning of the spawning season to 1400 m3 s at the end taking the year of 2015 as the representative of the dry years fig 12 i indicates that the obvious flow rise began on the 52nd day followed by three identified rising processes it should be illustrated that the starting point of a slow and steady rising process still needs to be clarified with the ecological knowledge for instance for the year of 2008 and 2013 in fig 12 the starting points of the first flow rising processes are not exclusive besides the situation that the last flow rising process does not end with a falling edge should be dealt with current ecological knowledge as shown in fig 12 b d f and i 4 3 characteristics of the identified flow rising process according to the classification results of different hydrological years the flow rising characteristic indicators of the identified rising processes in different years are extracted as shown in tables 2 3 and 4 the annual average of each indicators in different hydrological years are compared in fig 13 it can be seen in tables 2 4 and fig 13 a that more rising processes occur in wet years than normal years and dry years basically there are 4 6 times of rising processes in the fish spawning season however even for different hydrological years each flow rising process lasts for about 11 days as indicated in fig 13 b in the wet years the flow in the whole spawning season is generally high and thus the daily average flow in the rising processes are higher than normal years in fig 13 c compared to the flow in the whole spawning season the flow increment in the rising processes are not as high as those in the normal years and dry years thus the average flow rising ratio η 1 08 is relatively small in wet years under the assumption that the flow condition in the normal years are the most suitable for fish spawning the daily average flow in the flow rising process should be about 30 higher than the daily average flow in the whole spawning season as shown in fig 13 d it is interesting that almost all the other indicators show monotone features with the orders of wet years normal years and dry years except for the average flow increment δ q r in fig 13 e δ q r is much higher in the normal years than that in the wet years and dry years it has not been clear that whether the fish response to the flow or to the flow increment if the fish preferred most the flow condition in the normal years they might be most sensitive to the flow increment instead of the flow as indicated in fig 13 e in fig 13 f the average growth rate in normal years is 55 m3 s day falling between that in the wet years and dry years it can be inferred that the flow rising rate should not be too low nor too high to stimulate fish spawning it needs to be illustrated that the proposed fia method are suitable to analyze the flow regime of the rivers with little human influences 5 conclusion a fluctuation identification algorithm fia is proposed in this study to identify integrated flow rising processes effective for fish spawning stimulus consisting of flow rising and falling edges a group of indicators describing the features of the identified rising processes are also defined the application on the upper reaches of the yellow river over recent 10 years indicates that about 4 6 times of flow rising processes occur in the fish spawning season and it occurs more frequently in wet years but even for different hydrological years each rising process lasts for about 11 days under the assumption that the flow condition in the normal years are the most suitable for fish spawning the daily average flow in the flow rising process should be about 30 higher than the daily average flow in the whole spawning season and the growth rate should not be too low nor too high with a preferred value of 55 m3 s day the proposed methodology can be used to analyze the flow regimes of rivers under natural conditions and provide the knowledge of the flow characteristics preferred by fish in the spawning season in the future more observation of fish spawning can be carried on to check whether the rising processes detected by fia gives an effective stimulus for spawning for example whether it provides a good estimation of spawning times acknowledgments this research was supported by national natural science foundation of china grant no 51879137 91847302 and

25062,various studies have proven that the flow rising processes play a significant role in the fish spawning stimulus instead of seizing the flow rise as an integrated process consisting of a flow rising edge and falling edge the current publication focus on the daily flow it is necessary to identify the effective flow rising process to learn the flow feature and guide the water resources management in this study a fluctuation identification algorithm fia is proposed based on the identification of flow rising and falling edges with only three parameters in total on the strength of those identified flow rising processes a group of fish oriented indicators are defined to describe the features of the rising including the number of the rising processes in the whole spawning season the average duration of each rising process the daily average flow in the flow rising processes the average flow rising ratio the average flow increment and the average growth rate of the flow rising processes in the spawning season the application on the upper reaches of the yellow river over recent 10 years verifies the validity of the proposed fluctuation identification algorithm the statistics of those indicators indicates the regularities of the flow rising processes in the fish spawning seasons in different hydrological years which helps the ecological protection in the water resources development keywords fish spawning stimulus flow rising process fluctuation identification algorithm fia fish oriented indicators upper reaches of the yellow river 1 introduction stream flows that are sufficient for fisheries are usually adequate for macro invertebrate and other aquatic life liu et al 2011 as in the top position of the food chain fish can be appropriate ecosystem indicators providing an integrative view of the environment wu et al 2014 zhao et al 2015a existing studies have demonstrated that over the whole life span of fish some specific seasons are crucial for fish reproduction such as spawning season when fish community are sensitive to flow velocity and water level to spawn and for the successful survival of their eggs larvae liu et al 2011 chen et al 2015 reported that the spawning activity of indigenous fish schizothorax chongi in the yalong river in china is sensitive to the flow variations during the spawning period koster et al 2018 examined the influence of hydrological variables such as flow magnitude temporal variables and spatial variables on migration and spawn using data collected from 2008 to 2015 in the bunyip tarago river system in victoria and found that rising discharge act as a cue to downstream migration and spawn leira and cantonati 2008 concluded that water level fluctuations wlf in lakes and rivers especially their extent frequency and duration are dominant forces controlling the functioning of these ecosystems by reviewing the relevant literatures from 1991 to 2008 ondrej and ludek 2004 found that slow and steady flow helps the migration without spawn while the great change of flow provokes spawning for brown trout in china along with the developing construction of water conservancy facilities various evidence have also been reported that the change of hydrological conditions greatly impact the spawning of fishes tao et al 2017 reported that fish aggregated into the spawning grounds for spawning during the flood and departed after the flood in the yangtze river in china du et al 2011 stated that the sites where the embryo of the chinese sturgeon occur can be predicted with the three physical variables embeddedness of the sediment water velocity and river bottom elevation xu et al 2015 investigated the fish spawning activities of the four major chinese carps in the middle mainstream of the yangtze river from may to july and concluded that the flood amplitude and river transparency were significantly positive correlated with egg abundance and the flooding occasions was significantly and negatively correlated with the time of spawning according to the book freshwater pisciculture in china mainly edited by academician liu jiakang there is a certain velocity required to enable fish to spawn liu and he 1992 the calculations based on the observed data as well as the result of the research on fish ecology the appropriate velocity for most fish to spawn is about 0 3 0 4 m s liu 1999 there are two perspectives to understand the flow ecology relationships one is to estimate the timing and magnitude of fish movements relative to environmental factors which is from the perspective of the fish such as adapted ecological hydraulic radius approach aehra habitat suitability index hsi and index of biological integrity ibi aehra selects key fish species subjectively thus uncertainties will be unavoidably be introduces in e flows assessment zhao et al 2017 although zhao et al 2015b developed a multi species based hsi mhsi model to estimate responses of multi species to a habitat environmental factor the omission of the relative frequency of available habitat in mhsi brought uncertainties to findings although ibi has been widely applied across the world wu et al 2014 its direct application is problematic in regions having a rich and diverse ichthyofauna and where the knowledge of fish species ecology is incomplete tejerina garro et al 2006 these studies based on fish either used fish captures at dams ladders weirs and traps to quantify migration timing or make and recapture techniques vehanen et al 2000 heggenes and traaen 1988 the difficulty lies in 1 to capture free range fish 2 to quantify the movement of the fishes 3 to collect adequate data over long term monitoring besides such studies introduced uncertainties derived from the selection of the representative fish species and the studies often focused on single events with few examples which limits the temporal applicability and robustness of findings koster et al 2018 growns and james 2005 the other way is from the perspective of flow the oldest and the most studied element of the flows is biological minimum taking the minimum discharge for maintaining river scale as large as possible chen et al 2012 while it was realized that ecological status is influenced by a set of other hydrological features corresponding to appropriate ecological flow barbalic and kuspilic 2015 more than 200 methods for assessing ecological flow were reported liu et al 2011 such as methodologies of tennant river 2d and indicators of hydrological alterations iha although a steady state solution can be derived from river 2d the unattainable discrepancy of velocities and depth between the measured value and the river 2d yielded values occurs markgard 2009 boavida et al 2013 iha richter et al 1997 consisting of 33 parameters is considered to be good descriptors of hydrological regime characteristics which influence ecological status of rivers as in iha some studies use high low pulse of flow to describe the characteristics of flow alteration i e finding peaks before a global rise and after a global decrease such statistics regard the flow pulses as independent occurrence and every flow pulse is counted the significant merit of iha lies in its independency of a variety of other data except for daily streamflow nevertheless these studies are not fish oriented without specific identification of the key factors influencing the spawning or migrating in this study the flow process in fish spawning season is studied as a continuous and complete flow regime with some white noises several criteria are proposed to distinguish the noise and the fluctuation effective for fish spawning stimulus based on the proposed fluctuation identification algorithm fia a group of fish oriented indicators is presented to describe the characteristics of flows in the specific crucial seasons for fish reproduction the natural flow process in the spawning season is firstly analyzed by fia and the significant flow increasing process is identified which has been proven to be a crucial stimulus signal for fish to spawn the feature of the flow increasing process is then extracted by a group of indicators proposed in this study the upper stream of the yellow river in china where almost no disturb of human activities occurs is selected to verify the proposed method the selected years are classified into dry normal and wet years and the indicators for each kind of years are presented and analyzed 2 methodology 2 1 fluctuation identification algorithm fia 2 1 1 identification of flow rising edge the rising edge and the falling edge of natural flow increasing process are identified and extracted respectively the flow rising edge is classified into three modes including single sharp rising continuous rising and follow up rising the single sharp rising refers to a flow rising with an amplitude larger than a certain threshold as defined below and there is no following flow rising subsequently the continuous rising is composed of multiple single sharp risings with small drops in between and the amplitude of these drops needs to be smaller than a certain threshold as defined below the follow up rising refers to the situation that a sharp rising is followed by multiple small and successive risings the original flow sequence is firstly preprocessed by the findpeaks function in software matlab to find all the local valleys q v i and local peaks q p i then the three modes illustrated above are identified successively and the details are illustrated as follows 1 step 1 identification of single sharp flow rising process the natural flow process is a non stationary time series and the fluctuation range is quite different small fluctuations do not produce reproductive stimuli to fish and thus are not taken into account in the identification of rising flow only those rising process with a certain degree of fluctuation is considered the flow increment δ q r i described in fig 1 and eq 1 is used as an indicator to identify the rising edge of the flow as shown in eq 2 1 δ q r i q p i q v i 2 δ q r i q r c r i where q is the streamflow the index r refers to the variables related to the flow rising edge i is the index of the number of the flow rising processes in a certain year the subscript p and v refer to peak and valley values in the flow process respectively q r c r i is the increment threshold and if the increment δ q r i is larger than q r c r i the corresponding rising process is recognized as an effective stimulus for fish spawning increment threshold q r c r i relates to the maximum value of the flow process and is also relevant to the hydrological characteristics of the year thus q r c r i should be noted q r c r i h but for the sake of simplicity the dependency to h is implicit and q r c r i is defined as the mean of the maximum flow of the similar hydrological years i e wet years normal years or dry years as shown in eq 3 3 q r c r i α 1 m e a n max m q h m where α 1 is the sensitive factor of the identification of flow rising process h is the index of different hydrological years and h 1 2 3 indicate wet years normal years and dry years respectively m is the index of the year the smaller α 1 is the more likely the flow increment is identified as a single sharp flow rising process by our tests the recommended value of α 1 is between 0 15 to 0 35 and in this study α 1 0 20 fig 2 is the daily flow sequence of a certain hydrometric station during the fish spawning season where the red circle indicates the flow incremental process identified by single sharp rising identification 2 step 2 identification of continuous flow rising process the natural streamflow accomplishes the rising process on the basis of fluctuations the same rising process may consist of multiple continuous fluctuations that are connected end to end only using fluctuation amplitude q r c r i as the criterion may lead to misjudgment which recognizes the same continuous rising process as multiple independent rising processes as shown in fig 2 therefore if the rising edge of the adjacent flow rising process identified in the previous step is continuous it is necessary to determine whether the two rising edges are independent another sensitive factor of the identification of continuous flow rising process α 2 0 α 2 1 is set in this study to recognize continuous rising process with the help of the flow increment δ q r i defined in the previous step as shown in fig 3 a and eq 4 4 δ q f i α 2 q r c r i where δ q f i q f i j q f i j 1 is the flow decrement α 2 is the sensitive factor of the identification of continuous rising process the larger α 2 is the more likely the flow is identified as a continuous flow rising process by our tests the recommended value of α 2 is between 0 1 to 0 15 and in this study α 2 0 10 if the change of flow in the adjacent rising processes determined in the first step is relatively gentle the condition in eq 4 is satisfied and it is recognized as the same continuous flow rising process as shown in fig 3 b while if the flow fluctuation in the adjacent flow rising processes is drastic eq 4 cannot be satisfied and it is identified as two independent rising processes as illustrated in fig 3 c fig 4 shows the natural daily flow series during april to june at a certain hydrologic station where there exists a natural spawning ground downstream and the laying season lasts from april to june if only step 1 is carried out to identify rising flow process without recognition of continuous rising flow process in step 2 the increasing process indicated in the red circle will be judged as two independent rising processes as shown in fig 4 a however such result is obviously inconsistent with empirical understanding of the flow incremental stimulus for fish spawning adding the recognition of step 2 the two adjacent processes in red circles in fig 4 a is considered to be the same continuous rising process as shown in fig 4 b 3 step 3 identification of follow up flow rising process after the foregoing two steps the derived flow rising edge might link to small fluctuations and in such case the rising process is considered to end only when the subsequent increase rate becomes more and more severe the rising process is deemed to continue eqs 5 and 6 describe the criteria above for judging the end position of the rising edge by the characteristics of subsequent rising process 5 q p i j q p i j 1 2 n where q p i j indicates the j th follow up peaks in the i th flow rising process as illustrated in fig 5 when the fluctuation begin to decline the flow rising process can be judged to end as eq 5 cannot be satisfied however the case that a local peak links to a steady fluctuation instead of a sudden decline is not excluded by eq 5 which should also be the end of a rising process in case the follow up rising process is too gentle to be included in a rising process for spawning stimulus the criteria of classifying the follow up peaks into the rising process needs to be enhanced as shown in eq 6 6 q p i j q p i j 1 α 3 j 1 e j 1 j q r c r i j 1 2 n by convention q p i 0 q p i in eq 6 j 1 e j 1 j is a criterion enhancement factor whose value increases exponentially with the progressive increase of j this factor is used to ensure that the flow rising edge derived from step 1 and step 2 links to a follow up rising process whose increment becomes more and more severe when the same rising process is judged to continue the parameter α 3 is the sensitive factor of the identification of follow up flow rising process which is set to be 0 1 in this study by our tests the smaller α 3 is the more likely a steady follow up process is included in the rising process in addition there should not be any superposition of the rising edges to avoid repeated statistics of the flow rising processes that is the subsequent peak is always before the following rising process as indicated in eq 7 7 d a y q p i j d a y q p i 1 where d a y indicates the julian date when occurs fig 6 compares the identification results of the flow rising process with and without step 3 fig 6 a shows the flow rising process identified by step 1 and step 2 without the follow up rising process recognition where the first decline is considered to be the end of the rising process in the red circle such result is clearly inconsistent with empirical judgments fig 6 b takes the subsequent flooding process into account and assumes that a large flow peak following a small flow fluctuation is the end of the rising edge of this rising process as indicated in the red circle the rising process identified in fig 6 b is more reasonable going with our subjective judgment to be a spawning stimulus for fish 2 1 2 identification of flow falling edge 1 step 4 identification of the first flow falling edge due to the continuity of the rising and falling process of the streamflow each identified rising edge is followed by a falling edge which is extracted directly and named the first falling edge as shown in fig 7 and the red circle in fig 8 2 step 5 identification of the follow up flow falling edge there may exists subsequent falling process following the first flow falling edge as shown in fig 9 if the follow up falling process is connected to a smooth flow process with small fluctuation the process is considered to end after the first falling edge while if continuous falling occurs and the falling the process is considered to continue eq 8 and 9 describe the criteria above for judging the end position of the falling edge based on the characteristics of the subsequent falling process which are 1 the peak value of the local fluctuations in the subsequent falling process cannot exceed the peak of the rising edge as in eqs 8 and 2 the follow up falling process should not be too steady otherwise the whole rising process is considered to end to enhance the requirement of identifying the follow up falling process as a part of the rising process e j 1 j is taken as the amplification factor as shown in eq 9 if j 1 eq 9 is used to describe the first follow up peak which is the same as eq 8 while if j 1 eq 9 is stricter than eq 8 to determine whether the follow up peaks can be identified as the falling edge of the flow rising process 8 q p i j q p i j 1 2 n 9 e j 1 j q p i j q p i j 1 2 n fig 10 compares the recognition results with and without considerations of the subsequent falling process the falling process in fig 10 a satisfies the conditions defined in eq 8 which is that the peak in falling process is smaller than that in the rising edge and the subsequent valley is smaller than the first flow falling edge hence it is identified as the same flow falling process however the rising process is clearly not ended since the falling process continues with ever increasing amplitude the flow rising process effective for fish spawning stimulus is recognized to continue by eq 9 as shown in fig 10 b which is apparently more reasonable 2 2 characteristic indicators of the flow rising process for the identified natural flow rising process characteristic indicators need to be defined to describe the features of the rising process the physical characteristics represented by those indicators in common in different hydrological years can be regarded as the key factors for fish spawning stimulus if there is l flow rising processes in a spawning season in total in which the j th rising process covers nj daily flow data and the whole spawning season lasts for s days the parameter set in this study to characterize the flow rising process includes 1 n the total number of rising processes in the spawning season 2 t the average duration in days of each flow rising process in the spawning season 3 q daily average flow in the flow rising processes in the spawning season as defined below 11 q j 1 l i 1 n j q i j j 1 l n j where q i j is the flow of the i th day in the j th rising process 4 η average flow rising ratio in a spawning season it is defined as the ratio between the average flow in the flow rising processes and the average flow in the whole spawning season describing the relative intensity of the flow rising as in eq 12 12 η q i 1 s q i s 5 δ q r average flow increment in a spawning season which reflects the absolute intensity of the flow increment as shown in eq 13 13 δ q r j 1 l max q i j min q i j l i 1 2 n 6 v average growth rate which reflects both the increment and the temporal effect as in eq 14 14 v j 1 l max q i j min q i j d a y max q i j d a y min q i j 1 l i 1 2 n the larger the v is the more severe the fish perceives the flow rising thus v is deemed to be an important parameter for fish spawning 3 study case china renewable energy engineering institute 2017 the yellow river ranks as the sixth largest river in the world with a total length of 5464 km the source area of the yellow river is located at the eastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau and is bordered by the cross section of the tangnaihai hydrological station the drainage area of the source area is 121 972 km2 accounting for 16 2 of the area of the yellow river basin the average annual runoff of the source area is 2 1010 m3 accounting for 34 5 of the total runoff in the yellow river basin the upper reaches of the yellow river provide abundant water resources in recent years with the rapid development of the yellow river basin several large scale hydropower stations have been planned in the upper reaches of the yellow river the development and construction of these hydropower stations will affect the fishes in the corresponding river reaches greatly it is necessary to analyze the natural flow processes which are suitable for fish survival and reproduction to guide the operation of those projects the tangnaihe hydrological station is an important control station in the upper reaches of the yellow river the river length above the control section is 1553 km accounting for 28 4 of the whole river there is no national protected fish around the tangnaihe station other endangered and local protected fish mainly include chuanchia labiosa platypharodon extremus gymnocypris eckloni schizopygopsis pylzovi triplophysa siluroides gymnodiptychus pvery singleycheilus acanthogobio guentheri etc the gymnodiptychus pvery singleycheilus migrate against the stream and spawn after the ice melt in april while all the other kinds of fish spawn from may to june most of the protected fish above are cold water fish spawning adhesive and demersal eggs the flowing environment of the river is an important factor for the existence of the spawning ground for these fish long term observations indicate that the fish spawning requires not only flow pulses but also a continuous rising process during the pulse and there also have to be enough flood peaks in addition the spawning grounds of the above fish are mostly slow flow water area with pebbles and gravel sediments i e spawning grounds also have certain requirements on flow velocity and water depth which can be reflected through the flow besides the dynamic characteristics of the flow above appropriate water temperature is also an essential condition for the survival and hatching of the fish eggs taking the yehuxia spawning grounds around the tangaihai station as the study subject as shown in fig 11 the fish spawning season lasts from april to june the key ecological requirements for the water environment mainly include 1 flow requirement the sexual maturation of the fish requires stimulation of flow rising process with daily duration 2 water depth requirements the hatching of the adhesive and demersal eggs requires a gentle shallow water with hourly duration and thus the flow fluctuation within one day should not be too large 3 water temperature requirement the spawning as well as the survival and hatching of the eggs needs appropriate temperature and the suitable temperature for the protected fish spawning ground is about 14 15 c under the gentle and shallow water condition the river reach can receive sufficient sunniness during the spawning season and its water temperature can satisfy the demand therefore we focus on analyzing the characteristics of the flow process 4 results and discussion 4 1 classification of different hydrological years the streamflow generally complies with the pearson iii probability distribution and the statistical parameters and the design values of each frequency determined by frequency analysis are taken as the criteria for the classification of hydrological years cohen 1979 the flow sequence are classified into wet years normal years and dry years based on the historical flow from 2006 to 2016 at the tangnaihai station the frequency curve is plotted and the corresponding parameters are shown in table 1 according to the frequency parameters the ten years between the year of 2007 to 2016 are classified into wet years normal years and dry years half time of the recent 10 years lasting from 2007 to 2016 the normal years are normal years and wet years and dry years account for 30 and 20 respectively 4 2 identification results of the flow rising processes based on the natural daily flow of the yehuxia fish spawning ground during the spawning season from april to june in the past 10 years 2007 2016 the flow rising processes are identified for each year the results are shown in fig 12 where identified flow rising processes are labeled by pentagrams the three pentagrams in the same color represent the same rising process indicating the start point the peak point and the end point respectively these three important points in a rising process are linked by dash lines in the same flow sequence different rising processes are indicated by different colors taking the year of 2007 as the representative of the normal years it can be seen in fig 12 a that from the 1st to the 50th day the flow process kept steady around 300 400 m3 s without obvious rising process on the 51st day there began a small flow rising process followed by a moderate rise and then a strong rising process occurred these three flow rising processes are precisely identified by the proposed algorithm taking the year of 2009 as the representative of the wet years fig 12 c shows that there are four flow rising processes identified by the proposed algorithm resulting the flow rise from 350 m3 s at the beginning of the spawning season to 1400 m3 s at the end taking the year of 2015 as the representative of the dry years fig 12 i indicates that the obvious flow rise began on the 52nd day followed by three identified rising processes it should be illustrated that the starting point of a slow and steady rising process still needs to be clarified with the ecological knowledge for instance for the year of 2008 and 2013 in fig 12 the starting points of the first flow rising processes are not exclusive besides the situation that the last flow rising process does not end with a falling edge should be dealt with current ecological knowledge as shown in fig 12 b d f and i 4 3 characteristics of the identified flow rising process according to the classification results of different hydrological years the flow rising characteristic indicators of the identified rising processes in different years are extracted as shown in tables 2 3 and 4 the annual average of each indicators in different hydrological years are compared in fig 13 it can be seen in tables 2 4 and fig 13 a that more rising processes occur in wet years than normal years and dry years basically there are 4 6 times of rising processes in the fish spawning season however even for different hydrological years each flow rising process lasts for about 11 days as indicated in fig 13 b in the wet years the flow in the whole spawning season is generally high and thus the daily average flow in the rising processes are higher than normal years in fig 13 c compared to the flow in the whole spawning season the flow increment in the rising processes are not as high as those in the normal years and dry years thus the average flow rising ratio η 1 08 is relatively small in wet years under the assumption that the flow condition in the normal years are the most suitable for fish spawning the daily average flow in the flow rising process should be about 30 higher than the daily average flow in the whole spawning season as shown in fig 13 d it is interesting that almost all the other indicators show monotone features with the orders of wet years normal years and dry years except for the average flow increment δ q r in fig 13 e δ q r is much higher in the normal years than that in the wet years and dry years it has not been clear that whether the fish response to the flow or to the flow increment if the fish preferred most the flow condition in the normal years they might be most sensitive to the flow increment instead of the flow as indicated in fig 13 e in fig 13 f the average growth rate in normal years is 55 m3 s day falling between that in the wet years and dry years it can be inferred that the flow rising rate should not be too low nor too high to stimulate fish spawning it needs to be illustrated that the proposed fia method are suitable to analyze the flow regime of the rivers with little human influences 5 conclusion a fluctuation identification algorithm fia is proposed in this study to identify integrated flow rising processes effective for fish spawning stimulus consisting of flow rising and falling edges a group of indicators describing the features of the identified rising processes are also defined the application on the upper reaches of the yellow river over recent 10 years indicates that about 4 6 times of flow rising processes occur in the fish spawning season and it occurs more frequently in wet years but even for different hydrological years each rising process lasts for about 11 days under the assumption that the flow condition in the normal years are the most suitable for fish spawning the daily average flow in the flow rising process should be about 30 higher than the daily average flow in the whole spawning season and the growth rate should not be too low nor too high with a preferred value of 55 m3 s day the proposed methodology can be used to analyze the flow regimes of rivers under natural conditions and provide the knowledge of the flow characteristics preferred by fish in the spawning season in the future more observation of fish spawning can be carried on to check whether the rising processes detected by fia gives an effective stimulus for spawning for example whether it provides a good estimation of spawning times acknowledgments this research was supported by national natural science foundation of china grant no 51879137 91847302 and

25063,the current anthropogenic impacts on nature necessitate more research for nature conservation and restoration purposes to answer ecological and conservation questions concerning endangered species individual based modelling is an obvious choice individual based models can provide reliable results that may be used to predict the effects of different future conservation strategies once calibrated correctly here we calibrate an individual based model of maui dolphin movement which generates maui dolphin probability distribution maps we used sighting data for calibration of the chosen parameter combinations for each simulation run collected simulated data was compared to the empirical survey data resulting in cost badness of fit estimates using costs of four different aspects of dolphin behaviour we estimated the most likely parameter combinations with optimized parameter values maui dolphin probability distribution maps were created resulting in distributions that fall well outside of the current protection zones where either gillnets or trawling or both are prohibited with these results protected areas can be properly adjusted to the estimated distribution of this critically endangered species and so aid in their conservation keywords individual based modelling parameter calibration maui dolphins 1 introduction for the conservation of species vulnerable to extinction it is useful to explore the effectiveness of different restoration scenarios predicting the effects of different protection measures is of great importance as policy makers can adjust their actions accordingly and adopt the management strategies that will provide the best possible outcome cash et al 2002 to deliver high quality predictions for possible scenarios models are needed that represent the study system in a credible salient and legitimate fashion cash et al 2002 yet many ecological questions are too complex for simple deduction or successful modelling with spatially implicit population models custom made individual based models ibms are often the best analysis tool for these kinds of questions deangelis and mooij 2005 nabe nielsen et al 2014 macpherson and gras 2016 van der vaart et al 2016 udevitz et al 2017 van beest et al 2017 an urgent case in which high quality model projections are needed is that of the maui dolphin cephalorhynchus hectori maui the maui dolphin is with its current estimated population size of 63 individuals 95 ci 57 75 baker et al 2016 classified as critically endangered by the iucn reeves et al 2008 the declining population martien et al 1999 slooten et al 2000 baker et al 2013 wade et al 2012 that was once distributed along the west and south coasts of new zealand s north island du fresne 2010 dawson et al 2001 is now restricted to a much smaller area of approximately 300 km along the west coast with most recent sightings within an area of about 140 km length oremus et al 2012 besides their small coastal geographic range and population size maui dolphins have a slow reproduction rate endangering their survival davidson et al 2012 although the new zealand government has increased restrictions to fishing activities in a zone along the west coast after the death of a maui dolphin in 2012 hamner et al 2014 current restrictions are not yet sufficient to result in population recovery spatially implicit population level models have successfully demonstrated the link between the maui dolphin population decline and gillnet fishing martien et al 1999 slooten et al 2000 baker et al 2013 wade et al 2012 brought insight in the maximum by catch that can be supported wade 1998 wade et al 2012 and have prompted policy measures slooten and lad 1991 martien et al 1999 slooten et al 2000 burkhart and slooten 2003 slooten and dawson 2010 slooten and davies 2012 however population level models have lower spatial resolution as to where these policy measures should be in place to be able to provide policy advice at high spatial resolutions spatially explicit individual based models are needed van beest et al 2017 we developed a tailor made individual based model of maui dolphin movement which can be used to project the impact of fishing activities on the maui dolphin population under alternative policy scenarios we model hourly movement of individual dolphins at a 1 km2 resolution for a duration of 90 days to account for the small spatial and temporal scales at which dolphin behaviour and human impacts occur in real life this model will be useful for i spatially explicit modelling of interactions between fishery activities and dolphins and ii informing the spatially implicit models on values for parameters with high spatial and temporal sensitivity dolphin behaviour in our model is based on bathymetry social drivers and internal drivers because accurate data on the distribution and dynamics of prey species is insufficient foraging is not explicitly included in the model 2 methods 2 1 the study system maui dolphins the maui dolphin population is distributed within a small range along the west coast of the north island of new zealand ranging from maunganui bluff to whanganui slooten et al 2005 2006 currey et al 2012 the model was set up to represent the habitat of maui dolphins fig 1 a in the northern part of the maui dolphin s range protection implemented in 2008 prohibits gillnetting to 7 nautical miles nmi offshore and trawling to a maximum of 4 nmi offshore further south between new plymouth and hawera gillnets were banned in 2012 to 2 rather than 7 nmi offshore and trawling is permitted regardless of distance from shore the southernmost part of the maui dolphin range from hawera to whanganui remains unprotected dolphins range throughout the area from the shoreline to the 100 m depth contour and occasionally enter harbours rayment et al 2011 maui dolphins were observed to prefer inshore waters in population surveys with equal survey effort with respect to distance from shore slooten et al 2004 2006 rayment and du fresne 2007 dolphin movement behaviours depend on local environmental factors including water depth distance to the coast and the presence of other dolphins and fishing vessels rayment and webster 2009 rayment et al 2009 maui dolphins are not attracted to gillnets as the fish caught in these nets are too large for them to

overview design concepts details grimm et al 2006 2010 can be found in supplementary methods a the objective of our model is to accurately simulate hourly movements of maui dolphins as a function of dolphin swimming activity water depth distance to their home range centres and the distribution of nearby conspecifics we created an individual based model to simulate the spatial distribution of dolphins over the coastal waters along the west coast of new zealand s north island fig 1a represents the area of approximately 180 by 465 km that was used for the spatial configuration of the model based on a detailed bathymetry map we included average ocean depth for each 1 by 1 km grid cell during a simulation run dolphins are initially placed in the landscape and iteratively move across by choosing the number of patch displacements per hour and choosing the directions of each of these displacements for a set number of hourly steps first 63 dolphins were initially placed within the simulated area these dolphins are distributed along the coastline with a doubled probability of initial placement in the centre area see fig 1 depth at which dolphins occur follows an exponential distribution with λ 0 05 m 1 based on field data initial depth in m ln x 0 05 m 1 where x is a random number between zero and one after the initial distribution of dolphins along the coastline hourly movements were simulated at a 1 km resolution the number of moves per hour varies for each dolphin and every hour we assumed that the distribution of the number of moves per hour can be described by a poisson distribution of which the scaling exponent μ is equal for all dolphins per simulation empirical data on the distance moved per hour by maui dolphins fits extremely well to a weibull distribution see suppl fig 1 using a poisson distribution of the number of steps with steps of approximately 1 km in 8 random directions this weibull distribution can be approximated the movement direction per discrete move depends on a dolphin s preferences of shallow waters staying close to its home range centre and joining other dolphins for the eight neighbouring grid cells that fall within the 1 km range the weights of these three factors are multiplied 1 wpatch wdepth whome wschooling where wpatch is the overall weight of a patch and wdepth whome and wschooling are the weights assigned to a patch for its depth closeness to the focal dolphin s home range centre and the presence of dolphins respectively wdepth follows a sigmoid function 2 wdepth 1 0 011 d δ 1 where d is the depth in m and δ is the depth preference exponent which equals the depth where wdepth 0 5 at 0 m depth wdepth is kept at a constant value 0 99 whome also follows a sigmoid function 3 whome 1 0 011 h η 1 where h is the distance to the home range centre in km and η is the home range exponent which equals the distance where whome 0 5 at the home range centre whome is kept at a constant value 0 99 wschooling is a simple step function of whether other dolphins occur at a patch 4 w s c h o o l i n g 1 i f n 0 1 σ i f n 0 where σ is the schooling preference and n is the number of dolphins present when running a simulation dolphin s home range centres were calculated at an hourly rate as the centre of all previously visited locations during a spin up phase of 30 days after which home range centres remained unchanged and dolphin movements were recorded for 90 days afterwards a summary including home range characteristics and distributions of hourly displacements group sizes and depth was created more detailed information on the model can be found in the appended odd suppl methods a a summary of parameters and their descriptions is given in table 1 2 3 sensitivity analysis and calibration the main model flexibility lies with four parameters that cannot be directly estimated from observations the movement activity exponent μ depth preference exponent δ home range exponent η and schooling preference σ because direct estimation of these parameter values is impossible the observed patterns emerge through the interaction of these parameters we determined the model sensitivity to these parameters and calibrated the sensitive parameters to observed patterns of dolphin behaviour for this process we i reduced the number of parameters to be calibrated based on an estimate of the global sensitivity of the goodness of fit from multiple one at a time sensitivity analyses oat through linear regression ten broeke et al 2016 and ii determined the optimal combination of parameter values through regression of the idealised goodness of fit landscape to the results of a full factorial assessment of the model over a wide range of parameter combinations see suppl methods b thiele et al 2014 because we did not have observations that could be directly associated with model outputs we compared model outputs with observed distributions of four key variables as shown in table 2 we measured the degree of mismatch between model outputs and observed distributions using a cost function following thiele et al 2014 we defined the cost as 5 c o s t i j 0 i f e i j

behaviour in our model is based on survey data for maui dolphin the north island subspecies and hector s dolphin the species as a whole data has been collected on i depth preferences ii move length distributions iii grouping behaviour and iv home range sizes table 2 see suppl methods c to compare values between the different cost measures the values were rescaled by which a cost of 1 indicates a deviation double the expected value a cost of zero would indicate an optimal fit of the model to actual observations of maui dolphin behaviour assuming that the cost function follows a quadratic form through the 3 parameter space we calculated the parameter combination that minimizes the total cost i e maximum of the four costs per parameter combination using an analytical approach suppl methods d suppl fig 2 by using the maximum of the four costs we decrease the chance that the best performing parameter combination results in high deviations in one of the key behaviours as delineated in table 2 using summed up costs for model calibration resulted in estimated parameter values that provided qualitatively similar simulated dolphin distributions as when the maximum of the four costs was used for calibration suppl fig 3 2 4 interpretation once the model parameters were calibrated simulations with parameter values that minimized cost were run to generate probability distribution maps of dolphin presence in the study area to create these maps dolphin locations were recorded during a single season summer to examine the robustness of our results we repeated simulations 100 times for each likely parameter combination as well as for parameter combinations at the edges of the simulated parameter space we estimated the utilization distribution using the adehabitathr package in r r version 3 5 1 2018 the r foundation for statistical computing and subsequently calculated the kernel density estimates k50 k95 and k99 which are the areas in which all individuals have resided 50 95 and 99 of the simulated time respectively rayment et al 2009 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analyses before initializing a full calibration of the model we performed one at a time sensitivity analyses to examine which parameters would influence model output analysing the set of one at a time sensitivity analyses we observed that one of the parameters the depth preference exponent did not significantly affect any of the four cost estimates see suppl results a exclusion of this parameter resulted in a more efficient search for the optimal parameter combination in three dimensions 3 2 calibration after excluding variation in the depth preference exponent we performed a full orthogonal sampling of different combinations of the three remaining parameters i e movement activity exponent μ home range exponent η and schooling preference σ we found the parameter values giving outputs which most closely match the observed distributions shown in table 2 to be μ 5 1 η 27 5 and σ 322 at δ 50 fig 2 suppl results b 3 3 interpretation using these parameter values we estimated the area used by maui dolphins within the study site fig 1b illustrates the k50 red k95 orange and k99 yellow of dolphins simulated with 100 separate runs our estimates of the k95 and k99 lie well beyond the boundaries of the current marine mammal sanctuary fig 1b to check the robustness of our model we also ran 8 100 simulations with parameter combinations from the edges of the parameter space μ 1 or 7 η 10 or 50 and σ 10 or 500 fig 3 the badly parameterized model simulations with μ 1 top panels fig 3 result in a more spread out dolphin distribution compared to the calibrated model 4 discussion to promote the survival of the critically endangered maui dolphin population conservation policies regarding restrictions on fishing and trawling activities need to be fine tuned on the currently only coarsely known maui dolphin distribution we used an individual based model to estimate the occurrence of maui dolphins along the west coast of new zealand s north island and thereby predict local interactions between maui dolphins and fishing activities to provide high quality results four model parameters had to be calibrated our model incorporates small scale spatial detail in the estimates of the spatial distribution of maui dolphins that can be used to estimate the effect of human fishery activity on population dynamics by calibrating the model we increased the credibility of the simulation results as the model mimics the observed maui dolphin behaviour best when using the calibrated parameter values furthermore the high spatial resolution of the model can increase the legitimacy of applying models in policy design it should be noted that in its current form the model does not incorporate any interactions between dolphins and vessels the dolphin distribution estimated with the calibrated model results in most of the dolphins being found inside the gillnet restricted zone yet the dolphin distribution extends far beyond the current limits of this area fig 1b this is consistent with sightings outside the protected area at least as far as whanganui with occasional sightings as far as wellington and up the east coast of the north island of new zealand we focus on calibrating our individual based model to observed real world patterns it is important to note that taking values directly from field data as parameter input in an ibm will not result in model outcomes resembling observed behaviour patterns because the different behaviours of individuals in an ibm interact de jager et al 2014 for example the distance moved per hour by maui dolphins can be derived from field data slooten et al 1992 1993 slooten 1994 rayment et al 2009 yet we cannot use these values as input and assume that the model is accurately parameterized the observed movements are the consequence of interactions between intrinsic movement strategy attraction by dolphins depth preference home range dependencies and other behaviours by using such an observed movement pattern as the intrinsic movement strategy in a model in which interactions are still to come will certainly result in erroneous outcomes de jager et al 2014 hence parameter values which were given at first but interact with other modelling assumptions should be incorporated in the calibration process as parameters of unknown value two of the downsides of spatially explicit individual based modelling are that it is computationally and data intensive grimm and railsback 2005 each run of a well thought out model may require at least several minutes to weeks in extreme cases while population level models may take seconds or less due to these long running times parameter estimation and model calibration become challenging furthermore the data that is required to base the model on should be highly detailed at both the spatial and temporal scale as these would be the resolutions at which behaviour and interactions are modelled in ibms models that provide a good representation of a study system generally include several parameters whose value cannot be determined directly by empirical data to calibrate a model results from simulation runs with different combinations of parameter estimates need to be compared to real data grimm and railsback 2012 yet the number of simulation runs required for such an analysis increases exponentially with the number of parameters hence calibration remains a modelling process that is often neglected thiele et al 2014 but which should be incorporated in individual based modelling to generate more accurate predictions different approaches have been used to optimize model calibration such as manual calibration statistical calibration techniques using maximum likelihood or bayesian approaches or inverse modelling sobol 2001 wiegand et al 2003 grimm and railsback 2005 thiele et al 2014 van der vaart et al 2015 ten broeke et al 2016 for instance wiegand et al 2003 use a monte carlo filtering method in which the different cost measurements are successively applied as filters we used a different approach we used the highest cost out of the four costs for home range characteristics hourly displacements depth preference and group size distribution to represent the maximum cost per parameter combination using this method the worst fit of the model to the empirical data indicated by a high cost score represents a parameter combination s cost which will result in similar results as the method proposed by wiegand et al 2003 to improve the current model more survey data is needed especially on fish distributions in our model we assumed a homogeneous distribution of prey as data on fish distributions is lacking yet it is widely known that fish are not distributed evenly across the ocean but are rather clustered in patches of high nutritional value dolphins subsequently search for such dense aggregations a behaviour which is currently not incorporated in our model information on fish distributions would much improve the current maui dolphin movement model distribution maps generated with this model will improve the current spatial distribution estimates of the maui dolphin population and provide key input for comparison of different conservation measures by overlaying the estimated maui dolphin distribution map with a map indicating current fishing activities we can pinpoint the areas where human dolphin interactions are most likely to cause casualties furthermore for different future scenarios of protection zones we will be able to estimate the impact on the maui dolphin population calculation of the overlap between maui dolphin habitat and fishing activity as well as predictions of future scenarios will be important future directions of research declarations of interest none acknowledgements we would like to thank the scientific committee of the international whaling commission for

25063,the current anthropogenic impacts on nature necessitate more research for nature conservation and restoration purposes to answer ecological and conservation questions concerning endangered species individual based modelling is an obvious choice individual based models can provide reliable results that may be used to predict the effects of different future conservation strategies once calibrated correctly here we calibrate an individual based model of maui dolphin movement which generates maui dolphin probability distribution maps we used sighting data for calibration of the chosen parameter combinations for each simulation run collected simulated data was compared to the empirical survey data resulting in cost badness of fit estimates using costs of four different aspects of dolphin behaviour we estimated the most likely parameter combinations with optimized parameter values maui dolphin probability distribution maps were created resulting in distributions that fall well outside of the current protection zones where either gillnets or trawling or both are prohibited with these results protected areas can be properly adjusted to the estimated distribution of this critically endangered species and so aid in their conservation keywords individual based modelling parameter calibration maui dolphins 1 introduction for the conservation of species vulnerable to extinction it is useful to explore the effectiveness of different restoration scenarios predicting the effects of different protection measures is of great importance as policy makers can adjust their actions accordingly and adopt the management strategies that will provide the best possible outcome cash et al 2002 to deliver high quality predictions for possible scenarios models are needed that represent the study system in a credible salient and legitimate fashion cash et al 2002 yet many ecological questions are too complex for simple deduction or successful modelling with spatially implicit population models custom made individual based models ibms are often the best analysis tool for these kinds of questions deangelis and mooij 2005 nabe nielsen et al 2014 macpherson and gras 2016 van der vaart et al 2016 udevitz et al 2017 van beest et al 2017 an urgent case in which high quality model projections are needed is that of the maui dolphin cephalorhynchus hectori maui the

restricted to a much smaller area of approximately 300 km along the west coast with most recent sightings within an area of about 140 km length oremus et al 2012 besides their small coastal geographic range and population size maui dolphins have a slow reproduction rate endangering their survival davidson et al 2012 although the new zealand government has increased restrictions to fishing activities in a zone along the west coast after the death of a maui dolphin in 2012 hamner et al 2014 current restrictions are not yet sufficient to result in population recovery spatially implicit population level models have successfully demonstrated the link between the maui dolphin population decline and gillnet fishing martien et al 1999 slooten et al 2000 baker et al 2013 wade et al 2012 brought insight in the maximum by catch that can be supported wade 1998 wade et al 2012 and have prompted policy measures slooten and lad 1991 martien et al 1999 slooten et al 2000 burkhart and slooten 2003 slooten and dawson 2010 slooten and davies 2012 however population level models have lower spatial resolution as to where these policy measures should be in place to be able to provide policy advice at high spatial resolutions spatially explicit individual based models are needed van beest et al 2017 we developed a tailor made individual based model of maui dolphin movement which can be used to project the impact of fishing activities on the maui dolphin population under alternative policy scenarios we model hourly movement of individual dolphins at a 1 km2 resolution for a duration of 90 days to account for the small spatial and temporal scales at which dolphin behaviour and human impacts occur in real life this model will be useful for i spatially explicit modelling of interactions between fishery activities and dolphins and ii informing the spatially implicit models on values for parameters with high spatial and temporal sensitivity dolphin behaviour in our model is based on bathymetry social drivers and internal drivers because accurate data on the distribution and dynamics of prey species is insufficient foraging is not explicitly included in the model 2

whanganui slooten et al 2005 2006 currey et al 2012 the model was set up to represent the habitat of maui dolphins fig 1 a in the northern part of the maui dolphin s range protection implemented in 2008 prohibits gillnetting to 7 nautical miles nmi offshore and trawling to a maximum of 4 nmi offshore further south between new plymouth and hawera gillnets were banned in 2012 to 2 rather than 7 nmi offshore and trawling is permitted regardless of distance from shore the southernmost part of the maui dolphin range from hawera to whanganui remains unprotected dolphins range throughout the area from the shoreline to the 100 m depth contour and occasionally enter harbours rayment et al 2011 maui dolphins were observed to prefer inshore waters in population surveys with equal survey effort with respect to distance from shore slooten et al 2004 2006 rayment and du fresne 2007 dolphin movement behaviours depend on local environmental factors including water depth distance to the coast and the presence of other dolphins and fishing vessels rayment and webster 2009 rayment et al 2009 maui dolphins are not attracted to gillnets as the fish caught in these nets are too large for them to

different sets of initial conditions that yield pattern dynamics originating from degradation of uniform vegetation or colonization of bare ground these numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the analytical predictions to characterize more deeply the propagating character of the edges of vegetation patches and to emphasize how distinct initial conditions may lead to significantly different ecological scenarios keywords wave instability non stationary vegetation patterns primary and secondary seed dispersal linear stability analysis maxwell points 1 introduction in many semi arid environments vegetation along hillsides is spatially self organized in regular patches with suitable and unsuitable sites for establishment a lot of theoretical efforts have been spent to develop analytical and numerical tools capable to predict the transitions that such ecosystems may experience in particular a relevant body of research focuses on the modeling of those complex phenomena that contribute to the formation modulation resilience and propagation of vegetation patterns lefever and lejeune 1997 klausmeier 1999 rietkerk et al 2000 tongway et al 2001 hillerislambers et al 2001 sherratt 2005 2010 2011 2015 rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 deblauwe et al 2008 2011 siteur et al 2014 bochet 2015 penny et al 2013 consolo et al 2017 saco et al 2007 pueyo et al 2008 thompson et al 2008 2014 thompson and katul 2009 ursino and rulli 2010 in this context the klausmeier model is certainly one of the easiest tools able to predict pattern formation in sloped semi arid environments klausmeier 1999 in its original formulation it is a two compartments model for surface water and vegetation biomass that admits an advection driven instability through which vegetated patches may form and undergo an upslope migration this latter feature has been the subject of a long debate since very few field observations on this phenomenon were reported in the literature especially due to the difficulty in performing the corresponding long time experiments the origin of the above discrepancy is believed to be attributed to the phenomenon of seed dispersal saco et al 2007 pueyo et al 2008 thompson et al 2008 2014 thompson and katul 2009 ursino and rulli 2010 van langevelde et al 2016 it is indeed known from the literature that the overall process of seed dispersal which includes the stages of mobilization transport and germination is quite critical in reproductive biology and ultimately affects the spatial organization of dryland ecosystems thompson et al 2014 in particular in sloped semi arid environments seeds generally undergo a primary isotropic dispersal from the plant to the ground followed by a secondary anisotropic dispersal due to their transport in overland flow several theoretical works have also concluded that as long as the anisotropic effects arising from secondary seed dispersal are accounted for the movement of banded vegetation may be retarded or even suppressed saco et al 2007 thompson et al 2008 thompson and katul 2009 these results have been obtained in the frameworks of saint venant equations hillerislambers et al model rietkerk et al model to cite a few where seed dispersal is treated as a short or a long range phenomenon hillerislambers et al 2001 saco et al 2007 pueyo et al 2008 thompson et al 2008 thompson and katul 2009 however to the best of our knowledge very few investigations have been addressed in the context of the klausmeier model which in its original formulation accounted for the primary dispersal but not for the secondary one klausmeier 1999 in ref siero et al 2015 for instance the authors took into account the modified version of this model by assuming that both the state variables surface water and vegetation biomass undergo diffusion and advection and studied the resilience of banded vegetation on flat and sloped terrains with this in mind in the present manuscript we consider a generalization of the original klausmeier model which simply consists in augmenting the evolution equation for the vegetation biomass with an advection term representing the downslope motion of seeds carried by surface water therefore differently from the modified version the present model ignores water diffusion since the advection contribution is generally dominant on slopes then in order to inspect the possibility of originating migrating patterns we shall deduce the threshold condition for wave instability sherratt 2005 consolo et al 2017 siero et al 2015 perumpanani et al 1995 moreover with the goal of properly characterizing such patterns we shall provide explicit expressions for the most relevant ecological quantities here involved pattern speed locus of stationary patterns and excited wavenumber analytical predictions will be corroborated by numerical simulations that also aim at elucidating the role played by initial conditions in particular by considering two distinct setups we shall trigger pattern dynamics from degradation of uniform vegetation or colonization of bare ground through these examples we shall point out how the choice of initial conditions crucially affects the propagating character of the edges of the vegetated patches and how it leads to significantly different ecological scenarios sherratt 2015 the manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the generalized klausmeier model and discuss the ecological meaning of all the quantities here involved in section 3 we investigate the local stability character of each steady state admitted by the model against spatially homogeneous and non homogeneous perturbations this study will serve as a starting point to establish which steady state may undergo the instability required to trigger non stationary patterns at the end of this section we also deduce an approximate but explicit expression for the most relevant ecological quantities characterizing the excited patterns in section 4 we introduce the numerical framework and discuss the ecological implications arising from our results some final remarks are addressed in section 5 2 the model we consider the following one dimensional advection reaction diffusion model 1 u t k 3 2 u x 2 k 8 u x k 1 w u 2 k 2 u w t k 7 w x k 4 k 5 w k 6 w u 2 where u x t and w x t represent the plant biomass and surface water density at time t and position x respectively the space variable runs along the uphill direction and all the ecological coefficients k i i 1 8 are positive quantities in detail the diffusive term k 3 2 u x 2 mimics the primary isotropic seed dispersal from the plant to the ground while the advection term k 8 u x accounts for the secondary anisotropic and short range seed dispersal due to the transport of seed biomass by overland flow it is easy to see that in the particular case k 8 0 system 1 specializes to the original klausmeier model klausmeier 1999 where the only advection term there included k 7 w x describes the downhill water flow due to the hillslope the reaction terms are unchanged with respect to the original klausmeier model klausmeier 1999 and make use of the following assumptions the per capita rate of water uptake is proportional to plant biomass the plant growth rate is proportional to water uptake the plant loss has a linear form and may include both natural and herbivory effects rainfall is included via its mean annual value in order to reduce the number of parameters involved in the model we rescale the governing equations 1 by introducing the following dimensionless variables and parameters 2 u u k 6 k 5 w w k 1 k 6 k 5 t k 5 t x x k 5 k 3 3 b k 2 k 5 a k 1 k 4 k 5 3 2 k 6 1 2 ν k 7 k 3 k 5 ψ k 8 k 3 k 5 so that we get the dimensionless system 4 u t u xx ψ u x w u 2 b u f u w w t ν w x a w w u 2 g u w where the parameters a and b are now related to rainfall and plant loss respectively while ψ and ν correspond to the advection velocities of seeds and water respectively the governing system 4 is supplemented with initial data and periodic boundary conditions moreover since advection in surface runoff is considered to be primarily responsible for seed transport downslope hereafter we assume ψ ν thompson and katul 2009 siero et al 2015 and we also consider b 2 in agreement with realistic parameter values for plant growth in semi arid environments klausmeier 1999 sherratt 2010 3 estimation of key features of pattern dynamics in this section we address linear stability analysis to estimate some key features of pattern dynamics firstly we establish the bifurcation threshold for pattern formation and then we determine the conditions under which such patterns may migrate or be stationary 3 1 uniform steady states and linear stability analysis the model 4 admits spatially homogeneous steady states e u w whose number depends upon the value of the rainfall a namely 5 for a 2 b desert state only e d 0 a for a 2 b three steady states e d e l u l b u l e r u r b u r where 6 u l a a 2 4 b 2 2 b 1 u r a a 2 4 b 2 2 b in order to inspect the local stability character of each steady state 5 under small non homogeneous perturbations we linearize the governing system 4 around e by looking for solutions of the form 7 e e e exp ω t i k x being ω the growth factor k the wavenumber and i the imaginary unit therefore inserting 7 into 4 the following complex characteristic equation for ω is obtained 8 ω 2 c 1 i k c 2 ω d 1 i k d 2 0 with 9 c 1 k 2 f u g w c 2 ν ψ d 1 f u g w f w g u k 2 g w ν ψ d 2 ν k 2 f u ψ g w where the asterisk denotes that the functions are evaluated at e and the subscripts stand for partial derivative with respect to the indicated variables as known a steady state is linearly stable if the real part of all roots of the characteristic equation are negative k this leads to the following propositions proposition 1 the desert steady state e d is always stable and in particular it behaves as a node or a focus with respect to homogeneous or non homogeneous perturbations respectively proof taking into account that 10 f u e d b 0 f w e d 0 g u e d 0 g w e d 1 0 the explicit solutions of eq 8 evaluated at e d are 11 ω 1 b k 2 i k ψ ω 2 1 i k ν which are both real and negative for k 0 stable node while have negative real part for k 0 stable focus so that e d is always a stable steady state proposition 2 the steady state e l is always unstable a saddle point with respect to both homogeneous and non homogeneous perturbations whereas e r is stable with respect to homogeneous perturbations but it can lose stability with respect to non homogeneous ones proof taking into account that 12 f u e l r b 0 f w e l r u l r 2 0 g u e l r 2 b 0 g w e l r 1 u l r 2 0 the roots of eq 8 evaluated at e l r are 13 ω 1 2 1 2 c 1 i k c 2 c 1 2 k 2 c 2 2 4 d 1 i k 4 d 2 2 c 1 c 2 which in the case of uniform perturbations k 0 reduce to 14 ω 1 2 1 2 b u l r 2 1 b u l r 2 1 2 4 b u l r 2 1 considering that u l 1 u r we may conclude that e l is always unstable with respect to both homogeneous and non homogeneous perturbations whereas e r is stable with respect to homogeneous perturbations but it can lose stability with respect to non homogeneous ones 3 2 wave instability since we are interested in the occurrence of advection driven instability giving rise to oscillating vegetation patterns sherratt 2005 consolo et al 2017 hereafter we will restrict our attention to the dynamics observed around the steady state e r which represents the only good candidate for this purpose in particular since the excited spatially periodic patterns are expected to be non stationary we search for the conditions under which the so called wave instability takes place as known in parabolic reaction diffusion systems with no advection terms wave instability requires at least three interacting species zemskov and horsthemke 2016 on the other hand in the presence of advection two species suffices to generate such an instability klausmeier 1999 sherratt 2005 consolo et al 2017 perumpanani et al 1995 therefore the non stationary patterns observed in the present work are not due to the coupling of a hopf oscillation with a stationary turing solution yang and epstein 2003 baurmann et al 2007 ricard and michler 2009 rovinsky and menzinger 1992 lacitignola et al 2015 wang and ren 2011 gambino et al 2013 mathematically speaking we thus look for solutions of the characteristic equation 8 having null real part re ω 0 and im ω 0 for some k 0 from such a requirement we obtain the following sixth order equation for k 15 α 3 k 6 α 2 k 4 α 1 k 2 α 0 0 being 16 α 3 1 u r 2 α 2 2 3 b ν ψ 2 4 b ν ψ 2 u r 2 2 u r 4 α 1 1 3 b 2 b 4 ν ψ 2 3 b 4 b ν ψ 2 3 u r 2 u r 4 u r 2 α 0 b u r 2 1 1 u r 2 b 2 consequently the bifurcation locus of the wave instability is implicitly defined by 17 27 α 0 2 α 3 2 α 1 2 α 2 2 4 α 1 3 α 3 4 α 2 3 α 0 18 α 0 α 1 α 2 α 3 0 owing to the algebraic complexity of such a locus significant information are extracted through numerical investigations in fig 1 we represent the bifurcation locus 17 in the b a parameter space for a fixed value of the slope gradient ν 182 5 and varying the seed advection speed ψ in the range 0 ν the bifurcation diagram so obtained consists of three regions the region below the line a 2b that is characterized by the absence of vegetation being the desert state e d the only steady state here admitted the intermediate area delimited by a 2b and the bifurcation locus that corresponds to the pattern forming region the area above the wave bifurcation locus where also the homogeneous vegetated state e r exists and is stable in this latter region intuitively one expects that when rainfall is sufficiently high a localized introduction of plant biomass will invade and colonize the bare ground i e large rainfall values are enough to sustain plant growth it is interesting to notice that the instability region shrinks with the increase of seed advection speed and vanishes for ψ ν i e when all seeds falling into the ground are entirely dispersed via surface runoff in other words this result suggests that the presence of secondary seed dispersal reduces the instability region in which vegetation patterns can be observed to gain additional information on how the system behaves when the model parameters are varied and in particular to check the validity of the analytical expression of the bifurcation locus 17 we now fix the slope gradient at ν 182 5 and vary the seed advection speed we then investigate the character of the roots of the characteristic polynomial 8 in correspondence of the points p 1 0 45 2 5 p 2 0 45 3 0 and p 3 0 45 3 2 marked in the b a parameter space reported in the inset of fig 1 the real and imaginary parts of the roots obtained for ψ 0 10 50 are depicted in figs 2 4 respectively in these figures the root ω 1 is denoted through solid lines whereas ω 2 through dashed lines notice that re ω 2 is always negative and its value is significantly outside the used scale so that it is not represented to improve the intelligibility of the figures the stability character is thus determined by the behavior of the root ω 1 in detail a direct inspection of fig 2 reveals that for ψ 0 there exists a range of unstable wavenumbers independently of the value we choose for the parameter a from the mathematical viewpoint these results confirm that the points p 1 p 2 and p 3 fall into the pattern forming region moreover the imaginary part associated to such unstable wavenumbers is always negative this ecological scenario characterized by the absence of secondary seed dispersal corresponds to the excitation of a non stationary vegetation pattern which migrates uphill in fact as also reported by klausmeier klausmeier 1999 if the eigenvalue which determines the instability is complex with a negative positive imaginary part the resulting patterns oscillate in time and the stripes move uphill downhill fig 3 obtained for ψ 10 shows that for a 2 5 point p 1 and a 3 0 point p 2 there exists a region of unstable wavenumbers but the corresponding imaginary parts are now positive on the contrary for a 3 2 point p 3 there are no unstable modes being the real part always negative in the former two cases the system is thus within the instability region and the behavior of the roots corresponds to the excitation of a non stationary pattern which migrates downhill in the last case the characteristic polynomial evaluated at e r has all roots with negative real parts so that the homogeneous vegetated state e r is stable so confirming that the point p 3 is outside the pattern forming region from the analysis of the results reported in fig 4 obtained for ψ 50 we notice that the setup with a 2 5 point p 1 represents the only situation in which patterns may form and migrate downhill in all other cases a 3 0 and a 3 2 the characteristic polynomial has all roots with negative real parts and indeed the points p 2 and p 3 fall outside the pattern forming region all these results confirm that the increase of secondary seed dispersal ψ reduces the region of the parameter space in which patterns can emerge and it may even reverse the direction of pattern migration 3 3 approximate locus of stationary patterns one of the most significant information extracted from the previous figures is that the sign of the imaginary part of the eigenvalue which exhibits the fastest growth rate determines the direction of band migration of course since we are in the context of linear stability analysis the previous statement is strictly valid close to the onset of instability sherratt 2005 consolo et al 2017 in the following we then aim at determining the locus of null migration velocity bearing in mind that quantitative information can be extracted in the proximity of the bifurcation locus 17 only to this goal let us recast the two roots of 8 as 18 ω 1 2 1 2 c 1 i k c 2 c 1 2 k 2 c 2 2 4 d 1 i k 4 d 2 2 c 1 c 2 whose straightforward manipulation yields 19 re ω 1 2 1 2 c 1 1 2 c 1 2 k 2 c 2 2 4 d 1 c 1 2 k 2 c 2 2 4 d 1 2 k 2 4 d 2 2 c 1 c 2 2 1 2 im ω 1 2 1 2 k c 2 1 2 4 d 1 k 2 c 2 2 c 1 2 c 1 2 k 2 c 2 2 4 d 1 2 k 2 4 d 2 2 c 1 c 2 2 1 2 for simplicity we denote such roots as 20 ω 1 γ i δ ω 2 α i β if we limit the discussion in a small range of wavenumbers centered around the mode with the fastest growth rate called k max we can safely assume γ α β ℝ as it can be verified from figs 2 4 on the other hand as mentioned before the sign of real and imaginary parts of ω 2 do not vary with k so that the dynamical behavior of the system is entirely ruled by ω 1 consequently at k max the value of im ω 1 δ will determine the migrating stationary character of patterns in particular consistently with literature klausmeier 1999 we have 21 δ k m a x 0 u p h i l l m i g r a t i n g p a t t e r n s δ k m a x 0 s t a t i o n a r y p a t t e r n s δ k m a x 0 d o w n h i l l m i g r a t i n g p a t t e r n s therefore from 8 9 20 and imposing the condition for the maximum of the growth rate d γ dk 0 after some algebraic manipulations we end up with a system of five equations in five unknowns γ δ α β k 22 k 2 α γ 1 u r 2 b ν ψ k β δ 1 u r 2 ν ψ k 2 b 1 u r 2 α γ β δ k ν k 2 b ψ 1 u r 2 α δ γ β ν ψ α γ 2 k 1 u r 2 ν ψ γ β ν ψ β δ ν k 2 b ψ 1 u r 2 α ν ψ 2 k β δ ψ δ β ν due to the complexity of this system we consider two reasonable simplifying assumptions ψ ν and β δ the first one originates from ecological arguments as it implies that only a relatively small portion of seeds that fall into the ground is transported downhill by water flow the second one is mathematically justifiable by the fact that the typical value of this dimensionless parameter ν 182 5 is generally much larger than that of any other coefficient present in the model klausmeier 1999 sherratt 2005 2010 2011 therefore if the imaginary parts β and δ given in 19 2 are evaluated at leading order in ν they result of the order of kν and 0 respectively i e they differ by at least one order of magnitude this conclusion is also consistent with the results depicted in figs 2 4 the above assumptions allow to get an approximate but explicit expression for the dimensionless pattern speed δ 23 δ β ν ψ 1 u r 2 2 β 2 2 b u r 2 ν 1 u r 2 2 β 2 from which we extract the locus of stationary patterns 24 ψ 1 u r 2 2 β 2 2 b u r 2 ν where 25 β ν 3 1 u r 2 ν 2 2 b ν u r 2 ψ 1 u r 2 2 2 ν b 1 u r 2 ψ ν u r 4 u r 2 2 3 b b 1 2 ν 4 2 ν 2 b 1 u r 2 1 u r 2 2 1 4 firstly we notice that such a locus 24 exists if and only if ψ 0 so that in the absence of secondary seed dispersal downhill migration is prevented and we retrieve the classical results obtained in the original klausmeier model that as known admits uphill migration only klausmeier 1999 moreover the locus here obtained has the advantage of being an explicit function of the model parameters a b ν and ψ and independent of the excited wavenumber k the locus of stationary bands 24 is depicted in fig 5 for ν 182 5 and for different values of seed advection speed ψ 1 0 1 5 2 5 in the figure the two differently hatched areas indicate patterns migrating uphill or downhill whereas the boundary between them represents the no migration locus as it is easy to see the pattern forming region becomes progressively dominated by the downhill motion as the parameter ψ is increased in particular for a seed advection ψ 2 5 that corresponds to a very small percentage of water advection ψ 0 01ν the instability region is almost entirely characterized by a downhill motion in other words a small seed to water advection ratio suffices to make the patterns stationary or even to reverse the direction of band propagation moreover from 22 2 it is possible to deduce the expression of the wavenumber associated to the fastest growing mode 26 k max β ν 1 u r 2 ν 2 2 b ν u r

literature results sherratt 2005 4 numerical simulations in this section we report the results of simulations arising from numerical integration of the system 4 this study has a twofold goal firstly it aims at validating the analytical results illustrated in the previous section with a particular emphasis on establishing the limit of validity of the approximated locus of stationary patterns secondly it focuses on elucidating the role played by initial conditions to achieve these purposes we integrate numerically the governing system 4 through comsol multiphysics www comsol com ver 5 3 over the domain x 0 l together with periodic boundary conditions that allow to mimic an infinite domain through the analysis of the behavior of a small section of a hillslope moreover the use of periodic boundary conditions constitutes a quite natural choice in this context since the scale of the observed patterns is small compared to the size of the computational domain lefever and lejeune 1997 klausmeier 1999 siteur et al 2014 sherratt and lord 2007 van der stelt et al 2013 dawes and williams 2015 zelnik and tzuk 2017 zelnik et al 2018 preliminarily we aim at validating numerically the results obtained analytically in the previous section as illustrative example we inspect the spatio temporal dynamics obtained by varying the seed advection speed ψ for fixed values of water advection speed ν 182 5 rainfall a 3 0 and plant loss b 0 45 representative of point p 2 in particular we observe the behavior obtained for ψ 0 10 50 in order to enable a direct comparison with results depicted in figs 2 4 c d in performing such an investigation we set the domain size to l 200 and consider as initial condition a small random perturbation of the homogeneous vegetated state e r patterns generated from such initial conditions are referred to as degradation of homogeneous vegetation dhv results shown in fig 6 reveal an excellent agreement with the analytical predictions indeed for ψ 0 the system exhibits a transition from the spatially uniform state toward a patterned state and in particular the emerging vegetation bands are spatially periodic and migrate uphill see fig 6a the observed dynamics is consistent with the results depicted in fig 2 c d being associated to the presence of an unstable mode with negative imaginary part for ψ 10 the system exhibits a transition from the spatially uniform state toward a patterned state with spatially periodic bands that migrate downhill see fig 6b this is in agreement with results depicted in fig 3 c d because of the presence of an unstable mode with positive imaginary part finally for ψ 50 after a given transient the system relaxes towards the spatially uniform steady state see fig 6c in accordance with the absence of unstable modes as in fig 4 c d let us now address a different investigation in which we analyze the pattern generation from different initial conditions in particular we aim at comparing patterns originated from the above mentioned degradation of homogeneous vegetation dhv with those arising from the so called colonization of bare ground cbg in this latter case surface water is assumed to be initially distributed homogeneously over the entire domain whereas vegetation biomass is at its steady state value within a limited region of arbitrary width and is absent outside it as widely discussed by sherratt 2015 the choice of initial conditions is crucial as it may give rise to significantly different ecological scenarios in fact pattern dynamics originated from these initial conditions may provide information on the direct or inverse relationship between pattern wavelength and ground surface slope that in turn may be used to infer the historical origin of semiarid vegetation bands here we show that the initial conditions also affect the behavior of both edges of a vegetated patch as the model parameters b a are varied to perform such an analysis we now keep the advection speeds constant at the values ν 182 5 and ψ 1 whereas the domain size is set to l 600 moreover we numerically implement the initial conditions corresponding to cbg as follows 27 u x 0 u r for x 50 250 0 for x 50 250 w x 0 a for x 0 600 it is worth noting that pattern formation originated from dhv is expected to be in accordance with analytical predictions at least close to the bifurcation threshold where patterns are characterized by small amplitude this agreement arises from the fact that in both analytical and numerical approaches a small perturbation of the steady state is applied on the contrary in the cbg case numerical results are not easily predictable since the associated nonlinear invasion problem is quite difficult to be treated analytically as it involves a transition between two locally stable states sherratt 2015 alzahrani et al 2012 let us then analyze the spatio temporal pattern dynamics resulting from numerical simulations using the two proposed initial conditions in figs 7 and 8 we show the results obtained in the cases dhv and cbg respectively in these figures the rainfall parameter is fixed at a 1 whereas the plant loss is set at b 0 4 figures a or b 0 2 figures c in order to explore the behavior within the regions of uphill or downhill motion respectively for what concerns figures b we have chosen b 0 32 for dhv and b 0 26 for cbg since the loci of stationary patterns obtained numerically in the two cases are different results depicted in fig 7 reveal clearly that in the dhv case all vegetation bands exhibit the same direction of propagation or are all stationary independently of the parameter values moreover from 25 the expected value of the pattern wavelength λ 2π k max 50 15 is in excellent agreement with the numerical one λ 51 so further validating the analytical predictions a different scenario is revealed in the cbg setup in this case comparing the different patterns obtained as the plant loss is varied the only common feature is the uphill motion of the top edge of the initial vegetation patch see fig 8 this result is of course consistent with the presence of a larger soil moisture in the proximity of the top part of the pattern which creates the tendency of uphill migration independently of the plant loss value sherratt 2005 consolo et al 2017 the behavior of the bottom edge of the patch constitutes another significant information extracted from fig 8 in detail for b 0 4 the bottom edge of the patch moves uphill too see fig 8 a this means that for a fixed value of rainfall and provided that the strength of the secondary seed dispersal is not so relevant the considered value of plant mortality is large enough to prevent the seeds from germinating along the bottom side of the pattern despite this apparent analogy with the dhv case the cbg setup yields an excited wavelength that is roughly three times larger in contrast for b 0 2 the bottom edge of the patch moves downhill see fig 8 c this implies that the smaller value of mortality now favors the growth of vegetation even along the downhill direction numerical simulations indeed reveal that even a small percentage of seeds transported downslope by surface runoff suffices to create such a tendency of patterns to migrate downhill the last interesting case involves dynamics obtained for an intermediate value of plant loss b 0 26 that makes the only bottom edge of the pattern stationary see fig 8 b hence when reducing the plant loss value the lower edge of the vegetation patch experiences a reversal of the direction of motion from uphill to downhill while the top edge continues moving uphill in other words patterns generated from cbg can never be entirely stationary and the only feature controllable by model parameters is the direction of propagation of the lower edge of the patch in the literature the condition under which an extremum of a traveling wave may change direction of propagation and becomes stationary is referred to as maxwell point sherratt 2015 the occurrence of such a maxwell point may have some ecological grounds since it combines two competing effects on the one hand as known bare soils and vegetated patches are characterized by different infiltration rates and this creates higher levels of moisture at the uphill edge of the band which as said favors the tendency of patterns to migrate uphill on the other hand the presence of secondary seed dispersal favors accumulation of seeds and the consequent preferential growth of vegetation at the downslope edge of vegetated patches therefore the downslope seed transport acts as a stabilizing mechanism that justifies the low rates or even the absence of upslope migration of vegetation bands reported experimentally saco et al 2007 thompson and katul 2009 thompson et al 2014 the occurrence of a downslope movement of vegetation bands has not been observed so far so that from the theoretical viewpoint it should be treated with caution indeed some previous works suggest to interpret the regions of the parameter space in which such a phenomenon takes place as a regime in which pattern migration is precluded thompson and katul 2009 for the sake of completeness it should be remarked that the above mentioned competing dynamics become mutually exclusive when patterns are generated from dhv in fact in this case the control parameters may only determine the common direction of band propagation and select which of those effects really takes place let us finally analyze the bifurcation diagrams obtained in the two investigated cases they are depicted in fig 9 a and b for dhv and cbg respectively in both figures the pattern forming region is delimited by the black line and the red curve representative of the condition a 2b and the wave bifurcation locus 17 respectively the approximated locus of stationary patterns deduced analytically in 24 is here denoted by a dashed green curve in fig 9 a the dotted blue curve denotes the locus of stationary patterns obtained numerically in the dhv case as one can see a quantitative agreement is found close to the bifurcation threshold the agreement becomes just qualitative away from the onset consistently with the fact that linear stability analysis cannot predict the dynamical behavior far from the instability threshold where patterns have non negligible amplitude in fig 9 b the dotted blue curve represents the locus of maxwell points in the cbg case this locus is numerically deduced by monitoring the position of the downhill edge of the vegetated patch located initially at x 50 at the final stage of simulation t 100 in such a procedure we set a numerical tolerance to 1 moreover we span the pattern forming region in the b a parameter space through a rectangular computational grid as fine as 0 01 0 02 as expected there is no quantitative agreement with analytical results even close to the bifurcation threshold and a poor qualitative agreement holds everywhere however the trend exhibited by this curve for small values of the rainfall parameter about a 3 is quite similar to the one obtained in the dhv case so that a certain degree of similarity between the two cases may be still retrieved 5 final remarks in this paper we have considered a generalization of the original klausmeier model to account for the effects of secondary seed dispersal on the dynamics of vegetation patterns in sloped semi arid environments using standard tools of linear stability analysis we have established the character of the spatially homogeneous steady states and derived the conditions for the occurrence of wave instability that is generally associated to the formation of non stationary patterns moreover we have deduced analytically the approximated expressions for the pattern speed the locus of stationary patterns and the excited wavenumber these expressions which are strictly valid close to the bifurcation threshold bring the advantage of depending explicitly on the model parameters only the most relevant results arising from our analytical calculations are i the pattern forming region shrinks as the seed advection speed increases and it disappears as the advection speeds of seed and water become equal to each other ii stationary patterns may only exist in the presence of secondary seed dispersal so that in its absence patterns may only migrate uphill iii a small percentage of seed transport by overland flow suffices to create the tendency of patterns to migrate downhill the analytical results so obtained have been validated through numerical simulations carried out by considering two sets of initial conditions that give rise to vegetation patterns from degradation of homogeneous vegetation dhv or colonization of bare ground cbg in the former case the analytically deduced locus of stationary patterns agrees qualitatively with the one obtained numerically and they are even in quantitative agreement close to bifurcation threshold as expected on the other hand due to the intrinsic nonlinear nature of the problem associated to the cbg setup only a poor qualitative agreement with analytical results holds everywhere the use of different initial conditions has allowed to extract additional information useful from the ecological viewpoint in particular our simulations clearly indicate that the proper choice of initial conditions becomes crucial for the characterization of patterned vegetation dynamics among the most relevant numerical results we have found that when patterns are generated from dhv vegetation bands move together in the same direction uphill or downhill or are all stationary in contrast when patterns originate from cbg the top edge of the vegetation patch moves always uphill whereas the lower edge may reverse its direction of propagation according to the values of control parameters our numerical experiments thus point out that overland flow and seed dispersal influence vegetation establishment and patch dynamics in particular these results confirm that the downslope seed transport in overland flow has a stabilizing effect and may be used to properly characterize the observed low migration rates or even the absence of a net motion of vegetation bands sherratt 2015 bochet 2015 saco et al 2007 thompson and katul 2009 the

25064,the effects of secondary seed dispersal on the dynamics of banded vegetation are investigated in the framework of a generalized version of one of the easiest tools for the description of pattern formation along the hillsides of semi arid environments the klausmeier model the generalization here considered consists in augmenting the evolution equation for the vegetation biomass with an advection term mimicking the anisotropic dispersal of seeds by overland flow linear stability analysis is used to deduce the threshold condition for the occurrence of wave instability as well as to obtain approximated explicit expressions for some key quantities pattern speed locus of stationary patterns and excited wavenumber the generalized model is also integrated numerically considering two different sets of initial conditions that yield pattern dynamics originating from degradation of uniform vegetation or colonization of bare ground these numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the analytical predictions to characterize more deeply the propagating character of the edges of vegetation patches and to emphasize how distinct initial conditions may lead to significantly different ecological scenarios keywords wave instability non stationary vegetation patterns primary and secondary seed dispersal linear stability analysis maxwell points 1 introduction in many semi arid environments vegetation along hillsides is spatially self organized in regular patches with suitable and unsuitable sites for establishment a lot of theoretical efforts have been spent to develop analytical and numerical tools capable to predict the transitions that such ecosystems may experience in particular a relevant body of research focuses on the modeling of those complex phenomena that contribute to the formation modulation resilience and propagation of vegetation patterns lefever and lejeune 1997 klausmeier 1999 rietkerk et al 2000 tongway et al 2001 hillerislambers et al 2001 sherratt 2005 2010 2011 2015 rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 deblauwe et al 2008 2011 siteur et al 2014 bochet 2015 penny et al 2013 consolo et al 2017 saco et al 2007 pueyo et al 2008 thompson et al 2008 2014 thompson and katul 2009 ursino and rulli 2010 in this context the klausmeier model is certainly one of the easiest tools able to predict pattern formation in sloped semi arid environments klausmeier 1999 in its original formulation it is a two compartments model for surface water and vegetation biomass that admits an advection driven instability through which vegetated patches may form and undergo an upslope migration this latter feature has been the subject of a long debate since very few field observations on this phenomenon were reported in the literature especially due to the difficulty in performing the corresponding long time experiments the origin of the above discrepancy is believed to be attributed to the phenomenon of seed dispersal saco et al 2007 pueyo et al 2008 thompson et al 2008 2014 thompson and katul 2009 ursino and rulli 2010 van langevelde et al 2016 it is indeed known from the literature that the overall process of seed dispersal which includes the stages of mobilization transport and germination is quite critical in reproductive biology and ultimately affects the spatial organization of dryland ecosystems thompson et al 2014 in particular in sloped semi arid environments seeds generally undergo a primary isotropic dispersal from the plant to the ground followed by a secondary anisotropic dispersal due to their transport in overland flow several theoretical works have also concluded that as long as the anisotropic effects arising from secondary seed dispersal are accounted for the movement of banded vegetation may be retarded or even suppressed saco et al 2007 thompson et al 2008 thompson and katul 2009 these results have been obtained in the frameworks of saint venant equations hillerislambers et al model rietkerk et al model to cite a few where seed dispersal is treated as a short or a long range phenomenon hillerislambers et al 2001 saco et al 2007 pueyo et al 2008 thompson et al 2008 thompson and katul 2009 however to the best of our knowledge very few investigations have been addressed in the context of the klausmeier model which in its original formulation accounted for the primary dispersal but not for the secondary one klausmeier 1999 in ref siero et al 2015 for instance the authors took into account the modified version of this model by assuming that both the state variables surface water and vegetation biomass undergo diffusion and advection and studied the resilience of banded vegetation on flat and sloped terrains with this in mind in the present manuscript we consider a generalization of the original klausmeier model which simply consists in augmenting the evolution equation for the vegetation biomass with an advection term representing the downslope motion of seeds carried by surface water therefore differently from the modified version the present model ignores water diffusion since the advection contribution is generally dominant on slopes then in order to inspect the possibility of originating migrating patterns we shall deduce the threshold condition for wave instability sherratt 2005 consolo et al 2017 siero et al 2015 perumpanani et al 1995 moreover with the goal of properly characterizing such patterns we shall provide explicit expressions for the most relevant ecological quantities here involved pattern speed locus of stationary patterns and excited wavenumber analytical predictions will be corroborated by numerical simulations that also aim at elucidating the role played by initial conditions in particular by considering two distinct setups we shall trigger pattern dynamics from degradation of uniform vegetation or colonization of bare ground through these examples we shall point out how the choice of initial conditions crucially affects the propagating character of the edges of the vegetated patches and how it leads to significantly different ecological scenarios sherratt 2015 the manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the generalized klausmeier model and discuss the ecological meaning of all the quantities here involved in section 3 we investigate the local stability character of each steady state admitted by the model against spatially homogeneous and non homogeneous perturbations this study will serve as a starting point to establish which steady state may undergo the instability required to trigger non stationary patterns at the end of this section we also deduce an approximate but explicit expression for the most relevant ecological quantities characterizing the excited patterns in section 4 we introduce the numerical framework and discuss the ecological implications arising from our results some final remarks are addressed in section 5 2 the model we consider the following one dimensional advection reaction diffusion model 1 u t k 3 2 u x 2 k 8 u x k 1 w u 2 k 2 u w t k 7 w x k 4 k 5 w k 6 w u 2 where u x t and w x t represent the plant biomass and surface water density at time t and position x respectively the space variable runs along the uphill direction and all the ecological coefficients k i i 1 8 are positive quantities in detail the diffusive term k 3 2 u x 2 mimics the primary isotropic seed dispersal from the plant to the ground while the advection term k 8 u x accounts for the secondary anisotropic and short range seed dispersal due to the transport of seed biomass by overland flow it is easy to see that in the particular case k 8 0 system 1 specializes to the original klausmeier model klausmeier 1999 where the only advection term there included k 7 w x describes the downhill water flow due to the hillslope the reaction terms are unchanged with respect to the original klausmeier model klausmeier 1999 and make use of the following assumptions the per capita rate of water uptake is proportional to plant biomass the plant growth rate is proportional to water uptake the plant loss has a linear form and may include both natural and herbivory effects rainfall is included via its mean annual value in order to reduce the number of parameters involved in the model we rescale the governing equations 1 by introducing the following dimensionless variables and parameters 2 u u k 6 k 5 w w k 1 k 6 k 5 t k 5 t x x k 5 k 3 3 b k 2 k 5 a k 1 k 4 k 5 3 2 k 6 1 2 ν k 7 k 3 k 5 ψ k 8 k 3 k 5 so that we get the dimensionless system 4 u t u xx ψ u x w u 2 b u f u w w t ν w x a w w u 2 g u w where the parameters a and b are now related to rainfall and plant loss respectively while ψ and ν correspond to the advection velocities of seeds and water respectively the governing system 4 is supplemented with initial data and periodic boundary conditions moreover since advection in surface runoff is considered to be primarily responsible for seed transport downslope hereafter we assume ψ ν thompson and katul 2009 siero et al 2015 and we also consider b 2 in agreement with realistic parameter values for plant growth in semi arid environments klausmeier 1999 sherratt 2010 3 estimation of key features of pattern dynamics in this section we address linear stability analysis to estimate some key features of pattern dynamics firstly we establish the bifurcation threshold for pattern formation and then we determine the conditions under which such patterns may migrate or be stationary 3 1 uniform steady states and linear stability analysis the model 4 admits spatially homogeneous steady states e u w whose number depends upon the value of the rainfall a namely 5 for a 2 b desert state only e d 0 a for a 2 b three steady states e d e l u l b u l e r u r b u r where 6 u l a a 2 4 b 2 2 b 1 u r a a 2 4 b 2 2 b in order to inspect the local stability character of each steady state 5 under small non homogeneous perturbations we linearize the governing system 4 around e by looking for solutions of the form 7 e e e exp ω t i k x being ω the growth factor k the wavenumber and i the imaginary unit therefore inserting 7 into 4 the following complex characteristic equation for ω is obtained 8 ω 2 c 1 i k c 2 ω d 1 i k d 2 0 with 9 c 1 k 2 f u g w c 2 ν ψ d 1 f u g w f w g u k 2 g w ν ψ d 2 ν k 2 f u ψ g w where the asterisk denotes that the functions are evaluated at e and the subscripts stand for partial derivative with respect to the indicated variables as known a steady state is linearly stable if the real part of all roots of the characteristic equation are negative k this leads to the following propositions proposition 1 the desert steady state e d is always stable and in particular it behaves as a node or a focus with respect to homogeneous or non homogeneous perturbations respectively proof taking into account that 10 f u e d b 0 f w e d 0 g u e d 0 g w e d 1 0 the explicit solutions of eq 8 evaluated at e d are 11 ω 1 b k 2 i k ψ ω 2 1 i k ν which are both real and negative for k 0 stable node while have negative real part for k 0 stable focus so that e d is always a stable steady state proposition 2 the steady state e l is always unstable a saddle point with respect to both homogeneous and non homogeneous perturbations whereas e r is stable with respect to homogeneous perturbations but it can lose stability with respect to non homogeneous ones proof taking into account that 12 f u e l r b 0 f w e l r u l r 2 0 g u e l r 2 b 0 g w e l r 1 u l r 2 0 the roots of eq 8 evaluated at e l r are 13 ω 1 2 1 2 c 1 i k c 2 c 1 2 k 2 c 2 2 4 d 1 i k 4 d 2 2 c 1 c 2 which in the case of uniform perturbations k 0 reduce to 14 ω 1 2 1 2 b u l r 2 1 b u l r 2 1 2 4 b u l r 2 1 considering that u l 1 u r we may conclude that e l is always unstable with respect to both homogeneous and non homogeneous perturbations whereas e r is stable with respect to homogeneous perturbations but it can lose stability with respect to non homogeneous ones 3 2 wave instability since we are interested in the occurrence of advection driven instability giving rise to oscillating vegetation patterns sherratt 2005 consolo et al 2017 hereafter we will restrict our attention to the dynamics observed around the steady state e r which represents the only good candidate for this purpose in particular since the excited spatially periodic patterns are expected to be non stationary we search for the conditions under which the so called wave instability takes place as known in parabolic reaction diffusion systems with no advection terms wave instability requires at least three interacting species zemskov and horsthemke 2016 on the other hand in the presence of advection two species suffices to generate such an instability klausmeier 1999 sherratt 2005 consolo et al 2017 perumpanani et al 1995 therefore the non stationary patterns observed in the present work are not due to the coupling of a hopf oscillation with a stationary turing solution yang and epstein 2003 baurmann et al 2007 ricard and michler 2009 rovinsky and menzinger 1992 lacitignola et al 2015 wang and ren 2011 gambino et al 2013 mathematically speaking we thus look for solutions of the characteristic equation 8 having null real part re ω 0 and im ω 0 for some k 0 from such a requirement we obtain the following sixth order equation for k 15 α 3 k 6 α 2 k 4 α 1 k 2 α 0 0 being 16 α 3 1 u r 2 α 2 2 3 b ν ψ 2 4 b ν ψ 2 u r 2 2 u r 4 α 1 1 3 b 2 b 4 ν ψ 2 3 b 4 b ν ψ 2 3 u r 2 u r 4 u r 2 α 0 b u r 2 1 1 u r 2 b 2 consequently the bifurcation locus of the wave instability is implicitly defined by 17 27 α 0 2 α 3 2 α 1 2 α 2 2 4 α 1 3 α 3 4 α 2 3 α 0 18 α 0 α 1 α 2 α 3 0 owing to the algebraic complexity of such a locus significant information are extracted through numerical investigations in fig 1 we represent the bifurcation locus 17 in the b a parameter space for a fixed value of the slope gradient ν 182 5 and varying the seed advection speed ψ in the range 0 ν the bifurcation diagram so obtained consists of three regions the region below the line a 2b that is characterized by the absence of vegetation being the desert state e d the only steady state here admitted the intermediate area delimited by a 2b and the bifurcation locus that corresponds to the pattern forming region the area above the wave bifurcation locus where also the homogeneous vegetated state e r exists and is stable in this latter region intuitively one expects that when rainfall is sufficiently high a localized introduction of plant biomass will invade and colonize the bare ground i e large rainfall values are enough to sustain plant growth it is interesting to notice that the instability region shrinks with the increase of seed advection speed and vanishes for ψ ν i e when all seeds falling into the ground are entirely dispersed via surface runoff in other words this result suggests that the presence of secondary seed dispersal reduces the instability region in which vegetation patterns can be observed to gain additional information on how the system behaves when the model parameters are varied and in particular to check the validity of the analytical expression of the bifurcation locus 17 we now fix the slope gradient at ν 182 5 and vary the seed advection speed we then investigate the character of the roots of the characteristic polynomial 8 in correspondence of the points p 1 0 45 2 5 p 2 0 45 3 0 and p 3 0 45 3 2 marked in the b a parameter space reported in the inset of fig 1 the real and imaginary parts of the roots obtained for ψ 0 10 50 are depicted in figs 2 4 respectively in these figures the root ω 1 is denoted through solid lines whereas ω 2 through dashed lines notice that re ω 2 is always negative and its value is significantly outside the used scale so that it is not represented to improve the intelligibility of the figures the stability character is thus determined by the behavior of the root ω 1 in detail a direct inspection of fig 2 reveals that for ψ 0 there exists a range of unstable wavenumbers independently of the value we choose for the parameter a from the mathematical viewpoint these results confirm that the points p 1 p 2 and p 3 fall into the pattern forming region moreover the imaginary part associated to such unstable wavenumbers is always negative this ecological scenario characterized by the absence of secondary seed dispersal corresponds to the excitation of a non stationary vegetation pattern which migrates uphill in fact as also reported by klausmeier klausmeier 1999 if the eigenvalue which determines the instability is complex with a negative positive imaginary part the resulting patterns oscillate in time and the stripes move uphill downhill fig 3 obtained for ψ 10 shows that for a 2 5 point p 1 and a 3 0 point p 2 there exists a region of unstable wavenumbers but the corresponding imaginary parts are now positive on the contrary for a 3 2 point p 3 there are no unstable modes being the real part always negative in the former two cases the system is thus within the instability region and the behavior of the roots corresponds to the excitation of a non stationary pattern which migrates downhill in the last case the characteristic polynomial evaluated at e r has all roots with negative real parts so that the homogeneous vegetated state e r is stable so confirming that the point p 3 is outside the pattern forming region from the analysis of the results reported in fig 4 obtained for ψ 50 we notice that the setup with a 2 5 point p 1 represents the only situation in which patterns may form and migrate downhill in all other cases a 3 0 and a 3 2 the characteristic polynomial has all roots with negative real parts and indeed the points p 2 and p 3 fall outside the pattern forming region all these results confirm that the increase of secondary seed dispersal ψ reduces the region of the parameter space in which patterns can emerge and it may even reverse the direction of pattern migration 3 3 approximate locus of stationary patterns one of the most significant information extracted from the previous figures is that the sign of the imaginary part of the eigenvalue which exhibits the fastest growth rate determines the direction of band migration of course since we are in the context of linear stability analysis the previous statement is strictly valid close to the onset of instability sherratt 2005 consolo et al 2017 in the following we then aim at determining the locus of null migration velocity bearing in mind that quantitative information can be extracted in the proximity of the bifurcation locus 17 only to this goal let us recast the two roots of 8 as 18 ω 1 2 1 2 c 1 i k c 2 c 1 2 k 2 c 2 2 4 d 1 i k 4 d 2 2 c 1 c 2 whose straightforward manipulation yields 19 re ω 1 2 1 2 c 1 1 2 c 1 2 k 2 c 2 2 4 d 1 c 1 2 k 2 c 2 2 4 d 1 2 k 2 4 d 2 2 c 1 c 2 2 1 2 im ω 1 2 1 2 k c 2 1 2 4 d 1 k 2 c 2 2 c 1 2 c 1 2 k 2 c 2 2 4 d 1 2 k 2 4 d 2 2 c 1 c 2 2 1 2 for simplicity we denote such roots as 20 ω 1 γ i δ ω 2 α i β if we limit the discussion in a small range of wavenumbers centered around the mode with the fastest growth rate called k max we can safely assume γ α β ℝ as it can be verified from figs 2 4 on the other hand as mentioned before the sign of real and imaginary parts of ω 2 do not vary with k so that the dynamical behavior of the system is entirely ruled by ω 1 consequently at k max the value of im ω 1 δ will determine the migrating stationary character of patterns in particular consistently with literature klausmeier 1999 we have 21 δ k m a x 0 u p h i l l m i g r a t i n g p a t t e r n s δ k m a x 0 s t a t i o n a r y p a t t e r n s δ k m a x 0 d o w n h i l l m i g r a t i n g p a t t e r n s therefore from 8 9 20 and imposing the condition for the maximum of the growth rate d γ dk 0 after some algebraic manipulations we end up with a system of five equations in five unknowns γ δ α β k 22 k 2 α γ 1 u r 2 b ν ψ k β δ 1 u r 2 ν ψ k 2 b 1 u r 2 α γ β δ k ν k 2 b ψ 1 u r 2 α δ γ β ν ψ α γ 2 k 1 u r 2 ν ψ γ β ν ψ β δ ν k 2 b ψ 1 u r 2 α ν ψ 2 k β δ ψ δ β ν due to the complexity of this system we consider two reasonable simplifying assumptions ψ ν and β δ the first one originates from ecological arguments as it implies that only a relatively small portion of seeds that fall into the ground is transported downhill by water flow the second one is mathematically justifiable by the fact that the typical value of this dimensionless parameter ν 182 5 is generally much larger than that of any other coefficient present in the model klausmeier 1999 sherratt 2005 2010 2011 therefore if the imaginary parts β and δ given in 19 2 are evaluated at leading order in ν they result of the order of kν and 0 respectively i e they differ by at least one order of magnitude this conclusion is also consistent with the results depicted in figs 2 4 the above assumptions allow to get an approximate but explicit expression for the dimensionless pattern speed δ 23 δ β ν ψ 1 u r 2 2 β 2 2 b u r 2 ν 1 u r 2 2 β 2 from which we extract the locus of stationary patterns 24 ψ 1 u r 2 2 β 2 2 b u r 2 ν where 25 β ν 3 1 u r 2 ν 2 2 b ν u r 2 ψ 1 u r 2 2 2 ν b 1 u r 2 ψ ν u r 4 u r 2 2 3 b b 1 2 ν 4 2 ν 2 b 1 u r 2 1 u r 2 2 1 4 firstly we notice that such a locus 24 exists if and only if ψ 0 so that in the absence of secondary seed dispersal downhill migration is prevented and we retrieve the classical results obtained in the original klausmeier model that as known admits uphill migration only klausmeier 1999 moreover the locus here obtained has the advantage of being an explicit function of the model parameters a b ν and ψ and independent of the excited wavenumber k the locus of stationary bands 24 is depicted in fig 5 for ν 182 5 and for different values of seed advection speed ψ 1 0 1 5 2 5 in the figure the two differently hatched areas indicate patterns migrating uphill or downhill whereas the boundary between them represents the no migration locus as it is easy to see the pattern forming region becomes progressively dominated by the downhill motion as the parameter ψ is increased in particular for a seed advection ψ 2 5 that corresponds to a very small percentage of water advection ψ 0 01ν the instability region is almost entirely characterized by a downhill motion in other words a small seed to water advection ratio suffices to make the patterns stationary or even to reverse the direction of band propagation moreover from 22 2 it is possible to deduce the expression of the wavenumber associated to the fastest growing mode 26 k max β ν 1 u r 2 ν 2 2 b ν u r

literature results sherratt 2005 4 numerical simulations in this section we report the results of simulations arising from numerical integration of the system 4 this study has a twofold goal firstly it aims at validating the analytical results illustrated in the previous section with a particular emphasis on establishing the limit of validity of the approximated locus of stationary patterns secondly it focuses on elucidating the role played by initial conditions to achieve these purposes we integrate numerically the governing system 4 through comsol multiphysics www comsol com ver 5 3 over the domain x 0 l together with periodic boundary conditions that allow to mimic an infinite domain through the analysis of the behavior of a small section of a hillslope moreover the use of periodic boundary conditions constitutes a quite natural choice in this context since the scale of the observed patterns is small compared to the size of the computational domain lefever and lejeune 1997 klausmeier 1999 siteur et al 2014 sherratt and lord 2007 van der stelt et al 2013 dawes and williams 2015 zelnik and tzuk 2017 zelnik et al 2018 preliminarily we aim at validating numerically the results obtained analytically in the previous section as illustrative example we inspect the spatio temporal dynamics obtained by varying the seed advection speed ψ for fixed values of water advection speed ν 182 5 rainfall a 3 0 and plant loss b 0 45 representative of point p 2 in particular we observe the behavior obtained for ψ 0 10 50 in order to enable a direct comparison with results depicted in figs 2 4 c d in performing such an investigation we set the domain size to l 200 and consider as initial condition a small random perturbation of the homogeneous vegetated state e r patterns generated from such initial conditions are referred to as degradation of homogeneous vegetation dhv results shown in fig 6 reveal an excellent agreement with the analytical predictions indeed for ψ 0 the system exhibits a transition from the spatially uniform state toward a patterned state and in particular the emerging vegetation bands are spatially periodic and migrate uphill see fig 6a the observed dynamics is consistent with the results depicted in fig 2 c d being associated to the presence of an unstable mode with negative imaginary part for ψ 10 the system exhibits a transition from the spatially uniform state toward a patterned state with spatially periodic bands that migrate downhill see fig 6b this is in agreement with results depicted in fig 3 c d because of the presence of an unstable mode with positive imaginary part finally for ψ 50 after a given transient the system relaxes towards the spatially uniform steady state see fig 6c in accordance with the absence of unstable modes as in fig 4 c d let us now address a different investigation in which we analyze the pattern generation from different initial conditions in particular we aim at comparing patterns originated from the above mentioned degradation of homogeneous vegetation dhv with those arising from the so called colonization of bare ground cbg in this latter case surface water is assumed to be initially distributed homogeneously over the entire domain whereas vegetation biomass is at its steady state value within a limited region of arbitrary width and is absent outside it as widely discussed by sherratt 2015 the choice of initial conditions is crucial as it may give rise to significantly different ecological scenarios in fact pattern dynamics originated from these initial conditions may provide information on the direct or inverse relationship between pattern wavelength and ground surface slope that in turn may be used to infer the historical origin of semiarid vegetation bands here we show that the initial conditions also affect the behavior of both edges of a vegetated patch as the model parameters b a are varied to perform such an analysis we now keep the advection speeds constant at the values ν 182 5 and ψ 1 whereas the domain size is set to l 600 moreover we numerically implement the initial conditions corresponding to cbg as follows 27 u x 0 u r for x 50 250 0 for x 50 250 w x 0 a for x 0 600 it is worth noting that pattern formation originated from dhv is expected to be in accordance with analytical predictions at least close to the bifurcation threshold where patterns are characterized by small amplitude this agreement arises from the fact that in both analytical and numerical approaches a small perturbation of the steady state is applied on the contrary in the cbg case numerical results are not easily predictable since the associated nonlinear invasion problem is quite difficult to be treated analytically as it involves a transition between two locally stable states sherratt 2015 alzahrani et al 2012 let us then analyze the spatio temporal pattern dynamics resulting from numerical simulations using the two proposed initial conditions in figs 7 and 8 we show the results obtained in the cases dhv and cbg respectively in these figures the rainfall parameter is fixed at a 1 whereas the plant loss is set at b 0 4 figures a or b 0 2 figures c in order to explore the behavior within the regions of uphill or downhill motion respectively for what concerns figures b we have chosen b 0 32 for dhv and b 0 26 for cbg since the loci of stationary patterns obtained numerically in the two cases are different results depicted in fig 7 reveal clearly that in the dhv case all vegetation bands exhibit the same direction of propagation or are all stationary independently of the parameter values moreover from 25 the expected value of the pattern wavelength λ 2π k max 50 15 is in excellent agreement with the numerical one λ 51 so further validating the analytical predictions a different scenario is revealed in the cbg setup in this case comparing the different patterns obtained as the plant loss is varied the only common feature is the uphill motion of the top edge of the initial vegetation patch see fig 8 this result is of course consistent with the presence of a larger soil moisture in the proximity of the top part of the pattern which creates the tendency of uphill migration independently of the plant loss value sherratt 2005 consolo et al 2017 the behavior of the bottom edge of the patch constitutes another significant information extracted from fig 8 in detail for b 0 4 the bottom edge of the patch moves uphill too see fig 8 a this means that for a fixed value of rainfall and provided that the strength of the secondary seed dispersal is not so relevant the considered value of plant mortality is large enough to prevent the seeds from germinating along the bottom side of the pattern despite this apparent analogy with the dhv case the cbg setup yields an excited wavelength that is roughly three times larger in contrast for b 0 2 the bottom edge of the patch moves downhill see fig 8 c this implies that the smaller value of mortality now favors the growth of vegetation even along the downhill direction numerical simulations indeed reveal that even a small percentage of seeds transported downslope by surface runoff suffices to create such a tendency of patterns to migrate downhill the last interesting case involves dynamics obtained for an intermediate value of plant loss b 0 26 that makes the only bottom edge of the pattern stationary see fig 8 b hence when reducing the plant loss value the lower edge of the vegetation patch experiences a reversal of the direction of motion from uphill to downhill while the top edge continues moving uphill in other words patterns generated from cbg can never be entirely stationary and the only feature controllable by model parameters is the direction of propagation of the lower edge of the patch in the literature the condition under which an extremum of a traveling wave may change direction of propagation and becomes stationary is referred to as maxwell point sherratt 2015 the occurrence of such a maxwell point may have some ecological grounds since it combines two competing effects on the one hand as known bare soils and vegetated patches are characterized by different infiltration rates and this creates higher levels of moisture at the uphill edge of the band which as said favors the tendency of patterns to migrate uphill on the other hand the presence of secondary seed dispersal favors accumulation of seeds and the consequent preferential growth of vegetation at the downslope edge of vegetated patches therefore the downslope seed transport acts as a stabilizing mechanism that justifies the low rates or even the absence of upslope migration of vegetation bands reported experimentally saco et al 2007 thompson and katul 2009 thompson et al 2014 the occurrence of a downslope movement of vegetation bands has not been observed so far so that from the theoretical viewpoint it should be treated with caution indeed some previous works suggest to interpret the regions of the parameter space in which such a phenomenon takes place as a regime in which pattern migration is precluded thompson and katul 2009 for the sake of completeness it should be remarked that the above mentioned competing dynamics become mutually exclusive when patterns are generated from dhv in fact in this case the control parameters may only determine the common direction of band propagation and select which of those effects really takes place let us finally analyze the bifurcation diagrams obtained in the two investigated cases they are depicted in fig 9 a and b for dhv and cbg respectively in both figures the pattern forming region is delimited by the black line and the red curve representative of the condition a 2b and the wave bifurcation locus 17 respectively the approximated locus of stationary patterns deduced analytically in 24 is here denoted by a dashed green curve in fig 9 a the dotted blue curve denotes the locus of stationary patterns obtained numerically in the dhv case as one can see a quantitative agreement is found close to the bifurcation threshold the agreement becomes just qualitative away from the onset consistently with the fact that linear stability analysis cannot predict the dynamical behavior far from the instability threshold where patterns have non negligible amplitude in fig 9 b the dotted blue curve represents the locus of maxwell points in the cbg case this locus is numerically deduced by monitoring the position of the downhill edge of the vegetated patch located initially at x 50 at the final stage of simulation t 100 in such a procedure we set a numerical tolerance to 1 moreover we span the pattern forming region in the b a parameter space through a rectangular computational grid as fine as 0 01 0 02 as expected there is no quantitative agreement with analytical results even close to the bifurcation threshold and a poor qualitative agreement holds everywhere however the trend exhibited by this curve for small values of the rainfall parameter about a 3 is quite similar to the one obtained in the dhv case so that a certain degree of similarity between the two cases may be still retrieved 5 final remarks in this paper we have considered a generalization of the original klausmeier model to account for the effects of secondary seed dispersal on the dynamics of vegetation patterns in sloped semi arid environments using standard tools of linear stability analysis we have established the character of the spatially homogeneous steady states and derived the conditions for the occurrence of wave instability that is generally associated to the formation of non stationary patterns moreover we have deduced analytically the approximated expressions for the pattern speed the locus of stationary patterns and the excited wavenumber these expressions which are strictly valid close to the bifurcation threshold bring the advantage of depending explicitly on the model parameters only the most relevant results arising from our analytical calculations are i the pattern forming region shrinks as the seed advection speed increases and it disappears as the advection speeds of seed and water become equal to each other ii stationary patterns may only exist in the presence of secondary seed dispersal so that in its absence patterns may only migrate uphill iii a small percentage of seed transport by overland flow suffices to create the tendency of patterns to migrate downhill the analytical results so obtained have been validated through numerical simulations carried out by considering two sets of initial conditions that give rise to vegetation patterns from degradation of homogeneous vegetation dhv or colonization of bare ground cbg in the former case the analytically deduced locus of stationary patterns agrees qualitatively with the one obtained numerically and they are even in quantitative agreement close to bifurcation threshold as expected on the other hand due to the intrinsic nonlinear nature of the problem associated to the cbg setup only a poor qualitative agreement with analytical results holds everywhere the use of different initial conditions has allowed to extract additional information useful from the ecological viewpoint in particular our simulations clearly indicate that the proper choice of initial conditions becomes crucial for the characterization of patterned vegetation dynamics among the most relevant numerical results we have found that when patterns are generated from dhv vegetation bands move together in the same direction uphill or downhill or are all stationary in contrast when patterns originate from cbg the top edge of the vegetation patch moves always uphill whereas the lower edge may reverse its direction of propagation according to the values of control parameters our numerical experiments thus point out that overland flow and seed dispersal influence vegetation establishment and patch dynamics in particular these results confirm that the downslope seed transport in overland flow has a stabilizing effect and may be used to properly characterize the observed low migration rates or even the absence of a net motion of vegetation bands sherratt 2015 bochet 2015 saco et al 2007 thompson and katul 2009 the
