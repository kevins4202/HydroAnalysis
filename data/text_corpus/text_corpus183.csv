915,high altitude lakes have been studied intensively over the last decades both in terms of their biota and general physicochemical patterns and the importance of detailed knowledge of the small scale regional fauna was underlined in the present study the littoral macrobenthic invertebrate communities of two alpine lakes placed in the same geographical context upper and lower balma lakes cottian alps italy were seasonally characterized and the observed diversity was investigated in relation to site specific abiotic features during the ice free period two seasonal sampling campaigns summer and autumn were carried out at each lake along the littoral zones macrobenthic invertebrate were collected and abiotic features main physicochemical water parameters and main substrates were monitored permanova test disclosed significant differences in the invertebrate assemblages between the lakes and simper test highlighted that the observed dissimilarity was mainly related to oligochaeta and chironomidae taxa the application of the rda and vpa showed that differences were mainly due to littoral substrate composition and nutrient concentrations i e phosphorus and nitrates which could heavily affect both the structures and densities of the macrobenthic invertebrate communities in these environments findings from this study improve the knowledge about the macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages in the western area of the european alps highlighting the role of site specific factors in small scales studies and the importance of detailed knowledge of their local variability the better understanding of the variation patterns in regional subregional biodiversity and their drivers are of pivotal importance and have implications in the decision of conservation policies keywords high altitude lakes invertebrate communities chemico physical features substrate composition 1 introduction high altitude lakes are characterized by harsh environmental conditions supporting highly specific aquatic communities füreder et al 2006 bartels et al 2021 and are well known as indicators of global environmental change and early warning systems for the whole mountain environment molar water chemistry group 1999 čiamporova zat ovičová et al 2010 moser et al 2019 indeed although high altitude lakes are generally much less influenced by human activity than other habitats global and local anthropogenic threats can alter their natural environment the most serious are water exploitation tiberti et al 2019 alien species introduction cantonati et al 2021 climate change rogora et al 2018 and long range atmospheric transport of contaminants camarero et al 2009 pastorino et al 2020a pastorino et al 2022 due to their small area depth and small catchment area high altitude lakes are extremely sensitive to effects of global regional and local scale impacts kopáček et al 2002 the aquatic organisms of such areas are adapted to the severe conditions that characterize alpine water bodies such as persistent low temperatures high exposure to high urv doses associated with the high altitude common ultraoligo or oligotrophic status and usually acidic ph high altitude adaptation means irreversible evolved physiological responses to high altitude environments associated with behavioral and genetic changes pastorino et al 2019 during most of the year from october november to june july snow and ice cover the lakes blocking sunlight from penetrating the underlying water column felip et al 2002 without the penetration of light photosynthesis cannot take place and the lakes remain in darkness felip et al 2002 becoming heterotrophic systems isolated from the surrounding area until the ice cover breaks the ice free season lasts for a few months generally from mid june to late october during this brief period of ideal conditions aquatic organisms can complete their life cycle before the snow covers the lakes again usually alpine lakes are oligotrophic or ultraoligotrophic water bodies where altitude lake size and catchment characteristics determine the structure of the living communities catalan et al 2006 hamerlik et al 2014 hamerlik et al 2017 bartels et al 2021 these communities are greatly influenced by water temperatures ph dissolved oxygen nutrient concentrations and ice cover duration catalan et al 2006 hamerlik et al 2014 exposure to wind and consequent water movements in lakes can also have effect in shaping communities cazenave zanatta 2016 bartels et al 2021 moreover substrate has been found as a pivotal factor in shaping macrobenthic invertebrate communities in alpine lakes as in other aquatic environments boggero et al 2006 bartels et al 2021 however alpine lakes community are also affected by human activities and global changes have altered communities over time climate change affect the mountain biota directly owing to the increase in temperature and the variation of precipitation regimes and indirectly owing to the variation in abiotic components of the environment e g glacial retreat hoorn et al 2018 tito et al 2020 finally presence of introduced fish is also a key factor as non native species introduced for fisheries have cascading consequences on alpine lakes communities due to predation and alterations of the trophic conditions tiberti et al 2014 sánchez hernádez et al 2015 milardi et al 2016 perilli et al 2020 cantonati et al 2021 the combined pressures of global warming and human activities require a full understanding of the spatial and temporal variations in regional biodiversity patterns their drivers and concomitant implications for devising conservation policies zheng et al 2021 high altitude lakes have been studied intensively over the last decades both in terms of their biota and general physicochemical patterns füreder et al 2006 fjellheim et al 2009 novikmec et al 2015 hamerlík et al 2017 however it was also underlined the importance of detailed knowledge of the regional fauna for an understanding of climate driven processes on a broader geographical scale čiamporova zat ovičová et al 2010 alpine water bodies could have different characteristics within the same area i e substrate types depth etc leading to high regional diversity of dwelling macroinvertebrates hamerlík et al 2014 analyses at fine spatial scale regarding small areas are still lacking sax gaines 2003 schröter et al 2005 anderson et al 2011 but are necessary and useful to understand specific processes providing useful findings for the realization of region specific policies cheng et al 2021 however data will be also valuable to understand variation in local diversity which could be complicated by the introduction of new species by humans variations in microclimate and different eco geomorphic controls inherent to different landscapes diversity in alpine or polar regions is more likely to be controlled by temperature than in disturbed landscapes where human impacts could reshape species distribution nascimbene spitale 2017 sabatini et al 2017 peters et al 2019 in this context it was deemed of interest to investigate two alpine lakes in order to improve the knowledge about the western alpine area starting from local differences balma lakes cottian alps northwest italy placed in the same area represent an alpine system that could be considered as a natural laboratory to investigate the synergic action of environmental features in shaping alpine macrobenthic invertebrate littoral communities considering small local scale variability the aims of the present study were i characterize the littoral macrobenthic invertebrate communities of the balma lakes system ii investigate for differences in the littoral macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages between the lakes iii investigate site specific factors that contribute to shape the littoral macrobenthic invertebrate communities global large scale patterns of climate control the structure of the benthic invertebrate communities in lakes but site specific factors have the main role in shaping communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area balma lakes are two high altitude small water bodies sensu catalan et al 2006 located above the tree line in the cottian alps municipality of coazze piedmont northwestern italy the lower lake is located at 2101 m a s l while the upper lake is placed 2212 m above sea level fig 1 a b both lakes are of glacial origin and are included in the special area of conservation sac and special protection area spa it1110006 called orsiera rocciavrè and in the orsiera rocciavrè nature park in both lakes ice cover generally lasts from late october to late may early june the upper lake is s shaped with two sub basins separated by a shallow mid section the lake perimeter is 774 m with a 1 82 ha surface area and 2 77 m maximum depth the lake is placed in a catchment core composed of ophiolite metamorphic bedrock and the landscape is dominated by rocky outcrops ridges and mountain walls a little meadow area is placed at the southern side of the lake where a small inlet flows the outlet origins from the northeastern corner of the lake flowing downstream where it becomes the inlet of the lower lake fig 1b c the lower lake was already described in previous studies pastorino et al 2020b perilli et al 2020 cantonati et al 2021 it is circular shaped with a perimeter equal to 414 m the surface area is 1 21 ha and the maximum depth is 6 42 m the main catchment core has same composition described for the upper lake and the landscape is dominated by same elements observed above with the exception of the meadow that is absent near the lower lake the small inlet is located at the western shore dividing into three small branches before entering the lake although a true outlet is not evident the balma creek originates from water filtration through the sediments at the eastern side of the basin fig 1b d the most relevant anthropogenic impacts in the balma lakes area over the last four decades of the 20th century are represented by the long distance airborne transport of pollutants from the urban areas in the plain grazing activities and fishing pastorino et al 2020a 2020b perilli et al 2020 cantonati et al 2021 although the balma lakes were originally fishless the brook trout salvelinus fontinalis mitchill 1814 was introduced for recreational fishing in the 1970s balma et al 1992 pastorino et al 2020b perilli et al 2020 cantonati et al 2021 the brook trout population of the lower lake is well structured with individuals in age classes from 0 to 4 and an average fish biomass equal to 17 9 g m 2 pastorino et al 2020b brook trout population likely affected macrobenthic invertebrate communities over time due to predation and perilli et al 2020 diatom assemblages cantonati et al 2021 in the lower lake due to predation and affecting nutrient concentrations the brook trout population of the upper lake was never studied before but high densities were observed during the present study excretion 2 2 physicochemical features during each sampling event values of the main physicochemical water parameters were recorded water temperature c dissolved oxygen mg l 1 oxygen saturation ph unit and conductivity μs cm 1 were recorded using field meters hi 9033 conductivity meter hi 9125 ph orp meter hi 9147 oximeter all instruments were manufactured by hanna instruments inc woonsocket ri usa three values were collected at each site in both lakes during each sampling campaign the secchi disk was used from a boat in the deepest point of both lakes to check water transparency water samples 1 l three replicates were also collected at each site in sterile containers paying attention to avoid inclusion of sediment particles and then brought to the laboratory here nitrate no3 concentrations mg l 1 were quantified measuring the absorbance at 525 nm obtained by an adaptation of the cadmium reduction method apha awwa wef 1998 ammonium nh4 concentrations mg l 1 were measured by an adaptation of the nessler method measuring the absorbance at 420 nm astm 2015 finally the phosphorus p concentrations mg l 1 were obtained with an adaptation of the ascorbic acid method apha awwa wef 1998 measuring absorbance at 610 nm analyses were carried out using a multi parameter spectrophotometer hi83200 02 manufactured by hanna instruments inc woonsocket ri usa and three technical replicates were done for each parameter 2 3 macrobenthic invertebrate samplings two sampling campaigns were carried out in 2017 lower lake and 2021 upper lake during the ice free period in summer july early august and at the beginning of the fall season october surveys were focused on the littoral areas of both lakes defined as the nearshore habitat where enough light reaches the lake bottom to allow benthic primary producers to grow vander zanden vadeboncoeur 2020 five sampling sites were chosen in the littoral zone of the lower lake while seven sites were chosen for the upper lake fig 1c d table 1 this choice was driven by the catchment characteristics as the lower lake is round shaped with more uniform substrate and habitats while the upper lake could be divided in two sub basins and showed higher substrate variability than the lower in both lakes sites were selected after walking the lake perimeter to check for the presence of different microhabitats samplings were carried out following the guidelines reported by füreder et al 2006 and fjellheim et al 2000 2009 three sub samples were collected via kick sampling technique with a surber sampler 32 cm 32 cm 250 µm mesh size placing it from the shore to a water depth between 25 and 90 cm all the present habitats substrates classified as boulders rocks cobbles gravel and mud sand were considered and replicates were collected covering all the main habitat observed at each site in order to standardize sampling effort during each replicate collection substrates were disturbed for 2 minutes füreder et al 2006 fjellheim et al 2009 no aquatic vegetation was observed in the investigated lakes after collection samples were stored in situ with 70 ethanol solution and brought to the laboratory where they were examined using a stereomicroscope orma tekno series model nb50t led illumination from 8 to 50 magnifications for sorting counting and taxonomical identification oligochaetes and chironomid larvae were mounted on slides and identified with an optical microscope orma biotek model k900bl from 60 to 100 magnifications taxonomical identification was carried out at least to genus level if possible for each identified taxon densities ind m 2 were calculated at each sampling site 2 4 statistical analysis due to the size of the sample n 20 the wilcoxon non parametric test was used to check for significant differences between seasonal values of chemical physical data for each lake the same test was used to check for differences between upper and lower lake values in the analogous season in order to characterize the macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages common community indices were calculated mean number of observed genera shannon wiener index and evenness seasonal values observed for the investigated lakes were compared using the wilcoxon non parametric test the same test was used to check for differences between upper and lower lake values in the analogous season a similarity matrix was obtained from macrobenthic invertebrate littoral densities data using the bray curtis measure and two way permanova anderson 2001 mcardle and anderson 2001 was performed to check for significant differences between communities of the investigated lakes factors lake and season prior to analyses data were transformed log x 1 to reduce the influence of very abundant taxa clarke and gorley 2006 and the multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions was checked using permdisp2 anderson 2006 to minimize the influence of rare taxa only organisms with relative abundances 2 or present in at least two samples were included simper analysis clarke 1993 was applied to the data matrix to identify the main taxa which most highly contributed to observed significant differences highlighted by the permanova all analyses were performed using 9999 permutations redundancy analysis rda ter braak and smilauer 1998 legendre and legendre 1998 was used to investigate the relationship between macrobenthic invertebrates and environmental variables rda was chosen after applying the detrended correspondence analysis dca as the gradient lengths were 4 standard deviations ter braak and smilauer 2012 to avoid multicollinearity a subset of environmental variables was chosen after correlation analyses the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r was used for this purpose if two or more variables were strongly correlated threshold value r 0 7 and p 0 001 they were excluded from the analysis dorman et al 2013 as values of the pearson correlation coefficient were always lower than the threshold value all variables were included in the analysis in addition the habitats substrates observed and sampled at each site were also considered as a variable and classified in categories 1 mud sand 2 gravel 3 gravel and cobbles 4 cobbles 5 boulders the total explained variance within the macrobenthic invertebrate data was partitioned among three groups of variables associated with chemical physical temperature dissolved oxygen ph and conductivity nutrients no3 nh4 and p and substrate types using variation partitioning analysis vpa borcard et al 1992 the contribution of each variable group was then plotted as a venn diagram the significance of each variable group and relative interactions were checked using the monte carlo permutation test with 9999 permutations all analyses were performed using rstudio version 2021 9 0 351 figures are produced with rstudio r core team 2021 rstudio team 2021 and processed with software inkscape version 0 92 3 results 3 1 physicochemical water parameters trends of physicochemical data are shown in fig 2 generally values significantly differed seasonally in both lakes wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 05 for all comparisons except for nutrients which showed same levels in both lakes between the monitoring seasons wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 05 for all comparisons values of all the examined physicochemical features measured in the analogous season both in summer and in autumn differed between the two lakes wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 05 for all comparisons temperature and conductivity were always higher at the lower lake than in the upper fig 2a d while dissolved oxygen and ph showed different trends between summer and autumn fig 2b c interestingly nh4 and no3 were significantly higher in the lower basin than in the upper while p concentrations showed an opposite trend fig 2e f g respectively the highest depth where the secchi disk was visible was reached in the lower lake 3 0 0 3 m while in the upper lake it disappeared at 1 1 0 1 m table 1 3 2 macrobenthic invertebrate littoral communities values of community indices obtained in the balma lakes are shown in the fig 3 the densities of each collected genus were reported in the table s1 number of genera observed in both lakes did not differ significantly between the sampling seasons wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 16 for all comparisons comparisons between upper and lower lakes highlighted significant differences for all indices for the autumnal values wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 05 for all comparisons summer values did not differ between the two lakes except for evenness wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 001 littoral communities observed in the upper lake were dominated by oligochaeta on both seasons 50 0 22333 3 ind m 2 except in sites 2 3 and 4 where hexapoda 193 3 4043 3 ind m 2 were more abundant than oligochaeta fig 4 a the subfamily tubificinae especially species spirosperma ferox and tubifex tubifex showed the highest densities while subfamilies naidinae genus nais and enchytreidae genera cognettia cernosvitoviella and mesenchytraeus were also abundant fig 4c hexapoda were mainly diptera chironomidae distributed among five subfamilies chironominae orthocladiinae tanypodinae prodiamesinae and diamesinae fig 4e paratanytarsus austriacus tribe tanytarsini showed the highest densities in both seasons especially in autumn cricotopus orthocladius group was the most abundant among orthocladiinae followed by psectrocladius and hydrobaenus the tanypodinae zavrelimyia showed also high densities among the other taxa bivalvia pisidium was found in most of the sampling sites 13 3 1463 3 ind m 2 table s1 in the lower lake densities were always lower than the upper one especially for the oligochaeta group 53 3 1116 7 ind m 2 fig 4b d tubificinae was the most abundant worm subfamily in both seasons species s ferox and t tubifex and genus potamothrix while enchytreidae cognettia and henlea were observed only in summer and naididae were absent lumbriculus variegatus was the only species belonging to the family lumbriculidae the lower lake community was mainly constituted by chironomidae 556 7 1830 0 ind m 2 with the same subfamilies observed in the upper basin p austriacus was one of the most abundant while orthocladiinae were mainly represented by psectrocladius hydrobaenus and cricotopus orthocladius group as for the upper lake the tanypodinae zavrelimyia and macropelopia were observed and among the other taxa pisidium was collected at all sampling sites finally some taxa were characteristic exclusively of the site 1 inlet zone such as ecdyonurus nemoura cinerea and limnephilus coenosus table s1 the application of the permanova allowed for the detection of significant differences between the investigated lakes table 2 and the simper test highlighted that the observed dissimilarity between littoral communities was mainly related to oligochaeta taxa i e t tubifex nais cognettia s ferox l variegatus and to the chironomids psectrocladius p austriacus macropelopia and zavrelimyia considering also the bivalvia pisidium together these organisms contributed to the 74 96 of the observed dissimilarity the contribution due to other taxa was less than 3 table 3 3 3 macrobenthic invertebrates environment relationships the results of the rda application are shown in fig 5 a the rda 1 and rda 2 axes were both significant and explain respectively 25 9 and 6 7 of the observed variability fig 5a table 4 the main gradient is represented by the rda 1 and is characterized by nutrients and substrates lower lake sites take place in the right side of the figure corresponding to low p concentration high levels of no3 and nh4 and coarser substrates these sites are mostly characterized by presence of chironomid genera zavrelimyia psectrocladius and paratanytarsus austriacus upper lake sites take place in the left and bottom side of the figure and are mostly characterized by high presence of annelids cognettia t tubifex s ferox nais water temperature is mostly related to the rda 2 which represents a weak seasonal gradient as most of the summer sites take place in the upper side of the figure all the variable groups taken into consideration to explain the variation of the macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages of the balma lakes were significant table 4 and explained 41 1 of the total variance fig 4a c among individual fractions substrates explain most of the variation 10 5 followed by nutrients 6 8 whereas chemical physical features explain only the 1 6 fig 5b table 4 4 discussion despite the short distance between the two investigated water bodies different characteristics were observed in relation to physicochemical features and bottom characteristics consequently the macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages were significantly different 4 1 physicochemical water parameters as expected water temperatures differ seasonally in both catchments and are in line with ranges found in literature for high altitude lakes füreder et al 2006 reported that water temperature usually remains below 12 c in consequence of the short irradiation period related to the ice cover months rarely temperature may be higher than 15 c however this value was exceeded during summer in the balma lower lake despite the lakes were investigated in different years differences in water temperatures between upper and lower balma lake should reflect their elevation as altitude is strictly related to a climatic temperature gradient lotter et al 1997 čiamporová zaťovičová et al 2010 temperature plays a significant role in shaping littoral macrobenthic assemblages of both mountain and boreal lakes de mendoza and catalan 2010 especially for diptera chironomidae boggero et al 2006 dissolved oxygen concentrations show generally good levels in balma lakes especially in the lower one despite values were not high however increasing elevation comes with decreasing atmospheric pressure leading to decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations whereas lower water temperature related to increasing elevation leads to higher oxygen saturation luoto and nevalainen 2013 bartels et al 2021 oxygenation levels observed in the balma lakes agree with those reported by tiberti et al 2010 for 12 alpine lakes in the gran paradiso national park western alps italy values record for ph and conductivity recorded in both lakes during the present study are also in line with those commonly reported for alpine lakes located in granitic bedrocks kownacki et al 2000 boggero et al 2006 füreder et al 2006 fjellheim et al 2009 tiberti et al 2014 hamerlík et al 2017 interestingly both lakes did not show seasonal differences in concentrations of p nh4 and no3 nh4 and no3 are higher in the lower lake than in the upper while p levels follow an opposite trend increased nitrate levels could be related to inputs due to cattle or sheep bartels et al 2021 cattle excrements have been observed near both lakes during each sampling campaign and grazing livestock was present in the balma lakes area it was demonstrated that the lower balma lake was subject to an increase in nutrients over time especially nitrates cantonati et al 2021 which could be related to cattle and fish introduction on the other hand p concentrations are higher than expected in the upper lake which shows levels typical of calcareous catchment not expected in granitic bedrocks boggero et al 2006 fjellheim et al 2009 total phosphorous is a limiting factor for primary production junmei et al 2022 and inputs could increase algal productivity in remote lakes reche et al 2009 tiberti et al 2010 in the lower balma lake water transparency was higher than in the upper lake this result suggests that algal productivity should likely be higher in the upper lake than in the lower in fact presence of algal biomass was detected during the sampling operations in the upper lake despite values of total phosphorous seem to be not typical for blooming however observed values are higher than those reported by tiberti et al 2010 for alpine lakes in the gran paradiso national park filamentous algae can be early warning indicators of environmental change including eutrophication acidification or food web alterations lambert et al 2008 despite the cause of increase is not always clear naranjo et al 2019 and further analyses are required 4 2 macrobenthic invertebrates of the balma lakes biodiversity observed in the balma lakes system agrees with data found in literature čiamporova zat ovičová et al 2010 found a number of genera ranging between 5 and 18 for three lakes placed between 1724 and 2157 m a sl in the tatra mountains slovakia values of the shannon wiener index and evenness are also comparable to those observed by füreder et al 2006 in a study which analyzes littoral macrobenthic invertebrates of 55 alpine lakes in europe evenness values observed in the balma system allow to state that there is a good organism distribution among the observed taxa despite sometimes some of them become dominant especially in the upper lake as expected both balma lake littoral communities are dominated by diptera chironomidae and oligochaeta as usually reported for alpine lakes füreder et al 2006 kownacki et al 2006 oertli et al 2008 fjellheim et al 2009 čiamporová zaťovičová et al 2010 dumnicka et al 2015 novikmec et al 2015 bartels et al 2021 however dominant taxa are different between upper and lower lake due to the bottom characteristics of the analyzed water bodies listed above as highlighted by the application of the permanova and simper tests the upper lake is dominated by oligochaeta taxa while the lower is mostly characterized by diptera chironomidae first the high worm densities observed in the upper lake are likely related to the substrate composition as fine sandy muddy sediment was observed especially in site 1 at the inlet mouth and sites 5 6 and 7 placed near small shores at the foot of the slopes surrounding the western side of the lake fig 1b c these sites showed high invertebrate densities which were almost oligochaeta the other upper lake sampling sites showed lower densities and were dominated by the presence of chironomids in line with sites of the lower lake fig 4a the application of the rda confirms this result as sites 2 3 and 4 take places in the right side of the figure near the lower lake sites where samples were mostly characterized by chironomids in alpine lakes substrate of the littoral areas is generally dominated by larger grain size from gravel to stones and boulders as observed in the lower balma lake fine substrates such as silt mud and sand were prevalent only in rare cases but they have been found to be among the most influential environmental drivers of macroinvertebrate community composition and distribution in high altitude lakes catalan et al 2009 de mendoza and catalan 2010 bartels et al 2021 habitat types play a pivotal role for community composition as gravel cobbles and rocky littorals have been shown to be preferred by different species of chironomidae while oligochaeta prefers sites characterized by sandy habitats catalan et al 2009 reuss et al 2014 bartels et al 2021 the bivalve pisidium could be also related to fine sediments and it was found with higher densities in the upper lake than in the lower however pisidium was observed also in the lower basin this presence is in contrast with nardi 2014 which reports the absence of this bivalve with ph values lower than 7 as recorded in our work during the summer campaign on the other hand boggero et al 2005 found pisidium in alpine lakes with ph ranging between 6 21 and 6 74 in line with our findings it is possible that densities of pisidium in balma system are affected by both factors substrate and ph which can limit the presence in the lower lake in addition to substrates nutrient concentrations may have a central role in shaping the balma littoral communities it was demonstrated that in alpine lakes nitrate concentrations have negative effects on oligochaetes assemblages and that these organisms exhibit positive preferences for environments rich in phosphorous bartels et al 2021 especially the genus nais these findings seem to agree with our results as shown by the application of rda and vpa to the balma lakes dataset finally fluctuations in water level causing the temporary drying of the littoral and complete freezing of shorelines are factors that limit the occurrence of strictly aquatic families such as naidinae tubificinae and lumbriculidae kownacki et al 2000 in lakes with fluctuating water levels enchytraeidae were often abundant or the only oligochaetes to occur dumnicka and boggero 2007 it is reasonable to presume that the balma lakes were differently affected by water level fluctuations as differences in the shoreline position were observed between summer and autumn sampling campaign in both lakes however the shift of the shoreline water level limit was more evident in the upper lake especially in sites 1 5 6 7 where higher densities of enchytreidae have been observed among chironomidae differences between the two lakes were mostly due to psectrocladius paratanytarsus austriacus cricotopus orthocladius macropelopia and zavrelimyia the first taxon could be related to the nutrient levels measured in the lakes as it is commonly associated to low conductivity and phosphate poor environments moller pillot 2009 in fact it showed higher densities in the lower lake as agreement with the rda results paratanytarsus austriacus and zavrelimyia are two of the most widespread chironomids in alpine boggero et al 2006 füreder et al 2006 p austriacus is usually associated with oligotrophic conditions gandouin franquet on the other hand zavrelimyia is adapted to warm temperatures and shallow habitats its presence could be related to an increase in the lake productivity in relation to warm summers and global warming effects as observed by ilyashuk et al 2011 in an austrian alpine lake these findings have been also reported by perilli et al 2020 for the lower balma lake in a paleolimnological study the upper lake show slightly higher zavrelimyia densities than the lower lake where water temperatures were higher than upper lake maybe because here the effect of warmer summer seasons is more incisive due to different water temperature on the other hand other factors could have a role in shaping the communities the synergic action of high temperatures shape of the lake and catchment characteristics such as substrates could enhance the effect due to a well structured brook trout population which showed high densities during the sampling operations fish introduction can affect nutrient loads in alpine lakes tiberti et al 2014 sánchez hernádez et al 2015 milardi et al 2016 previous studies demonstrated how the lower balma lake was affected by fish introduction global warming and nutrient increase perilli et al 2020 pastorino et al 2020b cantonati et al 2021 however the effect on the upper lake could be more evident due to the basin shape as this is a pivotal factor in the metabolism of the lakes with cascading effects on the whole system thus further investigations should be also performed on the upper lake furthermore the small scale concept should be applied to the other assemblages diatoms ostracods testate amoebae to evaluate the role of the abiotic parameters on different organisms inhabiting remote alpine lakes moreover the paleolimnological history of the upper balma lake need to be investigated in the near future 5 conclusions the present study analyzes the variations of littoral macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages in two alpine lakes of the western alps in relation to local scale environmental variability observed biodiversity was comparable between the balma lakes but differences in community structure are related to substrate nutrient concentrations and water temperature which features seem to have the major role in shaping the investigated communities the group cricotopus orthocladius is commonly associated to aquatic plants algae or submerged parts of macrophytes higher densities of this orthocladiinae have been observed in the upper lake sites in agreement with the presence of a large algal community despite the upper lake is more characterized by oligochaeta than chironomidae the densities of the cricotopus orthocladius group could reflect the trophic condition of the upper lake these findings highlight the importance of site specific variables that operate al small scale these drivers shape the communities of alpine lakes and must be studied to better understand the ecological sensitivity of these environment and to predict potential changes in future

915,high altitude lakes have been studied intensively over the last decades both in terms of their biota and general physicochemical patterns and the importance of detailed knowledge of the small scale regional fauna was underlined in the present study the littoral macrobenthic invertebrate communities of two alpine lakes placed in the same geographical context upper and lower balma lakes cottian alps italy were seasonally characterized and the observed diversity was investigated in relation to site specific abiotic features during the ice free period two seasonal sampling campaigns summer and autumn were carried out at each lake along the littoral zones macrobenthic invertebrate were collected and abiotic features main physicochemical water parameters and main substrates were monitored permanova test disclosed significant differences in the invertebrate assemblages between the lakes and simper test highlighted that the observed dissimilarity was mainly related to oligochaeta and chironomidae taxa the application of the rda and vpa showed that differences were mainly due to littoral substrate composition and nutrient concentrations i e phosphorus and nitrates which could heavily affect both the structures and densities of the macrobenthic invertebrate communities in these environments findings from this study improve the knowledge about the macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages in the western area of the european alps highlighting the role of site specific factors in small scales studies and the importance of detailed knowledge of their local variability the better understanding of the variation patterns in regional subregional biodiversity and their drivers are of pivotal importance and have implications in the decision of conservation policies keywords high altitude lakes invertebrate communities chemico physical features substrate composition 1 introduction high altitude lakes are characterized by harsh environmental conditions supporting highly specific aquatic communities füreder et al 2006 bartels et al 2021 and are well known as indicators of global environmental change and early warning systems for the whole mountain environment molar water chemistry group 1999 čiamporova zat ovičová et al 2010 moser et al 2019 indeed although high altitude lakes are generally much less influenced by human activity than other habitats global and local anthropogenic threats can alter their natural environment the most serious are water exploitation tiberti et al 2019 alien species introduction cantonati et al 2021 climate change rogora et al 2018 and long range atmospheric transport of contaminants camarero et al 2009 pastorino et al 2020a pastorino et al 2022 due to their small area depth and small catchment area high altitude lakes are extremely sensitive to effects of global regional and local scale impacts kopáček et al 2002 the aquatic organisms of such areas are adapted to the severe conditions that characterize alpine water bodies such as persistent low temperatures high exposure to high urv doses associated with the high altitude common ultraoligo or oligotrophic status and usually acidic ph high altitude adaptation means irreversible evolved physiological responses to high altitude environments associated with behavioral and genetic changes pastorino et al 2019 during most of the year from october november to june july snow and ice cover the lakes blocking sunlight from penetrating the underlying water column felip et al 2002 without the penetration of light photosynthesis cannot take place and the lakes remain in darkness felip et al 2002 becoming heterotrophic systems isolated from the surrounding area until the ice cover breaks the ice free season lasts for a few months generally from mid june to late october during this brief period of ideal conditions aquatic organisms can complete their life cycle before the snow covers the lakes again usually alpine lakes are oligotrophic or ultraoligotrophic water bodies where altitude lake size and catchment characteristics determine the structure of the living communities catalan et al 2006 hamerlik et al 2014 hamerlik et al 2017 bartels et al 2021 these communities are greatly influenced by water temperatures ph dissolved oxygen nutrient concentrations and ice cover duration catalan et al 2006 hamerlik et al 2014 exposure to wind and consequent water movements in lakes can also have effect in shaping communities cazenave zanatta 2016 bartels et al 2021 moreover substrate has been found as a pivotal factor in shaping macrobenthic invertebrate communities in alpine lakes as in other aquatic environments boggero et al 2006 bartels et al 2021 however alpine lakes community are also affected by human activities and global changes have altered communities over time climate change affect the mountain biota directly owing to the increase in temperature and the variation of precipitation regimes and indirectly owing to the variation in abiotic components of the environment e g glacial retreat hoorn et al 2018 tito et al 2020 finally presence of introduced fish is also a key factor as non native species introduced for fisheries have cascading consequences on alpine lakes communities due to predation and alterations of the trophic conditions tiberti et al 2014 sánchez hernádez et al 2015 milardi et al 2016 perilli et al 2020 cantonati et al 2021 the combined pressures of global warming and human activities require a full understanding of the spatial and temporal variations in regional biodiversity patterns their drivers and concomitant implications for devising conservation policies zheng et al 2021 high altitude lakes have been studied intensively over the last decades both in terms of their biota and general physicochemical patterns füreder et al 2006 fjellheim et al 2009 novikmec et al 2015 hamerlík et al 2017 however it was also underlined the importance of detailed knowledge of the regional fauna for an understanding of climate driven processes on a broader geographical scale čiamporova zat ovičová et al 2010 alpine water bodies could have different characteristics within the same area i e substrate types depth etc leading to high regional diversity of dwelling macroinvertebrates hamerlík et al 2014 analyses at fine spatial scale regarding small areas are still lacking sax gaines 2003 schröter et al 2005 anderson et al 2011 but are necessary and useful to understand specific processes providing useful findings for the realization of region specific policies cheng et al 2021 however data will be also valuable to understand variation in local diversity which could be complicated by the introduction of new species by humans variations in microclimate and different eco geomorphic controls inherent to different landscapes diversity in alpine or polar regions is more likely to be controlled by temperature than in disturbed landscapes where human impacts could reshape species distribution nascimbene spitale 2017 sabatini et al 2017 peters et al 2019 in this context it was deemed of interest to investigate two alpine lakes in order to improve the knowledge about the western alpine area starting from local differences balma lakes cottian alps northwest italy placed in the same area represent an alpine system that could be considered as a natural laboratory to investigate the synergic action of environmental features in shaping alpine macrobenthic invertebrate littoral communities considering small local scale variability the aims of the present study were i characterize the littoral macrobenthic invertebrate communities of the balma lakes system ii investigate for differences in the littoral macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages between the lakes iii investigate site specific factors that contribute to shape the littoral macrobenthic invertebrate communities global large scale patterns of climate control the structure of the benthic invertebrate communities in lakes but site specific factors have the main role in shaping communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area balma lakes are two high altitude small water bodies sensu catalan et al 2006 located above the tree line in the cottian alps municipality of coazze piedmont northwestern italy the lower lake is located at 2101 m a s l while the upper lake is placed 2212 m above sea level fig 1 a b both lakes are of glacial origin and are included in the special area of conservation sac and special protection area spa it1110006 called orsiera rocciavrè and in the orsiera rocciavrè nature park in both lakes ice cover generally lasts from late october to late may early june the upper lake is s shaped with two sub basins separated by a shallow mid section the lake perimeter is 774 m with a 1 82 ha surface area and 2 77 m maximum depth the lake is placed in a catchment core composed of ophiolite metamorphic bedrock and the landscape is dominated by rocky outcrops ridges and mountain walls a little meadow area is placed at the southern side of the lake where a small inlet flows the outlet origins from the northeastern corner of the lake flowing downstream where it becomes the inlet of the lower lake fig 1b c the lower lake was already described in previous studies pastorino et al 2020b perilli et al 2020 cantonati et al 2021 it is circular shaped with a perimeter equal to 414 m the surface area is 1 21 ha and the maximum depth is 6 42 m the main catchment core has same composition described for the upper lake and the landscape is dominated by same elements observed above with the exception of the meadow that is absent near the lower lake the small inlet is located at the western shore dividing into three small branches before entering the lake although a true outlet is not evident the balma creek originates from water filtration through the sediments at the eastern side of the basin fig 1b d the most relevant anthropogenic impacts in the balma lakes area over the last four decades of the 20th century are represented by the long distance airborne transport of pollutants from the urban areas in the plain grazing activities and fishing pastorino et al 2020a 2020b perilli et al 2020 cantonati et al 2021 although the balma lakes were originally fishless the brook trout salvelinus fontinalis mitchill 1814 was introduced for recreational fishing in the 1970s balma et al 1992 pastorino et al 2020b perilli et al 2020 cantonati et al 2021 the brook trout population of the lower lake is well structured with individuals in age classes from 0 to 4 and an average fish biomass equal to 17 9 g m 2 pastorino et al 2020b brook trout population likely affected macrobenthic invertebrate communities over time due to predation and perilli et al 2020 diatom assemblages cantonati et al 2021 in the lower lake due to predation and affecting nutrient concentrations the brook trout population of the upper lake was never studied before but high densities were observed during the present study excretion 2 2 physicochemical features during each sampling event values of the main physicochemical water parameters were recorded water temperature c dissolved oxygen mg l 1 oxygen saturation ph unit and conductivity μs cm 1 were recorded using field meters hi 9033 conductivity meter hi 9125 ph orp meter hi 9147 oximeter all instruments were manufactured by hanna instruments inc woonsocket ri usa three values were collected at each site in both lakes during each sampling campaign the secchi disk was used from a boat in the deepest point of both lakes to check water transparency water samples 1 l three replicates were also collected at each site in sterile containers paying attention to avoid inclusion of sediment particles and then brought to the laboratory here nitrate no3 concentrations mg l 1 were quantified measuring the absorbance at 525 nm obtained by an adaptation of the cadmium reduction method apha awwa wef 1998 ammonium nh4 concentrations mg l 1 were measured by an adaptation of the nessler method measuring the absorbance at 420 nm astm 2015 finally the phosphorus p concentrations mg l 1 were obtained with an adaptation of the ascorbic acid method apha awwa wef 1998 measuring absorbance at 610 nm analyses were carried out using a multi parameter spectrophotometer hi83200 02 manufactured by hanna instruments inc woonsocket ri usa and three technical replicates were done for each parameter 2 3 macrobenthic invertebrate samplings two sampling campaigns were carried out in 2017 lower lake and 2021 upper lake during the ice free period in summer july early august and at the beginning of the fall season october surveys were focused on the littoral areas of both lakes defined as the nearshore habitat where enough light reaches the lake bottom to allow benthic primary producers to grow vander zanden vadeboncoeur 2020 five sampling sites were chosen in the littoral zone of the lower lake while seven sites were chosen for the upper lake fig 1c d table 1 this choice was driven by the catchment characteristics as the lower lake is round shaped with more uniform substrate and habitats while the upper lake could be divided in two sub basins and showed higher substrate variability than the lower in both lakes sites were selected after walking the lake perimeter to check for the presence of different microhabitats samplings were carried out following the guidelines reported by füreder et al 2006 and fjellheim et al 2000 2009 three sub samples were collected via kick sampling technique with a surber sampler 32 cm 32 cm 250 µm mesh size placing it from the shore to a water depth between 25 and 90 cm all the present habitats substrates classified as boulders rocks cobbles gravel and mud sand were considered and replicates were collected covering all the main habitat observed at each site in order to standardize sampling effort during each replicate collection substrates were disturbed for 2 minutes füreder et al 2006 fjellheim et al 2009 no aquatic vegetation was observed in the investigated lakes after collection samples were stored in situ with 70 ethanol solution and brought to the laboratory where they were examined using a stereomicroscope orma tekno series model nb50t led illumination from 8 to 50 magnifications for sorting counting and taxonomical identification oligochaetes and chironomid larvae were mounted on slides and identified with an optical microscope orma biotek model k900bl from 60 to 100 magnifications taxonomical identification was carried out at least to genus level if possible for each identified taxon densities ind m 2 were calculated at each sampling site 2 4 statistical analysis due to the size of the sample n 20 the wilcoxon non parametric test was used to check for significant differences between seasonal values of chemical physical data for each lake the same test was used to check for differences between upper and lower lake values in the analogous season in order to characterize the macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages common community indices were calculated mean number of observed genera shannon wiener index and evenness seasonal values observed for the investigated lakes were compared using the wilcoxon non parametric test the same test was used to check for differences between upper and lower lake values in the analogous season a similarity matrix was obtained from macrobenthic invertebrate littoral densities data using the bray curtis measure and two way permanova anderson 2001 mcardle and anderson 2001 was performed to check for significant differences between communities of the investigated lakes factors lake and season prior to analyses data were transformed log x 1 to reduce the influence of very abundant taxa clarke and gorley 2006 and the multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions was checked using permdisp2 anderson 2006 to minimize the influence of rare taxa only organisms with relative abundances 2 or present in at least two samples were included simper analysis clarke 1993 was applied to the data matrix to identify the main taxa which most highly contributed to observed significant differences highlighted by the permanova all analyses were performed using 9999 permutations redundancy analysis rda ter braak and smilauer 1998 legendre and legendre 1998 was used to investigate the relationship between macrobenthic invertebrates and environmental variables rda was chosen after applying the detrended correspondence analysis dca as the gradient lengths were 4 standard deviations ter braak and smilauer 2012 to avoid multicollinearity a subset of environmental variables was chosen after correlation analyses the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r was used for this purpose if two or more variables were strongly correlated threshold value r 0 7 and p 0 001 they were excluded from the analysis dorman et al 2013 as values of the pearson correlation coefficient were always lower than the threshold value all variables were included in the analysis in addition the habitats substrates observed and sampled at each site were also considered as a variable and classified in categories 1 mud sand 2 gravel 3 gravel and cobbles 4 cobbles 5 boulders the total explained variance within the macrobenthic invertebrate data was partitioned among three groups of variables associated with chemical physical temperature dissolved oxygen ph and conductivity nutrients no3 nh4 and p and substrate types using variation partitioning analysis vpa borcard et al 1992 the contribution of each variable group was then plotted as a venn diagram the significance of each variable group and relative interactions were checked using the monte carlo permutation test with 9999 permutations all analyses were performed using rstudio version 2021 9 0 351 figures are produced with rstudio r core team

differed seasonally in both lakes wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 05 for all comparisons except for nutrients which showed same levels in both lakes between the monitoring seasons wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 05 for all comparisons values of all the examined physicochemical features measured in the analogous season both in summer and in autumn differed between the two lakes wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 05 for all comparisons temperature and conductivity were always higher at the lower lake than in the upper fig 2a d while dissolved oxygen and ph showed different trends between summer and autumn fig 2b c interestingly nh4 and no3 were significantly higher in the lower basin than in the upper while p concentrations showed an opposite trend fig 2e f g respectively the highest depth where the secchi disk was visible was reached in the lower lake 3 0 0 3 m while in the upper lake it disappeared at 1 1 0 1 m table 1 3 2 macrobenthic invertebrate littoral communities values of community indices obtained in the balma lakes are shown in the fig 3 the densities of each collected genus were reported in the table s1 number of genera observed in both lakes did not differ significantly between the sampling seasons wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 16 for all comparisons comparisons between upper and lower lakes highlighted significant differences for all indices for the autumnal values wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 05 for all comparisons summer values did not differ between the two lakes except for evenness wilcoxon nonparametric test p 0 001 littoral communities observed in the upper lake were dominated by oligochaeta on both seasons 50 0 22333 3 ind m 2 except in sites 2 3 and 4 where hexapoda 193 3 4043 3 ind m 2 were more abundant than oligochaeta fig 4 a the subfamily tubificinae especially species spirosperma ferox and tubifex tubifex showed the highest densities while subfamilies naidinae genus nais and enchytreidae genera cognettia cernosvitoviella and mesenchytraeus were also abundant fig 4c hexapoda were mainly diptera chironomidae distributed among five subfamilies chironominae orthocladiinae tanypodinae prodiamesinae and diamesinae fig 4e paratanytarsus austriacus tribe tanytarsini showed the highest densities in both seasons especially in autumn cricotopus orthocladius group was the most abundant among orthocladiinae followed by psectrocladius and hydrobaenus the tanypodinae zavrelimyia showed also high densities among the other taxa bivalvia pisidium was found in most of the sampling sites 13 3 1463 3 ind m 2 table s1 in the lower lake densities were always lower than the upper one especially for the oligochaeta group 53 3 1116 7 ind m 2 fig 4b d tubificinae was the most abundant worm subfamily in both seasons species s ferox and t tubifex and genus potamothrix while enchytreidae cognettia and henlea were observed only in summer and naididae were absent lumbriculus variegatus was the only species belonging to the family lumbriculidae the lower lake community was mainly constituted by chironomidae 556 7 1830 0 ind m 2 with the same subfamilies observed in the upper basin p austriacus was one of the most abundant while orthocladiinae were mainly represented by psectrocladius hydrobaenus and cricotopus orthocladius group as for the upper lake the tanypodinae zavrelimyia and macropelopia were observed and among the other taxa pisidium was collected at all sampling sites finally some taxa were characteristic exclusively of the site 1 inlet zone such as ecdyonurus nemoura cinerea and limnephilus coenosus table s1 the application of the permanova allowed for the detection of significant differences between the investigated lakes table 2 and the simper test highlighted that the observed dissimilarity between littoral communities was mainly related to oligochaeta taxa i e t tubifex nais cognettia s ferox l variegatus and to the chironomids psectrocladius p austriacus macropelopia and zavrelimyia considering also the bivalvia pisidium together these organisms contributed to the 74 96 of the observed dissimilarity the contribution due to other taxa was less than 3 table 3 3 3 macrobenthic invertebrates environment relationships the results of the rda application are shown in fig 5 a the rda 1 and rda 2 axes were both significant and explain respectively 25 9 and 6 7 of the observed variability fig 5a table 4 the main gradient is represented by the rda 1 and is characterized by nutrients and substrates lower lake sites take place in the right side of the figure corresponding to low p concentration high levels of no3 and nh4 and coarser substrates these sites are mostly characterized by presence of chironomid genera zavrelimyia psectrocladius and paratanytarsus austriacus upper lake sites take place in the left and bottom side of the figure and are mostly characterized by high presence of annelids cognettia t tubifex s ferox nais water temperature is mostly related to the rda 2 which represents a weak seasonal gradient as most of the summer sites take place in the upper side of the figure all the variable groups taken into consideration to explain the variation of the macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages of the balma lakes were significant table 4 and explained 41 1 of the total variance fig 4a c among individual fractions substrates explain most of the variation 10 5 followed by nutrients 6 8 whereas chemical physical features explain only the 1 6 fig 5b table 4 4 discussion despite the short distance between the two investigated water bodies different characteristics were observed in relation to physicochemical features and bottom characteristics consequently the macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages were significantly different 4 1 physicochemical water parameters as expected water temperatures differ seasonally in both catchments and are in line with ranges found in literature for high altitude lakes füreder et al 2006 reported that water temperature usually remains below 12 c in consequence of the short irradiation period related to the ice cover months rarely temperature may be higher than 15 c however this value was exceeded during summer in the balma lower lake despite the lakes were investigated in different years differences in water temperatures between upper and lower balma lake should reflect their elevation as altitude is strictly related to a climatic temperature gradient lotter et al 1997 čiamporová zaťovičová et al 2010 temperature plays a significant role in shaping littoral macrobenthic assemblages of both mountain and boreal lakes de mendoza and catalan 2010 especially for diptera chironomidae boggero et al 2006 dissolved oxygen concentrations show generally good levels in balma lakes especially in the lower one despite values were not high however increasing elevation comes with decreasing atmospheric pressure leading to decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations whereas lower water temperature related to increasing elevation leads to higher oxygen saturation luoto and nevalainen 2013 bartels et al 2021 oxygenation levels observed in the balma lakes agree with those reported by tiberti et al 2010 for 12 alpine lakes in the gran paradiso national park western alps italy values record for ph and conductivity recorded in both lakes during the present study are also in line with those commonly reported for alpine lakes located in granitic bedrocks kownacki et al 2000 boggero et al 2006 füreder et al 2006 fjellheim et al 2009 tiberti et al 2014 hamerlík et al 2017 interestingly both lakes did not show seasonal differences in concentrations of p nh4 and no3 nh4 and no3 are higher in the lower lake than in the upper while p levels follow an opposite trend increased nitrate levels could be related to inputs due to cattle or sheep bartels et al 2021 cattle excrements have been observed near both lakes during each sampling campaign and grazing livestock was present in the balma lakes area it was demonstrated that the lower balma lake was subject to an increase in nutrients over time especially nitrates cantonati et al 2021 which could be related to cattle and fish introduction on the other hand p concentrations are higher than expected in the upper lake which shows levels typical of calcareous catchment not expected in granitic bedrocks boggero et al 2006 fjellheim et al 2009 total phosphorous is a limiting factor for primary production junmei et al 2022 and inputs could increase algal productivity in remote lakes reche et al 2009 tiberti et al 2010 in the lower balma lake water transparency was higher than in the upper lake this result suggests that algal productivity should likely be higher in the upper lake than in the lower in fact presence of algal biomass was detected during the sampling operations in the upper lake despite values of total phosphorous seem to be not typical for blooming however observed values are higher than those reported by tiberti et al 2010 for alpine lakes in the gran paradiso national park filamentous algae can be early warning indicators of environmental change including eutrophication acidification or food web alterations lambert et al 2008 despite the cause of increase is not always clear naranjo et al 2019 and further analyses are required 4 2 macrobenthic invertebrates of the balma lakes biodiversity observed in the balma lakes system agrees with data found in literature čiamporova zat ovičová et al 2010 found a number of genera ranging between 5 and 18 for three lakes placed between 1724 and 2157 m a sl in the tatra mountains slovakia values of the shannon wiener index and evenness are also comparable to those observed by füreder et al 2006 in a study which analyzes littoral macrobenthic invertebrates of 55 alpine lakes in europe evenness values observed in the balma system allow to state that there is a good organism distribution among the observed taxa despite sometimes some of them become dominant especially in the upper lake as expected both balma lake littoral communities are dominated by diptera chironomidae and oligochaeta as usually reported for alpine lakes füreder et al 2006 kownacki et al 2006 oertli et al 2008 fjellheim et al 2009 čiamporová zaťovičová et al 2010 dumnicka et al 2015 novikmec et al 2015 bartels et al 2021 however dominant taxa are different between upper and lower lake due to the bottom characteristics of the analyzed water bodies listed above as highlighted by the application of the permanova and simper tests the upper lake is dominated by oligochaeta taxa while the lower is mostly characterized by diptera chironomidae first the high worm densities observed in the upper lake are likely related to the substrate composition as fine sandy muddy sediment was observed especially in site 1 at the inlet mouth and sites 5 6 and 7 placed near small shores at the foot of the slopes surrounding the western side of the lake fig 1b c these sites showed high invertebrate densities which were almost oligochaeta the other upper lake sampling sites showed lower densities and were dominated by the presence of chironomids in line with sites of the lower lake fig 4a the application of the rda confirms this result as sites 2 3 and 4 take places in the right side of the figure near the lower lake sites where samples were mostly characterized by chironomids in alpine lakes substrate of the littoral areas is generally dominated by larger grain size from gravel to stones and boulders as observed in the lower balma lake fine substrates such as silt mud and sand were prevalent only in rare cases but they have been found to be among the most influential environmental drivers of macroinvertebrate community composition and distribution in high altitude lakes catalan et al 2009 de mendoza and catalan 2010 bartels et al 2021 habitat types play a pivotal role for community composition as gravel cobbles and rocky littorals have been shown to be preferred by different species of chironomidae while oligochaeta prefers sites characterized by sandy habitats catalan et al 2009 reuss et al 2014 bartels et al 2021 the bivalve pisidium could be also related to fine sediments and it was found with higher densities in the upper lake than in the lower however pisidium was observed also in the lower basin this presence is in contrast with nardi 2014 which reports the absence of this bivalve with ph values lower than 7 as recorded in our work during the summer campaign on the other hand boggero et al 2005 found pisidium in alpine lakes with ph ranging between 6 21 and 6 74 in line with our findings it is possible that densities of pisidium in balma system are affected by both factors substrate and ph which can limit the presence in the lower lake in addition to substrates nutrient concentrations may have a central role in shaping the balma littoral communities it was demonstrated that in alpine lakes nitrate concentrations have negative effects on oligochaetes assemblages and that these organisms exhibit positive preferences for environments rich in phosphorous bartels et al 2021 especially the genus nais these findings seem to agree with our results as shown by the application of rda and vpa to the balma lakes dataset finally fluctuations in water level causing the temporary drying of the littoral and complete freezing of shorelines are factors that limit the occurrence of strictly aquatic families such as naidinae tubificinae and lumbriculidae kownacki et al 2000 in lakes with fluctuating water levels enchytraeidae were often abundant or the only oligochaetes to occur dumnicka and boggero 2007 it is reasonable to presume that the balma lakes were differently affected by water level fluctuations as differences in the shoreline position were observed between summer and autumn sampling campaign in both lakes however the shift of the shoreline water level limit was more evident in the upper lake especially in sites 1 5 6 7 where higher densities of enchytreidae have been observed among chironomidae differences between the two lakes were mostly due to psectrocladius paratanytarsus austriacus cricotopus orthocladius macropelopia and zavrelimyia the first taxon could be related to the nutrient levels measured in the lakes as it is commonly associated to low conductivity and phosphate poor environments moller pillot 2009 in fact it showed higher densities in the lower lake as agreement with the rda results paratanytarsus austriacus and zavrelimyia are two of the most widespread chironomids in alpine boggero et al 2006 füreder et al 2006 p austriacus is usually associated with oligotrophic conditions gandouin franquet on the other hand zavrelimyia is adapted to warm temperatures and shallow habitats its presence could be related to an increase in the lake productivity in relation to warm summers and global warming effects as observed by ilyashuk et al 2011 in an austrian alpine lake these findings have been also reported by perilli et al 2020 for the lower balma lake in a paleolimnological study the upper lake show slightly higher zavrelimyia densities than the lower lake where water temperatures were higher than upper lake maybe because here the effect of warmer summer seasons is more incisive due to different water temperature on the other hand other factors could have a role in shaping the communities the synergic action of high temperatures shape of the lake and catchment characteristics such as substrates could enhance the effect due to a well structured brook trout population which showed high densities during the sampling operations fish introduction can affect nutrient loads in alpine lakes tiberti et al 2014 sánchez hernádez et al 2015 milardi et al 2016 previous studies demonstrated how the lower balma lake was affected by fish introduction global warming and nutrient increase perilli et al 2020 pastorino et al 2020b cantonati et al 2021 however the effect on the upper lake could be more evident due to the basin shape as this is a pivotal factor in the metabolism of the lakes with cascading effects on the whole system thus further investigations should be also performed on the upper lake furthermore the small scale concept should be applied to the other assemblages diatoms ostracods testate amoebae to evaluate the role of the abiotic parameters on different organisms inhabiting remote alpine lakes moreover the paleolimnological history of the upper balma lake need to be investigated in the near future 5 conclusions the present study analyzes the variations of littoral macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages in two alpine lakes of the western alps in relation to local scale environmental variability observed biodiversity was comparable between the balma lakes but differences in community structure are related to substrate nutrient concentrations and water temperature which features seem to have the major role in shaping the investigated communities the group cricotopus orthocladius is commonly associated to aquatic plants algae or submerged parts of macrophytes higher densities of this orthocladiinae have been observed in the upper lake sites in agreement with the presence of a large algal community despite the upper lake is more characterized by oligochaeta than chironomidae the densities of the cricotopus orthocladius group could reflect the trophic condition of the upper lake these findings highlight the importance of site specific variables that operate al small scale these drivers shape the communities of alpine lakes and must be studied to better understand the ecological sensitivity of these environment and to predict potential changes in future

consequence of increasing greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere owes rapid development of the industry and disregard of environmental issues heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc affirms in its fifth assessment report ipcc 2014 that human development activities especially burning fossil fuels and deforestation have caused considerable increases in concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since 1850 these elevated concentrations have led to temperature raise on a global scale the global increases in temperature appear to change the evapotranspiration precipitation type snow or rainfall intensities extreme event patterns and amounts accumulation and melting of snow and ice and it could consequently alter the atmospheric circulation and balance of temporal and spatial distribution of water resources and cause large scale floods in some areas or severe long term droughts in other places nijssen et al 2001 yimer et al 2009 le and sharif 2015 heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 silakhori et al 2022 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 sharafati et al 2020 to assess the impact of climate change on the various weather variables several general circulation models gcms have been developed for different scenarios stevens et al 2013 given the inadequate spatial and temporal resolution of gcms outputs their accuracy at local scale is low and cannot be directly used in projection of climate variables heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 sharafati et al 2020 several methods have been developed to downscale the output of the gcms stochastic weather generators are the common approaches for downscaling the output of the gcms over different regions semenov et

generate weather variables and predict them for future periods based on various climate change scenarios in different regions semenov et al 1998 semenov and brooks 1999 le and sharif 2015 zhu et al 2016 saddique et al 2019 sharafati et al 2020 silakhori et al 2022 the ipcc defined a series of representative concentration pathway rcp emission scenarios for projection of future climate 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 on the basis of coupled model intercom paring project phase 5 cmip5 these scenarios are related to a wide range of probable changes in future greenhouse gas emission population and socio economic status mcguire et al 2001 sharafati et al 2020 in which rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 accord with low balanced and high ghg emissions respectively due to the importance of predicting the change of critical climatic and hydrologic variables under the climate change which will provide valuable reference results for future water resources planning and management in each region various researches have been conducted in different areas of the world predictions of rodríguez díaz et al 2007 showed an increase in temperature in the guadalquivir river basin in spain as the impacts of the future climate change by the 2050s in both summer and winter in which summer temperatures are predicted to increase by as much as 3ᵒ during the irrigation season harmsen et al 2009 in assessing seasonal climate change impacts on precipitation in the future 2000 2090 reported that rainy season in puerto rico will become wetter and the dry season will become drier projection of climate change impact on precipitation over central belgium by baguis et al 2010 showed a shift in the precipitation pattern during 2071 2100 with a decrease during summer and an increase during winter predictions of chen et al 2013 in sudan indicated that precipitation in rainy seasons of june july and august will have a decreasing trend in the periods of 2011 2030 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 and an increasing trend in september october and november however tmax and tmin will have a continuous increasing trend azad et al 2018 in their research concluded that climate change in 2046 2065 will have an increasing impact on temperature and reference evapotranspiration and a reducing effect on winter wheat yield in myandoab iran temperature and precipitation projections in the shire river basin srb in malawi by kavwenje et al 2022 using lars wg6 revealed that continually rising temperatures are anticipated in the middle future 2041 2070 and late future 2071 2100 in the study area the results of predictions in southern iraq showed that increase in annual minimum and maximum temperatures will be 1 41 1 50 c under rcp4 5 and 5 67 5 91 c under rcp8 5 scenarios by this century s end and there will be reduction trend in predicted precipitation mohammed and hassan 2022 scientists argue that one of the most critical effects of climate change is the intensification of the hydrologic cycle heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 and numerous studies have reported that climate change has induced runoff regimes and affected water availability in different regions across the globe vorosmarty et al 2000 arnell 2003 arnell 2004 oki and kanae 2006 weather generators wgs in conjunction with hydrologic rainfall runoff r r simulation models have been widely utilized in recent studies with the rising attention to climate change researches among these studies the use of hydrologic models of swat clhms ihacres arno can be mentioned to river flow modeling in central vietnam by le and sharif 2015 yellow river basin yrb in china by zhu et al 2016 in meghna basin bangladesh by masood and takeuchi 2016 jhelum river basin in northern pakistan by saddique et al 2019 semi arid dehbar river basin in iran by sharafati and pezeshki 2020 and sharafati et al 2020 urmia lake basin in iran by heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 karaj river in iran by ensaniyat et al 2021 in golestan iran by silakhori et al 2022 hydrologic models despite their widespread application in modeling the hydrological process of the region require determination of numerous input parameters for precise calibration of the model the lack of access to the exact values of these parameters causes the uncertainty of the modeling results this issue has especial importance in the hydrologic model usage in the river flow prediction in the future where only limited meteorological parameters are predicted by the weather generator model in the future which are used as hydrological model inputs and other parameters are considered with some assumptions one approach that can reduce the computational and various inputs demands of the simulation model is to construct an emulator crompton et al 2019 emulators replace computationally demanding models with an alternative such as a machine learning model which is simpler faster to solve but still accurate with fewer input parameters among the available options to emulate rainfall runoff process artificial intelligence ai approaches are particularly attractive due to their proved applicability in complex systems modeling such as river flow using many well studied simple and famous ann models toward more advanced deep learning dl techniques kalteh 2013 eslamian 2014 bozorg haddad et al 2016 van et al 2020 hussain et al 2020 le et al 2021 the main objective of this study is hybrid application of a rainfall runoff modeling emulator deep learning and lars wg6 in projection of climate change impact on river discharge in this regard the effect of climate change on meteorological parameters river flow and extreme events has been studied and compared in three different climates due to the probable various increasing or decreasing changes in rivers discharge under the influence of climate change based on the climatic conditions of the region and climate change scenario assessment of the climate change and its probable side impacts on hydrologic processes in different regions is crucial assistance to water resource planners and managers to deal with these challenges in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study

order to collect the required meteorological and hydrologic data in each region a hydrologic station at upstream of each river that has a natural permanent river flow without significant water consumption before that either dam or irrigation network was selected and their daily discharge data were gathered the nearest synoptic station to the hydrologic stations were then selected and their

alternating convolutional and subsampling layers where the weights and biases get updated by backpropagation and are predominantly trained through a supervised learning algorithm gebrehiwot et al 2019 kiranyaz et al 2021 cnns successfully applied deep learning dl models have been developed at first to operate on 2d data images and videos and extract features and learn complex objects from large volume of labelled data kabir et al 2020 hosseiny 2021 and has gained popularity due to its success in image recognition and classification problems krizhevsky et al 2012 wang et al 2017 however the use of cnn tool for numeric data modeling have recently incremented and it have been successfully utilized in various fields including hydrologic processes especially rainfall runoff modeling van et al 2020 hussain et al 2020 le et al 2021 screening potential variables for model inputs in a neural network method is one of the important steps in selecting an optimal architecture of model van et al 2020 in this study various combinations of previous rainfall and discharges with different time steps lags were used as inputs in cnn modeling according to eq 1 1 q t f r t r t 1 r t 2 q t 1 q t 2 where q t is predicted flow at time t q t 1 q t 2 are river flow at antecedent time steps of t 1 t 2 and and r t r t 1 r t 2 are rainfall data at time steps of t t 1 t 2 considered scenarios of inputs variables in daily river flow modeling with cnn network are presented in table 2 in each scenario 80 of daily discharge data 2001 2016 and 20 of data 2017 2020 were considered for training the model and testing its performance respectively cross validation of model performance was performed during training process using 10 of training data cnn modeling in this study was implemented by programing in matlab r2021b with two convolutional layers and three fully connected layer with relu activation function batch normalization was used to normalize the data for regularity and balancing data range and a dropout method was utilized to prevent neural network from overfitting hussain et al 2020 cnn architecture in each scenario was modified by changing the number of hidden layers and its neurons in a trial and error process the training process continued until reaching a minimum error between the target observed river flow o i and the model output p i values in the n number of observations with the objective function of eq 2 2 m i n i m i z e o f i 1 n p i o i 2 to evaluate the performance of the neural network model in each scenario and select the best scenario a combination of graphical results evaluation and different statistics including root mean square of errors rmse coefficient of determination r2 mean error me and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are recommended in different studies moriasi et al 2007 ritter muñoz carpena 2013 and were used in this research as follows 3 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 2 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 5 m e 1 n

the number of observations the r m s e represents the differences between predicted and observed values and m e represents the overestimated or underestimated model therefore smaller and close to zero values of these parameters indicate better model performance bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 coefficient of determination is an indicator of the correlation of the observed and predicted values with the range between 0 and 1 r2 equal to 1 implies a perfect fit bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 according to nash and sutcliffe 1970 its range varies between 1 and and values close to 1 indicate the high accuracy of the model 2 3 simulation of future weather variables lars wg6 was used as a weather generator for downscaling of large scale climate predictions in daily time steps and local spatial scale to obtain projections for the future weather variables lars wg is a stochastic weather generator semenov and barrow 1997 generates daily weather data time series maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and solar radiation at local scales for both the past and the future periods this model uses a semi empirical probability function to calculate the length of wet and dry days based on the statistical distribution parameters of historically observed time series data and simulate seasonal cycles through fourier series racsko et al 1991 semenov et al 1998 semenov and brooks 1999 semenov and barrow 2002 the performance of lars wg in comparison with other weather generators wgs has been confirmed in many studies e g mavromatis and hansen 2001 semenov et al 1998 dibike and coulibaly 2005 semenov and stratonovitch 2010 mehan et al 2017 the latest version of this model lars wg6 which was updated and published in 2018 follows the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 based on representative concentration pathway rcp emission scenarios 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 for future climate projection heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 the rcp scenarios included the strict reduction scenario rcp2 6 a pessimistic scenario rcp8 5 with a high greenhouse gas emission rate and two intermediate scenarios ipcc 2014 these scenarios indicate the difference between the radiation energy emitted from the sun and the energy reflected to the atmosphere by the earth ipcc 2014 lars wg6 utilizes five gcms including hadgem2 ec ecearth miroc5 gfdl cm3 and mpiesm mr to simulate the future weather under climate change impact sharafati and pezeshki 2020 in this study the hadgem2 es model was used for downscaling data hadgem2 is a coupled earth system model developed by the hadley center for climate prediction and research hccpr which covers a network located in the area with a horizontal resolution of 1 25 degrees of latitude by 1 875 degrees of longitude heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 the selection of hadgem2 es is made based on literature review which has been widely used in statistical downscaling of weather variables over iran with appropriate performance heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 sharafati et al 2020 silakhori et al 2022 the calibration of the lars wg output was performed by assessing the accuracy of the model in reproducing the observed weather variables against the historically observed weather data over the baseline period at a desired significant level as its accuracy in simulating weather variables of the baseline period was confirmed in other studies osman et al 2019 sha et al 2019 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 sharafati et al 2020 after calibration lars wg was used to project of the future weather variables under three representative concentration pathway scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 the lars wg was implemented using the daily data of minimum and maximum temperature precipitation and solar radiation over a 20 year statistical base period 2001 2020 which was used as the basis for simulation of the future climate in the period of 2021 2040 in studied regions 2 4 overall research strategy in river flow projection and analysis of future extreme events after selecting the best combination of input variables in modeling the river discharge with cnn model in each region the predicted meteorological parameters of the lars wg6 model were used as the input of the cnn model and the discharge of the three rivers in the period of 2021 2040 was predicted in three scenarios of rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to analyze the extreme events of predicted river flow and compare them with the corresponded values of the base period the 7 day moving average of the daily discharge data were calculated and their maximum qmax and minimum qmin values were obtained 7 day moving average eliminates day to day flow changes in addition the analysis based on the 7 day average is less sensitive to measurement errors and in most cases there is not much difference between 1 day and 7 day low flows smakhtin 2001 fig 2 represents the overall flowchart of different stages of this study in river flow projection and analysis of future extreme events 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of the cnn model in predicting river discharge in different climates daily river flow modeling was performed in three different climates of iran using cnn model based on combinations of rainfall and runoff with different lags as model inputs under defined scenarios of table 2 the respective results are presented in table 3 by comparing the performance of different scenarios in the two sections of train and test according to the obtained results from this table scenario s4 with inputs of rt rt 1 rt 2 rt 3 and qt 1 had the best performance in modeling daily river flow in csa region the mentioned scenario has the least error and the most correlation between observed and predicted values of river flow in train and test data furthermore scenario s3 with inputs of rt rt 1 rt 2 and qt 1 has better performance than other scenarios in both ht and ca regions in this table positive values of me index indicate overestimation and negative values indicate underestimation of the model evaluation of different scenarios indicated that in the last scenarios with a greater number of inputs the cnn model performs worse than the low input architecture in all three climates comparison and correlation of observed and predicted values in two series of train and test data in figs 3 and 4 show that the cnn model in an architecture with less inputs was able to predict river flow with high accuracy the results of van et al 2020 hussain et al 2020 and le et al 2021 also showed the appropriate performance of cnn model in rainfall runoff modeling therefore this model can be combined with the lars wg6 outputs to predict river flow changes under the impact of climate change in the future 3 2 lars wg6 forecasts of future weather in three different climates prediction of minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and solar radiation using lars wg6 in different scenarios in figs 5 7 and the rate of changes in the mentioned parameters in table 4 show that the minimum and maximum temperature will increase in the near future 2021 2040 in all studied regions and in three climate change scenarios in all three climates the most raise in minimum and maximum temperature are often associated with scenario rcp8 5 followed by rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 respectively comparison of different climates shows that the most increase in minimum temperature is related to csa climate with 1 2 ᵒc increase in annual average in scenario rcp8 5 and the lowest increase in minimum temperature is related to ht climate with 0 6 ᵒc increase in annual average in scenario rcp4 5 moreover the most increase in maximum temperature is also related to the csa climate with 1 3 ᵒc increase in annual average in scenario rcp8 5 however the ht and ca climates are in the second rank with an increase of 0 9ᵒc in rcp4 5 the increase in temperature is different in various months in each climate and is in the range of 0 5 1 8ᵒc 0 2 1 8ᵒc and 0 3 2 1ᵒc in the csa ht and ca climates respectively the changes in solar radiation predicted in the period of 2021 2040 in the figs 5 7 and table 4 show that solar radiation will decrease in all three climates compared to the base period 2001 2020 this decrease will be more in the ht climate than two other climates however csa climate will have the least reduction of solar radiation compared to the other two climates monthly precipitation changes in three climates in different scenarios has more variability than temperature and solar radiation parameters and show different increasing and decreasing forecasts however the total annual rainfall in the csa and ca climates will increase in all climate change scenarios in the future the most increase in rainfall in the future compared to the base period is observed in the ca climate and in rcp2 6 by about 14 in this climate the lowest increase is related to rcp8 5 scenario and is about 6 in the csa climate an increase of about 8 of annual rainfall is predictable in rcp2 6 and in the other two scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this increase is less than 2 annual rainfall in the ht climate will increase by 3 7 in rcp2 6 scenario and it will decrease by 1 and 2 6 in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively similar to the obtained results of the present study predictions of chen et al 2013 indicated that tmax and tmin will have a continuous increasing trend in the future in sudan however monthly precipitation will have different increasing and decreasing trend harmsen et al 2009 and baguis et al 2010 also reported similar results about precipitation in puerto rico and central belgium respectively in accordance with the results of the present study mohammed and hassan 2022 predicted that increase in annual minimum and maximum temperatures under rcp8 5 5 67 5 91 c will be more than rcp4 5 1 41 1 50 c in southern iraq 3 3 river flow prediction under the climate change impact daily river flow prediction in three different climates in the near future 2021 2040 in different climate change scenarios compared with the base period values in fig 8 in this figure an increase in river discharge in autumn is observed in the csa climate in rcp2 6 in addition in the ca climate an increase in river flow in spring under the influence of scenario rcp2 6 as well as in autumn under the influence of scenario rcp4 5 is predicted this increase in flow in the mentioned scenarios can be related to the increase in rainfall in the relevant seasons figs 5 7 however as the fig 6 and table 4 illustrated the lack of significant change in the predicted rainfall in the ht climate the change in the predicted discharge compared to the base period discharge is not considerable fig 8 in order to compare the changes in the discharge extreme values in different scenarios with the base period the 7 day moving average of the discharge were calculated and their maximum and minimum values were obtained resulted maximum and minimum flow values in different climates are indicated in fig 9 the maximum flow in the csa climate will decrease by about 4 in scenario rcp4 5 in 2021 2040 compared to the base period however the minimum discharge in this scenario is predicted to increase about 40 in addition the maximum discharge in the ca climate in scenario rcp2 6 is projected to raise about 18 and in the ht climate in scenario rcp8 5 shows a reduce of about 5 the results of other studies in rainfall runoff modeling using the hydrologic model in combination with the lars wg output have also predicted different increase or decrease changes for river discharge in different regions as the influence of climate change maximum raise of mean annual precipitation and runoff in meghna basin bangladesh is projected to be 23 and 34 respectively during the near future 2015 2039 masood and takeuchi 2016 water resources decrement predicted to be between 30 and 24 for rcp 2 6 and 4 5 scenarios in yellow river basin yrb china zhu et al 2016 assessing climate change impact on dehbar river discharge in iran by sharafati and pezeshki 2020 and sharafati et al 2020 showed that the most increase in the future annual maximum values of river discharge and rainfall depth will occur according to rcp85 scenario as 142 and 81 respectively in 2021 2040 the amount of runoff in ziarat watershed of golestan province iran is anticipated to change from 0 373 to 0 308 m3 s in two periods of 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 in comparison with the base period under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios silakhori et al 2022 in this research rainfall and previous discharges were applied with different time steps and combinations as inputs similar to some studies jeong and kim 2005 senthil kumar et al 2005 van et al 2020 while some other studies attempted to utilize other variables such as temperature or evapotranspiration or relative humidity toth brath 2007 solomatine and shrestha 2009 however some studies pointed out that evaporation potential evapotranspiration or temperature as an input variable seemed unnecessary did not contributed to improve performance of the neural network rainfall runoff models may lead to chaos and noises during the training process and yield poorer results in comparison with the non use of this data in the models inputs increases the network complexity and therefore the risk of overfitting anctil et al 2004 toth and brath 2007 wu and chau 2009 van et al 2020 therefore in this study rainfall and river flow data were used as input variables in model development the main uncertainty of the proposed modeling approach for the prediction of river flow emerges from the use of climate change scenarios while the uncertainty level of the cnn modeling can be characterized as satisfactory based on its performance nevertheless taking into consideration that the selected time period for the future climate change scenarios was relatively near to the base period 2021 2040 the results can be trusted for water resources decisions making processes in this study an emulator machine learning model was utilized for river flow prediction which is simpler and faster to solve compared to computationally demanding hydrologic models but still accurate with fewer input parameters however hydrological models combined with machine learning approaches has recently been introduced for a better assessment of instantaneous peak flow in some researches jimeno sáez et al 2017 which can be useful to improve the assessment of the risk of reservoir operation moreover multiple hydrological models are also considered in some researches to propagate the impacts of some scenarios and analyze the structural uncertainty in the assessment senent aparicio et al 2018 pulido velazquez et al 2021 analyses of climate change impacts on climate variables in this study is based on the available information about general circulation models meanwhile some other studies are based on results of regional circulation models e g pardo iguzquiza et al 2019 there are also different approaches in which instead of analyzing impacts for future horizons under specific emission scenarios e g collados lara et al 2019 2020 they are defined for specific levels of global or regional warming pulido velazquez et al 2021 further evaluation of advantages and limitations of different approaches can indicate a new path for future research in this field 4 conclusion an attempt was made in this paper to investigate the possible impacts of climate change on river flows in different climates of iran csa cold semi arid ht humid temperate ca cold arid using hybrid use of deep learning and lars wg6 projections of weather variables in different climate change scenarios for 2021 2040 the best architecture of inputs from previous daily rainfall and discharges with different time steps lags for rainfall runoff modeling with cnn model had accurate performance in river flow modeling in all three regions predictions of lars wg6 indicated that minimum and maximum temperature will increase in the near future 2021 2040 in three climate change scenarios and in all studied regions the most raise in minimum and maximum temperature are often associated to scenario rcp8 5 followed by rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 respectively in which temperature increase in different months will be in the range of 0 5 1 8ᵒc 0 2 1 8ᵒc and 0 3 2 1ᵒc in the csa ht and ca climates respectively monthly precipitation changes in three climates in different scenarios showed different increasing and decreasing forecasts however the total annual rainfall in the csa and ca climates will increase in all climate change scenarios in the future the most increase in rainfall in the future compared to the base period is observed in the rcp2 6 scenario by about 14 and 8 in ca and csa climates respectively however in ht climate not only annual rainfall raise in rcp2 6 scenario is not considerable 3 7 but also a decrease of 1 and 2 6 can be anticipated in this climate for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively maximum discharge in the ca climate in scenario rcp2 6 is projected to raise about 18 and in the ht climate shows a reduce of about 5 in scenario rcp8 5 however since the increase in rainfall of rcp2 6 in the csa climate was predicted in autumn this increase will not have an effect on the maximum discharge raise in this region and the maximum discharge in this climate will decrease by about 5 in rcp2 6 based on the obtained results it can be concluded that different change directions of predicted river discharge in different regions necessitate accurate monthly and seasonal analysis and exploring the reasons affecting these changes assessment and prediction of river discharge under the influence of climate change in the future in different regions with various climates as well as further research in other scenarios of gcms are crucial to develop a comprehensive guide of possible future conditions for correct and timely decision making in water resources management to meet the problems of water supply on the basis of specific challenges of each region declaration of competing

wg6 in different climates of iran csa cold semi arid ht humid temperate ca cold arid for this purpose best combination of daily rainfall and discharges data with different lags were selected as inputs in rainfall runoff modeling using convolutional neural networks cnn model predicted meteorological data by the lars wg6 in the future 2021 2040 were then used as inputs for the selected cnn model and consequently runoff was predicted obtained findings showed that projected rainfall changes in 2021 2040 compared to the base period in scenarios of rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 will be 14 11 6 in ca 8 1 2 in csa and 3 7 1 2 6 in ht regions respectively whereas maximum discharge in ca climate in scenario rcp2 6 is projected to raise about 18 in the ht climate shows a reduce of about 5 in rcp8 5 and in csa will decrease by about 5 in rcp2 6 considering the effect of climate as well as seasonal changes in each region on the amount and direction of the climate change impacts on meteorological and hydrologic variables changes assessing climate change impact in each region is necessary to extract adaptation strategies in water resources management key words climate change cnn cold arid cold semi arid deep learning humid temperate lars wg6 river flow 1 introduction global climate changes have become a public international concern over the past decades changes in climate patterns as a consequence of increasing greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere owes rapid development of the industry and disregard of environmental issues heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc affirms in its fifth assessment report ipcc 2014 that human development activities especially burning fossil fuels and deforestation have caused considerable increases in concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since 1850 these elevated concentrations have led to temperature raise on a global scale the global increases in temperature appear to change the evapotranspiration precipitation type snow or rainfall intensities extreme event patterns and amounts accumulation and melting of snow and ice and it could consequently alter the atmospheric circulation and balance of temporal and spatial distribution of water resources and cause large scale floods in some areas or severe long term droughts in other

change on the various weather variables several general circulation models gcms have been developed for different scenarios stevens et al 2013 given the inadequate spatial and temporal resolution of gcms outputs their accuracy at local scale is low and cannot be directly used in projection of climate variables heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 sharafati et al 2020 several methods have been developed to downscale the output of the gcms stochastic weather generators are the common approaches for downscaling the output of the gcms over different regions semenov et

status mcguire et al 2001 sharafati et al 2020 in which rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 accord with low balanced and high ghg emissions respectively due to the importance of predicting the change of critical climatic and hydrologic variables under the climate change which will provide valuable reference results for future water resources planning and management in each region various researches have been conducted in different areas of the world predictions of rodríguez díaz et al 2007 showed an increase in temperature in the guadalquivir river basin in spain as the impacts of the future climate

al 2022 hydrologic models despite their widespread application in modeling the hydrological process of the region require determination of numerous input parameters for precise calibration of the model the lack of access to the exact values of these parameters causes the uncertainty of the modeling results this issue has especial importance in the hydrologic model usage in the river flow prediction in the future where only limited meteorological parameters are predicted by the weather generator model in the future which are used as hydrological model inputs and other parameters are considered with some assumptions one approach that can reduce the computational and various inputs demands of the simulation model is to construct an emulator crompton et al 2019 emulators replace computationally demanding models with an alternative such as a machine learning model which is simpler faster to solve but still accurate with fewer input parameters among the available options to emulate rainfall runoff process artificial intelligence ai approaches are particularly attractive due to their proved applicability in complex systems modeling such as river flow using many well studied simple and famous ann models toward more advanced deep learning dl techniques kalteh 2013 eslamian 2014 bozorg haddad et al 2016 van et al 2020 hussain et al 2020 le et al 2021 the main objective of this study is hybrid application of a rainfall runoff modeling emulator deep learning and lars wg6 in projection of climate change impact on river discharge in this regard the effect of climate change on meteorological parameters river flow and extreme events has been studied and compared in three different climates due to the probable various increasing or decreasing changes in rivers discharge under the influence of climate change based on the climatic conditions of the region and climate change scenario assessment of the climate change and its probable side impacts on hydrologic processes in different regions is crucial assistance to water resource planners and managers to deal with these challenges in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study

northeast of iran after passing from some cities in razavi khorasan province it joins the harirud river emberger 1932 system was used in this study for climate classification of the studied regions in order to collect the required meteorological and hydrologic data in each region a hydrologic station at upstream of each river that has a natural permanent river flow without significant water consumption before that either dam or irrigation network was selected and their daily discharge data were gathered the nearest synoptic station to the hydrologic stations were then selected and their

alternating convolutional and subsampling layers where the weights and biases get updated by backpropagation and are predominantly trained through a supervised learning algorithm gebrehiwot et al 2019 kiranyaz et al 2021 cnns successfully applied deep learning dl models have been developed at first to operate on 2d data images and videos and extract features and learn complex objects from large volume of labelled data kabir et al 2020 hosseiny 2021 and has gained popularity due to its success in image recognition and classification problems krizhevsky et al 2012 wang et al 2017 however the use of cnn tool for numeric data modeling have recently incremented and it have been successfully utilized in various fields including hydrologic processes especially rainfall runoff modeling van et al 2020 hussain et al 2020 le et al 2021 screening potential variables for model inputs in a neural network method is one of the important steps in selecting an optimal architecture of model van et al 2020 in this study various combinations of previous rainfall and discharges with different time steps lags were used as inputs in cnn modeling according to eq 1 1 q t f r t r t 1 r t 2 q t 1 q t 2 where q t is predicted flow at time t q t 1 q t 2 are river flow at antecedent time steps of t 1 t 2 and and r t r t 1 r t 2 are rainfall data at time steps of t t 1 t 2 considered scenarios of inputs variables in daily river flow modeling with cnn network are presented in table 2 in each scenario 80 of daily discharge data 2001 2016 and 20 of data 2017 2020 were considered for training the model and testing its performance respectively cross validation of model performance was performed during training process using 10 of training data cnn modeling in this study was implemented by programing in matlab r2021b with two convolutional layers and three fully connected layer with relu activation function batch normalization was used to normalize the data for regularity and balancing data range and a dropout method was utilized to prevent neural network from overfitting hussain et al 2020 cnn architecture in each scenario was modified by changing the number of hidden layers and its neurons in a trial and error process the training process continued until reaching a minimum error between the target observed river flow o i and the model output p i values in the n number of observations with the objective function of eq 2 2 m i n i m i z e o f i 1 n p i o i 2 to evaluate the performance of the neural network model in each scenario and select the best scenario a combination of graphical results evaluation and different statistics including root mean square of errors rmse coefficient of determination r2 mean error me and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are recommended in different studies moriasi et al 2007 ritter muñoz carpena 2013 and were used in this research as follows 3 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 2 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 5 m e 1 n

the number of observations the r m s e represents the differences between predicted and observed values and m e represents the overestimated or underestimated model therefore smaller and close to zero values of these parameters indicate better model performance bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 coefficient of determination is an indicator of the correlation of the observed and predicted values with the range between 0 and 1 r2 equal to 1 implies a perfect fit bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 according to nash and sutcliffe 1970 its range varies between 1 and and values close to 1 indicate the high accuracy of the model 2 3 simulation of future weather variables lars wg6 was used as a weather generator for downscaling of large scale climate predictions in daily time steps and local spatial scale to obtain projections for the future weather variables lars wg is a stochastic weather generator semenov and barrow 1997 generates daily weather data time series maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and solar radiation at local scales for both the past and the future periods this model uses a semi empirical probability function to calculate the length of wet and dry days based on the statistical distribution parameters of historically observed time series data and simulate seasonal cycles through fourier series racsko et al 1991 semenov et al 1998 semenov and brooks 1999 semenov and barrow 2002 the performance of lars wg in comparison with other weather generators wgs has been confirmed in many studies e g mavromatis and hansen 2001 semenov et al 1998 dibike and coulibaly 2005 semenov and stratonovitch 2010 mehan et al 2017 the latest version of this model lars wg6 which was updated and published in 2018 follows the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 based on representative concentration pathway rcp emission scenarios 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 for future climate projection heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 the rcp scenarios included the strict reduction scenario rcp2 6 a pessimistic scenario rcp8 5 with a high greenhouse gas emission rate and two intermediate scenarios ipcc 2014 these scenarios indicate the difference between the radiation energy emitted from the sun and the energy reflected to the atmosphere by the earth ipcc 2014 lars wg6 utilizes five gcms including hadgem2 ec ecearth miroc5 gfdl cm3 and mpiesm mr to simulate the future weather under climate change impact sharafati and pezeshki 2020 in this study the hadgem2 es model was used for downscaling data hadgem2 is a coupled earth system model developed by the hadley center for climate prediction and research hccpr which covers a network located in the area with a horizontal resolution of 1 25 degrees of latitude by 1 875 degrees of longitude heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 the selection of hadgem2 es is made based on literature review which has been widely used in statistical downscaling of weather variables over iran with appropriate performance heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 sharafati et al 2020 silakhori et al 2022 the calibration of the lars wg output was performed by assessing the accuracy of the model in reproducing the observed weather variables against the historically observed weather data over the baseline period at a desired significant level as its accuracy in simulating weather variables of the baseline period was confirmed in other studies osman et al 2019 sha et al 2019 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 sharafati et al 2020 after calibration lars wg was used to project of the future weather variables under three representative concentration pathway scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 the lars wg was implemented using the daily data of minimum and maximum temperature precipitation and solar radiation over a 20 year statistical base period 2001 2020 which was used as the basis for simulation of the future climate in the period of 2021 2040 in studied regions 2 4 overall research strategy in river flow projection and analysis of future extreme events after selecting the best combination of input variables in modeling the river discharge with cnn model in each region the predicted meteorological parameters of the lars wg6 model were used as the input of the cnn model and the discharge of the three rivers in the period of 2021 2040 was predicted in three scenarios of rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to analyze the extreme events of predicted river flow and compare them with the corresponded values of the base period the 7 day moving average of the daily discharge data were calculated and their maximum qmax and minimum qmin values were obtained 7 day moving average eliminates day to day flow changes in addition the analysis based on the 7 day average is less sensitive to measurement errors and in most cases there is not much difference between 1 day and 7 day low flows smakhtin 2001 fig 2 represents the overall flowchart of different stages of this study in river flow projection and analysis of future extreme events 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of the cnn model in predicting river discharge in different climates daily river flow modeling was performed in three different climates of iran using cnn model based on combinations of rainfall and runoff with different lags as model inputs under defined scenarios of table 2 the respective results are presented in table 3 by comparing the performance of different scenarios in the two sections of train and test according to the obtained results from this table scenario s4 with inputs of rt rt 1 rt 2 rt 3 and qt 1 had the best performance in modeling daily river flow in csa region the mentioned scenario has the least error and the most correlation between observed and predicted values of river flow in train and test data furthermore scenario s3 with inputs of rt rt 1 rt 2 and qt 1 has better performance than other scenarios in both ht and ca regions in this table positive values of me index indicate overestimation and negative values indicate underestimation of the model evaluation of different scenarios indicated that in the last scenarios with a greater number of inputs the cnn model performs worse than the low input architecture in all three climates comparison and correlation of observed and predicted values in two series of train and test data in figs 3 and 4 show that the cnn model in an architecture with less inputs was able to predict river flow with high accuracy the results of van et al 2020 hussain et al 2020 and le et al 2021 also showed the appropriate performance of cnn model in rainfall runoff modeling therefore this model can be combined with the lars wg6 outputs to predict river flow changes under the impact of climate change in the future 3 2 lars wg6 forecasts of future weather in three different climates prediction of minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and solar radiation using lars wg6 in different scenarios in figs 5 7 and the rate of changes in the mentioned parameters in table 4 show that the minimum and maximum temperature will increase in the near future 2021 2040 in all studied regions and in three climate change scenarios in all three climates the most raise in minimum and maximum temperature are often associated with scenario rcp8 5 followed by rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 respectively comparison of different climates shows that the most increase in minimum temperature is related to csa climate with 1 2 ᵒc increase in annual average in scenario rcp8 5 and the lowest increase in minimum temperature is related to ht climate with 0 6 ᵒc increase in annual average in scenario rcp4 5 moreover the most increase in maximum temperature is also related to the csa climate with 1 3 ᵒc increase in annual average in scenario rcp8 5 however the ht and ca climates are in the second rank with an increase of 0 9ᵒc in rcp4 5 the increase in temperature is different in various months in each climate and is in the range of 0 5 1 8ᵒc 0 2 1 8ᵒc and 0 3 2 1ᵒc in the csa ht and ca climates respectively the changes in solar radiation predicted in the period of 2021 2040 in the figs 5 7 and table 4 show that solar radiation will decrease in all three climates compared to the base period 2001 2020 this decrease will be more in the ht climate than two other climates however csa climate will have the least reduction of solar radiation compared to the other two climates monthly precipitation changes in three climates in different scenarios has more variability than temperature and solar radiation parameters and show different increasing and decreasing forecasts however the total annual rainfall in the csa and ca climates will increase in all climate change scenarios in the future the most increase in rainfall in the future compared to the base period is observed in the ca climate and in rcp2 6 by about 14 in this climate the lowest increase is related to rcp8 5 scenario and is about 6 in the csa climate an increase of about 8 of annual rainfall is predictable in rcp2 6 and in the other two scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this increase is less than 2 annual rainfall in the ht climate will increase by 3 7 in rcp2 6 scenario and it will decrease by 1 and 2 6 in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively similar to the obtained results of the present study predictions of chen et al 2013 indicated that tmax and tmin will have a continuous increasing trend in the future in sudan however monthly precipitation will have different increasing and decreasing trend harmsen et al 2009 and baguis et al 2010 also reported similar results about precipitation in puerto rico and central belgium respectively in accordance with the results of the present study mohammed and hassan 2022 predicted that increase in annual minimum and maximum temperatures under rcp8 5 5 67 5 91 c will be more than rcp4 5 1 41 1 50 c in southern iraq 3 3 river flow prediction under the climate change impact daily river flow prediction in three different climates in the near future 2021 2040 in different climate change scenarios compared with the base period values in fig 8 in this figure an increase in river discharge in autumn is observed in the csa climate in rcp2 6 in addition in the ca climate an increase in river flow in spring under the influence of scenario rcp2 6 as well as in autumn under the influence of scenario rcp4 5 is predicted this increase in flow in the mentioned scenarios can be related to the increase in rainfall in the relevant seasons figs 5 7 however as the fig 6 and table 4 illustrated the lack of significant change in the predicted rainfall in the ht climate the change in the predicted discharge compared to the base period discharge is not considerable fig 8 in order to compare the changes in the discharge extreme values in different scenarios with the base period the 7 day moving average of the discharge were calculated and their maximum and minimum values were obtained resulted maximum and minimum flow values in different climates are indicated in fig 9 the maximum flow in the csa climate will decrease by about 4 in scenario rcp4 5 in 2021 2040 compared to the base period however the minimum discharge in this scenario is predicted to increase about 40 in addition the maximum discharge in the ca climate in scenario rcp2 6 is projected to raise about 18 and in the ht climate in scenario rcp8 5 shows a reduce of about 5 the results of other studies in rainfall runoff modeling using the hydrologic model in combination with the lars wg output have also predicted different increase or decrease changes for river discharge in different regions as the influence of climate change maximum raise of mean annual precipitation and runoff in meghna basin bangladesh is projected to be 23 and 34 respectively during the near future 2015 2039 masood and takeuchi 2016 water resources decrement predicted to be between 30 and 24 for rcp 2 6 and 4 5 scenarios in yellow river basin yrb china zhu et al 2016 assessing climate change impact on dehbar river discharge in iran by sharafati and pezeshki 2020 and sharafati et al 2020 showed that the most increase in the future annual maximum values of river discharge and rainfall depth will occur according to rcp85 scenario as 142 and 81 respectively in 2021 2040 the amount of runoff in ziarat watershed of golestan province iran is anticipated to change from 0 373 to 0 308 m3 s in two periods of 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 in comparison with the base period under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios silakhori et al 2022 in this research rainfall and previous discharges were applied with different time steps and combinations as inputs similar to some studies jeong and kim 2005 senthil kumar et al 2005 van et al 2020 while some other studies attempted to utilize other variables such as temperature or evapotranspiration or relative humidity toth brath 2007 solomatine and shrestha 2009 however some studies pointed out that evaporation potential evapotranspiration or temperature as an input variable seemed unnecessary did not contributed to improve performance of the neural network rainfall runoff models may lead to chaos and noises during the training process and yield poorer results in comparison with the non use of this data in the models inputs increases the network complexity and therefore the risk of overfitting anctil et al 2004 toth and brath 2007 wu and chau 2009 van et al 2020 therefore in this study rainfall and river flow data were used as input variables in model development the main uncertainty of the proposed modeling approach for the prediction of river flow emerges from the use of climate change scenarios while the uncertainty level of the cnn modeling can be characterized as satisfactory based on its performance nevertheless taking into consideration that the selected time period for the future climate change scenarios was relatively near to the base period 2021 2040 the results can be trusted for water resources decisions making processes in this study an emulator machine learning model was utilized for river flow prediction which is simpler and faster to solve compared to computationally demanding hydrologic models but still accurate with fewer input parameters however hydrological models combined with machine learning approaches has recently been introduced for a better assessment of instantaneous peak flow in some researches jimeno sáez et al 2017 which can be useful to improve the assessment of the risk of reservoir operation moreover multiple hydrological models are also considered in some researches to propagate the impacts of some scenarios and analyze the structural uncertainty in the assessment senent aparicio et al 2018 pulido velazquez et al 2021 analyses of climate change impacts on climate variables in this study is based on the available information about general circulation models meanwhile some other studies are based on results of regional circulation models e g pardo iguzquiza et al 2019 there are also different approaches in which instead of analyzing impacts for future horizons under specific emission scenarios e g collados lara et al 2019 2020 they are defined for specific levels of global or regional warming pulido velazquez et al 2021 further evaluation of advantages and limitations of different approaches can indicate a new path for future research in this field 4 conclusion an attempt was made in this paper to investigate the possible impacts of climate change on river flows in different climates of iran csa cold semi arid ht humid temperate ca cold arid using hybrid use of deep learning and lars wg6 projections of weather variables in different climate change scenarios for 2021 2040 the best architecture of inputs from previous daily rainfall and discharges with different time steps lags for rainfall runoff modeling with cnn model had accurate performance in river flow modeling in all three regions predictions of lars wg6 indicated that minimum and maximum temperature will increase in the near future 2021 2040 in three climate change scenarios and in all studied regions the most raise in minimum and maximum temperature are often associated to scenario rcp8 5 followed by rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 respectively in which temperature increase in different months will be in the range of 0 5 1 8ᵒc 0 2 1 8ᵒc and 0 3 2 1ᵒc in the csa ht and ca climates respectively monthly precipitation changes in three climates in different scenarios showed different increasing and decreasing forecasts however the total annual rainfall in the csa and ca climates will increase in all climate change scenarios in the future the most increase in rainfall in the future compared to the base period is observed in the rcp2 6 scenario by about 14 and 8 in ca and csa climates respectively however in ht climate not only annual rainfall raise in rcp2 6 scenario is not considerable 3 7 but also a decrease of 1 and 2 6 can be anticipated in this climate for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively maximum discharge in the ca climate in scenario rcp2 6 is projected to raise about 18 and in the ht climate shows a reduce of about 5 in scenario rcp8 5 however since the increase in rainfall of rcp2 6 in the csa climate was predicted in autumn this increase will not have an effect on the maximum discharge raise in this region and the maximum discharge in this climate will decrease by about 5 in rcp2 6 based on the obtained results it can be concluded that different change directions of predicted river discharge in different regions necessitate accurate monthly and seasonal analysis and exploring the reasons affecting these changes assessment and prediction of river discharge under the influence of climate change in the future in different regions with various climates as well as further research in other scenarios of gcms are crucial to develop a comprehensive guide of possible future conditions for correct and timely decision making in water resources management to meet the problems of water supply on the basis of specific challenges of each region declaration of competing

917,summer ponds in north west bangladesh are suffering from sandy soil and drought from january to december 2017 the university of rajshahi bangladesh conducted an experiment to improve seasonal ponds water retention capacity and productivity in nine seasonal ponds polythene and clay were used on the bottom of three treatments t1 t2 and t3 selected five controlled ponds were used to compare water depth and production while the average water depth was above 3 feet 0 91 m in controlled ponds only for 6 months polythene based model ponds lengthened water holding capacity with average water depths of 6 23 feet 1 87 m 5 71 feet 1 71 m and 5 07 feet 1 52 m in t1 t2 and t3 respectively throughout the year the average net production of the research ponds in eight months was 20 68 kg decimal whereas it was only 4 35 kg decimal for controlled ponds t1 exhibited 2 07 fold greater water depth and 4 75 fold greater productions than controlled ponds net production 5908 59 72 72 kg ha 8month of t1 was significantly p 0 05 higher than t2 and t3 thus using polythene and clay in the pond bottom and covering it with water up to 8 feet 2 4 m deep will increase the water holding capacity and

2018 aquaculture benefits poor farmers livelihoods by increasing food supply employment and income edwards 2000 there are millions of ponds around the country about 55 of ponds are seasonal in the northwestern part of bangladesh islam and haque 2010 seasonal ponds are those that cannot hold water all year particularly during the dry season in a fish culture system the water depth and total volume of water available to fish are critical not only is adequate water depth required for optimal growth but also to give sufficient room and oxygen for fish existence in the north west part of bangladesh fish production faces an enormous problem this region is the most severely drought prone area in bangladesh high temperatures high evaporation rates and changing rainfall patterns are expected to cause a drought situation in this area in seasonal ponds the main source of water is rain so the water depth of seasonal ponds depends on the amount of rainfall intensity of evaporation seepage and the water retention capacity of the water body sandy soil in the ponds was a major problem for 19 of the fishpond owners in the northwestern part of bangladesh ali and rahman 1986 water levels impact aquaculture in many ways rahman 1992 due to the limited water retention capacity of sandy soil the water level of these seasonal ponds drops during the dry season rendering them completely unsuitable for fish rearing el sayed et al 1996 the water level starts to decrease gradually when the monsoon ceases and at the end of the dry season the water level is at its minimum in many places almost half of the ponds dry out additionally 60 of seasonal ponds retained water for 4 6 months of the year bbs 2004 these seasonal ponds are mainly being used for household activities but some are still abandoned due to their derelict and marshy nature as hypothesis new inoculations i e deploying polythene bed may solve the problem therefore the present experiment was conducted to

interactions of environmental parameters 4 1 1 soil condition in an aquatic ecosystem bottom soil serves as a repository for nutrients gupta et al 2001 the state of the soil has a significant impact on fish production in a body of water the capacity of ponds to retain water is primarily determined by the texture of the soil if a soil contains a high proportion of sand it has a low water retention capacity however if the soil contains a high proportion of clay particles it has a high water retention capacity a suitable soil for the construction of an earthen pond should contain no more than 30 sand the soil for the embankment and bottom of a pond should contain at least 20 30 clay hajek and boyd 1994 boyd and bowman 2017 prior to pond preparation the water retention capacity of the research ponds was extremely low due to the high proportion of sand particles in the soil prior to pond preparation the average percentage of sand and clay particles was 57 71 and 19 29 respectively but after applying clay to the polythene layer of the pond bottom the percentage of clay particles increased to 47 46 and the percentage of sand particles decreased to 24 87 as a result the research ponds water retention capacity was increased 4 1 2 water depth the survival rate and growth performance of fish are significantly affected by the depth of a pond and the temperature of the water el sayed et al 1996 ponds should not be shallower than 1 meter and deeper than 5 meters and the optimum depth should be 2 meters rahman 1992 for carp culture in tropical and subtropical regions a depth of about 1 meter is recommended pillay 1990 sarker and ali 2016 reported that the average depth of the pond was 2 6 metres a depth of about 2 m 6 feet in a pond is suitable from the biological point of view jhingran 1975 the average water depth of the t1 t2 and t3 was 6 23 5 71 and 5 07 feet or 1 89 1 74 and 1 55 meters respectively that was only 3 feet or 0 91 meters for the controlled ponds the highest water depth was found in t1 compared to t2 and t3 in the controlled ponds water depth was more than 3 feet only for six months although there was low water in ponds for the rest of the months sometimes it completely dried out so the ponds became unsuitable for fish culture application of polythene sheets on ponds bottom helped to retain water at a suitable range for fish culture throughout the year the average water depth of controlled ponds was 3 feet that was increased into 6 23 feet for t1 which was about 2 08 fold greater than the water holding capacity of controlled ponds alam et al 2002 conducted a study on carp polyculture in a pond and determined that the water temperature transparency ph and alkalinity were 31 85 c 30 11 cm 6 98 mg l 1 and 125 mgl 1 respectively hossain et al 2008 also observed similar water quality metrics in polyculture ponds water temperature 25 6 25 8 c dissolved oxygen do 5 3 5 6 mg l 1 ph 7 7 7 9 and transparency 28 5 29 7 cm water temperatures ranging from 27 1 to 28 7 c do concentrations ranging from 5 2 to 5 9 mgl 1 transparency ranging from 18 2 to 25 5 cm and ph ranging from 8 to 8 2 have also been seen in polyculture ponds ahmad et al 2013 mamun and mahmud 2014 also reported on similar water quality indicators the mean values for water quality indicators were determined to be within a range that is appropriate for fish cultivation in this study alikunhi 1957 swingle 1967 boyd 1998 in bangladesh 4 5 feet 1 2 1 5 m depth is good for aquaculture rahman 1992 treatments showed the level didn t cross the threshold line fig 4 so eventually it didn t affect the culture notably dry season may evaporate some amount of water polythene beds just blocked the water from soil suction which was adverse in controlled pond fig 5 4 1 3 water quality parameters all water quality metrics were within the acceptable range for fish culture in all treatments the mean water temperature ranged from 27 69 0 90 to 28 44 2 82 c in the present study which was almost like the observations of haider et al 2017 rumpa et al 2016 and sajitha and vijayamma 2016 boyd 1982 claimed that a level of transparency between 15 and 40 cm is beneficial for fish culture the water transparency of the present study was 25 63 0 41 to 27 69 1 64 cm which was between the range of haider et al 2017 and rumpa et al 2016 according to kamal et al 2012 the ph of seasonal ponds in natore bangladesh ranged between 6 88 and 9 22 the mean ph value in the experimental ponds was 7 38 0 33 to 7 72 0 60 which also showed similarity to the results of rumpa et al 2016 dissolved oxygen was 6 00 0 43 to 7 38 0 65mg l in the present investigation which was between the range found by sajitha and vijayamma 2016 munni et al 2013 and kamal et al 2012 hossain et al 2013 noticed the alkalinity ranged between 169 7 17 mg l to 305 3 19 9 mg l on the fish farm in natore bangladesh rumpa et al 2016 found total alkalinity 130 to 182 mg l which was more or less like the present study where alkalinity ranged between 161 88 10 51 to 178 13 17 27 mg l uddin 2003 found that nitrate nitrogen values ranged from 0 01 to 0 88 mg l which had similarity to the results 0 62 0 30 to 0 77 0 31 mg l of the present study bottom soil composition demonstrated no change which indicates less effect on water quality and fish growth as well fig 3 4 2 growth performance of treated species during the experiment fig 8 the weight gain of h molitrix silver carp and c cirrhosis mrigal differed significantly p 0 05 the mean weight gain of h molitrix varied between 259 20 38 16 to 435 11 13 83 g l rohita rohu 162 98 27 67 to 221 39 28 63 g c cirrhosus 162 29 8 27 to 234 05 11 72 g b gonionotus java barb 314 87 20 45 to 337 73 32 21 g and o niloticus tilapia 438 82 3 22 to 388 43 5 72 g ahmed 1993 found the growth rates of l rohita varied from 248 20 to 736 90 g 10 months which is more than the range of the present study which may be due to longer culture period sarker et al 2014 found the mean final weight gain g of silver carp tilapia rohu and mrigal were 258 8 154 8 119 7 and 124 7g which was less than the findings of the present research perhaps due to the short culture time the specific growth rate of h molitrix ranged between 0 64 0 04 to 0 82 0 01 l rohita 0 54 0 06 to 0 64 0 05 and c cirrhosus 0 56 0 01 to 0 67 0 01 asadujjaman and hossain 2016 discovered that the sgr of h molitrix l rohita and c mrigala in carp polyculture pond ranged between 0 94 to 1 29 0 84 to 1 21 and 0 87 to 1 24 respectively which was higher than the result obtained in the preset study possibly due to variations in initial size feed and so on the sgr of b gonionotus 1 030 01 to 1 050 03 matched the findings of asadujjaman and hossain 2016 0 85 to 1 05 according to das et al 2018 the sgr of o niloticus was 2 70 0 01 to 2 71 0 02 which was lower than the findings in the present research 2 09 to 2 43 this might be due to the variation of the culture system feed used etc in the experiment the food conversion ratio fcr was 1 00 0 22 1 37 0 30 and 1 16 0 30 in t1 t2 and t3 respectively the finding was like that obtained by begum et al 2017 dev 2015 ahmed et al 2014 and duston et al 2004 who reported fcr values ranging from 1 01 to 1 38 1 11 to 1 41 1 18 to 1 25 and 1 03 to 1 20 in tilapia culture the survival rate of h molitrix and l rohita was 93 16 to 98 55 and 96 90 to 97 54 which was higher than the study of khan et al 2018 who found an 85 75 to 87 50 and 90 00 to 93 50 survival rate perhaps due to variation in water quality but the survival rate of c cirrhosus 80 05 to 93 45 had similarity to the findings 90 00 to 93 50 of khan et al 2018 in their 2018 research halim et al 2018 found the survival rate of b gonionotus to be 91 05 where in the present research it was 95 81 to 100 ahmed et al 2014 reported the survival rate of o niloticus ranged from 95 76 97 54 which is comparable to the present study where it was 95 20 to 100 fig 9 4 3 variation of production the net production varied from 17 33 1 43 to 23 91 0 29 kg decimal among the treatments the average net production obtained from the controlled ponds was 4 35 kg decimal that was 20 68 kg decimal in the present research which was about 5 13 times greater than controlled ponds in the experiment water depth influenced fish production production was significantly higher in t1 where water depth was also higher among the treatments the net production of the present research ranged between 4282 07 355 14 to 5908 59 72 72 kg ha 8months shing et al 2013 obtained almost similar production where yearly fish yield was 3400 6800 kg ha rumpaet al 2016 haque et al 2015 and murty et al 1978 observed the production was 2122 92 333 60 2747 47 116 47 2618 85 57 5 to 2747 47 116 47 and 3858 kg ha yr which was less than the finding obtained from the present research it may be due to the difference in species composition stocking density feed etc 5 conclusion water levels in seasonal ponds steadily decline following the monsoon and water scarcity is relatively prevalent during the summer this is the most critical period for fish culture because fish grow at a faster rate during this time sometimes the ponds become fully dry out most pond owners in bangladesh s northwest region are unaware of fish culture due to a lack of available water in their ponds the study showed that polyethene coated clay bed can retain a suitable range of water in ponds during the whole experimental period and year round water depth 2 12 2 44 m 6 8 feet increases fish production as well so it can be concluded that the research findings will aid in the development of a sustainable aquaculture technique that will mitigate production losses and thus sustain the required fish production by

917,summer ponds in north west bangladesh are suffering from sandy soil and drought from january to december 2017 the university of rajshahi bangladesh conducted an experiment to improve seasonal ponds water retention capacity and productivity in nine seasonal ponds polythene and clay were used on the bottom of three treatments t1 t2 and t3 selected five controlled ponds were used to compare water depth and production while the average water depth was above 3 feet 0 91 m in controlled ponds only for 6 months polythene based model ponds lengthened water holding capacity with average water depths of 6 23 feet 1 87 m 5 71 feet 1 71 m and 5 07 feet 1 52 m in t1 t2 and t3 respectively throughout the year the average net production of the research ponds in eight months was 20 68 kg decimal whereas it was only 4 35 kg decimal for controlled ponds t1 exhibited 2 07 fold greater water depth and 4 75 fold greater productions than controlled ponds net production 5908 59 72 72 kg ha 8month of t1 was significantly p 0 05 higher than t2 and t3 thus using polythene and clay in the pond bottom and covering it with water up to 8 feet 2 4 m deep will increase the water holding capacity and

2018 aquaculture benefits poor farmers livelihoods by increasing food supply employment and income edwards 2000 there are millions of ponds around the country about 55 of ponds are seasonal in the northwestern part of bangladesh islam and haque 2010 seasonal ponds are those that cannot hold water all year particularly during the dry season in a fish culture system the water depth and total volume of water available to fish are critical not only is adequate water depth required for optimal growth but also to give sufficient room and oxygen for fish existence in the north west part of bangladesh fish production faces an enormous problem this region is the most severely drought prone area in bangladesh high temperatures high evaporation rates and changing rainfall patterns are expected to cause a drought situation in this area in seasonal ponds the main source of water is rain so the water depth of seasonal ponds depends on the amount of rainfall intensity of evaporation seepage and the water retention capacity of the water body sandy soil in the ponds was a major problem for 19 of the fishpond owners in the northwestern part of bangladesh ali and rahman 1986 water levels impact aquaculture in many ways rahman 1992 due to the limited water retention capacity of sandy soil the water level of these seasonal ponds drops during the dry season rendering them completely unsuitable for fish rearing el sayed et al 1996 the water level starts to decrease gradually when the monsoon ceases and at the end of the dry season the water level is at its minimum in many places almost half of the ponds dry out additionally 60 of seasonal ponds retained water for 4 6 months of the year bbs 2004 these seasonal ponds are mainly being used for household activities but some are still abandoned due to their derelict and marshy nature as hypothesis new inoculations i e deploying polythene bed may solve the problem therefore the present experiment was conducted to minimize the problem of decreasing water level by clay bedded polythene coated layer at the pond bottom and to increase the water holding capacity as well as the fish production of seasonal ponds 2

interactions of environmental parameters 4 1 1 soil condition in an aquatic ecosystem bottom soil serves as a repository for nutrients gupta et al 2001 the state of the soil has a significant impact on fish production in a body of water the capacity of ponds to retain water is primarily determined by the texture of the soil if a soil contains a high proportion of sand it has a low water retention capacity however if the soil contains a high proportion of clay particles it has a high water retention capacity a suitable soil for the construction of an earthen pond should contain no more than 30 sand the soil for the embankment and bottom of a pond should contain at least 20 30 clay hajek and boyd 1994 boyd and bowman 2017 prior to pond preparation the water retention capacity of the research ponds was extremely low due to the high proportion of sand particles in the soil prior to pond preparation the average percentage of sand and clay particles was 57 71 and 19 29 respectively but after applying clay to the polythene layer of the pond bottom the percentage of clay particles increased to 47 46 and the percentage of sand particles decreased to 24 87 as a result the research ponds water retention capacity was increased 4 1 2 water depth the survival rate and growth performance of fish are significantly affected by the depth of a pond and the temperature of the water el sayed et al 1996 ponds should not be shallower than 1 meter and deeper than 5 meters and the optimum depth should be 2 meters rahman 1992 for carp culture in tropical and subtropical regions a depth of about 1 meter is recommended pillay 1990 sarker and ali 2016 reported that the average depth of the pond was 2 6 metres a depth of about 2 m 6 feet in a pond is suitable from the biological point of view jhingran 1975 the average water depth of the t1 t2 and t3 was 6 23 5 71 and 5 07 feet or 1 89 1 74 and 1 55 meters respectively that was only 3 feet or 0 91 meters for the controlled ponds the highest water depth was found in t1 compared to t2 and t3 in the controlled ponds water depth was more than 3 feet only for six months although there was low water in ponds for the rest of the months sometimes it completely dried out so the ponds became unsuitable for fish culture application of polythene sheets on ponds bottom helped to retain water at a suitable range for fish culture throughout the year the average water depth of controlled ponds was 3 feet that was increased into 6 23 feet for t1 which was about 2 08 fold greater than the water holding capacity of controlled ponds alam et al 2002 conducted a study on carp polyculture in a pond and determined that the water temperature transparency ph and alkalinity were 31 85 c 30 11 cm 6 98 mg l 1 and 125 mgl 1 respectively hossain et al 2008 also observed similar water quality metrics in polyculture ponds water temperature 25 6 25 8 c dissolved oxygen do 5 3 5 6 mg l 1 ph 7 7 7 9 and transparency 28 5 29 7 cm water temperatures ranging from 27 1 to 28 7 c do concentrations ranging from 5 2 to 5 9 mgl 1 transparency ranging from 18 2 to 25 5 cm and ph ranging from 8 to 8 2 have also been seen in polyculture ponds ahmad et al 2013 mamun and mahmud 2014 also reported on similar water quality indicators the mean values for water quality indicators were determined to be within a range that is appropriate for fish cultivation in this study alikunhi 1957 swingle 1967 boyd 1998 in bangladesh 4 5 feet 1 2 1 5 m depth is good for aquaculture rahman 1992 treatments showed the level didn t cross the threshold line fig 4 so eventually it didn t affect the culture notably dry season may evaporate some amount of water polythene beds just blocked the water from soil suction which was adverse in controlled pond fig 5 4 1 3 water quality parameters all water quality metrics were within the acceptable range for fish culture in all treatments the mean water temperature ranged from 27 69 0 90 to 28 44 2 82 c in the present study which was almost like the observations of haider et al 2017 rumpa et al 2016 and sajitha and vijayamma 2016 boyd 1982 claimed that a level of transparency between 15 and 40 cm is beneficial for fish culture the water transparency of the present study was 25 63 0 41 to 27 69 1 64 cm which was between the range of haider et al 2017 and rumpa et al 2016 according to kamal et al 2012 the ph of seasonal ponds in natore bangladesh ranged between 6 88 and 9 22 the mean ph value in the experimental ponds was 7 38 0 33 to 7 72 0 60 which also showed similarity to the results of rumpa et al 2016 dissolved oxygen was 6 00 0 43 to 7 38 0 65mg l in the present investigation which was between the range found by sajitha and vijayamma 2016 munni et al 2013 and kamal et al 2012 hossain et al 2013 noticed the alkalinity ranged between 169 7 17 mg l to 305 3 19 9 mg l on the fish farm in natore bangladesh rumpa et al 2016 found total alkalinity 130 to 182 mg l which was more or less like the present study where alkalinity ranged between 161 88 10 51 to 178 13 17 27 mg l uddin 2003 found that nitrate nitrogen values ranged from 0 01 to 0 88 mg l which had similarity to the results 0 62 0 30 to 0 77 0 31 mg l of the present study bottom soil composition demonstrated no change which indicates less effect on water quality and fish growth as well fig 3 4 2 growth performance of treated species during the experiment fig 8 the weight gain of h molitrix silver carp and c cirrhosis mrigal differed significantly p 0 05 the mean weight gain of h molitrix varied between 259 20 38 16 to 435 11 13 83 g l rohita rohu 162 98 27 67 to 221 39 28 63 g c cirrhosus 162 29 8 27 to 234 05 11 72 g b gonionotus java barb 314 87 20 45 to 337 73 32 21 g and o niloticus tilapia 438 82 3 22 to 388 43 5 72 g ahmed 1993 found the growth rates of l rohita varied from 248 20 to 736 90 g 10 months which is more than the range of the present study which may be due to longer culture period sarker et al 2014 found the mean final weight gain g of silver carp tilapia rohu and mrigal were 258 8 154 8 119 7 and 124 7g which was less than the findings of the present research perhaps due to the short culture time the specific growth rate of h molitrix ranged between 0 64 0 04 to 0 82 0 01 l rohita 0 54 0 06 to 0 64 0 05 and c cirrhosus 0 56 0 01 to 0 67 0 01 asadujjaman and hossain 2016 discovered that the sgr of h molitrix l rohita and c mrigala in carp polyculture pond ranged between 0 94 to 1 29 0 84 to 1 21 and 0 87 to 1 24 respectively which was higher than the result obtained in the preset study possibly due to variations in initial size feed and so on the sgr of b gonionotus 1 030 01 to 1 050 03 matched the findings of asadujjaman and hossain 2016 0 85 to 1 05 according to das et al 2018 the sgr of o niloticus was 2 70 0 01 to 2 71 0 02 which was lower than the findings in the present research 2 09 to 2 43 this might be due to the variation of the culture system feed used etc in the experiment the food conversion ratio fcr was 1 00 0 22 1 37 0 30 and 1 16 0 30 in t1 t2 and t3 respectively the finding was like that obtained by begum et al 2017 dev 2015 ahmed et al 2014 and duston et al 2004 who reported fcr values ranging from 1 01 to 1 38 1 11 to 1 41 1 18 to 1 25 and 1 03 to 1 20 in tilapia culture the survival rate of h molitrix and l rohita was 93 16 to 98 55 and 96 90 to 97 54 which was higher than the study of khan et al 2018 who found an 85 75 to 87 50 and 90 00 to 93 50 survival rate perhaps due to variation in water quality but the survival rate of c cirrhosus 80 05 to 93 45 had similarity to the findings 90 00 to 93 50 of khan et al 2018 in their 2018 research halim et al 2018 found the survival rate of b gonionotus to be 91 05 where in the present research it was 95 81 to 100 ahmed et al 2014 reported the survival rate of o niloticus ranged from 95 76 97 54 which is comparable to the present study where it was 95 20 to 100 fig 9 4 3 variation of production the net production varied from 17 33 1 43 to 23 91 0 29 kg decimal among the treatments the average net production obtained from the controlled ponds was 4 35 kg decimal that was 20 68 kg decimal in the present research which was about 5 13 times greater than controlled ponds in the experiment water depth influenced fish production production was significantly higher in t1 where water depth was also higher among the treatments the net production of the present research ranged between 4282 07 355 14 to 5908 59 72 72 kg ha 8months shing et al 2013 obtained almost similar production where yearly fish yield was 3400 6800 kg ha rumpaet al 2016 haque et al 2015 and murty et al 1978 observed the production was 2122 92 333 60 2747 47 116 47 2618 85 57 5 to 2747 47 116 47 and 3858 kg ha yr which was less than the finding obtained from the present research it may be due to the difference in species composition stocking density feed etc 5 conclusion water levels in seasonal ponds steadily decline following the monsoon and water scarcity is relatively prevalent during the summer this is the most critical period for fish culture because fish grow at a faster rate during this time sometimes the ponds become fully dry out most pond owners in bangladesh s northwest region are unaware of fish culture due to a lack of available water in their ponds the study showed that polyethene coated clay bed can retain a suitable range of water in ponds during the whole experimental period and year round water depth 2 12 2 44 m 6 8 feet increases fish production as well so it can be concluded that the research findings will aid in the development of a sustainable aquaculture technique that will mitigate production losses and thus sustain the required fish production by retaining water in seasonal ponds in bangladesh s northwest region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper

918,in 2021 an abundance of phytoplankton species was observed in lake saemangeum we analyzed the relationship between phytoplankton abundance and salinity by comparing the distribution of salinity that changed because of freshwater inflow and drainage sluice gate operation thirteen field surveys were conducted monthly basic surveys from january to november 2021 and additional surveys after rainfall in august and september at seven sites during the survey period 46 94 species were recorded pearson correlation coefficients were used to analyze the relationship between salinity and abundance of the dominant phytoplankton species the result showed that cyclotella atomus stephanodiscus hantzschii phormidium tenue and chaetoceros spp were correlated with salinity chaetoceros spp was significantly positively correlated p 0 001 whereas all other species were negatively correlated moreover the correlation coefficient between seven species and salinity was close to zero compared with the general correlation coefficient of salinity and abundance the point biserial correlation coefficient showed a higher overall absolute value four species skeletonema spp cyclotella atomus phormidium tenue chaetoceros spp exhibited p 0 001 particularly the correlation coefficient of cyclotella atomus changed significantly from 0 237 to 0 451 whereas that of phormidium tenue changed from 0 207 to 0 431 the results imply that salinity can affect the distribution and survival of euryhaline species therefore high salinity may inhibit some freshwater and euryhaline species in the lake however further research is required to validate our findings keywords phytoplankton salinity lake saemangeum abundance cyclotella atomus euryhaline 1 introduction the large scale construction of the saemangeum seawall spanned over a period of 16 years november 1991 to april 2006 with a total length of 33 9 km it was created to protect agricultural farms and industrial points this project converted 401 km2 of gunsan si buan gun gimje si and jeollabuk do areas into land corresponding to two thirds of the seoul s area kim et al 2009 before the construction of the saemangeum seawall a well developed tideland was formed by sediment deposition from the dongjin and mangyeong rivers and a healthy coastal ecosystem was maintained through complex and organic relationships among various organisms an and koh 1992 however the ecosystem changed after the construction of the seawall due to changes in tidal intensity erosion and damage to the surrounding tideland koo et al 2008 lake sihwa a typical artificial lake formed along with lake saemangeum quickly underwent eutrophication after the construction of the seawall owing to the inflow of polluted wastewater from nearby complexes the deterioration of water quality accelerated when the seawall blocked the outflow of water to the west coast shin et al 2000 in particular an outbreak of phytoplankton growth occurs frequently due to the development of an industrial complex near lake saemangeum and the flow of eutrophic freshwater from the mangyeong and dongjin rivers phytoplankton is an important primary producer in the ocean with a unique distribution pattern in each region phytoplankton species occur in various ecological niches like freshwater seawater and brackish water and their succession pattern according to species is clear in brackish waters where rivers are well developed lee 1989 however phytoplankton ecosystems differ between natural ecosystems and lakes formed by human development such as lake saemangeum shin et al 2000 and rapid environmental changes frequently cause red tides owing to toxic phytoplankton growth gomez and claustre 2000 previous studies investigating environmental factors and changes in phytoplankton in the lake saemangeum assessed phytoplankton outbreak yoo et al 2002 distribution of organic carbon park et al 2009 fluctuation in numbers due to the inflow of freshwater from mangyeong river kim et al 2009 and long term fluctuations in phytoplankton populations yeo 2012 however the effects of freshwater inflow on the phytoplankton populations and changes in species distributions causing outbreaks in lake saemangeum remain unclear lake saemangeum the field of this study is a huge brackish lake formed by the seawall after the seawall was constructed the flow of the tide changed dramatically subsequently altering the salinity profile jeong and yang 2015 reported that the average salinity before the construction of the saemangeum seawall 2002 2003 was 28 1 psu but immediately after its completion 2006 2007 the salinity decreased to 22 3 psu with a decrease in the exchange rate of seawater and was 22 4 psu in 2008 2009 according to a recent survey 2013 2018 the salinity distribution was 8 37 1 42 psu in the summer and 23 82 1 66 psu in the winter oda et al 2018 moreover the distribution of phytoplankton also changed after the completion of the seawall according to a two year survey conducted from 2006 to 2007 a total of 191 phytoplankton species in lake saemangeum were found and in their order of appearance frequency were as follows diatoms 94 species 49 2 chlorophyceae 31 species 16 2 dinophyceae 24 species 12 6 cyanophyceae 24 species 12 6 and euglenoidea 11 species 5 8 yeo 2010 more recently in 2013 the monitoring of saemangeum reservoir natural ecosystem report 2021 identified a total of 333 species of phytoplankton their order of appearance frequency was chlorophyceae 140 species 42 0 diatoms 126 species 37 8 cyanophyceae 38 species 11 4 euglenoidea 16 species 4 8 and dinophyceae 8 species 2 4 according to the same report in 2020 a total of 346 species of phytoplankton were identified the updated order of appearance frequency was diatoms 151 species 43 6 chlorophyceae 122 species 35 3 cyanophyceae 27 species 7 8 euglenoidea 18 species 5 2 and dinophyceae 10 species 3 5 pilkaitytë et al 2004 found that salinity did not affect chl a concentration changes using a mesocosm approach in the darss zingst estuary for a salinity amplitude of up to 6 psu phytoplankton adapts to changes in salinity within a week in addition according to shadrin et al 2021 for microphytobenthos in the hypersaline 80 90 psu water bodies of bay sivash crimea there was no significant correlation pearson coefficient between the number of species and salinity across all sampling periods it was unlikely that an increase in salinity would have caused changes in the lagoon s microbial benthos according to these authors since most of the major dominant species of lake saemangeum are euryhaline it is difficult to determine the trend for salinity and phytoplankton in the case of skeletonema balzano et al 2011 reported that all strains exhibited growth at salinities between 10 and 35 ppt however the lowest salinity at which growth was observed differed between species and even within the same species phormidium tenue was the dominant species with an appearance rate of 21 at a very high salinity of 36 42 psu salinity levels in lake saemangeum are lower in the mangrove forest of the sandspit coastal area of southern karachi pakistan ahmed et al 2016 the freshwater diatom stephanodiscus hantzschii is a winter blooming species jung et al 2009 and extensively inhabits the waters of the nakdong river estuary in korea baek et al 2019 implying that it is freshwater plankton however blooming occurs at low salinity levels nevertheless since salinity and phytoplankton distribution have changed together in lake saemangeum whether salinity affects phytoplankton distribution needs to be addressed since the above studies showed cases where salinity had no direct effect on the increase in phytoplankton abundance this study attempted to approach the question from a statistical perspective on phytoplankton appearance and not their abundance for the same area as in this study the monitoring of saemangeum reservoir natural ecosystem report 2021 employed the canonical correspondence analysis cca to determine the correlations between the phytoplankton present and the ph dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod salinity chlorophyll a total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp correlation with environmental factors was analyzed s hantzschii cyclotella stephanodiscus etc showed a high correlation with nutrient levels however a correlation with salinity was not identified because cca was more useful in evaluating the relative importance among many variables therefore this lack of correlation may be due to the statistical analysis methods used specifically in the case of freshwater phytoplankton like s hantzschii in cca although a high correlation with nutrients such as phosphorus was observed no correlation with salinity was recorded i e even when fresh water with a high phosphorus concentration was added the spatial distribution of s hantzschii could have been misunderstood as being contingent only on phosphorus levels and not salinity we aimed to answer the question does the primary salinity change because artificial structural changes affect the distribution of phytoplankton and therefore a new approach was needed thus we hypothesized that it was better to approach this as a classification problem rather than a quantitative association therefore in lake saemangeum a huge brackish artificial lake we first analyzed the dominant species by period to intuitively examine their relationships with salinity next statistical analysis was performed by categorically dividing the data as 0 or 1 correspondingly according to the presence or absence of each species we attempted to analyze whether a significant relationship between salinity and the distribution of phytoplankton could be identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed in saemangeum a large artificial lake that was formed by the construction of a seawall to secure agricultural water in the yellow sea of korea samples were collected from seven locations in lake saemangeum and salinity and phytoplankton abundances were investigated first the species composition and abundance of phytoplankton were identified and the seven dominant species in terms of abundance skeletonema spp cyclotella atomus stephanodiscus hantzschii phormidium tenue chaetoceros spp cylindrotheca closterium and prorocentrum minimum were selected to determine the species abundance according to the characteristics of each location and salinity quantiles furthermore the maximum values of species abundance and salinity at that location were identified the correlation between species abundances of phytoplankton and salinity was also analyzed water samples were collected once a month from january to november 2021 from the surface and bottom layers of seven points and additionally collected once after each rain in august and september the survey locations are shown in fig 1 a total of 12 data columns point layer month day salinity skeletonema cyclotella stephanodiscus phormidium chaetoceros cylindrotheca prorocentrum with 143 rows were created salinity was measured in the field using the ocean seven 310 idronaut brugherio mb italy multi parameter water quality meter phytoplankton was collected with a niskin water sampler placed in a 500 ml polyethylene sample bottle and fixed with lugol s solution the samples were then transferred to the laboratory concentrated to 70 ml by precipitation to remove the supernatant and then counted under an optical microscope using a sedgwick rafter counting chamber for the classification and identification of phytoplankton the literature including hirose et al 1977 shim 1994 cupp 1943 dodge 1982 jeong 1993 chihara and murano 1997 and tomas 1997 was referenced 2 2 statistical analysis to analyze the correlation between salinity and phytoplankton abundance the pearson correlation coefficient and p value were obtained using the r language cor test x y function for salinity x and phytoplankton abundance y 1 r 1 n 1 x i x y i y s x s y where n is total data number x a n d y are the means of x and y respectively and s x and s y are the standard deviations of x and y respectively the cor test x y function in r was used to calculate the p value from the test statics t 2 t r n 2 1 r 2 the point biserial correlation coefficient was calculated to understand the effect of salinity on the presence or absence of phytoplankton this is a correlation coefficient obtained by substituting 0 or 1 for the abundance of phytoplankton it is 1 if the abundance of phytoplankton is greater than 1 otherwise 0 3 results and analysis 3 1 characteristics of phytoplankton distribution 3 1 1 composition and number of species choi et al 2013 reported that various communities such as bacillariophyceae chlorophyta dinophyceae and cyanophyceae appeared in lake saemangeum in 2006 and 2007 but the clusters gradually became less diverse and the proportions of bacillariophyceae and dinophyceae have increased since 2009 in this study chlorophyta bacillariophyceae and dinophyceae were observed at the highest frequencies although other communities i e cryptophyceae cyanophyceae euglenoidea were also observed at varying rates across sampling sites the number of species was 46 to 94 during the survey period from january to november 2021 the precipitation during this period was the lowest at 14 5 mm in february and the highest at 214 5 mm in august table 1 the lowest and highest precipitation was recorded in winter 37 5 mm january and february and summer 539 mm july august and september respectively fig 2 shows the composition and number of species of phytoplankton the smallest number of species appeared in the survey conducted after heavy rains in august while the highest number of species appeared in april with very low precipitation 21 mm in all surveys the appearance of bacillariophyceae was high and it was much higher in winter january and february than in summer july and august from april the species ratio of chlorophyceae increased following the winter season and mostly appeared in the me1 and de1 estuaries it is believed that various species appeared because of the increased water temperature of the river however lake saemangeum is operated to maintain a water level of approximately 1 5 m elevation level since freshwater flows in from the east and seawater is exchanged through two sluice gates in the west it is considered that the change of species composition of phytoplankton by location and season is due to the inflow of freshwater or seawater 3 1 2 abundance the survey result for phytoplankton abundance from january to november 2021 fig 3 showed that the average abundance after heavy rains in august was the lowest and cylindrotheca closterium a bacillariophyceae appeared at a high density in november indicating the highest average abundance the abundance of bacillariophyceae was the highest during most of the survey period followed by that of cyanobacteria in other words in lake saemangeum algal blooms mainly caused by bacillariophyceae occur throughout the year and algal blooms caused by cyanophyceae occur concurrently from april to october 3 2 relationship between phytoplankton distribution and salinity 3 2 1 comparison between salinity and phytoplankton abundance by survey period seven dominant species of phytoplankton were selected and analyzed in order of abundance to investigate the relationship between salinity and phytoplankton in lake saemangeum the selected dominant species were skeletonema spp cyclotella atomus stephanodiscus hantzschii phormidium tenue chaetoceros spp cylindrotheca closterium and prorocentrum minimum first to classify each sampling site for convenience quartile values and averages of salinity were calculated and presented in table 2 sites with a median and average value of salinity lower than 0 5 and 2 psu respectively were classified as fresh sites with both median and average values over 20 psu were classified as sea and every value in between as brackish to examine the relationship between phytoplankton and salinity at each sampling site salinity and abundance are presented as heat maps shown in figs 4 5 and 6 salinity skeletonema spp cyclotella atomus stephanodiscus hantzschii phormidium tenue chaetoceros spp cylindrotheca closterium and prorocentrum minimum are shown from top to bottom the unit of abundance is cells ml and salinity is plotted by multiplying the value by 10 for the readability of the heat map to set the dimension to 0 1 psu the survey dates are jan to oct 2021 from left to right on the heat map the displayed color is darker if the value of salinity or abundance is large and light if the value is low thus the relationship between phytoplankton and salinity at each point can be identified in chronological order the species skeletonema potamos which appeared most frequently mainly inhabits waters with a salinity of 2 34 hasle and evensen 1976 it is also known to inhabit mainly eutrophic rivers or downstream waters of estuaries in this study s potamos showed a high abundance in both brackish and seawater and the abundance was lower when salinity was close to 0 psu in freshwater sampling sites de1 and me1 cyclotella atomus a bacillariophyceae is a basophilic species that is correlated with high conductivity and salinity cyclotella atomus and cyclotella meneghiniana are often dominant species in downstream rivers makarewicz 1987 cyclotella atomus grows well at water temperatures of 15 20 c and occurs in maximum abundance at the upper end of this range however it is often observed in freshwater brackish water and saltwater because it can survive at high temperatures withstand turbulence and frequent osmotic stresses yang et al 2005 in this study the abundance of cyclotella atomus was low and did not appear at sampling sites dl2 and ml3 sea water with high salinity stephanodiscus hantzschii a bacillariophyceae adapts well to low illuminance and nutrient levels and is known as a typical eutrophication indicator van donk and kilham 1990 in this study a high abundance of s hantzchii was observed in the freshwater sampling sites me1 and de1 the downstream portion of the mangyeong and dongjin rivers during the winter season jan mar but it was not observed afterward phormidium tenue a cyanophyceae showed a wide range of resistance to salinity ranging from 0 to 100 it showed the best growth rate in the salinity range of 16 to 25 ppt and a rapid decrease in growth rate above 40 ppt rai sv and rajashekhar 2016 thus this species showed high abundance mainly in freshwater areas de1 me1 and brackish areas de2 me2 when salinity was low chaetoceros spp a bacillariophyceae showed high abundance in winter especially february when salinity was high and did not appear in freshwater areas me1 de1 in contrast c closterium appeared mainly in summer when salinity was low but could also be observed when salinity was high 20 psu or more prorocentrum minimum a dinophyceae is one of the causative organisms of red tides it has been reported that this species can generally survive in a wide range of salinity of 5 37 ppt at a temperature below 4 c but a natural state with a salinity of 4 ppt or less is clearly outside the range of optimal environmental conditions skarlato et al 2018 thus this species was rarely observed in freshwater areas me1 de1 and was observed with low abundance in the brackish sampling sites me2 and de2 meanwhile the dl2 and ml3 sampling sites in sea water areas showed higher abundance than that in brackish water at a time when salinity was high 3 2 2 phytoplankton abundance maximum and salinity the maximum abundance values and salinity values for each phytoplankton species are summarized in table 3 in the surface layer of the freshwater area de 1 outbreaks of cyclotella atomus a bacillariophyceae and phormidium tenue a cyanophyceae occurred when the salinity was 0 104 psu one difference between the surface layer of me 1 and de 1 was that an outbreak of stephanodiscus a bacillariophyta occurred when the salinity increased to 10 5 psu in the brackish surface layer of de 2 there was an outbreak of skeletonema spp and cyclotella atomus which belong to bacillariophyceae when the salinity was 2 954 psu furthermore there was an outbreak of cylindrotheca closterium when the salinity was 9 814 psu and an outbreak of phormidium tenue when the salinity was 11 080 psu in the dl 2 surface layer there was an outbreak of skeletonema spp when the salinity was 5 793 psu and an outbreak of cylindrotheca closterium when the salinity was 20 497 psu in addition outbreaks of skeletonema spp cycllotella atomus and phormidium tenue were observed in the surface layer of me2 with salinities of 20 717 4 428 and 1 440 psu respectively finally there was an outbreak of skeletonema spp and cylindrotheca closterium in the mk7 surface layer and the ml3 surface layer furthermore the salinities were 9 909 and 8 229 psu in mk7 and 6 336 and 8 896 psu in ml3 meanwhile all sampling sites classified as seawater in table 2 were in the low layers the abundance was less than 10 000 cells ml in the low layers of de2 dl2 and ml3 although they were low layers all three sites have a depth of less than 10 m hence the effect of high salinity cannot be excluded due to low phytoplankton abundance consequently additional research is needed to determine whether the high salinity in lake saemangeum is an indicator that eutrophic freshwater has been diluted with seawater or whether the phytoplankton outbreak was caused by the direct effect of salinity or the indirect effect of creating a competitive environment between species 3 2 3 correlation between phytoplankton species abundance and salinity the pearson correlation coefficient between salinity and phytoplankton abundance was determined table 4 the result showed that abundances of cyclotella atomus stephanodiscus hantzschii phormidium tenue and chaetoceros spp were correlated with salinity and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0 238 to 0 319 chaetoceros spp showed a positive correlation coefficient whereas all the other species showed a negative correlation coefficient meanwhile the abundances of skeletonema spp cylindrotheca closterium and prorocentrum minimum showed little correlation with salinity consequently the correlation coefficient between the abundance of seven species and salinity was almost zero and the p value was less than 0 001 for chaetoceros spp only the abundances of three of the seven dominant species showed little correlation with salinity as shown in figs 4 6 seven species of phytoplankton appeared in large blooming depending on the observation period however sometimes these did not appear at all therefore we decided that it was better to approach this as a classification problem rather than a quantitative relation the point biserial correlation coefficient was obtained by dividing the appearance of phytoplankton into 1 and 0 table 5 the point biserial correlation coefficient showed an overall higher absolute value than the general correlation coefficient for salinity and the presence of each phytoplankton in particular skeletonema spp which had a correlation coefficient of 0 057 showed a relatively significant positive correlation of 0 351 with the point biserial correlation coefficient overall the absolute value of the correlation coefficient was large and there were four species skeletonema spp cyclotella atomus phormidium tenue chaetoceros spp with a p value less than 0 001 particularly the correlation coefficient of cyclotella atomus changed significantly from 0 237 to 0 451 additionally the correlation coefficient of phormidium tenue changed significantly from 0 207 to 0 431 this implies that even a euryhaline species can be greatly affected by salinity regarding its distribution and survival 4 conclusions in this study the correlation between salinity and phytoplankton abundance was low in lake saemangeum a large artificial brackish waterbody however herein we tried to identify the correlation between salinity and phytoplankton from the statistical perspective depending on the appearance of phytoplankton and not their abundance the absolute value of the point biserial correlation coefficient was larger than the general correlation coefficient using abundance and salinity showed a significant correlation with the presence or absence of phytoplankton in lake saemangeum in conclusion most of the phytoplankton species blooming in large quantities in lake saemangeum were euryhaline but some species were affected by salinity depending on the time and where they appeared declaration of competing interest none ethical statement the research was done according to ethical standards

918,in 2021 an abundance of phytoplankton species was observed in lake saemangeum we analyzed the relationship between phytoplankton abundance and salinity by comparing the distribution of salinity that changed because of freshwater inflow and drainage sluice gate operation thirteen field surveys were conducted monthly basic surveys from january to november 2021 and additional surveys after rainfall in august and september at seven sites during the survey period 46 94 species were recorded pearson correlation coefficients were used to analyze the relationship between salinity and abundance of the dominant phytoplankton species the result showed that cyclotella atomus stephanodiscus hantzschii phormidium tenue and chaetoceros spp were correlated with salinity chaetoceros spp was significantly positively correlated p 0 001 whereas all other species were negatively correlated moreover the correlation coefficient between seven species and salinity was close to zero compared with the general correlation coefficient of salinity and abundance the point biserial correlation coefficient showed a higher overall absolute value four species skeletonema spp cyclotella atomus phormidium tenue chaetoceros spp exhibited p 0 001 particularly the correlation coefficient of cyclotella atomus changed significantly from 0 237 to 0 451 whereas that of phormidium tenue changed from 0 207 to 0 431 the results imply that salinity can affect the distribution and survival of euryhaline species therefore high salinity may inhibit some freshwater and euryhaline species in the lake however further research is required to validate our findings keywords phytoplankton salinity lake saemangeum abundance cyclotella atomus euryhaline 1 introduction the large scale construction of the saemangeum seawall spanned over a period of 16 years november 1991 to april 2006 with a total length of 33 9 km it was created to protect agricultural farms and industrial points this project converted 401 km2 of gunsan si buan gun gimje si and jeollabuk do areas into land corresponding to two thirds of the seoul s area kim et al 2009 before the construction of the saemangeum seawall a well developed tideland was formed by sediment deposition from the dongjin and mangyeong rivers and a healthy coastal ecosystem was maintained through complex and organic relationships among various organisms an and koh 1992 however the ecosystem changed after the construction of the seawall due to changes in tidal intensity erosion and damage to the surrounding tideland koo et al 2008 lake sihwa a typical artificial lake formed along with lake saemangeum quickly underwent eutrophication after the construction of the seawall owing to the inflow of polluted wastewater from nearby complexes the deterioration of water quality accelerated when the seawall blocked the outflow of water to the west coast shin et al 2000 in particular an outbreak of phytoplankton growth occurs frequently due to the development of an industrial complex near lake saemangeum and the flow of eutrophic freshwater from the mangyeong and dongjin rivers phytoplankton is an important primary producer in the ocean with a unique distribution pattern in each region phytoplankton species occur in various ecological niches like freshwater seawater and brackish water and their succession pattern according to species is clear in brackish waters where rivers are well developed lee 1989 however phytoplankton ecosystems differ between natural ecosystems and lakes formed by human development such as lake saemangeum shin et al 2000 and rapid environmental changes frequently cause red tides owing to toxic phytoplankton growth gomez and claustre 2000 previous studies investigating environmental factors and changes in phytoplankton in the lake saemangeum assessed phytoplankton outbreak yoo et al 2002 distribution of organic carbon park et al 2009 fluctuation in numbers due to the inflow of freshwater from mangyeong river kim et al 2009 and long term fluctuations in phytoplankton populations yeo 2012 however the effects of freshwater inflow on the phytoplankton populations and changes in species distributions causing outbreaks in lake saemangeum remain unclear lake saemangeum the field of this study is a huge brackish lake formed by the seawall after the seawall was constructed the flow of the tide changed dramatically subsequently altering the salinity profile jeong and yang 2015 reported that the average salinity before the construction of the saemangeum seawall 2002 2003 was 28 1 psu but immediately after its completion 2006 2007 the salinity decreased to 22 3 psu with a decrease in the exchange rate of seawater and was 22 4 psu in 2008 2009 according to a recent survey 2013 2018 the salinity distribution was 8 37 1 42 psu in the summer and 23 82 1 66 psu in the winter oda et al 2018 moreover the distribution of phytoplankton also changed after the completion of the seawall according to a two year survey conducted from 2006 to 2007 a total of 191 phytoplankton species in lake saemangeum were found and in their order of appearance frequency were as follows diatoms 94 species 49 2 chlorophyceae 31 species 16 2 dinophyceae 24 species 12 6 cyanophyceae 24 species 12 6 and euglenoidea 11 species 5 8 yeo 2010 more recently in 2013 the monitoring of saemangeum reservoir natural ecosystem report 2021 identified a total of 333 species of phytoplankton their order of appearance frequency was chlorophyceae 140 species 42 0 diatoms 126 species 37 8 cyanophyceae 38 species 11 4 euglenoidea 16 species 4 8 and dinophyceae 8 species 2 4 according to the same report in 2020 a total of 346 species of phytoplankton were identified the updated order of appearance frequency was diatoms 151 species 43 6 chlorophyceae 122 species 35 3 cyanophyceae 27 species 7 8 euglenoidea 18 species 5 2 and dinophyceae 10 species 3 5 pilkaitytë et al 2004 found that salinity did not affect chl a concentration changes using a mesocosm approach in the darss zingst estuary for a salinity amplitude of up to 6 psu phytoplankton adapts to changes in salinity within a week in addition according to shadrin et al 2021 for microphytobenthos in the hypersaline 80 90 psu water bodies of bay sivash crimea there was no significant correlation pearson coefficient between the number of species and salinity across all sampling periods it was unlikely that an increase in salinity would have caused changes in the lagoon s microbial benthos according to these authors since most of the major dominant species of lake saemangeum are euryhaline it is difficult to determine the trend for salinity and phytoplankton in the case of skeletonema balzano et al 2011 reported that all strains exhibited growth at salinities between 10 and 35 ppt however the lowest salinity at which growth was observed differed between species and even within the same species phormidium tenue was the dominant species with an appearance rate of 21 at a very high salinity of 36 42 psu salinity levels in lake saemangeum are lower in the mangrove forest of the sandspit coastal area of southern karachi pakistan ahmed et al 2016 the freshwater diatom stephanodiscus hantzschii is a winter blooming species jung et al 2009 and extensively inhabits the waters of the nakdong river estuary in korea baek et al 2019 implying that it is freshwater plankton however blooming occurs at low salinity levels nevertheless since salinity and phytoplankton distribution have changed together in lake saemangeum whether salinity affects phytoplankton distribution needs to be addressed since the above studies showed cases where salinity had no direct effect on the increase in phytoplankton abundance this study attempted to approach the question from a statistical perspective on phytoplankton appearance and not their abundance for the same area as in this study the monitoring of saemangeum reservoir natural ecosystem report 2021 employed the canonical correspondence analysis cca to determine the correlations between the phytoplankton present and the ph dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod salinity chlorophyll a total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp correlation with environmental factors was analyzed s hantzschii cyclotella stephanodiscus etc showed a high correlation with nutrient levels however a correlation with salinity was not identified because cca was more useful in evaluating the relative importance among many variables therefore this lack of correlation may be due to the statistical analysis methods used specifically in the case of freshwater phytoplankton like s hantzschii in cca although a high correlation with nutrients such as phosphorus was observed no correlation with salinity was recorded i e even when fresh water with a high phosphorus concentration was added the spatial distribution of s hantzschii could have been misunderstood as being contingent only on phosphorus levels and not salinity we aimed to answer the question does the primary salinity change because artificial structural changes affect the distribution of phytoplankton and therefore a new approach was needed thus we hypothesized that it was better to approach this as a classification problem rather than a quantitative association therefore in lake saemangeum a huge brackish artificial lake we first analyzed the dominant species by period to intuitively examine their relationships with salinity next statistical analysis was performed by categorically dividing the data as 0 or 1 correspondingly according to the presence or absence of each species we attempted to analyze whether a significant relationship between salinity and the distribution of phytoplankton could be identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed in saemangeum a large artificial lake that was formed by the construction of a seawall to secure agricultural water in the yellow sea of korea samples were collected from seven locations in lake saemangeum and salinity and phytoplankton abundances were investigated first the species composition and abundance of phytoplankton were identified and the seven dominant species in terms of abundance skeletonema spp cyclotella atomus stephanodiscus hantzschii phormidium tenue chaetoceros spp cylindrotheca closterium and prorocentrum minimum were selected to determine the species abundance according to the characteristics of each location and salinity quantiles furthermore the maximum values of species abundance and salinity at that location were identified the correlation between species abundances of phytoplankton and salinity was also analyzed water samples were collected once a month from january to november 2021 from the surface and bottom layers of seven points and additionally collected once after each rain in august and september the survey locations are shown in fig 1 a total of 12 data columns point layer month day salinity skeletonema cyclotella stephanodiscus phormidium chaetoceros cylindrotheca prorocentrum with 143 rows were created salinity was measured in the field using the ocean seven 310 idronaut brugherio mb italy multi parameter water quality meter phytoplankton was collected with a niskin water sampler placed in a 500 ml polyethylene sample bottle and fixed with lugol s solution the samples were then transferred to the laboratory concentrated to 70 ml by precipitation to remove the supernatant and then counted under an optical microscope using a sedgwick rafter counting chamber for the classification and identification of phytoplankton the literature including hirose et al 1977 shim 1994 cupp 1943 dodge 1982 jeong 1993 chihara and murano 1997 and tomas 1997 was referenced 2 2 statistical analysis to analyze the correlation between salinity and phytoplankton abundance the pearson correlation coefficient and p value were obtained using the r language cor test x y function for salinity x and phytoplankton abundance y 1 r 1 n 1 x i x y i y s x s y where n is total data number x a n d y are the means of x and y respectively and s x and s y are the standard deviations of x and y respectively the cor test x y function in r was used to calculate the p value from the test statics t 2 t r n 2 1 r 2 the point biserial correlation coefficient was calculated to understand the effect of salinity on the presence or absence of phytoplankton this is a correlation coefficient obtained by substituting 0 or 1 for the abundance of phytoplankton it is 1 if the abundance of phytoplankton is greater than 1 otherwise 0 3 results and analysis 3 1 characteristics of phytoplankton distribution 3 1 1 composition and number of species choi et al 2013 reported that various communities such as bacillariophyceae chlorophyta dinophyceae and cyanophyceae appeared in lake saemangeum in 2006 and 2007 but the clusters gradually became less diverse and the proportions of bacillariophyceae and dinophyceae have increased since 2009 in this study chlorophyta bacillariophyceae and dinophyceae were observed at the highest frequencies although other communities i e cryptophyceae cyanophyceae euglenoidea were also observed at varying rates across sampling sites the number of species was 46 to 94 during the survey period from january to november 2021 the precipitation during this period was the lowest at 14 5 mm in february and the highest at 214 5 mm in august table 1 the lowest and highest precipitation was recorded in winter 37 5 mm

much higher in winter january and february than in summer july and august from april the species ratio of chlorophyceae increased following the winter season and mostly appeared in the me1 and de1 estuaries it is believed that various species appeared because of the increased water temperature of the river however lake saemangeum is operated to maintain a water level of approximately 1 5 m elevation level since freshwater flows in from the east and seawater is exchanged through two sluice gates in the west it is considered that the change of species composition of phytoplankton by location and season is due to the inflow of freshwater or seawater 3 1 2 abundance the survey result for phytoplankton abundance from january to november 2021 fig 3 showed that the average abundance after heavy rains in august was the lowest and cylindrotheca closterium a bacillariophyceae appeared at a high density in november indicating the highest average abundance the abundance of

919,lake qarun the third largest saline lake in egypt has been plagued with algal blooms and experienced decline in fisheries however the toxicity of these blooms has not explored yet therefore the present study is the first to evaluate the toxicity of the most frequently recorded harmful algal blooms habs in lake qarun the results showed an occurrence of dinoflagellate bloom in site1 located near el bats drain 1 4 108 cells l 1 and site 2 located near el wadi drain 1 9 108 cells l 1 but not found in site 3 located away from drains this bloom associated with high nutrient concentrations and low salinity in these sites both intact cells and cell lysate of bloom samples and cultured species but not cell free supernatants exhibited toxicity towards artemia salina and cytotoxicity for the gill assay with higher toxicity incurred by lysed cells the cytotoxicity varied significantly among bloom constituting species with highest obtained by the most dominant species protoperidinium quinquecorne lc50 445 cells ml 1for lysed cells prorocentrum micans lc50 757 cells ml 1 gymnodinium lantzschii lc50 1151 cells ml 1 and amphidinium carterae lc50 1289 cells ml 1 these lc50s showed greater correlation with the percentages of the polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa octadecatetraenoic ota eicosapentaenoic epa and docosahexaenoic dha in these microalgae indicating the role of these fatty acids in ichthyotoxicity no detectable levels of known phycotoxins were found in bloom or cultured species this study suggests regular monitoring and systematic assessment of habs and their toxins in lake qarun to mitigate their occurrence and maintain fisheries and seafood safety key words algal blooms artemia fish polyunsaturated fatty acids saline lakes toxicity 1 introduction lake qarun is one of the largest lakes in the north africa and the oldest natural lake in egypt al afify et al 2019 the lake has turned from an ancient freshwater system into a marine system in the late 20th century abu zied et al 2007 flower et al 2006 this increase in salinity in the lake has been attributed to the evaporative concentration of agricultural drainage water entering the lake through el wadi and el bats drains abdel wahed et al 2014 this has led to the obvious invasion of marine algal species in lake qarun abd el karim 2012 moreover the discharge of nutrients and chemical fertilizers has also caused eutrophication of lake qarun fathi and flower 2005 zaher and ibrahim 2018 the trophic level index indicated that most sites of lake qarun lie at hypereutrophic level napió rkowska krzebietke et al 2016 such eutrophication conditions have induced algal proliferation and promoted formation of harmful blooms in the lake several studies reported the occurrence of different types of algal blooms in lake qarun including cyanobacterial blooms mohamed 2016 dinaoflagellate blooms zaher and ibrahim 2018 ibrahim et al 2021 diatom blooms abd el karim 2012 and green algae blooms ibrahim et al 2021 being living in the same environment fish and seafood organisms could be influenced by the presence of habs in lake qarun napió rkowska krzebietke et al 2016 these blooms can clog fish gills and deplete oxygen from water leading to fish kills mahmudi et al 2020 otherwise fish mortality may occur as a result of poisoning by phycotoxins particularly neurotoxins e g saxitoxins and neosaxitoxins produced by bloom forming algae mohamed 2018 yurga 2022 additionally fish gill damage may be due to the production of the so called ichthyotoxins which their production often differs from the well studied paralytic diarrheic amnesic and neurotoxic phycotoxins hallegraeff et al 2017 furthermore phycotoxins can accumulate in edible tissues of aquatic organisms such as fish and shellfish leading to human poisoning upon consumption of contaminated seafood kantiani et al 2010 hinder et al 2011 based on the symptoms of human poisoning these toxins include paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins psp toxins e g stxs diarrhetic shellfish poisoning dsp toxins e g okadaic acid neurotoxic shellfish poisoning nsp toxins e g brevetoxins ciguatera fish poisoning cfp toxins e g ciguatoxin and maitotoxin azaspiracid shellfish poisoning azp toxins e g azaspiracids and amnesic shellfish poisoning asp toxins e g domoic acid camacho muñoz et al 2021 although dinoflagellate blooms have been frequently recorded in lake qarun ibrahim et al 2021 to our knowledge toxins produced by these blooms have never been identified yet additionally there is no evidence of human intoxication through seafood consumption from the lake this is because of lack of knowledge for public and water authority about these toxins based on a field observation of fish mortality at bloom areas in lake qarun we hypothesized that the algal blooms could be the factor causing these massive mortalities of fishes in the lake therefore the present study was undertaken to determine the toxicity and toxins contained in dinoflagellate blooms prevalent in lake qarun the data obtained from this study is expected to significantly contribute to lake management in order to reduce the risks of these toxins to fisheries and human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water samples lake qarun is a closed saline basin situated about 95 km southwest of cairo with an elevation of 43 m below sea level it is located between longitudes of 30 24 and 30 49 e and latitudes 29 24 and 29 33 n the lake surface area is about 215 km2 40 km length and 5 7 km width with water volume about 1 100 000000 m3 ahdy et al 2011 it is a shallow lake with a depth varying between 5 m in the east to 12 m in the west the lake is surrounded by desert at the northern region and cultivated land slopes steeply towards the lake which makes it a natural sink for agricultural drainage water abdel wahed et al 2015 lake qarun receives agricultural wastewater via two main drains el bats at the most east part and el wadi at the middle of the southern side the total water discharging annually into the lake is about 395 million cubic meters lake qarun represents one of the important sectors in the egyptian fisheries for a large number of economically important species napió rkowska krzebietke et al 2016 water samples were collected from lake qarun at 3 sites site 1 is located at the eastern part of the lake near el bats drain site 2 is located at middle of the lake near el wadi drain and site 3 is located at the western part of the lake fig 1 water samples were collected in july 2021 which was approximately one week after the bloom was observed by fishermen at each site water and phytoplankton samples were collected in triplicate at 0 5 m below the water surface by using a van dorn water sampler bloom samples were passed through a 60 µm mesh to remove larger organisms and then divided into three parts one part was preserved with 1 lugol s iodine and used for the identification and counting of phytoplankton another part was used for isolation and culturing of dinoflagellate species the remaining part was kept in polyethylene bottle and used for evaluating the bloom ichthyotoxicity 2 2 physico chemical and phytoplankton analysis water temperature salinity and ph were measured in situ using a multipurpose probe meter wtw digit 88 and dissolved oxygen with an o2 meter nutrients such as ammonium nitrate phosphate and silicate were determined in gf c filtered water samples by the standard analytical methods apha 1995 all parameters were determined in triplicate dinoflagellate species constituting lake qarun bloom were enumerated in the lugol preserved samples and freshly collected samples less than 6 hours after sampling using sedgwick rafter cell counter under light microscope phytoplankton species in bloom samples were identified based on morphological characteristics according to popovský and pester 1990 anderson et al 1995 landsberg et al 2002 the current status of the scientific names of the species were periodically checked and rearranged according to the website of algaebase 2021 2 3 establishment of dinoflagellate cultures unialgal cultures of dinoflagellate species were established from cells of bloom samples collected in july 2021 at sites 1 and site 2 in lake qarun single cells of each species were isolated by capillary pipetting under a carl zeiss inverted microscope and transferred to f 2 medium without silica andersen et al 1997 prepared in filtered and sterile lake qarun water with salinity adjusted to 30 psu the cultures were then incubated at 26 c with a photon flux of 50 µmoles photons of cool white fluorescent light and a 12 12 light dark ld cycle after 3 weeks these monoclonal cultures were transferred into 100 ml culture flasks containing 50 ml f 2 medium and incubated under the above conditions for 21 days i e the time of exponentially growth phase the cell concentration was monitored every two days using a sedgwick rafter cell counter algal cultures were then divided into two parts one part was used for testing ichthyotoxicity by a salina and fish gill cell line while the other part was used for fatty acid analysis 2 4 artemia salina toxicity assay three different algal suspensions intact cells cell lysate obtained by sonication of the cultures and cell free supernatants were prepared from the cultures in the exponential growth phase at six different cell concentrations 100 200 500 1000 2000 and 5000 cell ml 1 and used for ichthyotoxicity assays i e artemia salina and fish gill cell line assays the a salina assay was carried out using freshly hatched a salina l nauplii according to kiviranta et al 1991 the mortality was estimated after 48h and expressed as the difference between mortalities in the tested and control samples following this formula mortality test control 1 control 100 the lethal concentration causing death of 50 lc50 with 95 confidence limits was calculated by the probit analysis method finney 1971 2 5 gill cell line assay the gill cell line rtgill w1 an epithelial cell line derived from rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss was obtained from the american type culture collection crl 2523 atcc cells were cultured and maintained in leibovitz s l 15 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum 10 and antibiotic antimycotic solution penicillin 10 000 units ml 1 amphotericin b 25 mg ml 1 and streptomycin 10 mg ml 1 dorantes aranda et al 2011 the cytotoxicity assay was carried out according to dorantes aranda et al 2011 briefly gill cell cultures were trypsinized 0 25 trypsin 0 02 edta for detachment and the cells were counted using a hemocytometer and adjusted to a final concentration of 2 105 cells ml 1 with l 15 medium gill cells were seeded in 96 well microplates 100 µl per well and incubated at 17 c in the dark for 48 hours thereafter l 15 medium was discarded and the cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline pbs the gill cells were exposed to intact cells cell lysate or cell free supernatants of algal cultures and bloom materials for 2 hours and the wells were washed twice with pbs the viability of gill cells was determined by incubation in l 15 medium containing resazurin 5 as an indicator dye 100 µl per well for 2 hours in the dark after that the metabolic reduction of resazurin to resorufin by the remaining viable gill cells was quantified in a fluorescent plate reader fluostar optima bmg labtech at excitation and emission wavelengths of 540 and 590 nm respectively wells without gill cells were used as blank wells containing gill cells and f 2 medium but without any algal material were used as a control the gill cell viability was expressed as a response percentage of the treatments relative to the control of control 2 6 analysis of saxitoxins and okadaic acid saxitoxins were analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa using commercial microplate kits for these toxins abraxis westminster pa usa the detection limit of this method was 0 02µg l 1 for saxitoxins diarrheic shellfish poisoning dsp toxins including okadaic acid and its analogues of dinophysistoxins dtxs were also analyzed by elisa using relevant kits abraxis westminster pa usa with detection limit of 0 45 µg l 1 2 7 analysis of fatty acids an aliquot of bloom samples or algal cultures was filtered onto a pre combusted whatman gf f filter 450 c for 2 h lipids were extracted from algal cells and analyzed following the method described by hyun et al 2016 briefly filters with attached algal cells were frozen at 20 c and then

acids were compared by anova using the excel data analysis tool at the 0 05 significance level correlations between algal density and environmental parameters as well as between toxicity and fatty acids were measured using spearman rank correlation coefficients using the excel data analysis tool 3 results 3 1 environmental factors associated with dinoflagellate blooms during the field study red patches of algal bloom was observed on 5 july 2021 at site 1 and site 2 but not found at site 3 in lake qarun also fish mortalities of tilapia shrimp eels and sea bream were observed at bloom sites data not shown during this bloom event physico chemical parameters of lake qarun water were measured at bloom sites site1 site2 and the non bloom site site3 in order to define the prevailing environmental parameter s favoring bloom formation in lake qarun water temperature varied significantly among the three sites p 0 0001 was higher in the non bloom site site3 36 c compared to 26 and 29 c in bloom sites table 1 there was insignificant difference in ph values p 0 08 among the study sites a slight decrease in do was observed in bloom sites 5 3 6 2 mg l 1 compared to 7 7 mg l 1 in the non bloom site salinity showed a wide variation among the study sites p 0 001 and was lower in bloom sites 29 31psu than the non bloom site 39 psu regarding nutrients nh4 no3 po4 and silicate varied significantly among the sites p 0 0001 with higher concentrations recorded at bloom sites table 1 the phytoplankton analysis of algal bloom observed in lake qarun demonstrated that this bloom was mediated by the rapid growth of dinoflagellate species phytoplankton samples taken from the bloom were found to be dominated by three dinoflagellate species gymnodinium lantzschii prorocentrum aporum and prorocentrum micans which showed cell densities in excess of 3 3 107 cells l 1 in bloom sites sit 1 and site 2 but they were totally absent in the non bloom site site 3 table 2 other dinoflagellate species such as amphidinium carterae gymnodinium simplex prorocentrum gracile protoperidinium quinquecorne were also found but with lower cell densities 0 2 104 4 1 105 cells l 1 in bloom sites table 2 interestingly these subdominant species were also recorded in the non bloom site with cell densities of 0 4 104 0 8 104 cells l 1 table 2 species of other phytoplankton groups including cyanobacteria green algae diatoms were not observed or represented in negligible cell numbers in both bloom and non bloom sites therefore data are not shown the statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between the abundance of bloom forming species and physicochemical parameters of lake qarun water determined during bloom event the cell density of main bloom forming species g lantzschii p aporum and p micans showed positive correlations with concentrations of nh4 r 0 8 0 9 no3 r 0 8 po4 r 0 8 and silicate r 0 9 in lake water on the other hand the cell density of these species negatively correlated with temperature r 0 8 and salinity r 0 9 3 2 ichthyooxicity of dinoflagellate blooms and cultured species the results of lethality assay revealed that both whole living cells and lysate of dinoflagellate bloom collected from lake qarun during the present study exhibited toxicity towards a salina with significant variation in lc50 values p 0 0001 the bloom lysate was more toxic lc50 210 430 cells ml 1 than intact cells lc50 1300 2000 cells ml 1 table 3 the toxicity of bloom materials i e intact cells and cell lysate also differed between the two bloom sites p 0 01 0 001 the intact cells and cell lysate of stie2 bloom was more toxic to a salina lc50 1300 and 210 cells ml 1 respectively than those of site 1 bloom lc50 2000 and 430 cells ml 1 respectively table 3 phytoplankton samples collected from the non bloom site site 3 showed toxicity to a salina but it was much lower lc50 4300 and 600 cells ml 1 for whole cells and lysate respectively than that of bloom samples of site1 and site2 table 3 for cultured dinoflagellate species constituting the algal bloom in lake qarun the toxicity of the intact cells and cell lysate to a salina varied significantly p 0 001 among these species the highest toxicity was exhibited by p quinquecorne lc50 300 and 140 cells ml 1 for intact cells and cell lysate respectively followed by p micans lc50 800 and 200 cells ml 1 g lantzschii lc50 1200 and 270 cells ml 1 and a carterae lc50 1400 and 290 cells ml 1 table 3 while the remaining species had lower toxicity to a salina with lc50 values over 3000 and 200 cells ml 1 for intact cells and cell lysate respectively table 3 on the other hand neither the supernatants of the centrifuged bloom samples nor the cell free medium of algal cultures caused mortality in a salina table 3 the results of gill cell line assay showed that the dinoflagellate bloom collected from lake qarun during the present study exhibited significant toxicity and reduced the viability of rtgill w1 cells after a two hour exposure to either intact or lysed cells the loss of gill cells viability differed significantly p 0 001 0 005 between phytoplankton samples collected from bloom sites site1 and site2 and the non bloom site site 3 in lake qarun but it did not differ significantly between samples of bloom sites p 0 07 0 2 the highest losses of viability observed on gill cells were achieved by intact cells and cell lysate of site 2 bloom at a concentration of 5000 cells ml 1 89 and 94 respectively fig 2 a b while the least loss of viability occurred by intact cells and cell lysate 72 and 82 respectively of phytoplankton samples collected from site3 at a concentration of 5000 cells ml 1 fig 2c for cultured species isolated from lake qarun during the present study the loss of gill cells viability varied markedly among species either for intact cells p 0 0001 or cell lysate p 0 0001 moreover intact cells and cell lysate of the same species showed a great difference in the loss of viability towards the rtgill w1 cells p 0 03 0 01 the highest losses of viability expressed as a reduction percentage were exerted by intact and lysed cells at a concentration of 5000 cells ml 1 of four species a carterae 85 for intact cells and 90 for lysed cells g lantzschii 88 and 92 p micans 91 and 94 and p quinquecorne 94 and 98 fig 2c d e and f the remaining species showed lower effect on rtgill w1 cells with loss of viability less than 50 for both intact cells and cell lysate at a concentration of 5000 cells ml 1 fig 3 b c and d the gill cells did not exhibit any significant loss of viability when exposed to the supernatants of the centrifuged bloom samples or the cell free medium of algal cultures figs 2 and 3 based on lc50 values calculated by probit analysis intact cells and cell lysate of site 2 bloom had lower lc50 values 1345 and 842 cells ml 1 respectively towards rtgill w1 cells i e higher toxicity compared to high lc50s for cells of site 1 bloom 1593 and 1133 cells ml 1 and the non bloom site lc50 2086 and 1146 cells ml 1 fig 4 similarly cultured species also exhibited varying extents of toxicity towards rtgill w1 cells with highly variable lc50 values p 0 0001 p quinquecorne was the most cytotoxic species having the lowest lc50 values 787 cells ml 1 for intact cells and 445 cells ml 1for lysed cells followed by p micans lc50 1070cells ml 1 and 757 cells ml 1 g lantzschii lc50 1509 cells ml 1 and 1151 cells ml 1 and a carterae lc50 1826 cells ml 1 and 1289 cells ml 1 fig 4 p gracile was the least toxic species to gill cells with highest lc50 values of 5143 cells ml 1 for intact cells and 3172 cells ml 1for lysed cells on the other hand bloom samples exhibited lower toxicity to fish gill cells than cultured species fig 4 also there was no significant difference in lc50 values of species strains originating from the study sites in lake qarun therefore data are not shown the fatty acid composition expressed as of total fatty acids based on gc ms analysis of microalgae forming dinoflagellate blooms in lake qarun are listed in table 4 in all species the fa profile was dominated by polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas with low levels of monounsaturated fatty acids mufas and saturated fatty acids sfas however the of pufa varied significantly among species p 005 and correlated with their ichthyotoxicity towards rtgill w1 cells the highest the percentage of pufa the lowest the lc50 to rtgill w1 cells r 0 7 more specifically lc50 of cell lysate of the tested species correlated r 0 9 with the percentages of octadecatetraenoic 18 4ω3 ota eicosapentaenoic 20 5ω3 epa and docosahexaenoic dha 22 6ω3 indicating the role of these fatty acids in ichthyotoxicity of these species table 5 for instance the most ichthyotoxic i e the lowest lc50 species to gill cells p quinquecorne had the highest percentages 18 2 8 1 and 21 6 respectively of these fatty acids table 4 on the other hand the least toxic i e highest lc50 species p gracile contained the lowest percentages 4 6 4 5 and 4 1 respectively of these fatty acids similar to toxicity towards rtgill w1 cells the toxicity of dinoflagellate species to artemia also correlated with the percentage of pufa r 0 7 and ota r 0 9 epa r 0 8 and dha r 0 9 table 5 based on elisa neither stxs nor okadaic acid and its analogues of dtxs were detectable in bloom samples or cultured species isolated from these blooms therefore data are not shown 4 discussion 4 1 dinoflagellate blooms and associated environmental factors in the present study the dinoflagellate bloom has occurred in lake qarun at site 1 and site 2 bloom sites which are located near el bats drain and el wadi drain but was not observed at site 3 the non bloom site which lies at the western side of the lake and not exposed to agricultural discharge this bloom was dominated by gymnodinium lantzschii prorocentrum aporum and prorocentrum micans with cell density more than 107 cells l 1 these species have also been previously reported as the main forming bloom species in lake qarun zaher and ibrahim 2018 ibrahim et al 2021 in addition to these dominant species we also recorded other dinoflagellate species participating in the species composition of this bloom table 2 with lower cell densities 104 cells l 1 the occurrence of this bloom in site 1 and site 2 was associating with the high concentrations of nutrients nh4 no3 po4 and silicate and low salinity 29 psu compared to lower nutrient concentrations and high salinity 39 psu in the non bloom site such eutrophic conditions could have favored the formation of dinoflagellate bloom at site 1 and 2 in line with previous studies demonstrating that habs have often been associated with or promoted by waste and agricultural water discharge mohamed and al sheri 2012 díaz et al 2016 ibrahim et al 2021 sathishkumar et al 2021 it seemed that decreased salinity in site 1 and 2 in lake qarun stemming from increased agricultural runoff from el bats drain and el wadi drains favored the dinofalgellate proliferation and blooms this agrees with previous studies which have reported that low salinity of water stimulates the formation of dinoflagellates blooms in marine and brackish waters accoroni and totti 2016 sathishkumar et al 2021 4 2 ichthyotoxicity of dinoflagellate bloom and cultured species in this study both intact and cell lysate of dinoflagellate bloom and cultured species but not cell free supernatants were toxic to the brine shrimp a salina with higher toxicity incurred by lysed cells the significant increase in toxicity when using lysed algal cells indicates that toxic substances are released upon cell lysis mooney et al 2010 mardones et al 2015 previously artemia spp have been widely used in ecotoxicological studies for the determination of general toxicity of harmful microalgae including h akashiwo mohamed and al shehri 2012 karlodinium veneficum and ostreopsis yang et al 2018 and amphidinium operculatum mejía camacho et al 2021 besides toxicity to a salina both dinoflagellate bloom and cultured species of lake qarun had various ichthyotoxicity to fish gill cells gill cells showed lower viability i e high toxicity upon exposure to algal cell lysate than intact cells these results agree with several studies reporting that ichthyotoxic microalgae such as the raphidophytes chattonella marina fibrocapsa japonica and heterosigma akashiwo and the dinoflagellates alexandrium catenella karenia mikimotoi and karlodinium veneficum p micans were more toxic to fish gill cells after cell lysis than whole living cells dorantes aranda et al 2015 mardones et al 2020 on the other hand most cultured species were more toxic towards fish gill cells than natural bloom samples this could be due to that the natural bloom is composed of various species with different cell densities and different quantities of ichthyotoxins compared to pure cultures containing only one single species which produces a fixed amount of ichthyotoxins however mesocosm experiments using a coculture of algal species with fish is needed to test whether fish can induce the algal cells to produce such potent ichthyotoxins ichthyotoxicity of microalgae to fish gill cells could be attributed to the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa mooney et al 2010 reactive oxygen species ros marshall et al 2003 chemically defined phycotoxins van deventer et al 2012 or synergistic effect of pufa and ros dorantes aranda et al 2015 mardones et al 2015 2021 as the most common phycotoxins including diarrhetic shellfish toxins e g oa and dtxs and paralytic shellfish toxins e g saxitoxins were not detectable by elisa in dinoflagellate bloom or cultured species of lake qarun the ichthyotoxicity of these microalgae could be attributed to uncharacterized ichthyotoxins similarly previous studies demonstrated that some harmful microalgae such as alexandrium catenella and prorocentrum concavum which could not produce saxitoxins or okadaic acid oa had severe ichthyotoxic effects against a salina and fish gill cells mardones et al 2015 zou et al 2020 therefore those authors suggested the involvement of uncertain substances rather than such known phycotoxins in the ichthyotoxiicty of these harmful microalgae regarding ichthyotoxic substances several studies have recognized the role of pufa as a known source of ichthyotoxicity of harmful microalgae mardones et al 2015 dorantes aranda et al 2015 mardones 2020 zou et al 2020 in our study ichthyotoxicity of bloom and cultured dinoflagellates isolated from lake qarun correlated markedly with the total percentage of pufa in these algae in particular this ichthyotoxicity showed greater correlation with the percentages of the fatty acids ota epa and dha in microalgae indicating the role of these fatty acids in ichthyotoxicity of these algal species to artemia and fish gill cells these three fatty acids have been previously reported as the major contributors to pufa produced by ichthyotoxic dinoflagellates and raphidophytes dalsgaard et al 2003 evjemo et al 2008 hyun et al 2016 dorantes aranda et al 2013 mooney et al 2011 mardones et al 2021 although the exact mechanism of ichthyotoxicity of pufa is still fully unclear the synergistic reaction between ros and pufa has been suggested as a primary ichthyotoxic mechanism marshall et al 2003 mardones et al 2015 due to their high degree of unsaturation else and kraffe 2015 pufa can be readily oxidized in the presence of high levels of ros producing other toxic compounds via lipid peroxidation e g aldehydes and lipid radicals which can cause physiological changes in gill cells by increasing superoxide dismutase activity and damaging gill cell membranes dorantes aranda et al 2015 however it has been found that pufa e g epa on its own can cause fish mortality but its combination with ros accelerated fish mortality marshall et al 2003 shikata et al 2021 on the other hand ros on their own exhibited weak ichthyotoxicity to fish marshall et al 2003 mooney et al 2011 5 conclusions and recommendations the present study has documented the occurrence of dinoflagellate bloom in lake qarun and confirmed its ichthyotoxicity the bloom was confined to two sites nearby agricultural drains rather than the site not exposed to any discharge the intensity of the bloom correlated with high nutrient concentrations and low salinity in bloom sites due to agricultural water from close drains both bloom and cultured species of dioflagellates exhibited severe toxicity to a salina and fish gill cells with varying extents no phycotoxin such as saxitoxin and okadaic acid was detected in these algae instead the ichthyotoxicity of these microalgae were highly correlated with the contents of pufas particularly ota epa and dha as a similar dinoflagellate bloom was observed in 2018 ibrahim et al 2021 it is reasonable to assume that lake qarun will also show dinoflagellate blooms in the future taken into account that climate change would have an effect on rainfall and thus increasing nutrient input trainer et al 2020 agricultural discharge to the lake from nearby drains should receive a high priority as a bloom management strategy for lake qarun also early warning and monitoring program for phytoplankton abundance in lake qarun should also include 1 determination of known phycotoxins by biochemical and analytical techniques e g elisa and hplc and 2 evaluating the ichthyotoxicity of dinoflagellate and other potential hab species using the fish gill cell line assay as it has proved to be a promising new tool for ichthyotoxic assessment of fish killing microalgae mardones et al 2020 this program could assist in understanding the relationship between ichthyotoxic habs and fish mortality in the lake and generation of scientific knowledge to better prevent control and mitigate hab occurrence and maintain fisheries and safeguarding seafood safety authors contributions all authors participated in experimental design and relevant analysis all authors also took part in data analysis and

919,lake qarun the third largest saline lake in egypt has been plagued with algal blooms and experienced decline in fisheries however the toxicity of these blooms has not explored yet therefore the present study is the first to evaluate the toxicity of the most frequently recorded harmful algal blooms habs in lake qarun the results showed an occurrence of dinoflagellate bloom in site1 located near el bats drain 1 4 108 cells l 1 and site 2 located near el wadi drain 1 9 108 cells l 1 but not found in site 3 located away from drains this bloom associated with high nutrient concentrations and low salinity in these sites both intact cells and cell lysate of bloom samples and cultured species but not cell free supernatants exhibited toxicity towards artemia salina and cytotoxicity for

fatty acids in ichthyotoxicity no detectable levels of known phycotoxins were found in bloom or cultured species this study suggests regular monitoring and systematic assessment of habs and their toxins in lake qarun to mitigate their occurrence and maintain fisheries and seafood safety key words algal blooms artemia fish polyunsaturated fatty acids saline lakes toxicity 1 introduction lake qarun is one of the largest lakes in the north africa and the oldest natural lake in egypt al afify et al 2019 the lake has turned from an ancient freshwater system into a marine system in the late 20th century abu zied et al 2007 flower et al 2006 this increase in salinity in the lake has been attributed to the evaporative concentration of agricultural drainage water entering the lake through el wadi and el bats drains abdel wahed et al 2014 this has led to the obvious invasion of marine algal species in lake qarun abd el karim 2012 moreover the discharge of nutrients and chemical fertilizers has also caused eutrophication of lake qarun fathi and flower 2005 zaher and ibrahim 2018 the trophic level index indicated that most sites of lake qarun lie at hypereutrophic level napió rkowska krzebietke et al 2016 such eutrophication conditions have induced algal proliferation and promoted formation of harmful blooms in the lake several studies reported the occurrence of different types of algal blooms in lake qarun including cyanobacterial blooms mohamed 2016 dinaoflagellate blooms zaher and ibrahim 2018 ibrahim et al 2021 diatom blooms abd el karim 2012 and green algae blooms ibrahim et al 2021 being living in the same environment fish and seafood organisms could be influenced by the presence of habs in lake qarun napió rkowska krzebietke et al 2016 these blooms can clog fish gills and deplete oxygen from water leading to fish kills mahmudi et al 2020 otherwise fish mortality may occur as a result of poisoning by phycotoxins particularly neurotoxins e g saxitoxins and neosaxitoxins produced by bloom forming algae mohamed 2018 yurga 2022 additionally fish gill damage may be due to the production of the so called ichthyotoxins which their production often differs from the well studied paralytic diarrheic amnesic and neurotoxic phycotoxins hallegraeff et al 2017 furthermore phycotoxins can accumulate in edible tissues of aquatic organisms such as fish and shellfish leading to human poisoning upon consumption of contaminated seafood kantiani et al 2010 hinder et al 2011 based on the symptoms of human poisoning these toxins include paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins psp toxins e g stxs diarrhetic shellfish poisoning dsp toxins e g okadaic acid neurotoxic shellfish poisoning nsp toxins e g brevetoxins ciguatera fish poisoning cfp toxins e g ciguatoxin and maitotoxin azaspiracid shellfish poisoning azp toxins e g azaspiracids and amnesic shellfish poisoning asp toxins e g domoic acid camacho muñoz et al 2021 although dinoflagellate blooms have been frequently recorded in lake qarun ibrahim et al 2021 to our knowledge toxins produced by these blooms have never been identified yet additionally there is no evidence of human intoxication through seafood consumption from the lake this is because of lack of knowledge for public and water authority about these toxins based on a field observation of fish mortality at bloom areas in lake qarun we hypothesized that the algal blooms could be the factor causing these massive mortalities of fishes in the lake therefore the present study was undertaken to determine the toxicity and toxins contained in dinoflagellate blooms prevalent in lake qarun the data obtained from this study is expected to significantly contribute to lake management in order to reduce the risks of these toxins to fisheries and human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water samples lake qarun is a closed saline basin situated about 95 km southwest of cairo with an elevation of 43 m below sea level it is located between longitudes of 30 24 and 30 49 e and latitudes 29 24 and 29 33 n the lake surface area is about 215 km2 40 km length and 5 7 km width with water volume about 1 100 000000 m3 ahdy et al 2011 it is a shallow lake with a depth varying between 5 m in the east to 12 m in the west the lake is surrounded by desert at the northern region and cultivated land slopes steeply towards the lake which makes it a natural sink for agricultural drainage water abdel wahed et al 2015 lake qarun receives agricultural wastewater via two main drains el bats at the most east part and el wadi at the middle of the southern side the total water discharging annually into the lake is about 395 million cubic meters lake qarun represents one of the important sectors in the egyptian fisheries for a large number of economically important species napió rkowska krzebietke et al 2016 water samples were collected from lake qarun at 3 sites site 1 is located at the eastern part of the lake near el bats drain site 2 is located at middle of the lake near el wadi drain and site 3 is located at the western part of the lake fig 1 water samples were collected in july 2021 which was approximately one week after the bloom was observed by fishermen at each site water and phytoplankton samples were collected in triplicate at 0 5 m below the water surface by using a van dorn water sampler bloom samples were passed through a 60 µm mesh to remove larger organisms and then divided into three parts one part was preserved with 1 lugol s iodine and used for the identification and counting of phytoplankton another part was used for isolation and culturing of dinoflagellate species the remaining part was kept in polyethylene bottle and used for evaluating the bloom ichthyotoxicity 2 2 physico chemical and phytoplankton analysis water temperature salinity and ph were measured in situ using a multipurpose probe meter wtw digit 88 and dissolved oxygen with an o2 meter nutrients such as ammonium nitrate phosphate and silicate were determined in gf c filtered water samples by the standard analytical methods apha 1995 all parameters were determined in triplicate dinoflagellate species constituting lake qarun bloom were enumerated in the lugol preserved samples and freshly collected samples less than 6 hours after sampling using sedgwick rafter cell counter under light microscope phytoplankton species in bloom samples were identified based on morphological characteristics according to popovský and pester 1990 anderson et al 1995 landsberg et al 2002 the current status of the scientific names of the species were periodically checked and rearranged according to the website of algaebase 2021 2 3 establishment of dinoflagellate cultures unialgal cultures of dinoflagellate species were established from cells of bloom samples collected in july 2021 at sites 1 and site 2 in lake qarun single cells of each species were isolated by capillary pipetting under a carl zeiss inverted microscope and transferred to f 2 medium without silica andersen et al 1997 prepared in filtered and sterile lake qarun water with salinity adjusted to 30 psu the cultures were then incubated at 26 c with a photon flux of 50 µmoles photons of cool white fluorescent light and a 12 12 light dark ld cycle after 3 weeks these monoclonal cultures were transferred into 100 ml culture flasks containing 50 ml f 2 medium and incubated under the above conditions for 21 days i e the time of exponentially growth phase the cell concentration was monitored every two days using a sedgwick rafter cell counter algal cultures were then divided into two parts one part was used for testing ichthyotoxicity by a salina and fish gill cell line while the other part was used for fatty acid analysis 2 4 artemia salina toxicity assay three different algal suspensions intact cells cell lysate obtained by sonication of the cultures and cell free supernatants were prepared from the cultures in the exponential growth phase at six different cell concentrations 100 200 500 1000 2000 and 5000 cell ml 1 and used for ichthyotoxicity assays i e artemia salina and fish gill cell line assays the a salina assay was carried out using freshly hatched a salina l nauplii according to kiviranta et al 1991 the mortality was estimated after 48h and expressed as the difference between mortalities in the tested and control samples following this formula mortality test control 1 control 100 the lethal concentration causing death of 50 lc50 with 95 confidence limits was calculated by the probit analysis method finney 1971 2 5 gill cell line assay the gill cell line rtgill w1 an epithelial cell line derived from rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss was obtained from the american type culture collection crl 2523 atcc cells were cultured and maintained in leibovitz s l 15 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum 10 and antibiotic antimycotic solution penicillin 10 000 units ml 1 amphotericin b 25 mg ml 1 and streptomycin 10 mg ml 1 dorantes aranda et al 2011 the cytotoxicity assay was carried out according to dorantes aranda et al 2011 briefly gill cell cultures were trypsinized 0 25 trypsin 0 02 edta for detachment and the cells were counted using a hemocytometer and adjusted to a final concentration of 2 105 cells ml 1 with l 15 medium gill cells were seeded in 96 well microplates 100 µl per well and incubated at 17 c in the dark for 48 hours thereafter l 15 medium was discarded and the cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline pbs the gill cells were exposed to intact cells cell lysate or cell free supernatants of algal cultures and bloom materials for 2 hours and the wells were washed twice with pbs the viability of gill cells was determined by incubation in l 15 medium containing resazurin 5 as an indicator dye 100 µl per well for 2 hours in the dark after that the metabolic reduction of resazurin to resorufin by the remaining viable gill cells was quantified in a fluorescent plate reader fluostar optima bmg labtech at excitation and emission wavelengths of 540 and 590 nm respectively wells without gill cells were used as blank wells containing gill cells and f 2 medium but without any algal material were used as a control the gill cell viability was expressed as a response percentage of the treatments relative to the control of

detection limit of this method was 0 02µg l 1 for saxitoxins diarrheic shellfish poisoning dsp toxins including okadaic acid and its analogues of dinophysistoxins dtxs were also analyzed by elisa using relevant kits abraxis westminster pa usa with detection limit of 0 45 µg l 1 2 7 analysis of fatty acids an aliquot of bloom samples or algal cultures was filtered onto a pre combusted whatman gf f filter 450 c for 2 h lipids were extracted from algal cells and analyzed following the method described by hyun et al 2016 briefly filters with attached algal cells were frozen at 20 c and then

acids were compared by anova using the excel data analysis tool at the 0 05 significance level correlations between algal density and environmental parameters as well as between toxicity and fatty acids were measured using spearman rank correlation coefficients using the excel data analysis tool 3 results 3 1 environmental factors associated with dinoflagellate blooms during the field study red patches of algal bloom was observed on 5 july 2021 at site 1 and site 2 but not found at site 3 in lake qarun also fish mortalities of tilapia shrimp eels and sea bream were observed at bloom sites data not shown during this bloom event physico chemical parameters of lake qarun water were measured at bloom sites site1 site2 and the non bloom site site3 in order to define the prevailing environmental parameter s favoring bloom formation in lake qarun water temperature varied significantly among the three sites p 0 0001 was higher in the non bloom site site3 36 c compared to 26 and 29 c in bloom sites table 1 there was insignificant difference in ph values p 0 08 among the study sites a slight decrease in do was observed in bloom sites 5 3 6 2 mg l 1 compared to 7 7 mg l 1 in the non bloom site salinity showed a wide variation among the study sites p 0 001 and was lower in bloom sites 29 31psu than the non bloom site 39 psu regarding nutrients nh4 no3 po4 and silicate varied significantly among the sites p 0 0001 with higher concentrations recorded at bloom sites table 1 the phytoplankton analysis of algal bloom observed in lake qarun demonstrated that this bloom was mediated by the rapid growth of dinoflagellate species phytoplankton samples taken from the bloom were found to be dominated by three dinoflagellate species gymnodinium lantzschii prorocentrum aporum and prorocentrum micans which showed cell densities in excess of 3 3 107 cells l 1 in bloom sites sit 1 and site 2 but they were totally absent in the non bloom site site 3 table 2 other dinoflagellate species such as amphidinium carterae gymnodinium simplex prorocentrum gracile protoperidinium quinquecorne were also found but with lower cell densities 0 2 104 4 1 105 cells l 1 in bloom sites table 2 interestingly these subdominant species were also recorded in the non bloom site with cell densities of 0 4 104 0 8 104 cells l 1 table 2 species of other phytoplankton groups including cyanobacteria green algae diatoms were not observed or represented in negligible cell numbers in both bloom and non bloom sites therefore data are not shown the statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between the abundance of bloom forming species and physicochemical parameters of lake qarun water determined during bloom event the cell density of main bloom forming species g lantzschii p aporum and p micans showed positive correlations with concentrations of nh4 r 0 8 0 9 no3 r 0 8 po4 r 0 8 and silicate r 0 9 in lake water on the other hand the cell density of these species negatively correlated with temperature r 0 8 and salinity r 0 9 3 2 ichthyooxicity of dinoflagellate blooms and cultured species the results of lethality assay revealed that both whole living cells and lysate of dinoflagellate bloom collected from lake qarun during the present study exhibited toxicity towards a salina with significant variation in lc50 values p 0 0001 the bloom lysate was more toxic lc50 210 430 cells ml 1 than intact cells lc50 1300 2000 cells ml 1 table 3 the toxicity of bloom materials i e intact cells and cell lysate also differed between the two bloom sites p 0 01 0 001 the intact cells and cell lysate of stie2 bloom was more toxic to a salina lc50 1300 and 210 cells ml 1 respectively than those of site 1 bloom lc50 2000 and 430 cells ml 1 respectively table 3 phytoplankton samples collected from the non bloom site site 3 showed toxicity to a salina but it was much lower lc50 4300 and 600 cells ml 1 for whole cells and lysate respectively than that of bloom samples of site1 and site2 table 3 for cultured dinoflagellate species constituting the algal bloom in lake qarun the toxicity of the intact cells and cell lysate to a salina varied significantly p 0 001 among these species the highest toxicity was exhibited by p quinquecorne lc50 300 and 140 cells ml 1 for intact cells and cell lysate respectively followed by p micans lc50 800 and 200 cells ml 1 g lantzschii lc50 1200 and 270 cells ml 1 and a carterae lc50 1400 and 290 cells ml 1 table 3 while the remaining species had lower toxicity to a salina with lc50 values over 3000 and 200 cells ml 1 for intact cells and cell lysate respectively table 3 on the other hand neither the supernatants of the centrifuged bloom samples nor the cell free medium of algal cultures caused mortality in a salina table 3 the results of gill cell line assay showed that the dinoflagellate bloom collected from lake qarun during the present study exhibited significant toxicity and reduced the viability of rtgill w1 cells after a two hour exposure to either intact or lysed cells the loss of gill cells viability differed significantly p 0 001 0 005 between phytoplankton samples collected from bloom sites site1 and site2 and the non bloom site site 3 in lake qarun but it did not differ significantly between samples of bloom sites p 0 07 0 2 the highest losses of viability observed on gill cells were achieved by intact cells and cell lysate of site 2 bloom at a concentration of 5000 cells ml 1 89 and 94 respectively fig 2 a b while the least loss of viability occurred by intact cells and cell lysate 72 and 82 respectively of phytoplankton samples collected from site3 at a concentration of 5000 cells ml 1 fig 2c for cultured species isolated from lake qarun during the present study the loss of gill cells viability varied markedly among species either for intact cells p 0 0001 or cell lysate p 0 0001 moreover intact cells and cell lysate of the same species showed a great difference in the loss of viability towards the rtgill w1 cells p 0 03 0 01 the highest losses of viability expressed as a reduction percentage were exerted by intact and lysed cells at a concentration of 5000 cells ml 1 of four species a carterae 85 for intact cells and 90 for lysed cells g lantzschii 88 and 92 p micans 91 and 94 and p quinquecorne 94 and 98 fig 2c d e and f the remaining species showed lower effect on rtgill w1 cells with loss of viability less than 50 for both intact cells and cell lysate at a concentration of 5000 cells ml 1 fig 3 b c and d the gill cells did not exhibit any significant loss of viability when exposed to the supernatants of the centrifuged bloom samples or the cell free medium of algal cultures figs 2 and 3 based on lc50 values calculated by probit analysis intact cells and cell lysate of site 2 bloom had lower lc50 values 1345 and 842 cells ml 1 respectively towards rtgill w1 cells i e higher toxicity compared to high lc50s for cells of site 1 bloom 1593 and 1133 cells ml 1 and the non bloom site lc50 2086 and 1146 cells ml 1 fig 4 similarly cultured species also exhibited varying extents of toxicity towards rtgill w1 cells with highly variable lc50 values p 0 0001 p quinquecorne was the most cytotoxic species having the lowest lc50 values 787 cells ml 1 for intact cells and 445 cells ml 1for lysed cells followed by p micans lc50 1070cells ml 1 and 757 cells ml 1 g lantzschii lc50 1509 cells ml 1 and 1151 cells ml 1 and a carterae lc50 1826 cells ml 1 and 1289 cells ml 1 fig 4 p gracile was the least toxic species to gill cells with highest lc50 values of 5143 cells ml 1 for intact cells and 3172 cells ml 1for lysed cells on the other hand bloom samples exhibited lower toxicity to fish gill cells than cultured species fig 4 also there was no significant difference in lc50 values of species strains originating from the study sites in lake qarun therefore data are not shown the fatty acid composition expressed as of total fatty acids based on gc ms analysis of microalgae forming dinoflagellate blooms in lake qarun are listed in table 4 in all species the fa profile was dominated by polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas with low levels of monounsaturated fatty acids mufas and saturated fatty acids sfas however the of pufa varied significantly among species p 005 and correlated with their ichthyotoxicity towards rtgill w1 cells the highest the percentage of pufa the lowest the lc50 to rtgill w1 cells r 0 7 more specifically lc50 of cell lysate of the tested species correlated r 0 9 with the percentages of octadecatetraenoic 18 4ω3 ota eicosapentaenoic 20 5ω3 epa and docosahexaenoic dha 22 6ω3 indicating the role of these fatty acids in ichthyotoxicity of these species table 5 for instance the most ichthyotoxic i e the lowest lc50 species to gill cells p quinquecorne had the highest percentages 18 2 8 1 and 21 6 respectively of these fatty acids table 4 on the other hand the least toxic i e highest lc50 species p gracile contained the lowest percentages 4 6 4 5 and 4 1 respectively of these fatty acids similar to toxicity towards rtgill w1 cells the toxicity of dinoflagellate species to artemia also correlated with the percentage of pufa r 0 7 and ota r 0 9 epa r 0 8 and dha r 0 9 table 5 based on elisa neither stxs nor okadaic acid and its analogues of dtxs were detectable in bloom samples or cultured species isolated from these blooms therefore data are not shown 4 discussion 4 1 dinoflagellate blooms and associated environmental factors in the present study the dinoflagellate bloom has occurred in lake qarun at site 1 and site 2 bloom sites which are located near el bats drain and el wadi drain but was not observed at site 3 the non bloom site which lies at the western side of the lake and not exposed to agricultural discharge this bloom was dominated by gymnodinium lantzschii prorocentrum aporum and prorocentrum micans with cell density more than 107 cells l 1 these species have also been previously reported as the main forming bloom species in lake qarun zaher and ibrahim 2018 ibrahim et al 2021 in addition to these dominant species we also recorded other dinoflagellate species participating in the species composition of this bloom table 2 with lower cell densities 104 cells l 1 the occurrence of this bloom in site 1 and site 2 was associating with the high concentrations of nutrients nh4 no3 po4 and silicate and low salinity 29 psu compared to lower nutrient concentrations and high salinity 39 psu in the non bloom site such eutrophic conditions could have favored the formation of dinoflagellate bloom at site 1 and 2 in line with previous studies demonstrating that habs have often been associated with or promoted by waste and agricultural water discharge mohamed and al sheri 2012 díaz et al 2016 ibrahim et al 2021 sathishkumar et al 2021 it seemed that decreased salinity in site 1 and 2 in lake qarun stemming from increased agricultural runoff from el bats drain and el wadi drains favored the dinofalgellate proliferation and blooms this agrees with previous studies which have reported that low salinity of water stimulates the formation of dinoflagellates blooms in marine and brackish waters accoroni and totti 2016 sathishkumar et al 2021 4 2 ichthyotoxicity of dinoflagellate bloom and cultured species in this study both intact and cell lysate of dinoflagellate bloom and cultured species but not cell free supernatants were toxic to the brine shrimp a salina with higher toxicity incurred by lysed cells the significant increase in toxicity when using lysed algal cells indicates that toxic substances are released upon cell lysis mooney et al 2010 mardones et al 2015 previously artemia spp have been widely used in ecotoxicological studies for the determination of general toxicity of harmful microalgae including h akashiwo mohamed and al shehri 2012 karlodinium veneficum and ostreopsis yang et al 2018 and amphidinium operculatum mejía camacho et al 2021 besides toxicity to a salina both dinoflagellate bloom and cultured species of lake qarun had various ichthyotoxicity to fish gill cells gill cells showed lower viability i e high toxicity upon exposure to algal cell lysate than intact cells these results agree with several studies reporting that ichthyotoxic microalgae such as the raphidophytes chattonella marina fibrocapsa japonica and heterosigma akashiwo and the dinoflagellates alexandrium catenella karenia mikimotoi and karlodinium veneficum p micans were more toxic to fish gill cells after cell lysis than whole living cells dorantes aranda et al 2015 mardones et al 2020 on the other hand most cultured species were more toxic towards fish gill cells than natural bloom samples this could be due to that the natural bloom is composed of various species with different cell densities and different quantities of ichthyotoxins compared to pure cultures containing only one single species which produces a fixed amount of ichthyotoxins however mesocosm experiments using a coculture of algal species with fish is needed to test whether fish can induce the algal cells to produce such potent ichthyotoxins ichthyotoxicity of microalgae to fish gill cells could be attributed to the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa mooney et al 2010 reactive oxygen species ros marshall et al 2003 chemically defined phycotoxins van deventer et al 2012 or synergistic effect of pufa and ros dorantes aranda et al 2015 mardones et al 2015 2021 as the most common phycotoxins including diarrhetic shellfish toxins e g oa and dtxs and paralytic shellfish toxins e g saxitoxins were not detectable by elisa in dinoflagellate bloom or cultured species of lake qarun the ichthyotoxicity of these microalgae could be attributed to uncharacterized ichthyotoxins similarly previous studies demonstrated that some harmful microalgae such as alexandrium catenella and prorocentrum concavum which could not produce saxitoxins or okadaic acid oa had severe ichthyotoxic effects against a salina and fish gill cells mardones et al 2015 zou et al 2020 therefore those authors suggested the involvement of uncertain substances rather than such known phycotoxins in the ichthyotoxiicty of these harmful microalgae regarding ichthyotoxic substances several studies have recognized the role of pufa as a known source of ichthyotoxicity of harmful microalgae mardones et al 2015 dorantes aranda et al 2015 mardones 2020 zou et al 2020 in our study ichthyotoxicity of bloom and cultured dinoflagellates isolated from lake qarun correlated markedly with the total percentage of pufa in these algae in particular this ichthyotoxicity showed greater correlation with the percentages of the fatty acids ota epa and dha in microalgae indicating the role of these fatty acids in ichthyotoxicity of these algal species to artemia and fish gill cells these three fatty acids have been previously reported as the major contributors to pufa produced by ichthyotoxic dinoflagellates and raphidophytes dalsgaard et al 2003 evjemo et al 2008 hyun et al 2016 dorantes aranda et al 2013 mooney et al 2011 mardones et al 2021 although the exact mechanism of ichthyotoxicity of pufa is still fully unclear the synergistic reaction between ros and pufa has been suggested as a primary ichthyotoxic mechanism marshall et al 2003 mardones et al 2015 due to their high degree of unsaturation else and kraffe 2015 pufa can be readily oxidized in the presence of high levels of ros producing other toxic compounds via lipid peroxidation e g aldehydes and lipid radicals which can cause physiological changes in gill cells by increasing superoxide dismutase activity and damaging gill cell membranes dorantes aranda et al 2015 however it has been found that pufa e g epa on its own can cause fish mortality but its combination with ros accelerated fish mortality marshall et al 2003 shikata et al 2021 on the other hand ros on their own exhibited weak ichthyotoxicity to fish marshall et al 2003 mooney et al 2011 5 conclusions and recommendations the present study has documented the occurrence of dinoflagellate bloom in lake qarun and confirmed its ichthyotoxicity the bloom was confined to two sites nearby agricultural drains rather than the site not exposed to any discharge the intensity of the bloom correlated with high nutrient concentrations and low salinity in bloom sites due to agricultural water from close drains both bloom and cultured species of dioflagellates exhibited severe toxicity to a salina and fish gill cells with varying extents no phycotoxin such as saxitoxin and okadaic acid was detected in these algae instead the ichthyotoxicity of these microalgae were highly correlated with the contents of pufas particularly ota epa and dha as a similar dinoflagellate bloom was observed in 2018 ibrahim et al 2021 it is reasonable to assume that lake qarun will also show dinoflagellate blooms in the future taken into account that climate change would have an effect on rainfall and thus increasing nutrient input trainer et al 2020 agricultural discharge to the lake from nearby drains should receive a high priority as a bloom management strategy for lake qarun also early warning and monitoring program for phytoplankton abundance in lake qarun should also include 1 determination of known phycotoxins by biochemical and analytical techniques e g elisa and hplc and 2 evaluating the ichthyotoxicity of dinoflagellate and other potential hab species using the fish gill cell line assay as it has proved to be a promising new tool for ichthyotoxic assessment of fish killing microalgae mardones et al 2020 this program could assist in understanding the relationship between ichthyotoxic habs and fish mortality in the lake and generation of scientific knowledge to better prevent control and mitigate hab occurrence and maintain fisheries and safeguarding seafood safety authors contributions all authors participated in experimental design and relevant analysis all authors also took part in data analysis and
