995,ecohydrology as an integrating discipline can contribute strongly to achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs especially in the context of integrated water resources management iwrm using ecohydrology principles in applying iwrm affords a better understanding of the links between water biodiversity and human wellbeing in the catchments one problem with the sdgs is that they are presented in a silo style which means there are few if any connections between sdg6 clean water and sanitation and sdg 15 life on land which deals with wetlands and catchments ecohydrology principles drawing on the need to better understand green and blue infrastructure can help bridge between the sdgs in an iwrm context allowing thus for their more successful achievement the convention on wetlands ramsar 1971 has degrees of overlap and redundancy with the unece water convention 1992 and both rely on better science policy and management of catchments for effective implementation ecohydrology can help promote and develop the science base of these multilateral environment agreements allowing for interpretation of catchment processes and dynamics and thus better application of iwrm and ultimately better policies for management of water resources and thus alleviation of water scarcity ecohydrology can also play a role in fostering social science research in catchments heritage management and conservation so far in unesco ecohydrology has been largely dealt with by the international hydrological programme in the division of water sciences there is a future role for ecohydrology as a cross cutting theme across all unesco sectors led by the natural sciences sector keywords iwrm sdgs nature s contributions to people blue green infrastructure ramsar convention unece unesco 1 introduction the un education science and culture organization unesco has amongst its science programmes the international hydrological programme ihp and the man and the biosphere programme mab the latter reached 50 years in 2021 as did the convention on wetlands ramsar iran 1971 of which unesco is the depositary ihp has four more years to reach 50 but like mab and the ramsar convention is of that active decade of environmental awakening and initial action the 1970 s mab has evolved from a largely research led programme to one now largely focused on the global network of over 700 biosphere reserves while ihp has evolved into a holistic programme to facilitate research and capacity building for better global water resources management some 30 years ago the mab and ihp programmes jointly contributed to development of early concepts for the newly emerging paradigm of ecohydrology but in recent decades ecohydrology has blossomed within the framework of ihp ihp has a history of working through phases and has just completed a seven year long eighth phase ihp viii that sought to discover the transformative changes required for more effective management of water resources with a view to alleviating water scarcity among many topics the programme included an examination of integrated water resources management iwrm ecohydrology and governance however there was little focus on the sustainable development goals sdgs or multilateral agreements that deal with water issues and thus help achieve the sdgs the purpose of this brief commentary is to examine how ecohydrological approaches especially can help understand how to implement iwrm deliver the sdgs and help develop multilateral environmental agreements meas with a water focus so called water conventions it also examines how unesco can become an even more effective international hub for water issues through building on its record of assisting the development of ecohydrology 1 1 integrated water resources management iwrm iwrm has been defined as a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems global water partnership 2000 2009 iwrm includes catchments river basins and watersheds and so comprises many ecosystems including ground waters rivers lakes swamps mires and human generated wetlands such as reservoirs and paddy fields all set in a wider landscape or wetscape bridgewater and kim 2021 historically these catchment water systems are linked to the development of civilizations perhaps even our species itself chan et al 2019 hammond et al 2021 many ancient civilizations grew and flourished along rivers or other large sources of freshwaters not all such civilisations survived many collapsing because of water scarcity induced by climate and or other anthropic changes even as human society acquired more environmental knowledge poor water management is still happening across the world with examples such as shrinkage of the aral and caspian seas in central asia and mismanagement of many rivers including the iconic amazon niger murray darling colorado indus and yellow rivers e g micklin 2007 goulden few 2011 forsberg et al 2017 although traditionally focussed on science and engineering approaches iwrm can integrate different knowledges and worldviews from science to local to indigenous krause and strang 2016 indeed as the biodiversity community is realising ipbes 2019 local indigenous and traditional knowledge can also contribute to solving contemporary biodiversity water resource and disaster management challenges many indigenous peoples and local communities understood and understand the importance of integrated water management yet in the global north this did not seriously obtain until the 1992 un conference on environment and development 1 1 https sustainabledevelopment un org milestones unced the issue was subject to much discussion at that global gathering and was taken up inter alia in the subsequent discussions of the commission on sustainable development over the following decade the strength of iwrm is that it integrates concerns of diverse stakeholders from a range of sectors and interest groups iwrm is most often represented as being a cross cutting mechanism to ensure water availability for people food nature industry and to try and avoid or resolve conflicts over water allocation and use iwrm can be highly mechanistic but has also the potential to be an adaptive approach like the convention on biological diversity ecosystem approach convention on biological diversity 2004 that includes conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity alongside water management and use through both hard and soft engineering approaches e g grey versus blue green infrastructure see european commission 2013 jncc 2019 thirty years on and given establishment of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and its sustainable development goals unga 2015 there is now renewed possibility for seeing iwrm in a refreshed light and this can allow incorporation of an integrating element so far missing ecohydrology as a major science and evidence basis for development and application of iwrm policies russi et al 2013 note that integrated water resource management iwrm if properly applied allow s decision makers to simultaneously achieve multiple objectives e g ensuring water food and energy security mitigating and adapting to climate change alleviating poverty and to deal with the synergies and trade offs among them this nexus between water food and energy as one of the most fundamental relationships and increasing challenges for society the intergovernmental science policy platform for biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes will undertake an assessment of this nexus but this is unlikely to be available before 2025 a recent review into economics and biodiversity dasgupta 2021 quotes tan soo et al 2016 as showing conversion of forests into oil palm and rubber plantation significantly increased the number of flooded days during the wettest months of the year specifically an additional square kilometre of conversion to oil palm or rubber was found to lead to 0 001 additional flood related deaths and two additional evacuees per year so there are quite direct and immediate links to human wellbeing from mismanagement of watersheds arising from a lack of knowledge on iwrm specifically the ecohydrological components dasgupta 2021 also discusses the range of issues that have arisen from dam construction both small and large barbarossa et al 2020 report that the approximately 40 000 high dams that currently exist worldwide have altered 50 of the volume of river water by either regulation of water flow or fragmentation and that the pending construction of some 3 700 more high dams will raise the figure to over 90 water flow regulation from dams has impacts on ecosystems relying on flowing surface and groundwaters for connectivity including downstream effects from river and floodplain fragmentation measuring the supply of water is much more than monetary valuation however and a critical need is to use an ecohydrology approach to approximate how where and when water flows and the impact of those flows on biodiversity and ecosystem services 1 2 the sustainable development goals the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs are part of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development unga 2015 agreed in 2012 at the united nations conference on sustainable development held in rio de janeiro brazil since their launch in 2015 there have been a great many publications analysing interrelationships and effectiveness of sdgs e g eat 2016 nilsson et al 2016 icsu 2017 vörösmarty et al 2018 weitz et al 2018 pham truffert et al 2020 the 17 sdgs each have a series of targets and indicators associated with them eat 2016 suggests goals 6 clean water 13 climate action 14 life under water and 15 life on land are the foundational goals while these four sdgs do support the remaining 13 obrecht et al 2021 discuss the idea that coherent policies to achieve all the sdgs require an understanding of interactions between individual sdgs and that such interactions may be synergistic or antithetic these interactions give rise to the idea that co benefits can accrue between sdgs thereby accelerating progress or that trade offs may be needed to ensure progress ecohydrology is a critical scientific framework to help achieve these four foundational goals and their targets by the 2030 end date to achieve sustainable development rather than ecosystem services the ipbes global assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes 2019 used the concept of nature s contributions to people ncp based on a more comprehensive understanding of human nature interactions and a wider range of values including those embedded in indigenous and local knowledge progress on achieving the sdgs and their component targets especially the foundational four needs to incorporate an analysis of nature s contributions to people pascual et al 2017 díaz et al 2018 mcelwee et al 2020 to assist achievement of the sdgs rather than the more traditional ecosystem services nonetheless ncps are an evolving concept and caution should be exercised when trying to use them where ecosystem services might be more appropriate besides helping in the achievement of these four sdgs the ecohydrology paradigm articulated by zalewski 2013 can assist in the de siloing of the individual sdgs and promote cross goal actions table 1 gives examples of targets for the four foundational sdgs where ecohydrology can provide evidential support on the progress to achievement table 1 also shows some of the interlinkages between the different targets for the sdgs illustrating the multidimensional complexity the sdgs encompass 1 3 ecohydrology in multilateral environmental agreements to achieve the sdgs and their included targets some meas have critical roles to play regarding water two in particular are important the convention on wetlands ramsar iran 1971 or the ramsar convention as it is more colloquially known and the unece convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes 1992 or unece water convention as it is more colloquially known these two meas benefit especially from iwrm as an actual or potential implementing mechanism and thereby ecohydrology as the science and evidence support for policy development in the context of iwrm ihp has influenced the unece water convention through its consideration of a draft framework convention on transboundary aquifers this originates from the internationally shared aquifer resources management isarm joint initiative of unesco ihp fao and the international association of hydrogeologists iah given the many actors involved in managing transboundary aquifers isarm is transdisciplinary and multidimensional burchi 2018 notes that unesco ihp s seventh phase included developing international and national frameworks for governance of transboundary aquifers in the framework of isarm ihp and the international oceanographic commission uneco ioc helped develop a groundwater component in the global environment facility gef transboundary waters assessment programme twap that reported in taluae mcmanus et al 2016 as the links between groundwater surface water and iwrm become clearer this work has carried through ihp vii and informed activities under ihp viii although from its origins in the economic commission for europe the unece water convention was initially focused on ece member states in 2013 an amendment allowed accession by all united nations member states the convention therefore became a global legal and intergovernmental framework for transboundary water cooperation that could assist implementation of the 2030 agenda and the sdgs inclusion of a target on transboundary cooperation in sdg6 on water and sanitation represents an important political recognition of transboundary issues and the need for integrated approaches to water management and this security there remains some confusion over essentially a parallel convention the un convention on the law of the non navigational uses of international watercourses 1997 un watercourses convention however this latter convention has attracted very low participation from contracting states and the unece remains the global leader for transboundary water matters given the covid 19 pandemic there was perhaps prescient thinking amongst unece members on the links between environmental water and human health this thinking resulted in adoption of a protocol on water and health to the convention in 2005 this protocol s objective is aimed at promoting at national and international level protection of human health and well being within a framework of sustainable development it aims to achieve this objective through improving water management including conservation and wise use of water related ecosystems and their component biodiversity the outbreaks of hpai bird flu in the early years of this century are examples of a globally important disease transmitted via aquatic biodiversity there are undoubtedly many other such diseases waiting to emerge as the other key water convention the ramsar convention produced a handbook on this issue ramsar convention secretariat 2010 and the tenth meeting of contracting parties in 2008 had the theme of wetlands and health the subsidiary body to the ramsar convention on science the science and technical review panel strp has discussed ecohydrology in the past but invoking the ecohydrology paradigm as a key tool in science support for the convention has yet to occur 2 conclusions figure 1 shows a conceptual framing where iwrm is a central focus for several direct and indirect drivers as input interacting with enablers to produce an outcome or impact of better human well being in this framing ecohydrology is shown as supporting an understanding of the roles and functions of the abiotic drivers and links with biodiversity and ecosystem services delivery of knowledge based iwrm through contributions from the key environmental areas of biodiversity ecosystem services water and policy instruments that link them is a key role for ecohydrology as an integrator of both hard and soft engineering approaches see e g bridgewater 2018 while some drivers are directly linked to physical environmental features sdgs meas and national policies are all indirect drivers that also impact on the effectiveness of iwrm in its development ecohydrology has incorporated the ecosystem services paradigm but the broader conceptualisation of natures contributions to people discussed earlier needs to form part of the developing ecohydrology rubric while ecohydrology is broader than biodiversity there is an opportunity to include the paradigm as part of the new global framework on biodiversity which is to be agreed at the fifteenth convention on biological diversity conference of the parties and place the ecohydrology paradigm squarely on the agenda of the strp of the ramsar convention at its next conference of the parties in spring of 2022 discussions in the unece and the still nascent un convention on transboundary waters should also seek to take a more ecohydrological turn best accomplished through closer links to the unesco science programmes notably ihp the 2018 world water development report manged by unesco for unwater united nations 2021 dealt with so called nature based solutions and included work on ecohydrology and yet that reports 2021 edition contains no reference to ecohydrology which is very surprising given the provenance of ecohydrology in unesco and the role that ecohydrology has in helping understand the value of water the report s theme this leads to the idea that more links and focus are needed within maison unesco to use and continue to support development of ecohydrology even within the natural sciences sector ihp is in a different division from ecological and earth sciences with social sciences education and culture in other sectors again there is no doubt that this separation of unesco activities into sectors and divisions has promoted siloisation of ideas and actions paradoxically then as ihp has over 30 years been becoming more inter disciplinary unesco is becoming organised more in silos there exists therefore a strong case for unesco to take a renewed look at its organisational arrangements to allow highly successful programmes like ihp and mab to be loosely led by one sector but have free and multiple interactions across the set of actors within and without unesco while there are demosites for ecohydrology ihp 2015 there is enormous scope for the unesco mab world network of biosphere reserves and perhaps global geoparks to become testbeds for ihp research led ideas on iwrm and related water matters global sustainability will not be guided by ideas and science alone on ground experiential activities in secure spaces are crucial so to implement sdg 6 on water sdg 13 on climate change sdg 14 for coastal zones and sdg 15 for life on land we need a better focus on all aspects of water biodiversity interactions from human use to water in ecosystems through the iwrm lens and to achieve that better evidence and science is needed in other words a better role for ecohydrology as a science policy interface for the meas as they strive to achieve the sdgs declaration of competing interest i attest there is no conflict of interest and i received no funding for this work between 1999 and 2003 i was director of the division of ecological sciences in unesco and represented australia on the man the biosphere intergovernmental co ordinating council between 1996 1999 and currently from 2017 acknowledgements i acknowledge the many colleagues with whom i have shared discussions on these topics over the years and two anonymous

996,ecohydrology is a transdisciplinary sustainability science based on an understanding of hydrosphere ecosphere interactions from the molecular to catchment scale developed within the framework of the unesco intergovernmental hydrological programme unesco ihp this paper introduces a broad range of ecohydrological nature based solutions eh nbs that have been developed based on dual regulation considering understanding of reciprocal h b hydrogeology biocenosis and b h interactions eh nbs are particularly effective at reducing various dispersed impacts especially non point source pollution which generate up to 50 of nutrient pollution load from the catchment the importance of methodology integration of ecological and hydrological disciplines which reduces impact and increases landscape water and nutrients retention and freshwater ecosystem resilience which is becoming important element of integrated water resource management iwrm was also presented considering the above implementation of ecohydrology aims to increase catchment sustainability potential expressed by water biodiversity ecosystem services and resilience wbsr due to the specific nature of dispersed impact generated by human factor in the catchment it is crucial to engage society through culture and education ce to ensure the implementation and long term efficiency introduction the coronavirus epidemic has prompted reflection on the long term consequences of the increasing exploitation of global resources and raises the question of how the shrinking ecological capacity of the biosphere can be reconciled with the continual growth in the human population and consumer social expectations currently 40 of the world s population does not have enough water and according to a unesco report this amount will rise by around 30 over the next 20 years suggesting that more than five billion people could suffer from water scarcity by 2050 this figure will be exacerbated by climate change increased demand and water pollution un wwdr 2018 those challenges characterised by increasing complexity require a new paradigm and innovative methods the only way to achieve this should be to replace the mechanistic paradigm formulated at the beginning of the industrial era by the french philosopher la mettrie with one based on an evolutionary and ecosystem model zalewski 2014 zalewski 2021 the sociocentric mechanistic paradigm regards the biosphere is a black box a system that we cannot even try to understand it has always provided unlimited resources and at the same time receives and absorbs all the waste and pollution generated by humanity this approach implies that energy and materials are extracted from non renewable but relatively easy to use fossil resources in contrast the evolutionary and ecosystem approach reduces exploitation of renewable resources assuming that quality of life is not a function of material and energy consumption in the new paradigm the term evolution expresses the need for societies to understand that biospheres and ecosystems have always undergone changes even so in the anthropocene era each of us decides to some extent whether to continue to use natural resources as a black box leading to an inevitable catastrophe or whether we can begin to rationally use the potential of the magnificent spacecraft that is the earth as a more disciplined crew the need to change to an evolutionary ecosystem paradigm has recently been recognised by the committee of the regions of the european commission https cor europa eu en our work pages opiniontimeline aspx opid cdr 541 2020 the committee has extended its climate change adaptation strategy to include an evolutionary ecosystem approach based on a framework created by ecohydrology this change in approach to governing the catchment economy is a significant one and in view of the new challenges facing the environmentalsciences a particularly urgent one this urgency is driven by the fact that these challenges are cumulative they occur in the environment through the combined influence of various human activities the environmental impact of individual actions is small but when their effects overlap they can significantly change the environment it is unfortunately extremely difficult to predict such cumulative effects both due to the multitude of factors and by the synergistic and antagonistic interactions between them to reverse the process of biosphere degradation it is necessary to integrate knowledge from a range of different environmental and related science disciplines the integration of ecological and hydrological processes to enable their regulation and thus increase the ecological potential of river basins river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 and the debate over the dependent and independent factors governing population and communities in the ecosystem krebs 1972 become a reference point for the abiotic biotic regulatory concept fig 1 abrc zalewski naiman 1985 which integrates hydrological and ecological processes for prediction of hierarchy of drivers which is changing along the river continuum by describing the changes occurring in a hierarchy of factors relative to hydrological and ecological gradients it is possible to regulate ecohydrological processes and increase the sustainability potential of the river basin wbsr expressed as water quantity and quality biodiversity benefits for society and resistance to anthropopressure zalewski 2014 zalewski 2021 as a description of river basin potential based on these four elements is needed to allow measures to compensate for cumulative anthropopressure abrc has become the starting point for the formulation of the basic assumptions of ecohydrology in addition to the dependencies given above the model also highlights the potential consequences of increasing water run off to the sea occurring as a result of river regulation deforestation and homogenisation of the agricultural landscape through the eradication of intra field trees and the introduction of monocultural cultivation in temperate climates in conditions of limited water resources and with the additional impact of climate change these practices have negative influences on soil erosion hasten the loss of organic matter and nutrients from soil reduce bioproduction intensify the eutrophication of watercourses reservoirs and coastal areas and encourage biodiversity loss the hydrological cycle the nutrients spiral and the quality and quantity of available water resources in a particular climate zone determine the biological productivity of ecosystems the availability of water depends to a large extent on the climate the geomorphology of the catchment area and the level of plant cover as well as the form of use of the catchment area and the degree of human influence for example deserts have significantly less rainfall than a tropical rainforests and they also demonstrate significantly less productivity plant biomass and hence biodiversity in the temperate zone most carbon is locked up in dead organic matter because low temperature inhibits the rate of decomposition in a tropical rainforest the majority of carbon is found in plant tissues because this zone is characterized by a high rate of decomposition which in turn stimulates bioproduction and consequently biodiversity these relationships are collected in the general water carbon accumulation bioproductivity and biodiversity model wcabb fig 2 ecohydrology is based on process oriented thinking these processes can only be understood by the integration of hydrological and ecological processes in river systems across different climate zones i e the abiotic biotic regulatory continuum and wcabb zalewski naiman 1985 a combination of theoretical models and empirical evidences e g zalewski et al 1990 zalewski et al 1998 fig 4 provide the background for understanding the interplay between ecological interactions and hydrological processes and to formulate the concept of dual regulation wherein hydrological process are regulated by ecological structures and interactions and vice versa fig 3 a b considering the increasing cumulative impact of man on water resources and the complexity of the processes involved there is an urgent need to not only reduce emissions but enhance catchment sustainability potential wbsr ce using approaches based on ecohydrology principles zalewski et al 1997 zalewski 2002 ecohydrology is a science based on processes i e the interactions between water and biota from molecular to catchment scale an understanding of these is necessary to elaborate and implement all manner of nature based solutions nbss across the catchment hence the evolutionary ecosystemic character of ecohydrology is fundamental for creating a vision strategy and tactics for sustainable catchment management and the development of innovative nbss that can form a synergetic approach with hydroengineering methods to enhance catchment sustainability potential wbsr ce one of the very first empirical applications of ecohydrology was hydrobiomanipulation changes in the water level of a reservoir can influence the entire trophic pyramid and thus determine the accessibility of spawning habitats for fish as shown in the inductive model of ecohydrological processes fig 4 this model was used as a prototype for the dual regulation concept hydrological systems produce high pollutant loads which stimulate the development of toxic algal blooms if the levels of filtering zooplankton are diminished by zooplanktivorous fish however lowering the water level during the spawning period reduces the predatory pressure of fish on zooplankton thus increasing zooplankton biofiltration such changes improve the pattern of energy flow and nutrient circulation through the ecosystem and increase the resilience of the ecosystem to human impact ecohydrology the use of ecological properties as a management tool for enhancing catchment potential wbsr ce one of the key challenges faced by science in the 21st century is not only understanding the causal relationships between abiotic factors hydrological cycle nutrient circulation cycles and biotic factors ecological processes in all types of ecosystems but also linking them to the dynamics of society with regard to 1 prevention and reduction of floods droughts and other hazards 2 prevention of environmental degradation based on biodiversity assessment 3 enhancing sustainability potential wbsr with the provision of ecosystem services as a long term objective in order to meet this challenge research is becoming increasingly specialised specialisation is necessary to advance the biological sciences medicine and engineering but there is also a need for transdisciplinary methodological approaches based on integrating specialised branches of different fields this integrative approach also emphasises the development of energy efficient technologies taking natural ecosystem processes as an essential tool one example of a catchment scale ecohydrological approach is towards eutrophic reservoirs subject to toxic algal blooms the solution harnessed a range ecosystem biotechnologies in different sections of the catchment area to successfully reduce the nutrient load fig 5 the first step is to increase nutrients retention homogenized agricultural landscape levia et al 2020 in the catchment area by renewing the plant cover restoring buffer zones and optimising agricultural practices this can allow nutrients absorption in agricultural areas to be increased up to 30 ryszkowski kędziora 1993 the load reaching the river can be further reduced by the transformation of nutreints into plant biomass in the ecotone zone izydorczyk et al 2019 the wetlands in the river valley serve as buffer zones reducing the load of mineral organic and biogenic substances transported by the river down the river continuum carling petts 1992 kiedrzyńska et al 2014 in artificially constructed wetlands the nitrogen load can be further reduced by regulating the water level thus controlling the denitrification process bednarek zalewski 2007 mitsch gosselink 2007 the self cleaning process can be further intensified by increasing the complexity of ecotone zones between water and shore as well as increasing the level of insolation by maintaining an intermediate level of zone complexity zalewski et al 1998 the feedback loop between the hydrological cycle and terrestrial ecosystems which act as natural recirculating pumps and filters to improve water quality is of significant importance as it determines up to 95 of the water circulation on continents wwap 2018 however it should be borne in mind that these interactions demonstrate considerable spatial variation it should be stressed that despite its great importance for the development of a successful strategy for adapting the catchment area to climate change this relationship has not yet been taken into account in water management the integration of knowledge explaining the interactions between the hydrological cycle and molecular to catchment level ecological processes in the context of evolutionary processes was first initiated two decades ago as part of the unesco ihp this integration also cleared the way to developing innovative system solutions in water management zalewski et al 1997 zalewski 2000 chícharo chícharo 2008 harper et al 2008 jörgensen 2016 chícharo et al 2006 to allow society to participate in measures to improve the condition of a catchment area it is necessary to explain the basic processes taking place in ecosystems to the public to emphasise the importance of human impact and to include the public in citizen science activities e g monitoring water levels in wells or reservoirs e g chicharo et al 2015 challenges and opportunities for improving the quality of water resources through ecohydrological nature based solutions poland as the case study as the mechanism driving the circulation of carbon phosphorus nitrogen and other elements in the biosphere is water any activity aimed at harmonizing the needs of the global society with the increased potential of the biosphere should take its as a point of reference as the hydrological mesocycle at the catchment basin scale this approach not only enables the analysis and quantification of processes but also allows hydrotechnical solutions to be harmonized with ecohydrological nbs however as such holistic ecohydrology based approaches encompass the entire catchment area they require the involvement of society as a whole for them to be effective one such area for improvement is the scattered anthropopressure generated by all its members such sources account for up to 50 of negative impacts on ecosystems one particular example is the phosphorus nitrogen and dioxin pollution among others from agricultural areas and cities that reaches the baltic sea as a result of the rainfall in june and july this pollution represents an important factor in the formation of toxic blue green algal blooms fig 6 in the worldwide scale including poland water shortages are a growing problem often due to the decline of snow cover during last decades and the increasing incidence of prolonged rainless periods the previous ten years has seen a falling trend in water level raising concerns about its availability for agriculture industry the population in general and wastewater management especially since it concerns the beginning of the vegetation period therefore throughout the country urgent measures are needed to retain water throughout the catchment area in river valleys dam reservoirs ecotone zones ponds wetlands ponds and intra field ditches this is also an important consideration in the autumn winter period when water availability is relatively high however increasing retention requires the water to be of good quality especially in renatured rivers and reservoirs polders and aquaculture ponds the problems of increasing eutrophication and water pollution affect not only the resources of inland waters but also the baltic sea which is one of the most polluted marine waters in the world the sea is fed by numerous rivers with the neva vistula measles kemi and niemen being five of the largest these transport pollution from a catchment area covering four times the area of the sea itself for example it is believed that a total of 825 800 tonnes of total nitrogen and 30 900 tonnes of total phosphorus reached the baltic sea in 2014 this value includes 169 900 tonnes of nitrogen and 12 800 tonnes of phosphorus from the polish area alone mainly via the vistula and the oder representing 21 and 41 of the total load entering the baltic sea respectively data from helcom report 2018 ecohydrology nature based solutions for water quality management enhancing the efficiency of sewage treatment plants with eh nbs point sources including urban domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants located in river catchment areas contribute significantly to the overall level of pollution such pollution are often discharged into rivers from where it is carried to dam reservoirs lakes and eventually the coastal zones an idea of the potential risk to surface water quality can be seen in fig 7 which shows the number of wastewater treatment plants located in the single pilica river catchment with an area of 9245 km2 and the volume of discharged wastewater loads municipal wastewater treatment plants have a high environmental impact as they produce significant cumulative loads of discharged wastewater recent research indicates that small wastewater treatment plants 2000 pe have an extremely negative impact on the quality of surface waters in poland often discharging sewage containing phosphorus and nitrogen at levels 200 300 above the permissible standards kiedrzyńska et al 2014 in addition to this pollution they also represent a source of dioxins and dioxin like compounds pathogens drug resistant bacteria with antibiotic resistance genes to the environment recent research shows that treated sewage from small municipal sewage treatment plants contained higher concentrations of drug resistant bacteria than that produced by larger plants koniuszewska et al 2020 harnisz et al 2020 the results of these studies indicate that microbiological risks should be constantly monitored especially in small wastewater treatment plants and that effective strategies should be implemented to prevent the spread of determinants of antibiotic resistance to aquatic ecosystems small wastewater treatment plants present a considerable challenge for wastewater management because they often have outdated technology which results in problems with maintaining appropriate wastewater quality parameters in addition as they also have a very limited capacity to receive wastewater their failure rate is high during periods of heavy rainfall with such failure being accompanied by uncontrolled discharges of untreated sewage into the environment to solve this problem eh nbs was proposed based on the hybrid sequential wastewater biofiltration system dedicated to small sewage treatment plants which cleans treated wastewater before it reaches the river fig 8 kiedrzyńska et al 2017 such low cost hybrid biofiltration systems when used as additional wastewater treatment elements are an effective tools for reducing pollution loads from point sources and improving water quality in river catchments high efficiency buffer zones for reduction of non point source pollution from agriculture another form of eh nbs is the use of high efficiency buffer zones these are recommended for use at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in areas of intense nutrient pollution in shallow groundwater izydorczyk et al 2019 they are land water ecotones whose efficiency in removing nutrients has been increased by the construction of a denitrification wall with or without a biogeochemical barrier prototypes of two high efficiency buffer zones have been designed constructed and tested on the shoreline of the sulejów reservoir fig 9 as part of the life ekorob project www ekorob pl it is recommended to use a denitrification wall as the main element of a high efficiency buffer zone in areas with high levels of nitrate pollution in groundwater the denitrifying wall is composed of various types of organic matter such as brown coal or pine shavings which serves as a carbon source for denitrifying bacteria when mixed with the soil the bed intensifies the denitrification process analysis of the high efficiency buffer zone above the sulejów reservoir found the denitrification wall was capable of removing 67 of incident nitrates izydorczyk et al 2019 in contrast where high phosphorus concentrations are present in shallow groundwater a biogeochemical barrier based on limestone should be used to strengthen the plant buffer zone this limestone barrier increases the removal of phosphorus by adsorbing it to the surface in the first year of operation the concentration of phosphates in groundwater was found to be reduced by 58 as a result of passing through the prototype barrier izydorczyk et al 2019 it should be emphasized that the implementation of nbss is particularly important in conditions of strong anthropopressure in addition a thorough analysis of the natural conditions needs to be performed as well as the sources of pollutant emissions as well as the routes of their transfer to the aquatic ecosystem further studies are needed before the implementation phase to allow the selection of the most effective tools to adapt them to the prevailing specific conditions in the catchment area and to optimize their effectiveness furthermore in order to effectively reduce diffuse pollution solutions based on the use of natural processes including ecohydrological biotechnologies should be implemented at the catchment scale in this case mathematical modelling should be used to identify priority areas for example in the case of the solution used in the pilica catchment area swat analysis identified very strong spatial differentiations in the levels of biogenic compound emissions these designated priority areas constituted approximately 6 6 of the pilica catchment area covered by the project and 16 3 of the arable land area located within the catchment area piniewski et al 2015 a detailed survey of the point sources of pollutant emissions in the catchment area should be performed to allow precise targeting of effective tools to achieve maximum improvement of the environment at minimum economic cost izydorczyk et al 2019 pressure is also placed on aquatic ecosystems by the use and uncontrolled movement of pesticides the main source of which is intensive agriculture in the lower pilica river basin in tributaries located in agricultural areas the concentrations of the popular herbicide mcpa i e 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxy acetic acid were found to exceed 6 µg l and its presence was confirmed in 65 of the analysed water samples during research conducted in 2018 2019 a total of 30 different pesticide substances were identified in four tributaries of the pilica jarosiewicz et al in progress ecohydrological biotechnologies for the reduction of point pollution in agricultural areas agriculture is more dependent on natural conditions then the other two pillars of the economy services and industry its environmental impact is significant but varies from region to region depending on the farming practices used improper fertilization results in the outflow of nutrients and thus the creation of diffuse pollution which is much more difficult to limit than point source pollution leachate from point sources of nitrogen contamination such as unprotected landfills containing organic fertilizers placed directly on the ground or discharges of domestic wastewater septic tanks in rural areas often exceed the nitrate concentration standards allowed by the eu nitrate directive 50 mg no3 l by several times these also have to potential to become sources of diffuse pollution by spreading across the catchment area the organic manure plate omp is a structure constructed from a carefully selected source of organic carbon which supports the development of a suitable population of microorganisms e g denitrifying bacteria whose activity results in the production of natural environmentally friendly nitrogen gas n2 the identification of soil bacteria capable of nitrogen transformation including nitrification and denitrification processes allowed for the development of microbiological activators which can be used to accelerate the removal of nitrates and ammonium ions in the constructed barriers this in turn improves the quality of leachate from point sources of pollution such as manure landfills mankiewicz boczek et al 2017 this technology is protected by patent no pl 231378 the omp is used to protect groundwater against the migration of nitrogen compounds from manure heaps into the ground with its simple construction the deposits with carbon substrate and bacteria can be installed at the manure storage site in a horizontal position directly below the landfill or a vertical one obstructing the sideways movement of leachate from the landfill this biotechnology allows a barrier to be created to suit manure storage of any size or more importantly any location in addition this use of denitrifying microorganisms can shorten the time to optimal operation of the newly constructed deposits and provide protection against periods of long term drought in addition a temperate climate zone one of the most important factors determining the continued effective operation of the denitrification deposits is the level of moisture during their construction as long term desiccation of the deposit threatens the efficiency of the denitrification deposits and the microorganisms present therein it is recommended that it should be placed deeper underground even at a depth of 2 2 5 m to protect against the risk of long term drought omp based solutions are particularly suited to farms that do not have adequate infrastructure for storing organic fertilizers this solution is cheaper than its concrete counterparts and being made of natural materials the board is fully biodegradable and environmentally friendly it also contributes to the implementation of the eu water framework directive and the eu nitrates framework directive it is also characterized by the so called clean biotechnology without any negative environmental side effects or landscape deformation the regulation of hydrology biocenosis interactions in the face of climate change and increasing anthropopressure ecosystem protection and rehabilitation programs require the use of innovative nbs approaches based on ecohydrological principles in order to fully understand the reactions of organisms to hydrological factors and to be able to regulate them it is necessary not only to prioritize them but also to understand the complex dynamics of their influences this can be achieved through the use of mathematical modelling or neural networks during a detailed study of the sulejowski reservoir zalewski et al 1990 demonstrated that by regulating the water level during spring it is possible to control the numbers of predatory fish fry and thus regulate the pressure on zooplankton larger fish populations translate into a reduction of toxic cyanobacterial blooms further refinements of the research enabled the construction of a mathematical model describing biotic interactions in the pelagic region dalis model wojtal frankiewicz et al 2015 in addition a kohonen self organizing map som a basic type of neural network has also been used for the recognition of long term patterns in the seasonal dynamics of plankton daphnia spp leptodora kindtii and cyanobacteria in response to abiotic factors this method was used to account for the high inter annual variability of the examined parameters and their often non linear relationships moreover unlike classical statistical methods soms can be used to process data expressed in different measurement scales a common obstacle in ecological studies the model was developed on the basis of qualitative and quantitative data describing the relationships between phytoplankton filtering zooplankton daphnia spp predatory zooplankton the pelagic invertebrate predator leptodora kindtii as well as planktonovorous fish and perch fry the model showed that the predatory water flea l kindtii and perch fry play significant roles in the reduction of daphnia spp biomass a close relationship was also observed between the dynamics of the biomass of daphnia spp and feeding conditions it was also found that the trophic interactions are more clearly marked in periods with stable hydrological conditions inflow of 30 50 m3s 1 by simulating the different pressures exerted by fry and l kindtii on daphnia spp during these periods it is possible to predict the course of changes in the biomass of filtering water fleas during periods of high flow i e in unstable hydrological conditions zooplankton are flushed out of the reservoir by flood waves thus interfering with the interaction with daphnia spp predators these results demonstrate that biological processes are regulated by a hierarchy of abiotic and biotic factors when they are unstable abiotic processes including the hydrological regime have a dominant effect on organisms however when the abiotic factors are stable and predictable the biotic interactions gain precedence this is in line with the model proposed by zalewski and naiman 1985 som analysis fig 10 wojtal frankiewicz et al 2015 confirmed the results of previous empirical studies during which the intensity of the bloom in the sulejowski reservoir was reduced from the predicted 15 7 to 7 1 mg l by regulating the water level frątczak izydorczyk 2015 it also revealed important new aspects of the interaction between hydrology and biocenosis such as the role of predatory l kindtii these findings highlighted the possibility of using hydrobiomanpulation to improve water quality in eutrophic lowland reservoirs the dalis model indicates that for a dam reservoir the hierarchy of hydrological and biotic factors changes with the seasons and is also influenced by the hydrological dynamics this is of great importance both for reducing the impact of the catchment area on the reservoir and for improving its resistance to the symptoms of eutrophication methods applied in ecohydrology hydroacoustics for the analysis of large scale ecohydrological process dynamics in the ecosystem an important element of the ecohydrology approach is the quantification of processes this stage underpins the understanding of the structure mechanism of action and dynamics of the processes during this stage it is important to acquire accurate qualitative and quantitative data when studying biological processes that are dynamically changing and covering a specific time and spatial scale currently the only methods known to ensure simultaneous testing of large areas such as water bodies are based on hydroacoustic approaches thanks to their repeatability insensitivity and non invasiveness for living organisms and the environment they are widely used for monitoring natural objects fig 11 godlewska et al 2018 zalewski 2020 molecular biology methods for the identification of threats and development of ecohydrological biotechnologies gene and protein level research provides an insight into processes that are critical to the activity of organisms and their behaviour including their sensitivity to the environment and their dependence on it by taking a molecular individual to macro ecosystem approach it is possible to obtain the necessary knowledge to improve water quality and increase the sustainability potential wbsr ce at catchment level zalewski 2020 molecular biology based studies allow early assessment of toxic cyanobacterial blooms caused by intensified eutrophication such blooms are responsible for inter alia allergic reactions vomiting and diarrhoea and chronic consumption of water containing microcystins hepatotoxins can lead to disorders of the digestive system and the possibility of liver cancer fig 12 these is a need for quantitative data on cyanobacteria genes to understand how environmental conditions can contribute to the formation of cyanobacterial blooms 16s rrna gene as well as on the role and frequency of cyanobacteria toxic genotypes mcy gene cluster responsible for the production of microcystins gągała et al 2014 an important element for the implementation of the ecohydrology concept is the understanding of the interaction between organisms the first step in the development of future biotechnological solutions aimed at regulating the presence of cyanobacteria and their toxins in reservoirs and lakes is to ensure the traceability and characterisation of bacteria associated with the toxic cyanobacteria research conducted on sulejowski reservoir made it possible to detect bacteria of the genus sphingosinicella capable of degrading microcystins fig 12 it was estimated that the environmentally derived jez8l strain could remove more than 90 of cyanotoxins font nájera et al 2017 within seven days in turn there is a need for a better understanding of the microorganisms responsible for the transformation and reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in groundwater and surface water to allow the development and optimisation of biotechnological solutions on the catchment scale genetic and enzymatic analyses enable the identification isolation and selection of the most effective bacterial strains in nutrients transformation which can increase the efficiency of sedimentation and biofiltration barriers font nájera et al 2020 font nájera et al 2021a 2021b phytoremediation and rhizoremediation as effective tools for water ecosystem protection rehabilitation and management biological remediation methods such as phytoremediation and rhizobacteria assisted phytoremediation rhizoremediation are effective tools for pollutant removal and protection rehabilitation and management of land water ecosystems during phytoremediation plants play a crucial role in stabilization of water and soil ecosystems they also serve as a natural barrier for contaminants and can detoxify the environment with an array of catabolic enzymes the selection of appropriate plant species and cultivars is critical for an effective removal of given contaminant from soil for example the plants of the family cucurbitaceae and genera tagetes l and festuca l demonstrate high tolerance to increased level of pollution and effective removal of pollutants and are excellent phytoremediators urbaniak et al 2020 2019 rhizoremediation is a naturally occurring process within the plant root zone rhizosphere where the growth of microorganisms and their degradative activity are stimulated by root exudates enriched by plant secondary metabolites psms rhizomicrobiome activity stimulated by plant derived compounds can substantially enhance the degree of contamination removal by various methods including stimulating biodegradation enhancing contaminant bioavailability and boosting plant health examples of the successful application of phyto rhizoremediation for removing pollutants from aquatic ecosystems i e river and reservoir sediments can be found in works by urbaniak et al 2020 2019 2016 and wyrwicka et al 2019 urbaniak et al 2020 showed that thermal processing and further phytoremediation with c pepo l effectively mitigated the ecological risk related to pollutants in river sediments urbaniak et al 2019 also report that the applied plants had a positive influence on soil quality amended with urban sediments the growth of c sativus l cv cezar and c pepo l cv atena polka enhanced the removal of pollutants by up to 69 wyrwicka et al 2019 evaluated the potential of cucumis sativus l cv cezar as a remediation tool for contaminated urban sediment the findings indicate that the plant was not only resistant to the pollutants but enhanced their removal in a relatively short time cucurbits were found to enhance the amelioration of phytotoxicity and decrease the level of pollution in soil treated with contaminated sediments urbaniak at al 2016 in addition the combined application of plants from the genus tagetes tagetes patula l and festuca festuca arundinacea schreb and two rhizobacterial inoculants fig 2 was found to mitigate the phytotoxicity of studied sediment and improve the efficiency of pollutant removal urbaniak et al 2019 holistic approach of ecohydrology demonstration sites the conversion of urban flood threats and adaptation of the blue green city to climate change in the anthropocene era more than half of the global population lives in cities as such it is essential that the urban space should be shaped to best ensure health and quality of life such development is strongly influenced by the quality of the urban environment which is in turn highly dependent on water retention in the urban space one such solution is the blue green network concept developed in lodz poland a city located on the watershed and hence particularly sensitive to increasing climate change zalewski et al 2012 urban areas are characterised by large sealed areas roofs roads car parks from which stormwater is discharged into sewers this runoff pollutes aquatic ecosystems does not feed groundwater and can cause local short term flooding an additional effect of accelerating the outflow of stormwater from the city are the development of cones of depression and the extensive transformation of urban river beds in the face of climate change there is a need to increase stormwater retention in cities this can be achieved by shaping green areas and improving water retention which also increases the efficiency of greenery in reducing the heat islands and air pollutants that cause allergies and asthma in residents to allow it to be kept in the city in small retention bodies surrounded by greenery storm water must be cleaned for this purpose sequential sedimentation and biofiltration systems sssb zalewski et al 2012 jurczak et al 2018 were developed for urban areas fig 13 previous hydroengineering methods such as settlers and separators do not ensure sufficient water quality in urban rivers and reservoirs therefore one method used in the upper bzura to improve water quality and recreational potential was a hybrid solution integrating existing hydrotechnical solutions with sssb this approach used a system comprising two settlers and slat separators located in the water body itself to clean rainwater running off parking lots and roads it consisted of a sedimentation zone a gabion partition with geofibre and a vegetation zone its efficiency was found to be above 90 for suspensions and more than 60 for biogenic substances in addition the biological structure of the water body was shaped to provide greater resistance to eutrophication biomanipulation thanks to the above solutions the upper bzura and the reservoirs in arturówek have become an important element of an urban blue green network improving the quality of life of the inhabitants in the city lateral reservoirs for the enhancement of water retentiveness and wbsrce an important element of an ecohydrological solution is its potential harmonisation with the existing hydrological infrastructure one such example is the design of the constructed łask water reservoir in the grabia river basin fig 14 the concept for the reservoir was to integrate it into the landscape maximizing its wbsr ce potential the primary function of the planned reservoir is recreational as such one aim of the design is to maintain the natural character of the valuable natural river while guaranteeing good quality water in the reservoir this is achieved by designing a system that analyses the quality of water and then controls the supply to the reservoir accordingly using an automatic barrier thereby reducing the risk of toxic blooms and ensuring constant water flow in the river nature based solutions require the translation of a holistic understanding of processes and interactions between water and biota from molecular to catchment scale through the following aims 1 increase the complexity of agricultural landscape reduce soil erosion and freshwater ecosystem eutrophication reverse biodiversity decline increase the economic efficiency of agricultural practices 2 construct lateral reservoirs resilient to toxic algal blooms which do not disturb the river continuum based on environmental flow and flood pulse condensing stage analysis zalewski 2020 kiedrzyńska et al 2021 such reservoirs demonstrate increased water retentiveness and higher water quantity and quality in the river valley w increase biodiversity b provide recreation for society s and enhance the resilience of the catchment to the climate change r ecohydrology for the development of a sustainability culture and education the essence of ecohydrology as a science integrating hydrology and ecology is that it uses scientific knowledge to increase the potential of catchment areas by regulating the interaction retention and purification of water thus improving the microclimate and reducing the transfer of nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural areas to aquatic ecosystems the potential to provide these benefits to society depends on the condition of the water and determines its natural capital such capital can be maintained reduced or enhanced by culture and education ce wantzen et al 2016 such maintenance requires supporting or increasing investments for example blue green infrastructure krauze wagner 2019 however such measures create competition for space and resources both between economic sectors and stakeholders social capital based on culture of sustainability and education ce is therefore an indispensable condition for building natural capital socio ecohydrology has developed as a response to this need with three objectives 1 education research is based on learning and the exchange of information and experience between stakeholders this leads to the identification and filling of gaps in knowledge regarding the environment and interactions between society and nature 2 participation citizen science based co creation live laboratories to disseminate knowledge about cause and effect relationships 3 building a compromise since it is not possible to fully meet all needs and expectations a social consensus on priority values and optimal solutions is necessary as well as agreement to incur sustainable development costs e g acceptance of payments

citizen science product produced by the amber adaptive management of barriers in european rivers https amber international project is the barrier tracker application which maps and classifies existing hydrotechnical barriers which modify the functioning of rivers as a continuum e g by blocking fish migration in rivers it is an it tool which in addition to its practical dimension aims to promote the problems associated with the fragmentation of european rivers among those interested in the ecological status of running water bodies the app is free available to anyone through phone app stores and is currently available in as many as 11 european national languages the user is guided through the process of locating and categorizing a given structure by a friendly interface using intuitive pictograms and simple definitions of individual issues the user can assign the construction to a category determine the approximate height of the migration barrier and its maintenance status and add a photograph of the observed structure the practical objective of the application is to collect additional data to verify the accuracy and timeliness of the databases held by individual european

transdisciplinary science for solving problems zalewski et al 1997 a prototype for nature based solutions zalewski 2000 introduced by unesco ihp technical documents zalewski m janauer g a jolánkai g 1997 zalewski 2000 the scientific background to use ecosystem properties as management tool for achieving sustainability of water resources it introduces a number of new aspects to both sustainability science and water management solutions 1 a new evolutionary ecosystem paradigm that should inspire action by society especially for reducing diffuse forms of anthropopressure the evolutionary aspect entails the knowledge that each of us can have a positive or negative impact on the environment and the sum of these interactions determines our future the ecosystem approach means that the reference system for both strategic catchment and operational ecosystem habitat water bodies planning and innovation should comprise three processes describing the functioning of each ecosystem the circulation of water and matter and energy flow 2 understanding the interaction between water and biocenosis from molecular scale to landscape scale enables the use of ecosystem processes as a tool in water management this can be facilitated by regulating hydrological processes reduction of diffuse pollution by shaping the structure of biocenosis e g with the use of high efficiency ecotone and intra field buffer zones and by increasing biocenosis productivity by regulating the hydrological cycle to maintain soil moisture employing wetlands sequential sedimentation and biofiltration systems for water purification and increasing the retention of river systems in urban areas and other nbs 3 enhancing the potential of catchment areas biospheres through systemic solutions fig 15 such approaches include the regulation of ecohydrological processes harmonisation with hydrotechnical infrastructure and integration into economic sociological and legal sciences declaration of competing interest the

996,ecohydrology is a transdisciplinary sustainability science based on an understanding of hydrosphere ecosphere interactions from the molecular to catchment scale developed within the framework of the unesco intergovernmental hydrological programme unesco ihp this paper introduces a broad range of ecohydrological nature based solutions eh nbs that have been developed based on dual regulation considering understanding of reciprocal h b hydrogeology biocenosis and b h interactions eh nbs are particularly effective at reducing various dispersed impacts especially non point source pollution which generate up to 50 of nutrient pollution load from the catchment the importance of methodology integration of ecological and hydrological disciplines which reduces impact and increases landscape water and nutrients retention and freshwater ecosystem resilience which is becoming important element of integrated water resource management iwrm was also presented considering the above implementation of ecohydrology aims to increase catchment sustainability potential expressed by water biodiversity ecosystem services and resilience wbsr due to the specific nature of dispersed impact generated by human factor in the catchment it is crucial to engage society through culture and education ce to ensure the implementation and long term efficiency introduction the coronavirus epidemic has prompted reflection on the long term consequences of the increasing exploitation of global resources and raises the question of how the shrinking ecological capacity of the biosphere can be reconciled with the continual growth in the human population and consumer social expectations currently 40 of the world s population does not have enough water and according to a unesco report this amount will rise by around 30 over the next 20 years suggesting that more than five billion people could suffer from water scarcity by 2050 this figure will be exacerbated by climate change increased demand and water pollution un wwdr 2018 those challenges characterised by increasing complexity require a new paradigm and innovative methods the only way to achieve this should be to replace the mechanistic paradigm formulated at the beginning of the industrial era by the french philosopher la mettrie with one based on an evolutionary and ecosystem model zalewski 2014 zalewski 2021 the sociocentric mechanistic paradigm regards the biosphere is a black box a system that we cannot even try to understand it has always provided unlimited resources and at the same time receives and absorbs all the waste and pollution generated by humanity this approach implies that energy and materials are extracted from non renewable but relatively easy to use fossil resources in contrast the evolutionary and ecosystem approach reduces exploitation of renewable resources assuming that quality of life is not a function of material and energy consumption in the new paradigm the term evolution expresses the need for societies to understand that biospheres and ecosystems have always undergone changes even so in the anthropocene era each of us decides to some extent whether to continue to use natural resources as a black box leading to an inevitable catastrophe or whether we can begin to rationally use the potential of the magnificent spacecraft that is the earth as a more disciplined crew the need to change to an evolutionary ecosystem paradigm has recently been recognised by the committee of the regions of the european commission https cor europa eu en our work pages opiniontimeline aspx opid cdr 541 2020 the committee has extended its climate change adaptation strategy to include an evolutionary ecosystem approach based on a framework created by ecohydrology this change in approach to governing the catchment economy is a significant one and in view of the new challenges facing the environmentalsciences a particularly urgent one this urgency is driven by the fact that these challenges are cumulative they occur in the environment through the combined influence of various human activities the environmental impact of individual actions is small but when their effects overlap they can significantly change the environment it is unfortunately extremely difficult to predict such cumulative effects both due to the multitude of factors and by the synergistic and antagonistic interactions between them to reverse the process of biosphere degradation it is necessary to integrate knowledge from a range of different environmental and related science disciplines the integration of ecological and hydrological processes to enable their regulation and thus increase the ecological potential of river basins river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 and the debate over the dependent and independent factors governing population and communities in the ecosystem krebs 1972 become a reference point for the abiotic biotic regulatory concept fig 1 abrc zalewski naiman 1985 which integrates hydrological and ecological processes for prediction of hierarchy of drivers which is changing along the river continuum by describing the changes occurring in a hierarchy of factors relative to hydrological and ecological gradients it is possible to regulate ecohydrological processes and increase the sustainability potential of the river basin wbsr expressed as water quantity and quality biodiversity benefits for society and resistance to anthropopressure zalewski 2014 zalewski 2021 as a description of river basin potential based on these four elements is needed to allow measures to compensate for cumulative anthropopressure abrc has become the starting point for the formulation of the basic assumptions of ecohydrology in addition to the dependencies given above the model also highlights the potential consequences of increasing water run off to the sea occurring as a result of river regulation deforestation and homogenisation of the agricultural landscape through the eradication of intra field trees and the introduction of monocultural cultivation in temperate climates in conditions of limited water resources and with the additional impact of climate change these practices have negative influences on soil erosion hasten the loss of organic matter and nutrients from soil reduce bioproduction intensify the eutrophication of watercourses reservoirs and coastal areas and encourage biodiversity loss the hydrological cycle the nutrients spiral and the quality and quantity of available water resources in a particular climate zone determine the biological productivity of ecosystems the availability of water depends to a large extent on the climate the geomorphology of the catchment area and the level of plant cover as well as the form of use of the catchment area and the degree of human influence for example deserts have significantly less rainfall than a tropical rainforests and they also demonstrate significantly less productivity plant biomass and hence biodiversity in the temperate zone most carbon is locked up in dead organic matter because low temperature inhibits the rate of decomposition in a tropical rainforest the majority of carbon is found in plant tissues because this zone is characterized by a high rate of decomposition which in turn stimulates bioproduction and consequently biodiversity these relationships are collected in the general water carbon accumulation bioproductivity and biodiversity model wcabb fig 2 ecohydrology is based on process oriented thinking these processes can only be understood by the integration of hydrological and ecological processes in river systems across different climate zones i e the abiotic biotic regulatory continuum and wcabb zalewski naiman 1985 a combination of theoretical models and empirical evidences e g zalewski et al 1990 zalewski et al 1998 fig 4 provide the background for understanding the interplay between ecological interactions and hydrological processes and to formulate the concept of dual regulation wherein hydrological process are regulated by ecological structures and interactions and vice versa fig 3 a b considering the increasing cumulative impact of man on water resources and the complexity of the processes involved there is an urgent need to not only reduce emissions but enhance catchment sustainability potential wbsr ce using approaches based on ecohydrology principles zalewski et al 1997 zalewski 2002 ecohydrology is a science based on processes i e the interactions between water and biota from molecular to catchment scale an understanding of these is necessary to elaborate and implement all manner of nature based solutions nbss across the catchment hence the evolutionary ecosystemic character of ecohydrology is fundamental for creating a vision strategy and tactics for sustainable catchment management and the development of innovative nbss that can form a synergetic approach with hydroengineering methods to enhance catchment sustainability potential wbsr ce one of the very first empirical applications of ecohydrology was hydrobiomanipulation changes in the water level of a reservoir can influence the entire trophic pyramid and thus determine the accessibility of spawning habitats for fish as shown in the inductive model of ecohydrological processes fig 4 this model was used as a prototype for the dual regulation concept hydrological systems produce high pollutant loads which stimulate the development of toxic algal blooms if the levels of filtering zooplankton are diminished by zooplanktivorous fish however lowering the water level during the spawning period reduces the predatory pressure of fish on zooplankton thus increasing zooplankton biofiltration such changes improve the pattern of energy flow and nutrient circulation through the ecosystem and increase the resilience of the ecosystem to human impact ecohydrology the use of ecological properties as a management tool for enhancing catchment potential wbsr ce one of the key challenges faced by science in the 21st century is not only understanding the causal relationships between abiotic factors hydrological cycle nutrient circulation cycles and biotic factors ecological processes in all types of ecosystems but also linking them to the dynamics of society with regard to 1 prevention and reduction of floods droughts and other hazards 2 prevention of environmental degradation based on biodiversity assessment 3 enhancing sustainability potential wbsr with the provision of ecosystem services as a long term objective in order to meet this challenge research is becoming increasingly specialised specialisation is necessary to advance the biological sciences medicine and engineering but there is also a need for transdisciplinary methodological approaches based on integrating specialised branches of different fields this integrative approach also emphasises the development of energy efficient technologies taking natural ecosystem processes as an essential tool one example of a catchment scale ecohydrological approach is towards eutrophic reservoirs subject to toxic algal blooms the solution harnessed a range ecosystem biotechnologies in different sections of the catchment area to successfully reduce the nutrient load fig 5 the first step is to increase nutrients retention homogenized agricultural landscape levia et al 2020 in the catchment area by renewing the plant cover restoring buffer zones and optimising agricultural practices this can allow nutrients absorption in agricultural areas to be increased up to 30 ryszkowski kędziora 1993 the load reaching the river can be further reduced by the transformation of nutreints into plant biomass in the ecotone zone izydorczyk et al 2019 the wetlands in the river valley serve as buffer zones reducing the load of mineral organic and biogenic substances transported by the river down the river continuum carling petts 1992 kiedrzyńska et al 2014 in artificially constructed wetlands the nitrogen load can be further reduced by regulating the water level thus controlling the denitrification process bednarek zalewski 2007 mitsch gosselink 2007 the self cleaning process can be further intensified by increasing the complexity of ecotone zones between water and shore as well as increasing the level of insolation by maintaining an intermediate level of zone complexity zalewski et al 1998 the feedback loop between the hydrological cycle and terrestrial ecosystems which act as natural recirculating pumps and filters to improve water quality is of significant importance as it determines up to 95 of the water circulation on continents wwap 2018 however it should be borne in mind that these interactions demonstrate considerable spatial variation it should be stressed that despite its great importance for the development of a successful strategy for adapting the catchment area to climate change this relationship has not yet been taken into account in water management the integration of knowledge explaining the interactions between the hydrological cycle and molecular to catchment level ecological processes in the context of evolutionary processes was first initiated two decades ago as part of the unesco ihp this integration also cleared the way to developing innovative system solutions in water management zalewski et al 1997 zalewski 2000 chícharo chícharo 2008 harper et al 2008 jörgensen 2016 chícharo et al 2006 to allow society to participate in measures to improve the condition of a catchment area it is necessary to explain the basic processes taking place in ecosystems to the public to emphasise the importance of human impact and to include the public in citizen science activities e g monitoring water levels in wells or reservoirs e g chicharo et al 2015 challenges and opportunities for improving the quality of water resources through ecohydrological nature based solutions poland as the case study as the mechanism driving the circulation of carbon phosphorus nitrogen and other elements in the biosphere is water any activity aimed at harmonizing the needs of the global society with the increased potential of the biosphere should take its as a point of reference as the hydrological mesocycle at the catchment basin scale this approach not only enables the analysis and quantification of processes but also allows hydrotechnical solutions to be harmonized with ecohydrological nbs however as such holistic ecohydrology based approaches encompass the entire catchment area they require the involvement of society as a whole for them to be effective one such area for improvement is the scattered anthropopressure generated by all its members such sources account for up to 50 of negative impacts on ecosystems one particular example is the phosphorus nitrogen and dioxin pollution among others from agricultural areas and cities that reaches the baltic sea as a result of the rainfall in june and july this pollution represents an important factor in the formation of toxic blue green algal blooms fig 6 in the worldwide scale including poland water shortages are a growing problem often due to the decline of snow cover during last decades and the increasing incidence of prolonged rainless periods the previous ten years has seen a falling trend in water level raising concerns about its availability for agriculture industry the population in general and wastewater management especially since it concerns the beginning of the vegetation period therefore throughout the country urgent measures are needed to retain water throughout the catchment area in river valleys dam reservoirs ecotone zones ponds wetlands ponds and intra field ditches this is also an important consideration in the autumn winter period when water availability is relatively high however increasing retention requires the water to be of good quality especially in renatured rivers and reservoirs polders and aquaculture ponds the problems of increasing eutrophication and water pollution affect not only the resources of inland waters but also the baltic sea which is one of the most polluted marine waters in the world the sea is fed by numerous rivers with the neva vistula measles kemi and niemen being five of the largest these transport pollution from a catchment area covering four times the area of the sea itself for example it is believed that a total of 825 800 tonnes of total nitrogen and 30 900 tonnes of total phosphorus reached the baltic sea in 2014 this value includes 169 900 tonnes of nitrogen and 12 800 tonnes of phosphorus from the polish area alone mainly via the vistula and the oder representing 21 and 41 of the total load entering the baltic sea respectively data from helcom report 2018 ecohydrology nature based solutions for water quality management enhancing the efficiency of sewage treatment plants with eh nbs point sources including urban domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants located in river catchment areas contribute significantly to the overall level of pollution such pollution are often discharged into rivers from where it is carried to dam reservoirs lakes and eventually the coastal zones an idea of the potential risk to surface water quality can be seen in fig 7 which shows the number of wastewater treatment plants located in the single pilica river catchment with an area of 9245 km2 and the volume of discharged wastewater loads municipal wastewater treatment plants have a high environmental impact as they produce significant cumulative loads of discharged wastewater recent research indicates that small wastewater treatment plants 2000 pe have an extremely negative impact on the quality of surface waters in poland often discharging sewage containing phosphorus and nitrogen at levels 200 300 above the permissible standards kiedrzyńska et al 2014 in addition to this pollution they also represent a source of dioxins and dioxin like compounds pathogens drug resistant bacteria with antibiotic resistance genes to the environment recent research shows that treated sewage from small municipal sewage treatment plants contained higher concentrations of drug resistant bacteria than that produced by larger plants koniuszewska et al 2020 harnisz et al 2020 the results of these studies indicate that microbiological risks should be constantly monitored especially in small wastewater treatment plants and that effective strategies should be implemented to prevent the spread of determinants of antibiotic resistance to aquatic ecosystems small wastewater treatment plants present a considerable challenge for wastewater management because they often have outdated technology which results in problems with maintaining appropriate wastewater quality parameters in addition as they also have a very limited capacity to receive wastewater their failure rate is high during periods of heavy rainfall with such failure being accompanied by uncontrolled discharges of untreated sewage into the environment to solve this problem eh nbs was proposed based on the hybrid sequential wastewater biofiltration system dedicated to small sewage treatment plants which cleans treated wastewater before it reaches the river fig 8 kiedrzyńska et al 2017 such low cost hybrid biofiltration systems when used as additional wastewater treatment elements are an effective tools for reducing pollution loads from point sources and improving water quality in river catchments high efficiency buffer zones for reduction of non point source pollution from agriculture another form of eh nbs is the use of high efficiency buffer zones these are recommended for use at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in areas of intense nutrient pollution in shallow groundwater izydorczyk et al 2019 they are land water ecotones whose efficiency in removing nutrients has been increased by the construction of a denitrification wall with or without a biogeochemical barrier prototypes of two high efficiency buffer zones have been designed constructed and tested on the shoreline of the sulejów reservoir fig 9 as part of the life ekorob project www ekorob pl it is recommended to use a denitrification wall as the main element of a high efficiency buffer zone in areas with high levels of nitrate pollution in groundwater the denitrifying wall is composed of various types of organic matter such as brown coal or pine shavings which serves as a carbon source for denitrifying bacteria when mixed with the soil the bed intensifies the denitrification process analysis of the high efficiency buffer zone above the sulejów reservoir found the denitrification wall was capable of removing 67 of incident nitrates izydorczyk et al 2019 in contrast where high phosphorus concentrations are present in shallow groundwater a biogeochemical barrier based on limestone should be used to strengthen the plant buffer zone this limestone barrier increases the removal of phosphorus by adsorbing it to the surface in the first year of operation the concentration of phosphates in groundwater was found to be reduced by 58 as a result of passing through the prototype barrier izydorczyk et al 2019 it should be emphasized that the implementation of nbss is particularly important in conditions of strong anthropopressure in addition a thorough analysis of the natural conditions needs to be performed as well as the sources of pollutant emissions as well as the routes of their transfer to the aquatic ecosystem further studies are needed before the implementation phase to allow the selection of the most effective tools to adapt them to the prevailing specific conditions in the catchment area and to optimize their effectiveness furthermore in order to effectively reduce diffuse pollution solutions based on the use of natural processes including ecohydrological biotechnologies should be implemented at the catchment scale in this case mathematical modelling should be used to identify priority areas for example in the case of the solution used in the pilica catchment area swat analysis identified very strong spatial differentiations in the levels of biogenic compound emissions these designated priority areas constituted approximately 6 6 of the pilica catchment area covered by the project and 16 3 of the arable land area located within the catchment area piniewski et al 2015 a detailed survey of the point sources of pollutant emissions in the catchment area should be performed to allow precise targeting of effective tools to achieve maximum improvement of the environment at minimum economic cost izydorczyk et al 2019 pressure is also placed on aquatic ecosystems by the use and uncontrolled movement of pesticides the main source of which is intensive agriculture in the lower pilica river basin in tributaries located in agricultural areas the concentrations of the popular herbicide mcpa i e 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxy acetic acid were found to exceed 6 µg l and its presence was confirmed in 65 of the analysed water samples during research conducted in 2018 2019 a total of 30 different pesticide substances were identified in four tributaries of the pilica jarosiewicz et al in progress ecohydrological biotechnologies for the reduction of point pollution in agricultural areas agriculture is more dependent on natural conditions then the other two pillars of the economy services and industry its environmental impact is significant but varies from region to region depending on the farming practices used improper fertilization results in the outflow of nutrients and thus the creation of diffuse pollution which is much more difficult to limit than point source pollution leachate from point sources of nitrogen contamination such as unprotected landfills containing organic fertilizers placed directly on the ground or discharges of domestic wastewater septic tanks in rural areas often exceed the nitrate concentration standards allowed by the eu nitrate directive 50 mg no3 l by several times these also have to potential to become sources of diffuse pollution by spreading across the catchment area the organic manure plate omp is a structure constructed from a carefully selected source of organic carbon which supports the development of a suitable population of microorganisms e g denitrifying bacteria whose activity results in the production of natural environmentally friendly nitrogen gas n2 the identification of soil bacteria capable of nitrogen transformation including nitrification and denitrification processes allowed for the development of microbiological activators which can be used to accelerate the removal of nitrates and ammonium ions in the constructed barriers this in turn improves the quality of leachate from point sources of pollution such as manure landfills mankiewicz boczek et al 2017 this technology is protected by patent no pl 231378 the omp is used to protect groundwater against the migration of nitrogen compounds from manure heaps into the ground with its simple construction the deposits with carbon substrate and bacteria can be installed at the manure storage site in a horizontal position directly below the landfill or a vertical one obstructing the sideways movement of leachate from the landfill this biotechnology allows a barrier to be created to suit manure storage of any size or more importantly any location in addition this use of denitrifying microorganisms can shorten the time to optimal operation of the newly constructed deposits and provide protection against periods of long term drought in addition a temperate climate zone one of the most important factors determining the continued effective operation of the denitrification deposits is the level of moisture during their construction as long term desiccation of the deposit threatens the efficiency of the denitrification deposits and the microorganisms present therein it is recommended that it should be placed deeper underground even at a depth of 2 2 5 m to protect against the risk of long term drought omp based solutions are particularly suited to farms that do not have adequate infrastructure for storing organic fertilizers this solution is cheaper than its concrete counterparts and being made of natural materials the board is fully biodegradable and environmentally friendly it also contributes to the implementation of the eu water framework directive and the eu nitrates framework directive it is also characterized by the so called clean biotechnology without any negative environmental side effects or landscape deformation the regulation of hydrology biocenosis interactions in the face of climate change and increasing anthropopressure ecosystem protection and rehabilitation programs require the use of innovative nbs approaches based on ecohydrological principles in order to fully understand the reactions of organisms to hydrological factors and to be able to regulate them it is necessary not only to prioritize them but also to understand the complex dynamics of their influences this can be achieved through the use of mathematical modelling or neural networks during a detailed study of the sulejowski reservoir zalewski et al 1990 demonstrated that by regulating the water level during spring it is possible to control the numbers of predatory fish fry and thus regulate the pressure on zooplankton larger fish populations translate into a reduction of toxic cyanobacterial blooms further refinements of the research enabled the construction of a mathematical model describing biotic interactions in the pelagic region dalis model wojtal frankiewicz et al 2015 in addition a kohonen self organizing map som a basic type of neural network has also been used for the recognition of long term patterns in the seasonal dynamics of plankton daphnia spp leptodora kindtii and cyanobacteria in response to abiotic factors this method was used to account for the high inter annual variability of the examined parameters and their often non linear relationships moreover unlike classical statistical methods soms can be used to process data expressed in different measurement scales a common obstacle in ecological studies the model was developed on the basis of qualitative and quantitative data describing the relationships between phytoplankton filtering zooplankton daphnia spp predatory zooplankton the pelagic invertebrate predator leptodora kindtii as well as planktonovorous fish and perch fry the model showed that the predatory water flea l kindtii and perch fry play significant roles in the reduction of daphnia spp biomass a close relationship was also observed between the dynamics of the biomass of daphnia spp and feeding conditions it was also found that the trophic interactions are more clearly marked in periods with stable hydrological conditions inflow of 30 50 m3s 1 by simulating the different pressures exerted by fry and l kindtii on daphnia spp during these periods it is possible to predict the course of changes in the biomass of filtering water fleas during periods of high flow i e in unstable hydrological conditions zooplankton are flushed out of the reservoir by flood waves thus interfering with the interaction with daphnia spp predators these results demonstrate that biological processes are regulated by a hierarchy of abiotic and biotic factors when they are unstable abiotic processes including the hydrological regime have a dominant effect on organisms however when the abiotic factors are stable and predictable the biotic interactions gain precedence this is in line with the model proposed by zalewski and naiman 1985 som analysis fig 10 wojtal frankiewicz et al 2015 confirmed the results of previous empirical studies during which the intensity of the bloom in the sulejowski reservoir was reduced from the predicted 15 7 to 7 1 mg l by regulating the water level frątczak izydorczyk 2015 it also revealed important new aspects of the interaction between hydrology and biocenosis such as the role of predatory l kindtii these findings highlighted the possibility of using hydrobiomanpulation to improve water quality in eutrophic lowland reservoirs the dalis model indicates that for a dam reservoir the hierarchy of hydrological and biotic factors changes with the seasons and is also influenced by the hydrological dynamics this is of great importance both for reducing the impact of the catchment area on the reservoir and for improving its resistance to the symptoms of eutrophication methods applied in ecohydrology hydroacoustics for the analysis of large scale ecohydrological process dynamics in the ecosystem an important element of the ecohydrology approach is the quantification of processes this stage underpins the understanding of the structure mechanism of action and dynamics of the processes during this stage it is important to acquire accurate qualitative and quantitative data when studying biological processes that are dynamically changing and covering a specific time and spatial scale currently the only methods known to ensure simultaneous testing of large areas such as water bodies are based on hydroacoustic approaches thanks to their repeatability insensitivity and non invasiveness for living organisms and the environment they are widely used for monitoring natural objects fig 11 godlewska et al 2018 zalewski 2020 molecular biology methods for the identification of threats and development of ecohydrological biotechnologies gene and protein level research provides an insight into processes that are critical to the activity of organisms and their behaviour including their sensitivity to the environment and their dependence on it by taking a molecular individual to macro ecosystem approach it is possible to obtain the necessary knowledge to improve water quality and increase the sustainability potential wbsr ce at catchment level zalewski 2020 molecular biology based studies allow early assessment of toxic cyanobacterial blooms caused by intensified eutrophication such blooms are responsible for inter alia allergic reactions vomiting and diarrhoea and chronic consumption of water containing microcystins hepatotoxins can lead to disorders of the digestive system and the possibility of liver cancer fig 12 these is a need for quantitative data on cyanobacteria genes to understand how environmental conditions can contribute to the formation of cyanobacterial blooms 16s rrna gene as well as on the role and frequency of cyanobacteria toxic genotypes mcy gene cluster responsible for the production of microcystins gągała et al 2014 an important element for the implementation of the ecohydrology concept is the understanding of the interaction between organisms the first step in the development of future biotechnological solutions aimed at regulating the presence of cyanobacteria and their toxins in reservoirs and lakes is to ensure the traceability and characterisation of bacteria associated with the toxic cyanobacteria research conducted on sulejowski reservoir made it possible to detect bacteria of the genus sphingosinicella capable of degrading microcystins fig 12 it was estimated that the environmentally derived jez8l strain could remove more than 90 of cyanotoxins font nájera et al 2017 within seven days in turn there is a need for a better understanding of the microorganisms responsible for the transformation and reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in groundwater and surface water to allow the development and optimisation of biotechnological solutions on the catchment scale genetic and enzymatic analyses enable the identification isolation and selection of the most effective bacterial strains in nutrients transformation which can increase the efficiency of sedimentation and biofiltration barriers font nájera et al 2020 font nájera et al 2021a 2021b phytoremediation and rhizoremediation as effective tools for water ecosystem protection rehabilitation and management biological remediation methods such as phytoremediation and rhizobacteria assisted phytoremediation rhizoremediation are effective tools for pollutant removal and protection rehabilitation and management of land water ecosystems during phytoremediation plants play a crucial role in stabilization of water and soil ecosystems they also serve as a natural barrier for contaminants and can detoxify the environment with an array of catabolic enzymes the selection of appropriate plant species and cultivars is critical for an effective removal of given contaminant from soil for example the plants of the family cucurbitaceae and genera tagetes l and festuca l demonstrate high tolerance to increased level of pollution and effective removal of pollutants and are excellent phytoremediators urbaniak et al 2020 2019 rhizoremediation is a naturally occurring process within the plant root zone rhizosphere where the growth of microorganisms and their degradative activity are stimulated by root exudates enriched by plant secondary metabolites psms rhizomicrobiome activity stimulated by plant derived compounds can substantially enhance the degree of contamination removal by various methods including stimulating biodegradation enhancing contaminant bioavailability and boosting plant health examples of the successful application of phyto rhizoremediation for removing pollutants from aquatic ecosystems i e river and reservoir sediments can be found in works by urbaniak et al 2020 2019 2016 and wyrwicka et al 2019 urbaniak et al 2020 showed that thermal processing and further phytoremediation with c pepo l effectively mitigated the ecological risk related to pollutants in river sediments urbaniak et al 2019 also report that the applied plants had a positive influence on soil quality amended with urban sediments the growth of c sativus l cv cezar and c pepo l cv atena polka enhanced the removal of pollutants by up to 69 wyrwicka et al 2019 evaluated the potential of cucumis sativus l cv cezar as a remediation tool for contaminated urban sediment the findings indicate that the plant was not only resistant to the pollutants but enhanced their removal in a relatively short time cucurbits were found to enhance the amelioration of phytotoxicity and decrease the level of pollution in soil treated with contaminated sediments urbaniak at al 2016 in addition the combined application of plants from the genus tagetes tagetes patula l and festuca festuca arundinacea schreb and two rhizobacterial inoculants fig 2 was found to mitigate the phytotoxicity of studied sediment and improve the efficiency of pollutant removal urbaniak et al 2019 holistic approach of ecohydrology demonstration sites the conversion of urban flood threats and adaptation of the blue green city to climate change in the anthropocene era more than half of the global population lives in cities as such it is essential that the urban space should be shaped to best ensure health and quality of life such development is strongly influenced by the quality of the urban environment which is in turn highly dependent on water retention in the urban space one such solution is the blue green network concept developed in lodz poland a city located on the watershed and hence particularly sensitive to increasing climate change zalewski et al 2012 urban areas are characterised by large sealed areas roofs roads car parks from which stormwater is discharged into sewers this runoff pollutes aquatic ecosystems does not feed groundwater and can cause local short term flooding an additional effect of accelerating the outflow of stormwater from the city are the development of cones of depression and the extensive transformation of urban river beds in the face of climate change there is a need to increase stormwater retention in cities this can be achieved by shaping green areas and improving water retention which also increases the efficiency of greenery in reducing the heat islands and air pollutants that cause allergies and asthma in residents to allow it to be kept in the city in small retention bodies surrounded by greenery storm water must be cleaned for this purpose sequential sedimentation and biofiltration systems sssb zalewski et al 2012 jurczak et al 2018 were developed for urban areas fig 13 previous hydroengineering methods such as settlers and separators do not ensure sufficient water quality in urban rivers and reservoirs therefore one method used in the upper bzura to improve water quality and recreational potential was a hybrid solution integrating existing hydrotechnical solutions with sssb this approach used a system comprising two settlers and slat separators located in the water body itself to clean rainwater running off parking lots and roads it consisted of a sedimentation zone a gabion partition with geofibre and a vegetation zone its efficiency was found to be above 90 for suspensions and more than 60 for biogenic substances in addition the biological structure of the water body was shaped to provide greater resistance to eutrophication biomanipulation thanks to the above solutions the upper bzura and the reservoirs in arturówek have become an important element of an urban blue green network improving the quality of life of the inhabitants in the city lateral reservoirs for the enhancement of water retentiveness and wbsrce an important element of an ecohydrological solution is its potential harmonisation with the existing hydrological infrastructure one such example is the design of the constructed łask water reservoir in the grabia river basin fig 14 the concept for the reservoir was to integrate it into the landscape maximizing its wbsr ce potential the primary function of the planned reservoir is recreational as such one aim of the design is to maintain the natural character of the valuable natural river while guaranteeing good quality water in the reservoir this is achieved by designing a system that analyses the quality of water and then controls the supply to the reservoir accordingly using an automatic barrier thereby reducing the risk of toxic blooms and ensuring constant water flow in the river nature based solutions require the translation of a holistic understanding of processes and interactions between water and biota from molecular to catchment scale through the following aims 1 increase the complexity of agricultural landscape reduce soil erosion and freshwater ecosystem eutrophication reverse biodiversity decline increase the economic efficiency of agricultural practices 2 construct

such reservoirs demonstrate increased water retentiveness and higher water quantity and quality in the river valley w increase biodiversity b provide recreation for society s and enhance the resilience of the catchment to the climate change r ecohydrology for the development of a sustainability culture and education the essence of ecohydrology as a science integrating hydrology and ecology is that it uses scientific knowledge to increase the potential of catchment areas by regulating the interaction retention and purification of water thus improving the microclimate and reducing the transfer of nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural areas to aquatic ecosystems the potential to provide these benefits to society depends on the condition of the water and determines its natural capital such capital can be maintained reduced or enhanced by culture and education ce wantzen et al 2016 such maintenance requires supporting or increasing investments for example blue green infrastructure krauze wagner 2019 however such measures create competition for space and resources both between economic sectors and stakeholders social capital based on culture of sustainability and education ce is therefore an indispensable condition for building natural capital socio ecohydrology has developed as a response to this need with three objectives 1 education research is based on learning and the exchange of information and experience between stakeholders this leads to the identification and filling of gaps in knowledge regarding the environment and interactions between society and nature 2 participation citizen science based co creation live laboratories to disseminate knowledge about cause and effect relationships 3 building a compromise since it is not possible to fully meet all needs and expectations a social consensus on priority values and optimal solutions is necessary as well as agreement to incur sustainable development costs e g acceptance of payments

citizen science product produced by the amber adaptive management of barriers in european rivers https amber international project is the barrier tracker application which maps and classifies existing hydrotechnical barriers which modify the functioning of rivers as a continuum e g by blocking fish migration in rivers it is an it tool which in addition to its practical dimension aims to promote the problems associated with the fragmentation of european rivers among those interested in the ecological status of running water bodies the app is free available to anyone through phone app stores and is currently available in as many as 11 european national languages the user is guided through the process of locating and categorizing a given structure by a friendly interface using intuitive pictograms and simple definitions of individual issues the user can assign the construction to a category determine the approximate height of the migration barrier and its maintenance status and add a photograph of the observed structure the practical objective of the application is to collect additional data to verify the accuracy and timeliness of the databases held by individual european

science and water management solutions 1 a new evolutionary ecosystem paradigm that should inspire action by society especially for reducing diffuse forms of anthropopressure the evolutionary aspect entails the knowledge that each of us can have a positive or negative impact on the environment and the sum of these interactions determines our future the ecosystem approach means that the reference system for both strategic catchment and operational ecosystem habitat water bodies planning and innovation should comprise three processes describing the functioning of each ecosystem the circulation of water and matter and energy flow 2 understanding the interaction between water and biocenosis from molecular scale to landscape scale enables the use of ecosystem processes as a tool in water management this can be facilitated by regulating hydrological processes reduction of diffuse pollution by shaping the structure of biocenosis e g with the use of high efficiency ecotone and intra field buffer zones and by increasing biocenosis productivity by regulating the hydrological cycle to maintain soil moisture employing wetlands sequential sedimentation and biofiltration systems for water purification and increasing the retention of river systems in urban areas and other nbs 3 enhancing the potential of catchment areas biospheres through systemic solutions fig 15 such approaches

997,the construction of four large reservoirs for hydroelectric power generation in the main channel of the paraná river and many others in the tributaries has eliminated important wetlands except over an area of 2000 km2 between the reservoirs of the uhe engenheiro sérgio motta porto primavera and the itaipu the up river reservoirs created large changes in the river s hydrology and in its loads of suspended bed and dissolved material a detailed assessment of the impact of these changes requires a description and classification of the floodplain s different subunits called macrohabitats according to hydrological hydromorphological and vegetational parameters the classification system presented herein is hierarchical and is embedded in the classifications of brazilian wetlands the system differentiates the paraná river floodplain into 6 functional units 13 subclasses and 23 macrohabitats which are presented in this paper changes in hydrology have reduced the flood amplitude frequency and permanence and thus confined the macrohabitats to an area currently subjected to a regular flood pulse of 3 m rather than the previous 6 m the gradual terrestrialization of macrohabitats at the upper end of the flood gradient is expected accompanied by a loss of macrohabitats at its lower end because of long term flooding the retention of sediments and dissolved nutrients in the reservoirs will lead to the oligotrophication of aquatic macrohabitats the degradation of near channel hydromorphic structures and their vegetation and a general reduction of overall primary production in the floodplain which may extend also to higher trophic levels key words flood pulse oligotrophication dam impacts hydrophytes 1 introduction scientific studies of large and complex wetland ecosystems and their sustainable management benefit from a classification system based on subunits macrohabitats and the application of scientifically based parameters for their description the parameters used for classification should address the specific well defined characteristics of each macrohabitat distinguish between macrohabitats and allow the establishment of a databank containing all available information on them this approach has been applied to the classification of large amazonian lowland wetlands junk et al 2011 and brazilian wetlands junk et al 2014a however large and complex wetlands require a specific effort as has already been shown for the pantanal of mato grosso nunes da cunha junk 2011 2014 and the amazonian white water and black water river floodplains junk et al 2012 2015 the classification system used in those studies was hierarchic and based on hydrological and botanical characteristics as well as the chemistry of the water and soil its further use will enable studies on the interactions between their organisms and on the natural and anthropogenic changes in macrohabitat structure function and biodiversity as well as assessments of ecosystem goods and services the information can be compared with that from studies of similar macrohabitats within other floodplain ecosystems and the results interpreted in a trans regional context the classification of macrohabitats within the remaining paraná river floodplain is urgently needed because this is the last undammed stretch of this river in brazilian territory despite the importance of the floodplain for biodiversity conservation thomaz et al 2004a the large number of reservoirs constructed upstream 27 reservoirs with areas 100 km2 in the basin agostinho et al 2004 have dramatically changed both the hydrological regime stevaux et al 2009 of the river and its water quality these changes have had a strong impact on the river floodplain ecosystem and have affected their macrohabitats in different degrees while some changes were apparent immediately after reservoir construction such as at the porto primavera dam roberto et al 2009 many others occurred more slowly and can only be quantified based on comparison of data collected in following years thus a classification system was devised in cooperation with scientists of the state university of maringa nupélia as part of a large research program of the national institute of science and technology in wetlands inct inau that is also developing macrohabitat classification systems for the wetlands of the araguaia and guaporé rivers 2 genesis and ecological characterization of the paraná river floodplain between the mouths of the paranapanema and ivinheima rivers 2 1 geography geology and paleoclimatic history the brazilian part of the paraná river system extends over a distance of 590 km from the junction of the grande and paranaiba rivers near aparecida do taboado city to the frontier with paraguay at guaira city draining an area of 800 000 km2 formerly most stretches of the river were accompanied by an extended fringing floodplain however with the construction in the paraná s main channel of four reservoirs for hydroelectric power generation and in its basin of dozens of other large reservoirs the area has become permanently flooded except for an alluvial plain 230 km long and 20 km wide between the dam of uhe engenheiro sérgio motta porto primavera and the itaipu reservoir this remaining area floodplain and channel is under the protection of two federal and one state conservation authority part of the floodplain is shown in fig 1 the paraná river alluvial valley includes the fazenda boa vista terrace situated 10 12 m above the current mean water level stevaux 1994 fujita 2014 the hydrological changes that occurred in most brazilian river systems at the beginning of the holocene produced a vertical incision of the paraná channel with consequent terrace formation on the right bank and the gradual development of the current floodplain of the paraná river latrubesse et al 2005 the terrace surface is occupied by minor drainage systems that form swampy areas and small alluvial fans parolin stevaux 2006 identified a local eolic dune field that developed in the middle holocene the terrace wetlands are not discussed here further the active floodplain of the paraná river covers an area of 2 033 km2 and is situated mostly at the right margin of the river channel fluvial deposits vary from 7 to 12 m in the floodplain and from 12 to 20 m in the channel increasing in the downstream direction souza filho 1993 from the last glacial maximum until the beginning of the holocene the river developed a braided channel pattern typical of a dry climate stevaux 1994 during the holocene the climate became wet with the exception of a short period of less precipitation between 3 500 and 2 500 years ago stevaux 2000 the current anastomosed pattern emerged during the wet climate of the holocene souza filho 1993 1994 stevaux 1994 2000 stevaux et al 1993 2004 most features of the current floodplain such as levees ridges swales and blind channels are the products of the anastomosing period stevaux souza 2004 the soils that developed from the sediments of the floodplain are shallow barely permeable and clayey to very clayey stevaux et al 2006 2 2 climate and hydrology the paraná river floodplain is situated in the circumglobal belt of a tropical climate and thus subjected to high temperatures and a pronounced seasonality of precipitation the mean annual temperature reaches 22 c and the mean annual precipitation 1410 1690 mm fig 2 the fluvial discharge of the paraná river has been monitored by the porto são josé fluviometric station since 1963 table 1 according to the data from this station the mean annual discharge is 8 912 m³ sec 1 with values of 33 740 m³ sec 1 and 2 550 m³ sec 1 reached in 1983 and 1969 respectively orfeo stevaux 2002 modification of the river discharge began in 1972 with the construction of several dams rocha et al 1998 since late 1998 discharge has mostly been controlled by the porto primavera dam souza filho 2009 rocha 2002 referred to the interval between 1963 and 1971 as the natural regime period and the period after 1971 as the modified regime period within the latter the author further distinguished three other periods a transitional period 1972 1981 a period marked by the cascading effect of the newly constructed dams 1982 1998 and the current after1999 regulation of discharge by the porto primavera hydroelectric power plant changes in discharge are also related to pluriannual changes in the precipitation regime and to control via the reservoirs in the catchment area before the porto primavera dam became operative the greatest impact on the hydrologic regime with respect to flow was the magnitude of the minimum flows from may to november rocha 2002 2010a dam operation resulted in significant increases in the annual averages and in the number of short hydrological pulses rocha 2002 2010a the amplitude and duration of the floods are the ecologically most important attributes of the flood regime river water initially enters the floodplain at a level of 3 5 m and a discharge rate of 9 900 m3 sec 1 rocha 2002 intermediate areas of the plain start flooding at 6 0 m 16 356 m³ sec 1 and the highest areas at 7 0 m 19 335 m³ sec 1 during the natural hydrological regime from 1965 1981 when reservoirs had little influence on river flow the flood amplitude varied between about 0 5 m and 7 5 m but during the intermediate period from 1982 to 1998 it ranged between 1 5 m and 9 m rocha 2002 2010a however since the construction of the primavera dam completed in 1999 the amplitude has been much smaller 1 7 m as measured until 2015 with a high frequency of low flooding 2 m and very rare and brief periods of high flooding 5 m fig 3 since the dam entered operation rapid modifications in sub daily discharges have been documented agostinho et al 2008 water levels at the porto são josé station from 6 00 to 18 00 varied by 10 cm for 55 of the days and by 30 cm for 9 of the days the largest variation was 122 cm in 12 h 2 3 vegetation cover the paraná river floodplain is embedded in the semideciduous seasonal forest belt ibge 1992 situated between the savanna domain cerrado and the atlantic forest floristic elements from these areas characterize the floodplain vegetation which is under flood stress during high water periods and drought and fire stress during low water periods among the 1042 species of higher plants described from the floodplain souza et al 1997 2009 thomaz et al 2004b thomaz et al 2004c ferreira et al 2011 487 46 74 are herbaceous plants including 47 species of epiphytes 239 22 94 are woody plants 149 are scrubs 14 297 145 are lianas 13 92 6 0 57 are palms and 16 1 54 are without classification nonetheless the number of species has likely been underestimated given that the reported species richness has increased in more recent compared with older surveys all higher lying areas of the floodplain were formerly covered by forest but only small forest fragments and secondary forests remain due to extensive logging and deforestation for agriculture and cattle ranching during the 20th century low lying areas are covered by annual and perennial grasses and herbaceous plants during the low water level and by different types of aquatic macrophytes during floods aquatic macrohabitats are colonized by aquatic and semi aquatic macrophytes 3 objectives of the macrohabitat classification a major limitation in international wetland classifications is that they treat small wetlands of a few hectares in the same way as large wetlands of many thousand square kilometers with very complex interacting structures in wetland indicators tiner 1999 described floodplain wetlands as hydrologically problematic briefly considered floodplain forests and called for additional studies in the ramsar convention s typology of wetlands published by finlayson 2018 floodplains are not considered as a specific category because they are complex and include several wetland types however large floodplains represent landscape units which have to be treated holistically including considerations about political social cultural and ecological aspects of the entire wetland complex the dilemma can be resolved by subdividing the floodplains in well defined subunits called in this paper macrohabitats which can be treated individually without losing the connection with the entire system hydrology is the main driving force in floodplains it determines the vegetation cover which depends on length and depth of the floods the resilience of the different macrohabitats against wild fires and extreme climatic events depends on their position on the flooding gradient plant and animal species are not randomly distributed in the entire floodplain but are linked to specific macrohabitats efforts to maintain biodiversity have to consider macrohabitat diversity distribution and integrity human activities in river floodplains are increasing and threatening ecosystem services some macrohabitats are more sensitive than others against natural and man made disturbance and require specific protection measures for instance the reestablishment of forested macrohabitats requires decades or even centuries whereas herbaceous communities recover in few months or years the protection of permanent aquatic macrohabitats and the internal drainage system is essential for the survival of aquatic organisms in the paraná river floodplain macrohabitat classification allows the systematic long term analysis of the impact of reservoir construction on the distribution of different macrohabitats and their organisms in the protected areas it permits the description of the recovery of the vegetation in the areas modified by different land use methods in former times it also allows to quantify the impact of the reduction of nutrient inputs by the floods into the floodplain oligotrophication more information is provided in the following paragraphs 4 material and methods a representative part of the protected area of the parana river floodplain was visited during several field excursions by boat and car major hydromorphological features such as lakes channels mud flats sand bars swales and ridges were documented flood marks at the trees indicated the height of the last flood and allowed the calculation of the length and depth of the floods in the respective areas the periodic change from terrestrial to aquatic conditions was considered by introducing five hydrological categories called functional units they are defined as large landscape units in the floodplain characterized by specific hydrological conditions our classification system differentiates between permanently aquatic periodically aquatic periodically terrestrial permanently waterlogged palustric and permanently terrestrial conditions a sixth functional unit recognizes anthropogenic areas independent of their hydrological characteristics characteristic communities of higher plants were identified and dominant species were annotated the occurrence of the communities was related to the flood pattern because of their longevity and stationary behavior higher plants best represent the environmental conditions of the respective area herbaceous plants indicate conditions in months and years and trees in decades and centuries animals are not considered in this classification because of their mobility and insufficient data on their macrohabitat requirements well defined hydromorphological and vegetation units were denominated as macrohabitats macrohabitats are defined as landscape units in the respective wetlands subjected to similar hydrological conditions and covered by specific indicator plant species or groups of species or in their absence subjected to a similar terrestrial or aquatic environment junk et al 2015 the results of the field observations were complemented by long term observations of the co authors in the study area and by literature studies the classification system was adjusted to the already published macrohabitat classification systems of the pantanal of mato grosso nunes da cunha junk 2014 and the amazonian várzeas and igapós junk et al 2012 2014b 2015 to permit a direct comparison of the different floodplains 5 general characterization of the paraná river floodplain the structures functions and biodiversity of river floodplain systems are described by the flood pulse concept fpc junk et al 1989 junk 2005 junk wantzen 2004 which provides the conceptual basis for the study of these ecosystems the periodically flooded area is called the aquatic terrestrial transition zone attz a moving littoral connects and disconnects the floodplain and its embedded lakes with the main channel according to the shape of the flood curve junk et al 1981 floodplain macrohabitats are subjected to the flood pulse to different degrees depending on their position along the flooding gradient habitats at higher altitudes such as on levees are flooded every 2 3 years for a few weeks while with the same frequency those at lower altitudes briefly dry out junk et al 2018 some habitats are waterlogged during the entire year because of hydromorphologic peculiarities the flood magnitude frequency permanence and recurrence are important parameters allowing macrohabitat differentiation stevaux et al 2013 deeper lakes blind channels and river channels represent permanent aquatic habitats in the river floodplain system and the terraces bordering floodplain permanent terrestrial systems both are essential structures for the maintenance of biodiversity in the river floodplain as indicated by the definition of wetland delimitation junk et al 2014a the extent of a wetland can be determined by the border of the permanently flooded or waterlogged area or in the case of fluctuating water levels by the limit of the area influenced during the mean maximum flood the outer borders of wetlands are indicated by the absence of hydromorphic soils and or hydrophytes and or specific woody species adapted to grow in periodically or permanently flooded or waterlogged soils the definition of a wetland area should include if present internal permanently dry areas as these habitats are of fundamental importance to the maintenance of the functional integrity and biodiversity of the respective wetland in the paraná river floodplain the nutrient status of its macrohabitats depends on the quality of the sediments and on the amounts of dissolved and suspended solids from the periodic inflow of river water thomaz et al 1992 agostinho et al 2004 roberto et al 2009 both the duration of connectivity with the main river and habitat internal cycles modify the nutrient status unfortunately there are no data on the physical and chemical characteristics of the soils and water before reservoir construction which started in 1960 in the upper paraná basin however comparisons can be made before and after the construction of the porto primavera dam which created the largest reservoir in the paraná river and was the last dam constructed in the river channel before the construction of the reservoir 1986 1987 the mean total p concentration and the secchi disk depth in the paraná channel was 27 µgl 1 12 sd and 1 0 m 0 5 sd respectively roberto et al 2009 this situation changed dramatically after completion of the porto primavera dam including a decrease in the mean total p to 12 µgl 1 8 sd and an increase in the secchi disk depth to 3 0 m 1 2 sd from 2000 to 2008 roberto et al 2009 suspended sediment concentration from a mean of 24 mg l 1 in the late 1980s with a seasonal variation of 10 mg l 1 during the floods and 30 mg l 1 during the dry season stevaux 1994 to 0 74 mg l 1 in 2005 and 2006 hayakawa 2007 to a lesser degree the impoverishment of the low lying macrohabitats as a result of flooding with nutrient poor waters from reservoirs upstream on the paraná river had already been determined before the completion of the porto primavera reservoir agostinho et al 1995 after dam closes flooding now lixiviates nutrients from many macrohabitats and erodes the fine fraction of elevated areas leaving sand behind furthermore deepening of the river channel by depth erosion indicated by a modification between the river level and the outflow souza filho 2009 has accelerated the erosion of levees and islands and decreased the flood period of many macrohabitats minor differences have been determined in the water chemistry of macrohabitats at the edges of the floodplain where water and sediments from tributaries alter the characteristic chemical attributes of the soils and water of the paraná river floodplain for example the floodplain lakes connected with the still un dammed ivinheima river receive larger nutrient and solid loads than do the lakes and backwaters directly influenced by the paraná river thomaz et al 1992 roberto et al 2009 6 the macrohabitat classification of the active paraná river floodplain based on the definition of wetland delimitation junk et al 2014a permanent terrestrial macrohabitats inside and at the edges are included this aspect is of specific importance because of the reservoir induced hydrological changes in the paraná river addressed in the discussion a synthesis of the classification system of the macrohabitats of the paraná river floodplain is given in table 2 the classification is based on ecological parameters and is meant to complement rather than replace other classification systems 7 general description of functional units and macrohabitats 7 1 permanently aquatic areas functional unit 1 7 1 1 river channels subclass 1 1 for hydrologists the main function of river channels is the transport of water and dissolved and solid substances for biologists river channels are habitats passive dispersal routes and migration pathways for plants and animals the paraná river macrohabitat 1 1 1 transports sandy bed load in bedforms of different size and morphology ripples mega ripples dunes and sand waves at an entrainment velocity of 10 m month 1 stevaux et al 2009 sand waves active during the great floods can generate sand bars features very common in the paraná channel sand bars can vary from tens to hundreds of meters in size and remain in the channel for periods between 100 to 102 years stevaux and latrubesse 2017 formerly the turbid river channels of the paraná river were colonized only by phytoplankton and were free of aquatic macrophytes however since the increase in transparency that followed reservoir construction especially porto primavera submersed aquatic macrophytes have been increasingly detected the number of native submersed species colonizing the paraná channel increased after the 1990s thomaz et al 2009 but the greatest cause of concern was the arrival of hydrilla verticillata hydrocharitaceae a submersed highly invasive species native to asia but first recorded in the floodplain in 2005 sousa 2011 upstream reservoirs may have served as the source of propagules of this and other macrophyte species and together with the greater water transparency caused by the reservoirs facilitated colonization of the river s main channel and of secondary channels by this invasive plant sousa et al 2010 along the banks slack waters containing woody debris support greater bioproductivity at some places floating belts of aquatic macrophytes provide for short periods food and or habitats for the aquatic fauna macrohabitat 1 1 2 7 1 2 floodplain lakes subclass 1 2 the active floodplain contains hundreds of permanent lakes formed either by ancient anastomosed or by recent braided processes the overflow lakes formed by anastomosed processes include paleochannels lakes lateral expansion lakes and annexed lakes macrohabitat 1 2 1 and those by braided processes of inter bar ponds and obstruction ponds souza filho stevaux 2004 kramer 2004 macrohabitat 1 2 2 paleochannel lakes are the most frequent in the floodplain they are elongated may extend for several kilometers have a width up to 400 m and a depth during low waters of 3 4 m although during extreme drought periods some of these lakes become much shallower and others almost completely dry out their borders are defined by natural levees and their edges are low and poorly defined lateral expansion lakes may be as long as 700 m and as wide as 300 m annexed lakes are complex sets of lakes formed by the merging of several ponds their length can reach 2 km and their width 1 km their depth varies depending on the type of attached pond inter bar and obstruction ponds locally are known as ressacos their length can reach 1 5 km but their width does not exceed 50 m and their depth is less than that of other types of ponds during the day a thermal stratification develops in which surface water temperatures may be as high as 32 c leading to a more stable stratification during the high waters in summer thomaz et al 2004d the large amounts of organic material and high decomposition rates that occur in summer lead to hypoxic conditions in the hypolimnion thomaz et al 1992 2004d benthic abundance in lakes responds negatively to the increased water level takeda grzybkowska 1997 including decreases in the richness and density of chironomids higuti 2004 as a possible response to the steep decrease in oxygen levels these tendencies are accompanied by a dilution of phytoplankton as indicated by the low chlorophyll concentrations measured during high waters thomaz et al 2004d in permanent lakes with steep shores dense floating islands can develop because permanent water logging retards decomposition of the organic layer several fish species especially juveniles of long distance migratory species prochilodus lineatus pseudoplatystomas corruscans may search these habitats during retraction of the water level after completing their initial development in very shallow and recently flooded areas agostinho et al 2007a the level of connectivity determines the exchange of water dissolved and solid substances and biota between the river and adjacent lakes small channels kept open by the large amount of inflowing and outflowing water maintain the connection between the river and large lakes whereas small lakes may be isolated for several months and are connected to the river only when the water level is high studies in temperate and tropical floodplains including the upper paraná river floodplain have shown that with decreasing connectivity lakes tend to establish their own specific nutrient cycles furch and junk 1997 and to maintain a specific aquatic flora and fauna neiff 1979

inside the attz subclass 2 1 within the floodplain water is distributed by minor channels that connect the main river channels with floodplain lakes macrohabitat 2 1 1 water flux in these channels can change direction such that with a rising water level water is transported from the main channels into the floodplain and with a falling water level from the floodplain to the major river channels 7 2 2 areas periodically covered by standing water subclass 2 2 when the river inundates the floodplain formerly dry areas become covered with water these areas can be free of macrophytes macrohabitat 3 2

sparse vegetation subclass 3 1 during the terrestrial phase vegetation free habitats in the attz include sand bars macrohabitat 3 1 1 and steep shores barrancos macrohabitat 3 1 2 sand bars are used as resting places by birds and aquatic mammals steep river banks are for nest building by king fishers during the terrestrial phase and by freshwater crabs and armored catfish during the aquatic phase 7 3 2 areas covered by herbaceous plants subclass 3 2 large parts of the attz including the shores of river channels and lakes are colonized by aquatic and palustric grasses sedges and herbaceous plants a recent compilation using records gathered since 1997 and intensive data collection between 2007 and 2009 ferreira et al 2011 lists 155 species of aquatic macrophytes belonging to 100 genera and 37 families in the main habitats of the upper paraná river and its floodplain families with the highest number of species are poaceae 21 cyperaceae 17 pontederiaceae and onagraceae 8 hydrocharitaceae 7 polygonaceae 6 and fabaceae 5 the importance of the paraná floodplain as a hotspot for aquatic macrophyte species is also evident based on comparisons with already dammed stretches of the river in a survey carried out at 18 reservoirs of the paraná river and several of its main tributaries martins et al 2008 found only 39 species of aquatic macrophytes the most common species are aeschynomene spp commelina nudiflora cyperus giganteus eichhornia crassipes e azurea hibiscus cisplatinus hymenachne pernambucensis ludwigia spp passiflora misera polygonum acuminatum p ferrugineum p stelligerum pontederia cordata securidaca rivinaefolia solanum glaucophyllum and salvinia spp colonization on sandy beaches begins with cenchrus echinatus eragostis bahiensis urochloa mutica and among others the plants develop from the seed bank in the sediment and or from seeds transported by the water these areas are heavily disturbed by the river during floods macrohabitat 3 2 1 stable low lying areas in the floodplain that are exposed to dry conditions for a few weeks only are colonized by annual terrestrial species with short life cycles including axonopus sp cynodon dactylon and panicum dichotomiflorum on clay soils and the perennial grasses coleataenia prionitis and panicum tricholaenoides on sandy clay soils macrohabitat 3 2 2 on higher lying areas where the forest has been removed exotic grasses such as megathyrsus maximus urochloa brizantha u humidicola u mutica and u plantaginea have been planted to improve the quality of pasture however there are also a large number of native herbaceous species such as paspalum notatum and panicum spp and the shrubs andropogon bicornis cenchrus purpureus and mimosa pigra which require frequent disturbance by cattle and floods ruderal plants and agricultural weeds such as digitaria ciliaris d violascens and eleusine indica also colonize disturbed moist upland areas and are present in abundance macrohabitat 3 2 3 7 3 3 areas covered predominantly by shrubs and trees subclass 3 3 in a review of the literature on the forests of paraná state campos 2004 described forest formation in the paraná river floodplain as representative of semideciduous seasonal alluvial forest the large spatial variability and variations in the physical environment were shown to result in a small scale floristic heterogeneity the three forest types identified in that study were 1 forests situated on highly hydromorphic soils frequent species are calophyllum brasiliense cecropia pachystachya cedrela fissilis celtis iguanaea

americana unonopsis guatterioides and zygia cataractae among others in floodplain environments increasing flood stress from the highest levees to low lying areas leads to a distribution of woody species according to their flood tolerance and to the formation of different forest communities wittmann et al 2010 disturbance by the floods also results in the frequent natural set back of the forest communities furthermore cattle ranching and timber harvesting since the last century have led to a fragmentation of the forest cover in the paraná river floodplain and to a modified species composition of natural forest communities since many early successional species such as cecropia pachystachya croton urucurana inga vera and zygia cataractae have a large ecological plasticity and occur along the entire flood gradient our classification of natural forested communities is somewhat speculative forest succession in sedimentation areas near the river channel begins with croton urucurana inga vera and cecropia pachystachya which invade the herbaceous communities at sandy beaches these species tolerate long term flooding and high sedimentation rates macrohabitat 3 3 1 later a low lying floodplain forest becomes established on periodically drying ground that tolerates flooding of several months characteristic species are cecropia pachystachya inga marginata inga vera nectandra angustifolia sapindus saponaria triplaris americana vitex montevidensis and zygia cataractae campos souza 1997 eletrosul 1986 previdello et al 1996 romagnolo 2003 medium flood periods allow colonization by albizia niopoides eugenia egensis eugenia florida guarea macrophylla piper tuberculatum and unonopsis guatterioides macrohabitat 3 3 2 levees flooded for short periods only host a high lying floodplain forest with cecropia pachystachya cordia americana ficus obtusiuscula genipa americana hymenaea courbaril ocotea diospyrifolia ormosia arborea protium heptaphyllum sloanea guianensis and vitex megapotamica among others macrohabitat 3 3 3 7 4 swampy areas permanently flooded or waterlogged functional unit 4 large areas of the paraná river floodplain are permanently waterlogged or shallowly flooded most of them are covered by a similar mixture of annual and perennial herbaceous plants as described above macrohabitat 4 1 1 some areas are dominated by a single species cyperus giganteus macrohabitat 4 1 2 in these habitats and on the shores of the semi lentic baía river the increasing dominance of the african grass urochloa arrecta should be noted because this highly invasive plant adversely impacts aquatic biodiversity e g fernandes et al 2013 on the shores of permanent lakes under permanently wet conditions dead organic material can accumulate between the free floating plants thus giving rise to floating islands whose development accompanies the rise and fall of the water level with the increasing density of the organic layer founder species move to the border of the island and in the center are substituted by swamp species such as cyperus blepharoleptos justicia laevilinguis and by other palustric species macrohabitat 4 1 3 on slightly higher lying but still long term waterlogged and flooded soils an open swamp forest is established that consists of bactris glaucescens cephalanthus glabratus erythrina crista galli erytroxylum anguifugum mouriri guianensis psidium striatulum and interspersed with palustric perennial herbaceous plants 7 5 permanently terrestrial areas functional unit 5 the active floodplain connects to the fluvial terraces which may be as high as 10 m above the highest flood level and are covered by semi deciduous seasonal forest that lacks wetland attributes characteristic species are acrocomia aculeta anadenathera colubrina cariniana estrellensis cereus hildmannianus gallesia integrifolia ruprechtia laxifolia and others these areas are important for the floodplain because they enable intensive active and passive exchanges of plant and animal species for instance upland birds and at low water some terrestrial mammals migrate into the floodplain to make use of the abundant food resources macrohabitat 5 1 1 the interactions of these areas with the floodplain remain to be studied in detail 7 6 anthropogenic areas functional unit 6 anthropogenic areas consist of managed and not managed areas subclasses 6 1 and 6 2 managed areas mostly consist of small properties on islands where small houses have been built for use as family dwellings or for sporadic sport fishing the cultivation of crops such as maize and cassava is limited to local consumption cattle ranching used to play a major role in the floodplain and changed the vegetation cover considerably either by deforestation aimed at increasing pasture area or by grazing soil compaction and the disturbance of small water bodies agostinho et al 2004 exclosure experiments carried out on one such island showed that protection from grazing led to a significant increase in plant height biomass and species richness in only 4 months milne et al 2008 cattle raising on the islands decreased after the creation in the 1990s of conservation units in the area which allowed a rapid regeneration of the islands forests campos dickinson 2005 however cattle raising continues in several areas within the attz macrohabitat 6 1 1 attempts to transform the attz into large paddy fields ceased following the large floods that occurred in association with strong enso events roads that cross the floodplain macrohabitat 6 1 2 are important for the dispersion of ruderal plants but their impact has not yet been studied not managed anthropogenic areas consist of abandoned agricultural fields and cattle ranches these have since been invaded by native and introduced grasses sedges herbaceous species shrubs and trees the resulting communities are heterogeneous and still in a dynamic transition phase macrohabitat 6 2 1 8 discussion most wetland classifications take into account a combination of physical habitat characteristics such as hydrology climatology geomorphology soil and water chemistry and the composition of plant assemblages however as they are non hierarchic comparisons between different classification systems are difficult finlayson van der valk 1995 pointed out the need to resolve differences among existing systems with respect to the definition of a wetland and the characterization of wetland types they also called for the standardization of data collection storage and dissemination techniques as a strategy to generate more extensive international inventories the ramsar s scientific and technical review panel likewise called for the development and testing of a hydro geomorphically based system of wetland classification davidson and finlayson 2007 in brazil there are already classification systems for different wetland vegetation types studies on wetlands along streams and rivers in the savanna belt cerrado have been conducted by veloso et al 1991 ibge 1992 and ribeiro walter 1998 wantzen et al 2005 provided a classification of aquatic habitats of the pantanal of mato grosso in 2014a junk et al proposed a hierarchic classification of brazilian wetlands that was later also adopted for the classification of colombian wetlands ricaurtre et al 2019 it differentiates at the system level among coastal inland and artificial wetlands at higher rankings consisting of subsystems orders suborders and classes it considers hydrological parameters especially the stability of the water level and the predictability frequency and height of the flood pulse as the major drivers of ecological processes only at lower rankings functional units subclasses macrohabitats are hydrochemical and vegetation parameters used for differentiation purposes large ecologically politically and socially important wetlands such as the pantanal the amazonian várzeas and igapós and the araguaia guapore and paraná river floodplains are established at the class level macrohabitat classifications of large brazilian floodplains were presented for the pantanal of mato grosso nunes da cunha junk 2011 2014 and for the amazonian white and blackwater river floodplains várzeas and igapós junk et al 2012 2015 studies on the araguaia and guaporé river floodplains are ongoing the classification system of the macrohabitats of the upper paraná river system follows the same approach and will allow comparative studies in addition to facilitating wetland management and protection among the system s aims are to address the following 1 the lack of fixed boundaries between many macrohabitats 2 the changes in macrohabitat conditions in the attz throughout the year due to the flood pulse 3 the large scale changes in macrohabitat conditions and the related changes in vegetation cover due to multi annual changes in regional climate and 4 the need for quantification of the human impact not only on specific wetland macrohabitats but also on the entire river floodplain system as stated earlier the paraná river channel and its floodplain are currently undergoing dramatic alterations in addition to local impacts caused by cattle raising the many large reservoirs have profoundly modified the hydrography as well as the physical and chemical conditions of the river agostinho et al 2004 the flood curve has been smoothed and the load of dissolved and suspended material reduced after completion of the porto primavera reservoir water transparency increased substantially and the concentrations of dissolved nutrients decreased as shown by a one third reduction in the phosphorous concentration roberto et al 2009 the consequences of these changes are already visible in the river s aquatic macrohabitats and include alterations in the species composition of aquatic organisms for example the increase in water transparency measured by the secchi disk has promoted the invasion of the submerged macrophyte h verticillata which now forms dense stands along the shore of the paraná river and in its lateral canals thomaz et al 2009 the greater water transparency has also allowed the successful invasion of visually oriented predators such as the amazonian peacock bass cichla ocellaris agostinho et al 2007b espinola et al 2015 changes in the floodplain following dam construction have also occurred albeit more slowly and less conspicuously consequently they have not been noticed by the public who in addition interpret the very transparent clean water typical of the post dam phase as a positive development however these changes are of fundamental long term importance for the entire river floodplain system thus due to the modified hydrodynamics the area available for floodplain vegetation is restricted to a range of 2 5 m instead of the previous 1 7 m providing little space for the development of different plant communities the absence of lower discharges has resulted in an increase in humid areas in the floodplain throughout the year prohibiting the isolation of water bodies during dry periods the absence of high flood levels leads to fewer inundated areas in turn decreasing the connectivity of water bodies across the floodplain investigations in other river floodplain systems have clearly shown that flow regulation causes large transformations in the vegetation e g mumba thompson 2005 catford et al 2014 currently areas below 2 m are rarely exposed to dry conditions but prior to the dam they were probably covered by annual and perennial grasses and by herbaceous plants woody vegetation was likely absent because there are no records of tree mortality nor are there remnants of dead trees at the lower end of the flood gradient areas above 5 m at the upper end are now flooded only during exceptionally high floods and only for short periods which has favored the immigration of poorly flood tolerant native and exotic terrestrial trees scrubs and herbaceous plants from the upland this aspect is considered in the classification system by the inclusion of permanent terrestrial macrohabitats with the dramatic decrease in sedimentation rates islands will no longer form and the formation of low lying pioneer communities of herbaceous and woody plants will be accordingly inhibited in the future only low lying perennial herbaceous swamp vegetation low lying swamp forests and forests and high lying forests may remain reflecting an impoverishment of major vegetation types and habitats macrohabitats on the banks of the islands or on the lateral banks of the river s main channel rocha 2010b are vulnerable to erosion due to the increased erosive depositional trend of the river instead of carrying sediments and nutrients to the floodplain the river now erodes fine particles and leaches nutrients thus affecting the physical and chemical properties of the soil a slow degradation of the floodplain structures near the river channel is therefore likely with erosion processes at mud banks and levees as the most obvious ones the transformation of mud banks to sandbanks is already evident for example bank erosion increased by 230 after the completion of the porto primavera dam this was the result of piping a type of internal erosion enhanced by water infiltration by the sub daily discharge variation caused by dam operation stevaux et al 2009 the deleterious impact of reservoir construction on fish stocks and inland fishery is the product of many factors including the interruption of longitudinal connectivity which hinders fish migrations agostinho et al 2008 and fish recruitment in addition the decline in fishery yields can be attributed to changes in parameters related to flood hydrology including the timing amplitude duration and frequency of flooding oliveira et al 2018 oliveira et al 2020 to a reduction in nursery areas for juvenile fish and to the reduced carrying capacity caused by the loss of nutrients retention agostinho et al 2008 reductions in the primary and secondary productivity of the river floodplain can be expected to follow from the very large reductions in p concentrations a reduction of phytoplankton productivity of the river may already be underway for example long term data show a clear reduction in the algal biovolume an indication of primary productivity after construction of the porto primavera dam rodrigues et al 2009 this suggests oligotrophication across the whole floodplain as the water of the paraná river dilutes floodplain lake water during high water periods thomaz et al 2004d roberto et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2009 this process of oligotrophication will probably affect other primary producers with potential consequences for higher trophic levels over the long term the natural vegetation of large parts of the floodplain has been modified by humans for at least a century but because the area is now protected and human activities mainly cattle ranching are decreasing it may recover campos dickinson 2005 at the same time the vegetation will adapt to the new hydrological and nutrient conditions measurement of the decrease in primary production of grasses and herbaceous plants is a time consuming task and requires long time series to exclude the impact of other environmental factors such as drought stress excess water grazing and fire we recommend studies of the wood increment of floodplain trees by tree ring analysis as a long term indicator of the impact of the altered flood pulse and changes in nutrient availability the macrohabitat classification described herein will allow modifications to be related to specific macrohabitats the paraná river is the first large tropical floodplain river in which large scale changes in hydrology and the physicochemical conditions following reservoir construction have been studied for a relatively long period of time 35 years this long term experience makes the river floodplain system of the upper paraná a model that can be applied to other similar ecosystems there are plans for the construction of many other reservoirs on large rivers in brazil and in other tropical countries winemiller et al 2016 thus these rivers and their floodplains can be expected to meet a fate similar to that of the paraná river studies on the macrohabitats of the paraná river floodplain will provide data for realistic cost benefit calculations of the conversion of an intact river floodplain system to a system modified by reservoirs this may lead to a decision to terminate reservoir construction in rivers with very large and productive floodplains such as the mekong river where large human populations in the lower course and along the delta depend on the productivity of an intact

997,the construction of four large reservoirs for hydroelectric power generation in the main channel of the paraná river and many others in the tributaries has eliminated important wetlands except over an area of 2000 km2 between the reservoirs of the uhe engenheiro sérgio motta porto primavera and the itaipu the up river reservoirs created large changes in the river s hydrology and in its loads of suspended bed and dissolved material a detailed assessment of the impact of these changes requires a description and classification of the floodplain s different subunits called macrohabitats according to hydrological hydromorphological and vegetational parameters the classification system presented herein is hierarchical and is embedded in the classifications of brazilian wetlands the system differentiates the paraná river floodplain into 6 functional units 13 subclasses and 23 macrohabitats which are presented in this paper changes in hydrology have reduced the flood amplitude frequency and permanence and thus confined the macrohabitats to an area currently subjected to a regular flood pulse of 3 m rather than the previous 6 m the gradual terrestrialization of macrohabitats at the upper end of the flood gradient is expected accompanied by a loss of macrohabitats at its lower end because of long term flooding the retention of sediments and dissolved nutrients in the reservoirs will lead to the oligotrophication of aquatic macrohabitats the degradation of near channel hydromorphic structures and their vegetation and a general reduction of overall primary production in the floodplain which may extend also to higher trophic levels key words flood pulse oligotrophication dam impacts hydrophytes 1 introduction scientific studies of large and complex wetland ecosystems and their sustainable management benefit from a classification system based on subunits macrohabitats and the application of scientifically based parameters for their description the parameters used for classification should address the specific well defined characteristics of each macrohabitat distinguish between macrohabitats and allow the establishment of a databank containing all available information on them this approach has been applied to the classification of large amazonian lowland wetlands junk et al 2011 and brazilian wetlands junk et al 2014a however large and complex wetlands require a specific effort as has already been shown for the pantanal of mato grosso nunes da cunha junk 2011 2014 and the amazonian white water and black water river floodplains junk et al 2012 2015 the classification system used in those studies was hierarchic and based on hydrological and botanical characteristics as well as the chemistry of the water and soil its further use will enable studies on the interactions between their organisms and on the natural and anthropogenic changes in macrohabitat structure function and biodiversity as well as assessments of ecosystem goods and services the information can be compared with that from studies of similar macrohabitats within other floodplain ecosystems and the results interpreted in a trans regional context the classification of macrohabitats within the remaining paraná river floodplain is urgently needed because this is the last undammed stretch of this river in brazilian territory despite the importance of the floodplain for biodiversity conservation thomaz et al 2004a the large number of reservoirs constructed upstream 27 reservoirs with areas 100 km2 in the basin agostinho et al 2004 have dramatically changed both the hydrological regime stevaux et al 2009 of the river and its water quality these changes have had a strong impact on the river floodplain ecosystem and have affected their macrohabitats in different degrees while some changes were apparent immediately after reservoir construction such as at the porto primavera dam roberto et al 2009 many others occurred more slowly and can only be quantified based on comparison of data collected in following years thus a classification system was devised in cooperation with scientists of the state university of maringa nupélia as part of a large research program of the national institute of science and technology in wetlands inct inau that is also developing macrohabitat classification systems for the wetlands of the araguaia and guaporé rivers 2 genesis and ecological characterization of the paraná river floodplain between the mouths of the paranapanema and ivinheima rivers 2 1 geography geology and paleoclimatic history the brazilian part of the paraná river system extends over a distance of 590 km from the junction of the grande and paranaiba rivers near aparecida do taboado city to the frontier with paraguay at guaira city draining an area of 800 000 km2 formerly most stretches of the river were accompanied by an extended fringing floodplain however with the construction in the paraná s main channel of four reservoirs for hydroelectric power generation and in its basin of dozens of other large reservoirs the area has become permanently flooded except for an alluvial plain 230 km long and 20 km wide between the dam of uhe engenheiro sérgio motta porto primavera and the itaipu reservoir this remaining area floodplain and channel is under the protection of two federal and one state conservation authority part of the floodplain is shown in fig 1 the paraná river alluvial valley includes the fazenda boa vista terrace situated 10 12 m above the current mean water level stevaux 1994 fujita 2014 the hydrological changes that occurred in most brazilian river systems at the beginning of the holocene produced a vertical incision of the paraná channel with consequent terrace formation on the right bank and the gradual development of the current floodplain of the paraná river latrubesse et al 2005 the terrace surface is occupied by minor drainage systems that form swampy areas and small alluvial fans parolin stevaux 2006 identified a local eolic dune field that developed in the middle holocene the terrace wetlands are not discussed here further the active floodplain of the paraná river covers an area of 2 033 km2 and is situated mostly at the right margin of the river channel fluvial deposits vary from 7 to 12 m in the floodplain and from 12 to 20 m in the channel increasing in the downstream direction souza filho 1993 from the last glacial maximum until the beginning of the holocene the river developed a braided channel pattern typical of a dry climate stevaux 1994 during the holocene the climate became wet with the exception of a short period of less precipitation between 3 500 and 2 500 years ago stevaux 2000 the current anastomosed pattern emerged during the wet climate of the holocene souza filho 1993 1994 stevaux 1994 2000 stevaux et al 1993 2004 most features of the current floodplain such as levees ridges swales and blind channels are the products of the anastomosing period stevaux souza 2004 the soils that developed from the sediments of the floodplain are shallow barely permeable and clayey to very clayey stevaux et al 2006 2 2 climate and hydrology the paraná river floodplain is situated in the circumglobal belt of a tropical climate and thus subjected to high temperatures and a pronounced seasonality of precipitation the mean annual temperature reaches 22 c and the mean annual precipitation 1410 1690 mm fig 2 the fluvial discharge of the paraná river has been monitored by the porto são josé fluviometric station since 1963 table 1 according to the data from this station the mean annual discharge is 8 912 m³ sec 1 with values of 33 740 m³ sec 1 and 2 550 m³ sec 1 reached in 1983 and 1969 respectively orfeo stevaux 2002 modification of the river discharge began in 1972 with the construction of several dams rocha et al 1998 since late 1998 discharge has mostly been controlled by the porto primavera dam souza filho 2009 rocha 2002 referred to the interval between 1963 and 1971 as the natural regime period and the period after 1971 as the modified regime period within the latter the author further distinguished three other periods a transitional period 1972 1981 a period marked by the cascading effect of the newly constructed dams 1982 1998 and the current after1999 regulation of discharge by the porto primavera hydroelectric power plant changes in discharge are also related to pluriannual changes in the precipitation regime and to control via the reservoirs in the catchment area before the porto primavera dam became operative the greatest impact on the hydrologic regime with respect to flow was the magnitude of the minimum flows from may to november rocha 2002 2010a dam operation resulted in significant increases in the annual averages and in the number of short hydrological pulses rocha 2002 2010a the amplitude and duration of the floods are the ecologically most important attributes of the flood regime river water initially enters the floodplain at a level of 3 5 m and a discharge rate of 9 900 m3 sec 1 rocha 2002 intermediate areas of the plain start flooding at 6 0 m 16 356 m³ sec 1 and the highest areas at 7 0 m 19 335 m³ sec 1 during the natural hydrological regime from 1965 1981 when reservoirs had little influence on river flow the flood amplitude varied between about 0 5 m and 7 5 m but during the intermediate period from 1982 to 1998 it ranged between 1 5 m and 9 m rocha 2002 2010a however since the construction of the primavera dam completed in 1999 the amplitude has been much smaller 1 7 m as measured until 2015 with a high frequency of low flooding 2 m and very rare and brief periods of high flooding 5 m fig 3 since the dam entered operation rapid modifications in sub daily discharges have been documented agostinho et al 2008 water levels at the porto são josé station from 6 00 to 18 00 varied by 10 cm for 55 of the days and by 30 cm for 9 of the days the largest variation was 122 cm in 12 h 2 3 vegetation cover the paraná river floodplain is embedded in the semideciduous seasonal forest belt ibge 1992 situated between the savanna domain cerrado and the atlantic forest floristic elements from these areas characterize the floodplain vegetation which is under flood stress during high water periods and drought and fire stress during low water periods among the 1042 species of higher plants described from the floodplain souza et al 1997 2009 thomaz et al 2004b thomaz et al 2004c ferreira et al 2011 487 46 74 are herbaceous plants including 47 species of epiphytes 239 22 94 are woody plants 149 are scrubs 14 297 145 are lianas 13 92 6 0 57 are palms and 16 1 54 are without classification nonetheless the number of species has likely been underestimated given that the reported species richness has increased in more recent compared with older surveys all higher lying areas of the floodplain were formerly covered by forest but only small forest fragments and secondary forests remain due to extensive logging and deforestation for agriculture and cattle ranching during the 20th century low lying areas are covered by annual and perennial grasses and herbaceous plants during the low water level and by different types of aquatic macrophytes during floods aquatic macrohabitats are colonized by aquatic and semi aquatic macrophytes 3 objectives of the macrohabitat classification a major limitation in international wetland classifications is that they treat small wetlands of a few hectares in the same way as large wetlands of many thousand square kilometers with very complex interacting structures in wetland indicators tiner 1999 described floodplain wetlands as hydrologically problematic briefly considered floodplain forests and called for additional studies in the ramsar convention s typology of wetlands published by finlayson 2018 floodplains are not considered as a specific category because they are complex and include several wetland types however large floodplains represent landscape units which have to be treated holistically including considerations about political social cultural and ecological aspects of the entire wetland complex the dilemma can be resolved by subdividing the floodplains in well defined subunits called in this paper macrohabitats which can be treated individually without losing the connection with the entire system hydrology is the main driving force in floodplains it determines the vegetation cover which depends on length and depth of the floods the resilience of the different macrohabitats against wild fires and extreme climatic events depends on their position on the flooding gradient plant and animal species are not randomly distributed in the entire floodplain but are linked to specific macrohabitats efforts to maintain biodiversity have to consider macrohabitat diversity distribution and integrity human activities in river floodplains are increasing and threatening ecosystem services some macrohabitats are more sensitive than others against natural and man made disturbance and require specific protection measures for instance the reestablishment of forested macrohabitats requires decades or even centuries whereas herbaceous communities recover in few months or years the protection of permanent aquatic macrohabitats and the internal drainage system is essential for the survival of aquatic organisms in the paraná river floodplain macrohabitat classification allows the systematic long term analysis of the impact of reservoir construction on the distribution of different macrohabitats and their organisms in the protected areas it permits the description of the recovery of the vegetation in the areas modified by different land use methods in former times it also allows to quantify the impact of the reduction of nutrient inputs by the floods into the floodplain oligotrophication more information is provided in the following paragraphs 4 material and methods a representative part of the protected area of the parana river floodplain was visited during several field excursions by boat and car major hydromorphological features such as lakes channels mud flats sand bars swales and ridges were documented flood marks at the trees indicated the height of the last flood and allowed the calculation of the length and depth of the floods in the respective areas the periodic change from terrestrial to aquatic conditions was considered by introducing five hydrological categories called functional units they are defined as large landscape units in the floodplain characterized by specific hydrological conditions our classification system differentiates between permanently aquatic periodically aquatic periodically terrestrial permanently waterlogged palustric and permanently terrestrial conditions a sixth functional unit recognizes anthropogenic areas independent of their hydrological characteristics characteristic communities of higher plants were identified and dominant species were annotated the occurrence of the communities was related to the flood pattern because of their longevity and stationary behavior higher plants best represent the environmental conditions of the respective area herbaceous plants indicate conditions in months and years and trees in decades and centuries animals are not considered in this classification because of their mobility and insufficient data on their macrohabitat requirements well defined hydromorphological and vegetation units were denominated as macrohabitats macrohabitats are defined as landscape units in the respective wetlands subjected to similar hydrological conditions and covered by specific indicator plant species or groups of species or in their absence subjected to a similar terrestrial or aquatic environment junk et al 2015 the results of the field observations were complemented by long term observations of the co authors in the study area and by literature studies the classification system was adjusted to the already published macrohabitat classification systems of the pantanal of mato grosso nunes da cunha junk 2014 and the amazonian várzeas and igapós junk et al 2012 2014b 2015 to permit a direct comparison of the different floodplains 5 general characterization of the paraná river floodplain the structures functions and biodiversity of river floodplain systems are described by the flood pulse concept fpc junk et al 1989 junk 2005 junk wantzen 2004 which provides the conceptual basis for the study of these ecosystems the periodically flooded area is called the aquatic terrestrial transition zone attz a moving littoral connects and disconnects the floodplain and its embedded lakes with the main channel according to the shape of the flood curve junk et al 1981 floodplain macrohabitats are subjected to the flood pulse to different degrees depending on their position along the flooding gradient habitats at higher altitudes such as on levees are flooded every 2 3 years for a few weeks while with the same frequency those at lower altitudes briefly dry out junk et al 2018 some habitats are waterlogged during the entire year because of hydromorphologic peculiarities the flood magnitude frequency permanence and recurrence are important parameters allowing macrohabitat differentiation stevaux et al 2013 deeper lakes blind channels and river channels represent permanent aquatic habitats in the river floodplain system and the terraces bordering floodplain permanent terrestrial systems both are essential structures for the maintenance of biodiversity in the river floodplain as indicated by the definition of wetland delimitation junk et al 2014a the extent of a wetland can be determined by the border of the permanently flooded or waterlogged area or in the case of fluctuating water levels by the limit of the area influenced during the mean maximum flood the outer borders of wetlands are indicated by the absence of hydromorphic soils and or hydrophytes and or specific woody species adapted to grow in periodically or permanently flooded or waterlogged soils the definition of a wetland area should include if present internal permanently dry areas as these habitats are of fundamental importance to the maintenance of the functional integrity and biodiversity of the respective wetland in the paraná river floodplain the nutrient status of its macrohabitats depends on the quality of the sediments and on the amounts of dissolved and suspended solids from the periodic inflow of river water thomaz et al 1992 agostinho et al 2004 roberto et al 2009 both the duration of connectivity with the main river and habitat internal cycles modify the nutrient status unfortunately there are no data on the physical and chemical characteristics of the soils and water before reservoir construction which started in 1960 in the upper paraná basin however comparisons can be made before and after the construction of the porto primavera dam which created the largest reservoir in the paraná river and was the last dam constructed in the river channel before the construction of the reservoir 1986 1987 the mean total p concentration and the secchi disk depth in the paraná channel was 27 µgl 1 12 sd and 1 0 m 0 5 sd respectively roberto et al 2009 this situation changed dramatically after completion of the porto primavera dam including a decrease in the mean total p to 12 µgl 1 8 sd and an increase in the secchi disk depth to 3 0 m 1 2 sd from 2000 to 2008 roberto et al 2009 suspended sediment concentration from a mean of 24 mg l 1 in the late 1980s with a seasonal variation of 10 mg l 1 during the floods and 30 mg l 1 during the dry season stevaux 1994 to 0 74 mg l 1 in 2005 and 2006 hayakawa 2007 to a lesser degree the impoverishment of the low lying macrohabitats as a result of flooding with nutrient poor waters from reservoirs upstream on the paraná river had already been determined before the completion of the porto primavera reservoir agostinho et al 1995 after dam closes flooding now lixiviates nutrients from many macrohabitats and erodes the fine fraction of elevated areas leaving sand behind furthermore deepening of the river channel by depth erosion indicated by a modification between the river level and the outflow souza filho 2009 has accelerated the erosion of levees and islands and decreased the flood period of many macrohabitats minor differences have been determined in the water chemistry of macrohabitats at the edges of the floodplain where water and sediments from tributaries alter the characteristic chemical attributes of the soils and water of the paraná river floodplain for example the floodplain lakes connected with the still un dammed ivinheima river receive larger nutrient and solid loads than do the lakes and backwaters directly influenced by the paraná river thomaz et al 1992 roberto et al 2009 6 the macrohabitat classification of the active paraná river floodplain based on the definition of wetland delimitation junk et al 2014a permanent terrestrial macrohabitats inside and at the edges are included this aspect is of specific importance because of the reservoir induced hydrological changes in the paraná river addressed in the discussion a synthesis of the classification system of the macrohabitats of the paraná river floodplain is given in table 2 the classification is based on ecological parameters and is meant to complement rather than replace other classification systems 7 general description of functional units and macrohabitats 7 1 permanently aquatic areas functional unit 1 7 1 1 river channels subclass 1 1 for hydrologists the main function of river channels is the transport of water and dissolved and solid substances for biologists river channels are habitats passive dispersal routes and migration pathways for plants and animals the paraná river macrohabitat 1 1 1 transports sandy bed load in bedforms of different size and morphology ripples mega ripples dunes and sand waves at an entrainment velocity of 10 m month 1 stevaux et al 2009 sand waves active during the great floods can generate sand bars features very common in the paraná channel sand bars can vary from tens to hundreds of meters in size and remain in the channel for periods between 100 to 102 years stevaux and latrubesse 2017 formerly the turbid river channels of the paraná river were colonized only by phytoplankton and were free of aquatic macrophytes however since the increase in transparency that followed reservoir construction especially porto primavera submersed aquatic macrophytes have been increasingly detected the number of native submersed species colonizing the paraná channel increased after the 1990s thomaz et al 2009 but the greatest cause of concern was the arrival of hydrilla verticillata hydrocharitaceae a submersed highly invasive species native to asia but first recorded in the floodplain in 2005 sousa 2011 upstream reservoirs may have served as the source of propagules of this and other macrophyte species and together with the greater water transparency caused by the reservoirs facilitated colonization of the river s main channel and of secondary channels by this invasive plant sousa et al 2010 along the banks slack waters containing woody debris support greater bioproductivity at some places floating belts of aquatic macrophytes provide for short periods food and or habitats for the aquatic fauna macrohabitat 1 1 2 7 1 2 floodplain lakes subclass 1 2 the active floodplain contains hundreds of permanent lakes formed either by ancient anastomosed or by recent braided processes the overflow lakes formed by anastomosed processes include paleochannels lakes lateral expansion lakes and annexed lakes macrohabitat 1 2 1 and those by braided processes of inter bar ponds and obstruction ponds souza filho stevaux 2004 kramer 2004 macrohabitat 1 2 2 paleochannel lakes are the most frequent in the floodplain they are elongated may extend for several kilometers have a width up to 400 m and a depth during low waters of 3 4 m although during extreme drought periods some of these lakes become much shallower and others almost completely dry out their borders are defined by natural levees and their edges are low and poorly defined lateral expansion lakes may be as long as 700 m and as wide as 300 m annexed lakes are complex sets of lakes formed by the merging of several ponds their length can reach 2 km and their width 1 km their depth varies depending on the type of attached pond inter bar and obstruction ponds locally are known as ressacos their length can reach 1 5 km but their width does not exceed 50 m and their depth is less than that of other types of ponds during the day a thermal stratification develops in which surface water temperatures may be as high as 32 c leading to a more stable stratification during the high waters in summer thomaz et al 2004d the large amounts of organic material and high decomposition rates that occur in summer lead to hypoxic conditions in the hypolimnion thomaz et al 1992 2004d benthic abundance in lakes responds negatively to the increased water level takeda grzybkowska 1997 including decreases in the richness and density of chironomids higuti 2004 as a possible response to the steep decrease in oxygen levels these tendencies are accompanied by a dilution of phytoplankton as indicated by the low chlorophyll concentrations measured during high waters thomaz et al 2004d in permanent lakes with steep shores dense floating islands can develop because permanent water logging retards decomposition of the organic layer several fish species especially juveniles of long distance migratory species prochilodus lineatus pseudoplatystomas corruscans may search these habitats during retraction of the water level after completing their initial development in very shallow and recently flooded areas agostinho et al 2007a the level of connectivity determines the exchange of water dissolved and solid substances and biota between the river and adjacent lakes small channels kept open by the large amount of inflowing and outflowing water maintain the connection between the river and large lakes whereas small lakes may be isolated for several months and are connected to the river only when the water level is high studies in temperate and tropical floodplains including the upper paraná river floodplain have shown that with decreasing connectivity lakes tend to establish their own specific nutrient cycles furch and junk 1997 and to maintain a specific aquatic flora and fauna neiff 1979 rodríguez lewis jr 1994 gurnell petts 2002 okada et al 2003 thomaz et al 2007 7 2 periodically aquatic areas aquatic phase of the attz functional unit 2 7 2 1 water distribution and drainage systems inside the attz subclass 2 1 within the floodplain water is distributed by minor channels that connect the main river channels with floodplain lakes macrohabitat 2 1 1 water flux in these channels can change direction such that with a rising water level water is transported from the main channels into the floodplain and with a falling water level from the floodplain to the major river channels 7 2 2 areas periodically covered by standing water subclass 2 2 when the river inundates the floodplain formerly dry areas become covered with water these areas can be free of macrophytes macrohabitat 3 2 1 or covered by free floating or rooted emergent aquatic macrophytes macrohabitat 3 2 2 7 3 periodically terrestrial areas terrestrial phase of the attz functional unit 3 7 3 1 areas without or with sparse vegetation subclass 3 1 during the terrestrial phase vegetation free habitats in the attz include sand bars macrohabitat 3 1 1 and steep shores barrancos macrohabitat 3 1 2 sand bars are used as resting places by birds and aquatic mammals steep river banks are for nest building by king fishers during the terrestrial phase and by freshwater crabs and armored catfish during the aquatic phase 7 3 2 areas covered by herbaceous plants subclass 3 2 large parts of the attz including the shores of river channels and lakes are colonized by aquatic and palustric grasses sedges and herbaceous plants a recent compilation using records gathered since 1997 and intensive data collection between 2007 and 2009 ferreira et al 2011 lists 155 species of aquatic macrophytes belonging to 100 genera and 37 families in the main habitats of the upper paraná river and its floodplain families with the highest number of species are poaceae 21 cyperaceae 17 pontederiaceae and onagraceae 8 hydrocharitaceae 7 polygonaceae 6 and fabaceae 5 the importance of the paraná floodplain as a hotspot for aquatic macrophyte species is also evident based on comparisons with already dammed stretches of the river in a survey carried out at 18 reservoirs of the paraná river and several of its main tributaries martins et al 2008 found only 39 species of aquatic macrophytes the most common species are aeschynomene spp commelina nudiflora cyperus giganteus eichhornia crassipes e azurea hibiscus cisplatinus hymenachne pernambucensis ludwigia spp passiflora misera polygonum acuminatum p ferrugineum p stelligerum pontederia cordata securidaca rivinaefolia solanum glaucophyllum and salvinia spp colonization on sandy beaches begins with cenchrus echinatus eragostis bahiensis urochloa mutica and among others the plants develop from the seed bank in the sediment and or from seeds transported by the water these areas are heavily disturbed by the river during floods macrohabitat 3 2 1 stable low lying areas in the floodplain that are exposed to dry conditions for a few weeks only are colonized by annual terrestrial species with short life cycles including axonopus sp cynodon dactylon and panicum dichotomiflorum on clay soils and the perennial grasses coleataenia prionitis and panicum tricholaenoides on sandy clay soils macrohabitat 3 2 2 on higher lying areas where the forest has been removed exotic grasses such as megathyrsus maximus urochloa brizantha u humidicola u mutica and u plantaginea have been planted to improve the quality of pasture however there are also a large number of native herbaceous species such as paspalum notatum and panicum spp and the shrubs andropogon bicornis cenchrus purpureus and mimosa pigra which require frequent disturbance by cattle and floods ruderal plants and agricultural weeds such as digitaria ciliaris d violascens and eleusine indica also colonize disturbed moist upland areas and are present in abundance macrohabitat 3 2 3 7 3 3 areas covered predominantly by shrubs and trees subclass 3 3 in a review of the literature on the forests of paraná state campos 2004 described forest formation in the paraná river floodplain as representative of semideciduous seasonal alluvial forest the large spatial variability and variations in the physical environment were shown to result in a small scale floristic heterogeneity the three forest types identified in that study were 1 forests situated on highly hydromorphic soils frequent species are calophyllum brasiliense cecropia pachystachya cedrela fissilis celtis iguanaea colubrina retusa croton urucurana ficus obtusiuscula inga affinis nectandra falcifolia ocotea diospyrifolia sloana garckeana s guianensis tapirira guianensis triplaris americana and zygia cataractae emong others 2 forests in dryer better drained areas frequent species are albizia niopoides astromium graveolens cariniana estrellensis cecropia pachystachya coussarea platyphylla eugenia sp ficus spp gallesia integrifolia garcinia brasiliensis guadua chacoensis g paniculata guazuma ulmifolia inga affinis maclura tinctoria peltophorum dubium piper tuberculatum pouteria torta protium heptaphyllum sloanea guianensis trichilia palida and unonopsis guatterioides among others 3 forests in alluvial shoreline cliffs frequent species are anadenathera colubrina cariniana estrellensis copaifera langsdorfii eugenia florida gallesia integrifolia handroanthus heptaphyllus parapidadenia rigida sloanea guianensis ficus sp cecropia pachystachya guarea macrophylla peltophorum dubium triplaris americana unonopsis guatterioides and zygia cataractae among others in floodplain environments increasing flood stress from the highest levees to low lying areas leads to a distribution of woody species according to their flood tolerance and to the formation of different forest communities wittmann et al 2010 disturbance by the floods also results in the frequent natural set back of the forest communities furthermore cattle ranching and timber harvesting since the last century have led to a fragmentation of the forest cover in the paraná river floodplain and to a modified species composition of natural forest communities since many early successional species such as cecropia pachystachya croton urucurana inga vera and zygia cataractae have a large ecological plasticity and occur along the entire flood gradient our classification of natural forested communities is somewhat speculative forest succession in sedimentation areas near the river channel begins with croton urucurana inga vera and cecropia pachystachya which invade the herbaceous communities at sandy beaches these species tolerate long term flooding and high sedimentation rates macrohabitat 3 3 1 later a low lying floodplain forest becomes established on periodically drying ground that tolerates flooding of several months characteristic species are cecropia pachystachya inga marginata inga vera nectandra angustifolia sapindus saponaria triplaris americana vitex montevidensis and zygia cataractae campos souza 1997 eletrosul 1986 previdello et al 1996 romagnolo 2003 medium flood periods allow colonization by albizia niopoides eugenia egensis eugenia florida guarea macrophylla piper tuberculatum and unonopsis guatterioides macrohabitat 3 3 2 levees flooded for short periods only host a high lying floodplain forest with cecropia pachystachya cordia americana ficus obtusiuscula genipa americana hymenaea courbaril ocotea diospyrifolia ormosia arborea protium heptaphyllum sloanea guianensis and vitex megapotamica among others macrohabitat 3 3 3 7 4 swampy areas permanently flooded or waterlogged functional unit 4 large areas of the paraná river floodplain are permanently waterlogged or shallowly flooded most of them are covered by a similar mixture of annual and perennial herbaceous plants as described above macrohabitat 4 1 1 some areas are dominated by a single species cyperus giganteus macrohabitat 4 1 2 in these habitats and on the shores of the semi lentic baía river the increasing dominance of the african grass urochloa arrecta should be noted because this highly invasive plant adversely impacts aquatic biodiversity e g fernandes et al 2013 on the shores of permanent lakes under permanently wet conditions dead organic material can accumulate between the free floating plants thus giving rise to floating islands whose development accompanies the rise and fall of the water level with the increasing density of the organic layer founder species move to the border of the island and in the center are substituted by swamp species such as cyperus blepharoleptos justicia laevilinguis and by other palustric species macrohabitat 4 1 3 on slightly higher lying but still long term waterlogged and flooded soils an open swamp forest is established that consists of bactris glaucescens cephalanthus glabratus erythrina crista galli erytroxylum anguifugum mouriri guianensis psidium striatulum and interspersed with palustric perennial herbaceous plants 7 5 permanently terrestrial areas functional unit 5 the active floodplain connects to the fluvial terraces which may be as high as 10 m above the highest flood level and are covered by semi deciduous seasonal forest that lacks wetland attributes characteristic species are acrocomia aculeta anadenathera colubrina cariniana estrellensis cereus hildmannianus gallesia integrifolia ruprechtia laxifolia and others these areas are important for the floodplain because they enable intensive active and passive exchanges of plant and animal species for instance upland birds and at low water some terrestrial mammals migrate into the floodplain to make use of the abundant food resources macrohabitat 5 1 1 the interactions of these areas with the floodplain remain to be studied in detail 7 6 anthropogenic areas functional unit 6 anthropogenic areas consist of managed and not managed areas subclasses 6 1 and 6 2 managed areas mostly consist of small properties on islands where small houses have been built for use as family dwellings or for sporadic sport fishing the cultivation of crops such as maize and cassava is limited to local consumption cattle ranching used to play a major role in the floodplain and changed the vegetation cover considerably either by deforestation aimed at increasing pasture area or by grazing soil compaction and the disturbance of small water bodies agostinho et al 2004 exclosure experiments carried out on one such island showed that protection from grazing led to a significant increase in plant height biomass and species richness in only 4 months milne et al 2008 cattle raising on the islands decreased after the creation in the 1990s of conservation units in the area which allowed a rapid regeneration of the islands forests campos dickinson 2005 however cattle raising continues in several areas within the attz macrohabitat 6 1 1 attempts to transform the attz into large paddy fields ceased following the large floods that occurred in association with strong enso events roads that cross the floodplain macrohabitat 6 1 2 are important for the dispersion of ruderal plants but their impact has not yet been studied not managed anthropogenic areas consist of abandoned agricultural fields and cattle ranches these have since been invaded by native and introduced grasses sedges herbaceous species shrubs and trees the resulting communities are heterogeneous and still in a dynamic transition phase macrohabitat 6 2 1 8 discussion most wetland classifications take into account a combination of physical habitat characteristics such as hydrology climatology geomorphology soil and water chemistry and the composition of plant assemblages however as they are non hierarchic comparisons between different classification systems are difficult finlayson van der valk 1995 pointed out the need to resolve differences among existing systems with respect to the definition of a wetland and the characterization of wetland types they also called for the standardization of data collection storage and dissemination techniques as a strategy to generate more extensive international inventories the ramsar s scientific and technical review panel likewise called for the development and testing of a hydro geomorphically based system of wetland classification davidson and finlayson 2007 in brazil there are already classification systems for different wetland vegetation types studies on wetlands along streams and rivers in the savanna belt cerrado have been conducted by veloso et al 1991 ibge 1992 and ribeiro walter 1998 wantzen et al 2005 provided a classification of aquatic habitats of the pantanal of mato grosso in 2014a junk et al proposed a hierarchic classification of brazilian wetlands that was later also adopted for the classification of colombian wetlands ricaurtre et al 2019 it differentiates at the system level among coastal inland and artificial wetlands at higher rankings consisting of subsystems orders suborders and classes it considers hydrological parameters especially the stability of the water level and the predictability frequency and height of the flood pulse as the major drivers of ecological processes only at lower rankings functional units subclasses macrohabitats are hydrochemical and vegetation parameters used for differentiation purposes large ecologically politically and socially important wetlands such as the pantanal the amazonian várzeas and igapós and the araguaia guapore and paraná river floodplains are established at the class level macrohabitat classifications of large brazilian floodplains were presented for the pantanal of mato grosso nunes da cunha junk 2011 2014 and for the amazonian white and blackwater river floodplains várzeas and igapós junk et al 2012 2015 studies on the araguaia and guaporé river floodplains are ongoing the classification system of the macrohabitats of the upper paraná river system follows the same approach and will allow comparative studies in addition to facilitating wetland management and protection among the system s aims are to address the following 1 the lack of fixed boundaries between many macrohabitats 2 the changes in macrohabitat conditions in the attz throughout the year due to the flood pulse 3 the large scale changes in macrohabitat conditions and the related changes in vegetation cover due to multi annual changes in regional climate and 4 the need for quantification of the human impact not only on specific wetland macrohabitats but also on the entire river floodplain system as stated earlier the paraná river channel and its floodplain are currently undergoing dramatic alterations in addition to local impacts caused by cattle raising the many large reservoirs have profoundly modified the hydrography as well as the physical and chemical conditions of the river agostinho et al 2004 the flood curve has been smoothed and the load of dissolved and suspended material reduced after completion of the porto primavera reservoir water transparency increased substantially and the concentrations of dissolved nutrients decreased as shown by a one third reduction in the phosphorous concentration roberto et al 2009 the consequences of these changes are already visible in the river s aquatic macrohabitats and include alterations in the species composition of aquatic organisms for example the increase in water transparency measured by the secchi disk has promoted the invasion of the submerged macrophyte h verticillata which now forms dense stands along the shore of the paraná river and in its lateral canals thomaz et al 2009 the greater water transparency has also allowed the successful invasion of visually oriented predators such as the amazonian peacock bass cichla ocellaris agostinho et al 2007b espinola et al 2015 changes in the floodplain following dam construction have also occurred albeit more slowly and less conspicuously consequently they have not been noticed by the public who in addition interpret the very transparent clean water typical of the post dam phase as a positive development however these changes are of fundamental long term importance for the entire river floodplain system thus due to the modified hydrodynamics the area available for floodplain vegetation is restricted to a range of 2 5 m instead of the previous 1 7 m providing little space for the development of different plant communities the absence of lower discharges has resulted in an increase in humid areas in the floodplain throughout the year prohibiting the isolation of water bodies during dry periods the absence of high flood levels leads to fewer inundated areas in turn decreasing the connectivity of water bodies across the floodplain investigations in other river floodplain systems have clearly shown that flow regulation causes large transformations in the vegetation e g mumba thompson 2005 catford et al 2014 currently areas below 2 m are rarely exposed to dry conditions but prior to the dam they were probably covered by annual and perennial grasses and by herbaceous plants woody vegetation was likely absent because there are no records of tree mortality nor are there remnants of dead trees at the lower end of the flood gradient areas above 5 m at the upper end are now flooded only during exceptionally high floods and only for short periods which has favored the immigration of poorly flood tolerant native and exotic terrestrial trees scrubs and herbaceous plants from the upland this aspect is considered in the classification system by the inclusion of permanent terrestrial macrohabitats with the dramatic decrease in sedimentation rates islands will no longer form and the formation of low lying pioneer communities of herbaceous and woody plants will be accordingly inhibited in the future only low lying perennial herbaceous swamp vegetation low lying swamp forests and forests and high lying forests may remain reflecting an impoverishment of major vegetation types and habitats macrohabitats on the banks of the islands or on the lateral banks of the river s main channel rocha 2010b are vulnerable to erosion due to the increased erosive depositional trend of the river instead of carrying sediments and nutrients to the floodplain the river now erodes fine particles and leaches nutrients thus affecting the physical and chemical properties of the soil a slow degradation of the floodplain structures near the river channel is therefore likely with erosion processes at mud banks and levees as the most obvious ones the transformation of mud banks to sandbanks is already evident for example bank erosion increased by 230 after the completion of the porto primavera dam this was the result of piping a type of internal erosion enhanced by water infiltration by the sub daily discharge variation caused by dam operation stevaux et al 2009 the deleterious impact of reservoir construction on fish stocks and inland fishery is the product of many factors including the interruption of longitudinal connectivity which hinders fish migrations agostinho et al 2008 and fish recruitment in addition the decline in fishery yields can be attributed to changes in parameters related to flood hydrology including the timing amplitude duration and frequency of flooding oliveira et al 2018 oliveira et al 2020 to a reduction in nursery areas for juvenile fish and to the reduced carrying capacity caused by the loss of nutrients retention agostinho et al 2008 reductions in the primary and secondary productivity of the river floodplain can be expected to follow from the very large reductions in p concentrations a reduction of phytoplankton productivity of the river may already be underway for example long term data show a clear reduction in the algal biovolume an indication of primary productivity after construction of the porto primavera dam rodrigues et al 2009 this suggests oligotrophication across the whole floodplain as the water of the paraná river dilutes floodplain lake water during high water periods thomaz et al 2004d roberto et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2009 this process of oligotrophication will probably affect other primary producers with potential consequences for higher trophic levels over the long term the natural vegetation of large parts of the floodplain has been modified by humans for at least a century but because the area is now protected and human activities mainly cattle ranching are decreasing it may recover campos dickinson 2005 at the same time the vegetation will adapt to the new hydrological and nutrient conditions measurement of the decrease in primary production of grasses and herbaceous plants is a time consuming task and requires long time series to exclude the impact of other environmental factors such as drought stress excess water grazing and fire we recommend studies of the wood increment of floodplain trees by tree ring analysis as a long term indicator of the impact of the altered flood pulse and changes in nutrient availability the macrohabitat classification described herein will allow modifications to be related to specific macrohabitats the paraná river is the first large tropical floodplain river in which large scale changes in hydrology and the physicochemical conditions following reservoir construction have been studied for a relatively long period of time 35 years this long term experience makes the river floodplain system of the upper paraná a model that can be applied to other similar ecosystems there are plans for the construction of many other reservoirs on large rivers in brazil and in other tropical countries winemiller et al 2016 thus these rivers and their floodplains can be expected to meet a fate similar to that of the paraná river studies on the macrohabitats of the paraná river floodplain will provide data for realistic cost benefit calculations of the conversion of an intact river floodplain system to a system modified by reservoirs this may lead to a decision to terminate reservoir construction in rivers with very large and productive floodplains such as the mekong river where large human populations in the lower course and along the delta depend on the productivity of an intact

998,availability of water for wildlife in some of the national parks in tanzania has been hampered by several factors including the effect of climate change and anthropogenic factors due to the fact that most of the water catchments are outside the national parks in order to ensure the survival of the national parks tanapa which is a parastatal organization mandated to manage the national parks has taken proactive initiatives and actions to tackle the water crisis in its national parks principally the serengeti tarangire ruaha katavi rubondo saadani arusha and kilimanjaro national parks these initiatives and actions have followed the ecohydrology guidelines for water management and they varied from park to park according to the local conditions there are limits to what tanapa can achieve by itself to save its national parks from the water crisis because tanapa has no control on activities outside the parks for those water issues tanapa has communicated its findings and recommendations to the government and stakeholders and the resolution or otherwise of these issues requires state governance as well as in some cases cooperation between the east african countries keywords wildlife water availability river discharge groundwater conservation area governance ecohydrology 1 introduction freshwater resources and biodiversity in sub saharan africa are increasingly threatened by a rapidly increasing human population unep 2006 jury and vaux 2007 un desa 2017 more people require more food which requires more water and thus more abstraction of water from rivers which is often done unsustainably this leads to a freshwater crisis and associated conflicts between people in upstream and downstream areas and between people and nature in much of semi arid east africa crisman et al 2003 in general unsustainably practiced human activities increase low flow periods in rivers and modify or destroy flow pathways nugroho et al 2013 lin et al 2015 jacobs et al 2018 lee et al 2018 kihwele et al 2021 a sustainable supply of water requires healthy watersheds nugroho et al 2013 welde and gebremariam 2017 guzha et al 2018 jacobs et al 2018 lee et al 2018 and this is directly impacted by human activities seeteram et al 2019 elisa et al 2021 kihwele et al 2021 furthermore the ipcc predicted that climate change in east africa will affect rainfall and river flows with consequences for livelihoods and wildlife for the last twenty years tanapa tanzania national parks has taken proactive actions to address the water crisis in its national parks which support tanzania s tourism industry the parks are scattered throughout the country covering all environments figure 1 a tanapa recognised in the 1990s that its national parks are increasingly threatened by human activities brought upon by the exponentially increasing population of humans and cattle in the country figure 1b a recent study has demonstrated how livestock grazing affects the quality of watershed and thus stream flows kihwele et al 2021 in tanzania cattle contributes 5 9 of the country s gross domestic product which is very low compared to the large number of available livestock figure 1b engida et al 2015 commonly it is not kept for its monetary value instead it is often associated with cultural and social values conferring prestige and respect to the owners as well as being used as a dowry mayala et al 2017 much of the resulting pressure on the national parks comes from human activities outside the parks affecting water quality and quantity inside the parks we focus in this paper on the resulting water issues in and around the national parks as sketched in figure 1c each park covers only part of the watershed commonly there is a forested water tower upstream in the highlands whose outflow forms a river there are human activities in the river basin upstream of the parks and possibly compounded by climate change affecting the water quality e g eutrophication and quantity e g through extraction of water for irrigation in several cases these rivers drain in a wetland and from there they flow in the parks these parks are famous for their large mammals that migrate seasonally to and from the rivers these migrations are driven by variability of surface water quantity and quality some of their seasonal migration routes bring them outside the parks historically when the human population was small figure 1b this was feasible but nowadays with the increasing competition for land and water by humans and their cattle this seasonal migration outside the parks is not possible in several cases in some parks the wild animals that historically drunk river water in the dry season now find no more water elephants have learned to dig holes to get to that water when available underground in sandy riverbeds other animals migrate away in search for water either outside the parks where they may be killed or to the few remaining water holes where they are overcrowded and stressed and they overgraze the surrounding areas mtahiko et al 2006 elisa et al 2010 stommel et al 2016 where a water crisis occurs the water dependent wildlife that depend on drinking water on a daily basis such as buffaloes and waterbucks has significantly decreased such is the case in ruaha national park mtahiko et al 2006 the water then flows to downstream water users the parks do not contribute to this water crisis but they suffer from it the causes for the water crisis are many they include see figure 2 deforestation poor land use by small scale farmers leading to massive erosion overgrazing by cattle leading to desertification in the dry season illegal weirs in rivers illegal irrigation channels providing no return flow to the rivers illegal breaching of legal irrigation channels to divert water to squatters dams completely blocking rivers and over used by cattle so they dry out illegal cattle dams diverting a river to flood rice fields at the start of the wet season large scale commercial irrigation and illegal water extraction by pumping from rivers in the dry season water is often abstracted so much by upstream water users that at times in the dry season the river flow ceases completely in the parks figure 2m where then only a few scatter water holes remain around rock bars figured 2n p tanapa the authority managing the national parks of tanzania has long recognized the key role of water in shaping and maintaining the ecosystems in the parks from a link between hydrology and ecology i e ecohydrology it observed in the 1990s that a water crisis was developing and that it is now severe it recognises that solutions are needed and for that it formed a water management group comprising the tanzanian authors of this paper the group has been undertaking ecohydrology monitoring and research since the late 1990s to find solution to the water crisis the ecohydrology monitoring and research follows the principles described by zalewski 2002 2011 first monitoring and research data are used to quantify the links between hydrological and biological processes at the catchment scale second an effort is made or planned to restore the basin ecosystem capacity to absorb the human impact third an effort is made or planned to use the ecosystem properties as a management tool tanapa has no authority for issues outside the parks but it is proactive and it conveys its ecohydrology findings and recommendation to stakeholders and local and national governments for implementation if appropriate when implemented these initiatives within and outside the parks do not eliminate the threats posed by the water crisis but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale this paper reviews such ecohydrology monitoring and research the outcomes and the challenges remaining it focuses on the parks highlighted in figure 1 which all suffer from a water crisis and for which ecohydrology based solutions were implemented or recommended to both central and local government authorities 2 climate change and rainfall climate change may affect the hydrology in several ways from rainfall to evaporation to temperature and vegetation to changes in seasonal and interannual variability of the hydrology cycle in this section we focus on the relationship between the rainfall regime and changes long term 100 years data sets are available for the annual rainfall over the lake victoria basin and at narok in kenya but close to the tanzanian border figure 1 both show major inter annual fluctuations and increased rainfall at a rate of 1 93 and 0 83 mm y 1 for lake victoria basin and narok respectively figure 3 a this increase is not statistically significant in view of the large inter annual fluctuations r2 0 05 and 0 01 for lake victoria and narok respectively the data weakly support the predictions of the inter governmental panel on climate change ipcc of an increase of rainfall over parts of east africa but the observed trend of increasing yearly rainfall is very small there is no evidence either that the inter annual variability of rainfall at narok has increased bartzke et al 2018 neither rainfall data correlate significantly with the soi the southern oscillation index i e the parameter quantifying the dipole in the pacific ocean and the dmi the dipole mode index i e the parameter quantifying the dipole in the indian ocean for lake victoria rainfall r2 0 05 and 0 12 when rainfall is correlated with the soi and the dmi respectively for narok rainfall r2 0 02 and 0 08 when rainfall is correlated with the soi and the dmi respectively the lake victoria and narok annual rainfall data are not significantly correlated with each other r2 0 07 shorter but still spanning several decades data sets of monthly rainfalls were obtained for kigoma on the northern shore of lake tanganyika iringa near ruaha national park tarangire in the tarangire national park and sri seronera in the centre of the serengeti national park they show various trends of increasing or decreasing rainfall figure 3b and these trends are not statistically significant in view of the large inter annual variability and no time series correlates significantly with any other all these sites experienced a dry season and a wet season with two peaks of the wet season in the northeast figure 3c the dry season is shorter in the south and in the west and longer in the northeast where there is considerable inter annual variability one reason for this lack of consistency in the rainfall data at different sites is that rainfall in tanzania is not controlled so much by the passage of large scale frontal systems as in temperate climates in tanzania it is also strongly influenced by tropical thunderstorms https www futurelearn com info courses come rain or shine 0 steps 15245 these are often very localised and produce much rainfall they are not necessarily randomly distributed spatially so they do not spatially even out the monthly rainfall indeed for the case of the maasai mara national reserve the monthly rainfall is incoherent at spatial scales of 10 km and more figure 4 with these data we suggest that climate change induced changes in rainfall are at present overwhelmed by the spatial and temporal variability and the impact of climate change on the parks still needs to be quantified 3 ruaha national park 3 1 ecohydrology findings the great ruaha river grr is the only perennial river in the park the source of that river is the usangu wetlands that create the river by the outflow from the wetlands over the n giriama rock bar figure 5 a mtahiko et al 2006 the usangu wetlands receive their water from the water tower that are the kipengere and kitulo mountains and the highlands of the ndembera river catchment smuwc 2002 hywande et al 2018 much of water is now extracted for rice irrigation upstream of the usangu wetlands in the late 1990s the perennial grr became a seasonal river with zero flow periods of a few months with a devastating impact on the wildlife the reason was the progressive drying out of the usangu wetlands at a rate of about 3 6 cm y 1 figure 5b mtahiko et al 2006 kihwele et al 2012 during that time the rainfall had not decreased in the catchment thus the drying out was due to excessive water abstraction for irrigation as well as the invasion of the usangu wetlands by about 1 million cattle the impact of the cattle was found to be not the water drunk by the cattle but the destruction of the wetland vegetation this prevented the wetlands to act as a sponge storing water it also increased the water temperature and hence the evaporation by removing the shading by the vegetation the destruction of usangu wetlands in the 1990s also resulted in lowering the water level of mtera lake and the reservoir behind the kidatu dam these are hydroelectric dams that had to cease power production for 60 days in 2004 and this resulted in severe economic consequences for tanzania mtahiko et al 2006 3 2 ecohydrology solutions to resolve this water crisis in 2006 the government removed 1 million cattle from the eastern usangu wetlands but much cattle remains in the western usangu the impact was dramatic firstly on the positive side the usangu wetlands provided water to the grr for one extra month after cattle removal figure 5c kihwele et al 2012 secondly on the negative side usangu wetlands became eutrophicated from the fertilisers leaching from the farming upstream a thick floating vegetation layer thick enough to walk on formed all over the wetlands kihwele et al 2012 this decreased evaporation and thus saved water however it also provides dead organic material when plants in the floating vegetation die that sinks to the bottom and is presently filling up the wetlands which in time will transform into a seasonal floodplain kihwele et al 2018 since cattle was removed the usangu water level increased at a rate of 2 4 cm y 1 figure 5b the outflow from the usangu wetlands i e the source of the grr still dries out annually in the dry season but the number of days per year that there is zero river flow has stabilised on the average figure 5d both at n giriama at the outlet of usangu wetlands and at msembe downstream of usangu the number of days of zero flow is different at n giriama and msembe because the reach of the river between the two sites is rocky and has permanent water pools that in the dry season slowly dribble water from pond to pond in a cascade as a result there can be no water at n giriama and still a small flow at msembe downstream of msembe the river is sandy with no rock bar and if the river flow at msembe is less than 0 45 m3 s 1 all that water disappears in the riverbed at such times most of the wildlife deserts the lower reaches of the river and the waterless lower reaches of the park at such times water is still available in the dry season in the rocky pools between n girima and msembe and the area becomes overcrowded and overgrazed mtahiko et al 2006 the holes dug by elephants in search for water in the sandy riverbed in the dry season downstream of msembe fig 2o indicated that there is groundwater at depth less than 1 m two experimental large and shallow holes were excavated in the riverbed to provide water to wildlife downstream of msembe figure 5e this experiment was a success epaphras et al 2008 the water remained clear throughout the dry season and the wildlife used them in a comparable manner as natural water holes these holes were washed away in the wet season and thus left no permanent trace when high flows smooth out the riverbed these findings suggest a remediation measure within the park namely to excavate a dozen water holes yearly in the dry season all along the river downstream of msembe they would provide water for wildlife all along the river in the whole park thus avoiding overcrowding and overgrazing in the upstream reaches therefore somewhat reproducing the historical conditions of the formerly perennial river another proposal is to construct a small v notch weir over each of the two natural channels at the rock bar at n giriama at the outlet of usangu wetlands figure 5f hydrodynamic modelling reveals that by slowing down the outflow from the usangu wetlands this will reduce the no flow period of the great ruaha river at msembe by nearly 2 months thus returning the river nearly to its former perennial status kihwele et al 2018 this was discussed with the world bank for financing the proposal was passed on to the rufiji basin authority and it is presently in the hands of government officials the ecohydrology science has been largely done restoring the grr to its perennial status is now an issue of state governance overshadowed by the government efforts to eradicate human poverty and allocating water for rice irrigation these ecohydrology solutions do not eliminate the threats but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale 4 katavi national park 4 1 ecohydrology findings the water tower of the katuma river is the mwese mpanda forest from which the river flow is perennial figure 6 a the katuma river flows into lake katavi inside katavi national park knp lake katavi is misnamed as it is a seasonal floodplain its outflow forms the katuma river in knp where it is the key source of water for wildlife in the dry season this wildlife is abundant with thousands of buffalo elephant impala zebra eland giraffe sable and hundreds of hippo https newsroom wcs org news releases articletype articleview articleid 13470 massive wildlife survey in tanzania points to elephant recovery in key landscape aspx on leaving knp the river flows into lake rukwa that has no outlet and supports an important artisanal fisheries and communities the katuma river in knp was perennial until the early 2000s when it started drying out in the dry season it is now dry for up to four months a year in knp the reason is the use of katuma river water for rice irrigation upstream of knp figure 6 elisa et al 2010 urt 2014 like in ruaha national park irrigation generates winners being the irrigators upstream and the losers being the park and its wildlife as well as the fishermen and cattlemen living around lake rukwa elisa et al 2010 lrbwb 2016 lake rukwa faces an existential crisis indeed it is predicted to further shrink and even disappear by 2050 or so down to earth 2017 iucn netherlands 2017 lakepedia 2017 nasa earth observatory 2019 we pooled together altimetry data river gauging data rainfall data and landsat images to quantify the water budget our remote sensing data clearly suggest figure 6b that the sustained long term decrease of the water level in lake rukwa up to 2019 followed the increase of rice irrigation and did not result from a change in rainfall we verified this observation by quantifying the water budget from our data elisa et al 2021 4 2 ecohydrology solutions in 2016 and early 2017 the government accepted tanapa s recommendations to restore perennial flows in the katuma river it removed 46 illegal weirs in the river and restored the river channel that was blocked in the irrigated areas upstream of knp as a result in 2017 and 2018 the duration of the zero flow period of the river in knp decreased by up to 2 months compared with previous years with similar rainfall elisa et al 2021 in addition the water level of lake rukwa increased by nearly 1 m thus the removal of illegal weirs was a successful first step in restoring perennial flow in knp and helping lake rukwa the irrigators had rebuilt about 20 illegal weirs by late 2019 the return of illegal weirs and the small rainfall resulted in a return of the long no flow periods that year figure 6b however the park in collaboration with other stakeholders later in the same year removed these weirs because of the removal of these weirs plus exceptional high rainfall in 2020 the river never stopped flowing in 2020 and lake rukwa water level increased by 2 m providing a much needed relief to its progressive drying out just like for ruaha national park we proposed to tanapa to construct a low v notch weir at the outlet of the lake katavi wetlands to further reduce the katuma river zero flow periods by an additional month thus returning the river nearly to its former perennial status the yearly removal of illegal weirs is essential and this becomes a matter of state governance as those weirs are located outside knp outside the legal reach of tanapa just like at ruaha national park these ecohydrology solutions do not eliminate the threats but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale 5 serengeti national park 5 1 ecohydrology findings the mara river is the only perennial river in serengeti national park snp and this water is essential for the animals making the annual migration for which snp is world famous figure 7 a wolanski et al 1999 mati et al 2008 gereta et al 2009 mnaya et al 2017 its water tower is the mau forest in kenya serious deforestation occurred as landsat images revealed that the forest covered 752 km2 in 1973 650 km2 in 1985 and 493 km2 in 2000 gereta et al 2002 this was an overestimate we do not know by how much of the forested area because aerial observations revealed that there were also numerous small scale squatter deforestation plots figure 2a that were too small for landsat satellite to see at the same time the agricultural land in the mara river basin in kenya upstream of snp has increased by 204 and savannah and rangelands reduced from 79 to 52 mati et al 2008 kipampi et al 2017 more recently commercial scale irrigation much for wheat farms has developed in kenya using mara river water figure 2k mango et al 2011 as a result the flows of the mara river in snp during drought years are decreasing and approaching zero figure 7b further the mara river flows are becoming more transient and flashy as the baseflow recession period has decreased from 100 days in the 1970s to 16 days at present kihwele et al 2021 this decrease cannot be attributed to natural causes because the baseflow recession period for the mbalageti river which is a natural system entirely inside the snp has remained unchanged since the 1970s at 70 days while the other two main rivers the grumeti and the mbalageti in snp have no flow in the dry season they retain a few scattered water holes in the riverbed these water holes are important because they allow for spatial niche partitioning and co existence of diverse grazing herbivores kihwele et al 2020 further the grumeti river in snp drains land from outside snp in the loliondo game controlled area lgca which has a forest in its highlands this forest is being degraded but efforts are underway to conserve some of it https sema fzs org en loliondo forest the population has become hostile to snp and in 2019 tanapa had to stop its hydrology investigations in that area however before that happened kihwele et al 2021 documented large scale overgrazing by cattle resulting in major erosion and gully formation in the small streams in lgca draining in the grumeti river soil compaction resulting in reduced infiltration leading to reduced base flow as a result the base flow recession period of these small cattle impacted streams is only 2 hours as opposed to 1 97 days in small streams of the same size just inside snp next to lgca in the same landscape thus the flows in lgca have become extremely short lived therefore largely useless for wildlife drinking these flows are also very flashy with intense local floods lasting a few hours and their swift currents transport the eroded sediment from lgca into snp this sediment is expected to silt and ultimately dry out the dry season water holes in the grumeti river this will have a severe impact on the ecosystem because these scatter water holes allow for spatial niche partitioning and co existence of diverse grazing herbivores kihwele et al 2020 even for catchments inside snp where tanapa has control as exemplified by the seronera river the sedimentation of water holes from the wet season erosion from dirt roads is severe kihwele et al 2021 there are also proposals to build a number of dams on the mara river in kenya as well as to divert mara river water to another river catchment figure 7a the dams are located upstream of the commercially irrigated fields in kenya and their proposed minimum environmental flow is smaller than the flow required for the irrigated fields this will result in zero flow in the mara river in snp this will ruin the serengeti ecosystem mnaya et al 2017 thus the future availability of water for snp is threatened this has major environmental and socio economic consequences for tanzania and its people the whole serengeti ecosystem and its wildlife 5 2 ecohydrology solutions ecohydrology based solutions are urgently needed to reduce catchment degradation while ensuring sustainable water provision for wildlife inside the snp where tanapa has control erosion control measures need to be strengthened along the dirt roads some water holes along the seronera river are occasionally dredged after silting the empirical threshold is that dredging is needed when hippos vacate the water hole this practice needs to be applied to other rivers including the grumeti river to combat siltation from eroded land in the lgca in lgca the issue is outside control of tanapa the number of cattle in lgca must be controlled to prevent overgrazing this is an issue of state governance the threat to the perenniality of the mara river flow is an international issue between kenya and tanzania outside the control of tanapa tanapa has informed the government of tanzania and the national authorities have taken the issue on board some local remedial measures are possible such as constructing a dozen or so low level small weirs at rock bars all along the mara river reach in snp so as to store water during a drought and extending the snp to lake victoria s speke gulf tanapa in collaboration with conservation stakeholders has already proposed the second measure which is awaiting the decision of the parliament the experience in southern africa weeber et al 2020 suggests that such measures may save the resident wildlife in a drought 6 tarangire national park 6 1 ecohydrology findings the tarangire national park tnp figure 8 a has only one river the tarangire river its dry season water tower is the isabe and salanga forest reserves that are being degraded by wood collectors and farming land at their boundaries charley and overton 2006 wet season runoff also comes from the rangelands to the east which are becoming heavily populated and overgrazed and several cattle dams have been built figure 2i miller and joy 2014 in the only published study of the biophysics in tnp gereta et al 2004 reported that in the dry season the only drinking water available for wildlife was the tarangire river and a number of small scattered wetland fringed water holes but their salinity was often high 8 ppt and unsuitable for dinking these animals aggregated in the dry season in areas with the least salty water all wildebeests most zebras and some elephants and buffaloes migrated out of tarangire national park and into the wider tarangire ecosystem at the start of the wet season and they returned into the park in the dry season this seasonal migration sketched in figure 1c is now largely confined to the tnp because of the recent human settlements and cattle outside tnp we undertook exploratory biophysical studies of tnp in october 2017 we found that the system had degraded since gereta et al 2004 in october 2017 and 2018 during the dry season the river had no surface water figure 2m except at three rock bars that forced the groundwater to rise above ground and form a small pool figure 2n p all the wildlife depended on these small pools of water for drinking there were small pools of water in the silale wetlands in the park but the salinity 7 ppt was too high for the wildlife to drink much 90 of the park was then deserted of large mammals in october 2017 during a drought and 2018 we measured a flow of 0 006 m3 s 1 over the matete rock bar in the north of the park the itwasi dam located between the water tower and the park was found to be dry figure 2h rainfall data reveal that there was a worse drought in 2000 however the matete dam then had water the dam built in 1960 never dried before except once in 1994 a ranger who has been in the park 29 years stated that 20 years ago the tarangire river in the south of the park stopped flowing by september october and that now it stops flowing by june july the reason for all that is likely to be the increased use of water for people and cattle attracted by the water provided freely at the dam from which no enviromental flow is provided from 2014 2015 to 2016 2017 the human population grew by 28 the cattle population by 116 and the goat population by 111 at the itwasi village land near the dam in 2017 we started ecohydrology monitoring in tnp initial results showed that at the matete rock bar the river flow is highly variable it decreases rapidly after a flood to small values of only liters per second but it never ceases figure 8b 6 2 ecohydrology solutions a water crisis is developing and needs to be addressed water management outside of the park is a state governance issue when the itwasi dam was built tanapa was not nominated as a stakeholder in the operation of the dam tanapa has to become a stakeholder and actively involved in water issues at the village level for the itwasi dam for the eastern watersheds and the isabe and salanga forest reserves there is clearly a need to control the number of livestock around itwasi dam and to release some environmental flow to the tarangire river within the park there is a need to evaluate the usefulness of otherwise to construct small weirs at the three rock bars of the tarangire river to secure water for the wildlife in a drought one reason being that there may be less groundwater flow in the future if upstream water users use dams to stop the wet season recharge of groundwater there is also a need to construct some water holes deep enough to retain sufficient water after evaporation over 6 8 months of the dry season in the south of the park where there are no rock bars to provide surface water 7 saadani national park this is a small park along the indian ocean coast figure 9 a it is unique in africa that it provides a continuum of ecosystems each with its associated wildlife from savannah to a mangrove fringed estuary to a stretch of a sandy beach that is a nesting ground for sea turtles and seagrass meadows at sea its only perennial river is the wami river that drains an area of 43 946 km2 the river reach including meanders inside the park is only about 8 km long only the top 2 km of the river in the park is not tidal in the wet season the estuary has freshwater up to the mouth and in the dry season saline water intrudes from the ocean up the estuary kiwango et al 2015 2018 historically the uppermost reach of the estuary in the park remained freshwater and thus drinkable by wildlife in the dry season the estuary water residence time is short 7 days kiwango et al 2018 thus saltwater salinity intrudes quickly within a week in the estuary during wami river low flow events such low flow events are becoming more frequent figure 9b because water is increasingly extracted from the river throughout its basin miraji et al 2019 indeed in recent years the whole estuary had high salinity water that wildlife cannot drink the estuary hosts a large number of hippos and crocodiles refugees from the river upstream outside the park these animals move upstream to drink and then return in the saline estuary when the whole estuary becomes too saline this daily migration brings them outside the park where they are in great danger there are approved plans for large scale irrigation in the river basin e g https www dailynews co tz news bakhresa kicks off sugar production aspx which will further aggravate the water crisis in the park due to recent land use changes in the river basin the wami river has become very turbid this sediment load is silting the estuary with mud waves detected by loggers and this benefits the mangroves however the sediment impact on aquatic and marine life including the seagrass is unknown kiwango et al 2018 7 1 ecohydrology solutions the decreasing flows in the wami river is an issue of state governance outside the reach of tanapa which has however joined the stakeholders working group in the central and northern regions of the park water holes have been constructed those that were dug deep enough are perennial but they are located too far for the animals in the wami estuary to find them to save these animals in the dry season we proposed to tanapa to excavate a large hole in clay soils next to the estuary and using solar water pumps to fill it with freshwater from the estuary in the wet season in view of evaporation this water hole would have to be about 2 m deep to retain water throughout the year this would provide drinkable freshwater to the animals in the dry season 8 rubondo island national park 8 1 ecohydrology findings the park figure 10 a comprises rubondo island eleven smaller islets and a lake buffer zone all around the island terrestrial wildlife has access to freshwater all along the shores there are extensive and healthy papyrus wetlands mnaya et al 2007 there are also rich tilapia fisheries which in turn support nile perch fisheries which are supported by the papyrus wetlands one key process sustaining these fisheries was that the papyrus wetlands create an oxygenated well flushed 5 m thick buffer zone between the oxygenated lake water and the anoxic waters in the wetlands beyond the juvenile tilapia fish take refuge from predators including the nile perch in that buffer zone in daytime and come out on moonless night to feed in the lake mnaya and wolanski 2002 mnaya et al 2006 in the early 2000s the lake level dropped swiftly by 2 m the papyrus was exposed and could not re establish itself quickly at the lower elevations this decrease was attributed to uganda s two hydroelectric dams at the outlet of lake victoria in jinja figure 10b because these two dams are in parallel each dam requires water independently of the other dam if they were in series they would use the same water thus they discharge in the white nile nearly twice the amount of lake victoria water than they should if they followed the agreed curve figure 10c eac 2006 kiwango and wolanski 2008 mnaya et al 2011 the agreed curve is the discharge of the white nile river at jinja that should be maintained so that the lake victoria s water level would be natural as if there was no dam the juvenile tilapia population in the park deprived of their papyrus refuge crashed by 95 figure 10d kiwango and wolanski 2008 this man made natural decrease of the water level impacted fishing all over lake victoria as papyrus wetlands dried out all along its shores in uganda tanzania and kenya and this exacerbated the human poverty of the riparian communities this was then once again a scenario of winners i e uganda s urban electricity users and losers i e the riparian communities of lake victoria these communities are already impoverished by the eutrophication of lake victoria which results in occasional red tides now occurring in patches and with a severe problem with invasive species especially the hyacinth sitoki et al 2010 8 2 ecohydrology solutions tanapa is not contributing to the eutrophication of lake victoria and the problem with invasive species to address these issues a basin wide action by kenya uganda and tanzania is needed none is apparently forthcoming so far at the local scale to help the riparian communities improve their fish catch and hopefully reduce their fishing raids in the rubondo national park tanapa created in 2011 two small 100 m long demonstration papyrus wetlands on village land on the shore of lake victoria kiwango et al 2013 the wetlands were constructed over former papyrus wetlands that had been destroyed by human activities in collaboration with the villages that donated the land the villages were given ownership of the created wetlands and promised to manage them in the future to improve the socio economics of the local communities fishing was to be regulated by the village authority and any earnings were for expenses approved by that authority the wetlands were protected by a fence on the landside to inhibit intrusion by people and ubiquitous goats they were constructed using runnels to maximise the habitats for juvenile tilapia fish in the papyrus boundary layer which was discovered by mnaya et al 2006 in rubondo s pristine papyrus wetlands one created wetland was soon degraded by benign neglect of the villagers but the other wetland was maintained figure 10f two years after creation the aboveground papyrus biomass was found to be comparable with that of pristine papyrus wetlands in rubondo island national park light trap data shows increased fish around the area and indeed they were readily visible at night figure 10g the created papyrus wetlands sites also attracted birds including fish eagles cormorants little egrets storks jacana and golden weavers others wildlife identified included monitor lizards frogs and pythons and these were rare or inexistent outside of these wetlands 9 kilimanjaro and arusha national parks 9 1 ecohydrology findings these two parks are in mountain forests and they are the water tower of the rivers in the kilimanjaro landscape figure 11 these rivers support extensive agriculture in heavily populated areas both south of the forests the rivers are an important and reliable source of water for the rich wildlife within the parks as well as in the northern semi arid west kilimanjaro region they also reliably replenish the water of the nyumba ya mungu hydroelectric dam which is important for tanzania s economy these two parks also are important supply of water through groundwater flow for lakes chala jipe and amboseli elisa phd thesis in prep for the period november 2011 to march 2020 elisa found that the mean groundwater flow from kilimanjaro to lake chala was 0 18 m3 s 1 a result which agrees well with the finding of payne 1970 in the late 1960s for the same period elisa also found that the mean annual groundwater inflow from kilimanjaro to lake jipe for the same period was about 8 m3 s 1 which is about 4 times larger than the inflow from the lumi river and 10 times larger than the inflow from rainfall thus the groundwater flow from kilimanjaro is the dominant source of water of lake jipe elisa also estimated the mean annual groundwater inflow from kilimanjaro to lake amboseli is about 0 2 m3 s 1 and in the absence of other surface water source this inflow is essential for the maintenance of the wetlands of amboseli national park in kenya one of the purposes of establishing national parks is to provide ecosystem services including water to tanzanian communities tanapa in collaboration with the basin water offices authorised intake of water from small streams in these two parks these comprise small weirs or traps to capture the water and pipes to bring the water to communities outside the park at most of the water intakes during the dry season all the water is extracted and nothing is left for the environment downstream the environmental impact of such practice was detailed by elisa et al 2016 for arusha national park they found that diverted water was of better quality i e the water extractors were careful in choosing which streams to tap while water left for the ecosystem was of poorer in quality with higher salinity levels and or fluoride levels there were more animals in the upstream areas compared to downstream areas in the water capture areas there were more invasive spp and less or absence of natural wetland vegetation such as rushes and sedges in streams where water was completely abstracted and in those areas invasive species prevailed mostly ageratum conyzoides others included vernonia auriculifera caesalpinia decapetala senna spectabilis and solanum spp 9 2 ecohydrology solutions by providing perennial surface and groundwater runoff the arusha and kilimanjaro national parks are the water towers essential for the ecology and the human activities in the kilimanjaro landscape they clearly need to be preserved the historical practice of allowing stream water capture inside these two parks needs to be strictly controlled and monitored 10 conclusions a serious water crisis already exists and is ever growing throughout tanzania due to the exponential growth of the human and cattle population for instance the human population has increased 20 times in the last 100 years this water crisis flows down with the rivers into the national parks due to human activities upstream of the parks this is degrading the ecosystem of these parks including seriously impacting their wildlife mainly through drying out in the dry season of formerly perennial rivers in the parks tanapa which is the authority managing the national parks of tanzania has taken proactive initiatives and actions to tackle the water crisis in its national parks these initiatives and actions have followed the ecohydrology principles for water management zalewski 2002 and 2011 first studies were undertaken to understand and quantify the biophysical processes linking water quantity and quality and wildlife both in the parks and at the catchment scale second an effort is made or planned to restore the ecosystem capacity to absorb the human impact third an effort is made or planned to use the ecosystem properties as a management tool several such tools were used and they varied from park to park according to the local conditions figure 12 a tanapa has no practical control on activities outside the parks and therefore there are limits to what it can achieve to save its national parks from the water crisis however we are grateful to the government of tanzania for its efforts to approve collaboration between tanapa and the national commission for land use to work with local communities adjacent to the national parks on the establishment of sustainable land use such governance issues involve protecting the water tower in the uplands ensuring environmental flows from dams removing illegal weirs and illegal water pumping regulating irrigation restoring degraded papyrus wetlands promoting sustainable cattle husbandry and controlling erosion figure 12b without this governance at the basin scale some parks will continue to degrade other parks such as serengeti and rubondo require multi national actions to be saved from degradation due to human activities outside tanzania these require cooperation between uganda kenya and tanzania declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
998,availability of water for wildlife in some of the national parks in tanzania has been hampered by several factors including the effect of climate change and anthropogenic factors due to the fact that most of the water catchments are outside the national parks in order to ensure the survival of the national parks tanapa which is a parastatal organization mandated to manage the national parks has taken proactive initiatives and actions to tackle the water crisis in its national parks principally the serengeti tarangire ruaha katavi rubondo saadani arusha and kilimanjaro national parks these initiatives and actions have followed the ecohydrology guidelines for water management and they varied from park to park according to the local conditions there are limits to what tanapa can achieve by itself to save its national parks from the water crisis because tanapa has no control on activities outside the parks for those water issues tanapa has communicated its findings and recommendations to the government and stakeholders and the resolution or otherwise of these issues requires state governance as well as in some cases cooperation between the east african countries keywords wildlife water availability river discharge groundwater conservation area governance ecohydrology 1 introduction freshwater resources and biodiversity in sub saharan africa are increasingly threatened by a rapidly increasing human population unep 2006 jury and vaux 2007 un desa 2017 more people require more food which requires more water and thus more abstraction of water from rivers which is often done unsustainably this leads to a freshwater crisis and associated conflicts between people in upstream and downstream areas and between people and nature in much of semi arid east africa crisman et al 2003 in general unsustainably practiced human activities increase low flow periods in rivers and modify or destroy flow pathways nugroho et al 2013 lin et al 2015 jacobs et al 2018 lee et al 2018 kihwele et al 2021 a sustainable supply of water requires healthy watersheds nugroho et al 2013 welde and gebremariam 2017 guzha et al 2018 jacobs et al 2018 lee et al 2018 and this is directly impacted by human activities seeteram et al 2019 elisa et al 2021 kihwele et al 2021 furthermore the ipcc predicted that climate change in east africa will affect rainfall and river flows with consequences for livelihoods and wildlife for the last twenty years tanapa tanzania national parks has taken proactive actions to address the water crisis in its national parks which support tanzania s tourism industry the parks are scattered throughout the country covering all environments figure 1 a tanapa recognised in the 1990s that its national parks are increasingly threatened by human activities brought upon by the exponentially increasing population of humans and cattle in the country figure 1b a recent study has demonstrated how livestock grazing affects the quality of watershed and thus stream flows kihwele et al 2021 in tanzania cattle contributes 5 9 of the country s gross domestic product which is very low compared to the large number of available livestock figure 1b engida et al 2015 commonly it is not kept for its monetary value instead it is often associated with cultural and social values conferring prestige and respect to the owners as well as being used as a dowry mayala et al 2017 much of the resulting pressure on the national parks comes from human activities outside the parks affecting water quality and quantity inside the parks we focus in this paper on the resulting water issues in and around the national parks as sketched in figure 1c each park covers only part of the watershed commonly there is a forested water tower upstream in the highlands whose outflow forms a river there are human activities in the river basin upstream of the parks and possibly compounded by climate change affecting the water quality e g eutrophication and quantity e g through extraction of water for irrigation in several cases these rivers drain in a wetland and from there they flow in the parks these parks are famous for their large mammals that migrate seasonally to and from the rivers these migrations are driven by variability of surface water quantity and quality some of their seasonal migration routes bring them outside the parks historically when the human population was small figure 1b this was feasible but nowadays with the increasing competition for land and water by humans and their cattle this seasonal migration outside the parks is not possible in several cases in some parks the wild animals that historically drunk river water in the dry season now find no more water elephants have learned to dig holes to get to that water when available underground in sandy riverbeds other animals migrate away in search for water either outside the parks where they may be killed or to the few remaining water holes where they are overcrowded and stressed and they overgraze the surrounding areas mtahiko et al 2006 elisa et al 2010 stommel et al 2016 where a water crisis occurs the water dependent wildlife that depend on drinking water on a daily basis such as buffaloes and waterbucks has significantly decreased such is the case in ruaha national park mtahiko et al 2006 the water then flows to downstream water users the parks do not contribute to this water crisis but they suffer from it the causes for the water crisis are many they include see figure 2 deforestation poor land use by small scale farmers leading to massive erosion overgrazing by cattle leading to desertification in the dry season illegal weirs in rivers illegal irrigation channels providing no return flow to the rivers illegal breaching of legal irrigation channels to divert water to squatters dams completely blocking rivers and over used by cattle so they dry out illegal cattle dams diverting a river to flood rice fields at the start of the wet season large scale commercial irrigation and illegal water extraction by pumping from rivers in the dry season water is often abstracted so much by upstream water users that at times in the dry season the river flow ceases completely in the parks figure 2m where then only a few scatter water holes remain around rock bars figured 2n p tanapa the authority managing the national parks of tanzania has long recognized the key role of water in shaping and maintaining the ecosystems in the parks from a link between hydrology and ecology i e ecohydrology it observed in the 1990s that a water crisis was developing and that it is now severe it recognises that solutions are needed and for that it formed a water management group comprising the tanzanian authors of this paper the group has been undertaking ecohydrology monitoring and research since the late 1990s to find solution to the water crisis the ecohydrology monitoring and research follows the principles described by zalewski 2002 2011 first monitoring and research data are used to quantify the links between hydrological and biological processes at the catchment scale second an effort is made or planned to restore the basin ecosystem capacity to absorb the human impact third an effort is made or planned to use the ecosystem properties as a management tool tanapa has no authority for issues outside the parks but it is proactive and it conveys its ecohydrology findings and recommendation to stakeholders and local and national governments for implementation if appropriate when implemented these initiatives within and outside the parks do not eliminate the threats posed by the water crisis but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale this paper reviews such ecohydrology monitoring and research the outcomes and the challenges remaining it focuses on the parks highlighted in figure 1 which all suffer from a water crisis and for which ecohydrology based solutions were implemented or recommended to both central and local government authorities 2 climate change and rainfall climate change may affect the hydrology in several ways from rainfall to evaporation to temperature and vegetation to changes in seasonal and interannual variability of the hydrology cycle in this section we focus on the relationship between the rainfall regime and changes long term 100 years data sets are available for the annual rainfall over the lake victoria basin and at narok in kenya but close to the tanzanian border figure 1 both show major inter annual fluctuations and increased rainfall at a rate of 1 93 and 0 83 mm y 1 for lake victoria basin and narok respectively figure 3 a this increase is not statistically significant in view of the large inter annual fluctuations r2 0 05 and 0 01 for lake victoria and narok respectively the data weakly support the predictions of the inter governmental panel on climate change ipcc of an increase of rainfall over parts of east africa but the observed trend of increasing yearly rainfall is very small there is no evidence either that the inter annual variability of rainfall at narok has increased bartzke et al 2018 neither rainfall data correlate significantly with the soi the southern oscillation index i e the parameter quantifying the dipole in the pacific ocean and the dmi the dipole mode index i e the parameter quantifying the dipole in the indian ocean for lake victoria rainfall r2 0 05 and 0 12 when rainfall is correlated with the soi and the dmi respectively for narok rainfall r2 0 02 and 0 08 when rainfall is correlated with the soi and the dmi respectively the lake victoria and narok annual rainfall data are not significantly correlated with each other r2 0 07 shorter but still spanning several decades data sets of monthly rainfalls were obtained for kigoma on the northern shore of lake tanganyika iringa near ruaha national park tarangire in the tarangire national park and sri seronera in the centre of the serengeti national park they show various trends of increasing or decreasing rainfall figure 3b and these trends are not statistically significant in view of the large inter annual variability and no time series correlates significantly with any other all these sites experienced a dry season and a wet season with two peaks of the wet season in the northeast figure 3c the dry season is shorter in the south and in the west and longer in the northeast where there is considerable inter annual variability one reason for this lack of consistency in the rainfall data at different sites is that rainfall in tanzania is not controlled so much by the passage of large scale frontal systems as in temperate climates in tanzania it is also strongly influenced by tropical thunderstorms https www futurelearn com info courses come rain or shine 0 steps 15245 these are often very localised and produce much rainfall they are not necessarily randomly distributed spatially so they do not spatially even out the monthly rainfall indeed for the case of the maasai mara national reserve the monthly rainfall is incoherent at spatial scales of 10 km and more figure 4 with these data we suggest that climate change induced changes in rainfall are at present overwhelmed by the spatial and temporal variability and the impact of climate change on the parks still needs to be quantified 3 ruaha national park 3 1 ecohydrology findings the great ruaha river grr is the only perennial river in the park the source of that river is the usangu wetlands that create the river by the outflow from the wetlands over the n giriama rock bar figure 5 a mtahiko et al 2006 the usangu wetlands receive their water from the water tower that are the kipengere and kitulo mountains and the highlands of the ndembera river catchment smuwc 2002 hywande et al 2018 much of water is now extracted for rice irrigation upstream of the usangu wetlands in the late 1990s the perennial grr became a seasonal river with zero flow periods of a few months with a devastating impact on the wildlife the reason was the progressive drying out of the usangu wetlands at a rate of about 3 6 cm y 1 figure 5b mtahiko et al 2006 kihwele et al 2012 during that time the rainfall had not decreased in the catchment thus the drying out was due to excessive water abstraction for irrigation as well as the invasion of the usangu wetlands by about 1 million cattle the impact of the cattle was found to be not the water drunk by the cattle but the destruction of the wetland vegetation this prevented the wetlands to act as a sponge storing water it also increased the water temperature and hence the evaporation by removing the shading by the vegetation the destruction of usangu wetlands in the 1990s also resulted in lowering the water level of mtera lake and the reservoir behind the kidatu dam these are hydroelectric dams that had to cease power production for 60 days in 2004 and this resulted in severe economic consequences for tanzania mtahiko et al 2006 3 2 ecohydrology solutions to resolve this water crisis in 2006 the government removed 1 million cattle from the eastern usangu wetlands but much cattle remains in the western usangu the impact was dramatic firstly on the positive side the usangu wetlands provided water to the grr for one extra month after cattle removal figure 5c kihwele et al 2012 secondly on the negative side usangu wetlands became eutrophicated from the fertilisers leaching from the farming upstream a thick floating vegetation layer thick enough to walk on formed all over the wetlands kihwele et al 2012 this decreased evaporation and thus saved water however it also provides dead organic material when plants in the floating vegetation die that sinks to the bottom and is presently filling up the wetlands which in time will transform into a seasonal floodplain kihwele et al 2018 since cattle was removed the usangu water level increased at a rate of 2 4 cm y 1 figure 5b the outflow from the usangu wetlands i e the source of the grr still dries out annually in the dry season but the number of days per year that there is zero river flow has stabilised on the average figure 5d both at n giriama at the outlet of usangu wetlands and at msembe downstream of usangu the number of days of zero flow is different at n giriama and msembe because the reach of the river between the two sites is rocky and has permanent water pools that in the dry season slowly dribble water from pond to pond in a cascade as a result there can be no water at n giriama and still a small flow at msembe downstream of msembe the river is sandy with no rock bar and if the river flow at msembe is less than 0 45 m3 s 1 all that water disappears in the riverbed at such times most of the wildlife deserts the lower reaches of the river and the waterless lower reaches of the park at such times water is still available in the dry season in the rocky pools between n girima and msembe and the area becomes overcrowded and overgrazed mtahiko et al 2006 the holes dug by elephants in search for water in the sandy riverbed in the dry season downstream of msembe fig 2o indicated that there is groundwater at depth less than 1 m two experimental large and shallow holes were excavated in the riverbed to provide water to wildlife downstream of msembe figure 5e this experiment was a success epaphras et al 2008 the water remained clear throughout the dry season and the wildlife used them in a comparable manner as natural water holes these holes were washed away in the wet season and thus left no permanent trace when high flows smooth out the riverbed these findings suggest a remediation measure within the park namely to excavate a dozen water holes yearly in the dry season all along the river downstream of msembe they would provide water for wildlife all along the river in the whole park thus avoiding overcrowding and overgrazing in the upstream reaches therefore somewhat reproducing the historical conditions of the formerly perennial river another proposal is to construct a small v notch weir over each of the two natural channels at the rock bar at n giriama at the outlet of usangu wetlands figure 5f hydrodynamic modelling reveals that by slowing down the outflow from the usangu wetlands this will reduce the no flow period of the great ruaha river at msembe by nearly 2 months thus returning the river nearly to its former perennial status kihwele et al 2018 this was discussed with the world bank for financing the proposal was passed on to the rufiji basin authority and it is presently in the hands of government officials the ecohydrology science has been largely done restoring the grr to its perennial status is now an issue of state governance overshadowed by the government efforts to eradicate human poverty and allocating water for rice irrigation these ecohydrology solutions do not eliminate the threats but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale 4 katavi national park 4 1 ecohydrology findings the water tower of the katuma river is the mwese mpanda forest from which the river flow is perennial figure 6 a the katuma river flows into lake katavi inside katavi national park knp lake katavi is misnamed as it is a seasonal floodplain its outflow forms the katuma river in knp where it is the key source of water for wildlife in the dry season this wildlife is abundant with thousands of buffalo elephant impala zebra eland giraffe sable and hundreds of hippo https newsroom wcs org news releases articletype articleview articleid 13470 massive wildlife survey in tanzania points to elephant recovery in key landscape aspx on leaving knp the river flows into lake rukwa that has no outlet and supports an important artisanal fisheries and communities the katuma river in knp was perennial until the early 2000s when it started drying out in the dry season it is now dry for up to four months a year in knp the reason is the use of katuma river water for rice irrigation upstream of knp figure 6 elisa et al 2010 urt 2014 like in ruaha national park irrigation generates winners being the irrigators upstream and the losers being the park and its wildlife as well as the fishermen and cattlemen living around lake rukwa elisa et al 2010 lrbwb 2016 lake rukwa faces an existential crisis indeed it is predicted to further shrink and even disappear by 2050 or so down to earth 2017 iucn netherlands 2017 lakepedia 2017 nasa earth observatory 2019 we pooled together altimetry data river gauging data rainfall data and landsat images to quantify the water budget our remote sensing data clearly suggest figure 6b that the sustained long term decrease of the water level in lake rukwa up to 2019 followed the increase of rice irrigation and did not result from a change in rainfall we verified this observation by quantifying the water budget from our data elisa et al 2021 4 2 ecohydrology solutions in 2016 and early 2017 the government accepted tanapa s recommendations to restore perennial flows in the katuma river it removed 46 illegal weirs in the river and restored the river channel that was blocked in the irrigated areas upstream of knp as a result in 2017 and 2018 the duration of the zero flow period of the river in knp decreased by up to 2 months compared with previous years with similar rainfall elisa et al 2021 in addition the water level of lake rukwa increased by nearly 1 m thus the removal of illegal weirs was a successful first step in restoring perennial flow in knp and helping lake rukwa the irrigators had rebuilt about 20 illegal weirs by late 2019 the return of illegal weirs and the small rainfall resulted in a return of the long no flow periods that year figure 6b however the park in collaboration with other stakeholders later in the same year removed these weirs because of the removal of these weirs plus exceptional high rainfall in 2020 the river never stopped flowing in 2020 and lake rukwa water level increased by 2 m providing a much needed relief to its progressive drying out just like for ruaha national park we proposed to tanapa to construct a low v notch weir at the outlet of the lake katavi wetlands to further reduce the katuma river zero flow periods by an additional month thus returning the river nearly to its former perennial status the yearly removal of illegal weirs is essential and this becomes a matter of state governance as those weirs are located outside knp outside the legal reach of tanapa just like at ruaha national park these ecohydrology solutions do not eliminate the threats but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale 5 serengeti national park 5 1 ecohydrology findings the mara river is the only perennial river in serengeti national park snp and this water is essential for the animals making the annual migration for which snp is world famous figure 7 a wolanski et al 1999 mati et al 2008 gereta et al 2009 mnaya et al 2017 its water tower is the mau forest in kenya serious deforestation occurred as landsat images revealed that the forest covered 752 km2 in 1973 650 km2 in 1985 and 493 km2 in 2000 gereta et al 2002 this was an overestimate we do not know by how much of the forested area because aerial observations revealed that there were also numerous small scale squatter deforestation plots figure 2a that were too small for landsat satellite to see at the same time the agricultural land in the mara river basin in kenya upstream of snp has increased by 204 and savannah and rangelands reduced from 79 to 52 mati et al 2008 kipampi et al 2017 more recently commercial scale irrigation much for wheat farms has developed in kenya using mara river water figure 2k mango et al 2011 as a result the flows of the mara river in snp during drought years are decreasing and approaching zero figure 7b further the mara river flows are becoming more transient and flashy as the baseflow recession period has decreased from 100 days in the 1970s to 16 days at present kihwele et al 2021 this decrease cannot be attributed to natural causes because the baseflow recession period for the mbalageti river which is a natural system entirely inside the snp has remained unchanged since the 1970s at 70 days while the other two main rivers the grumeti and the mbalageti in snp have no flow in the dry season they retain a few scattered water holes in the riverbed these water holes are important because they allow for spatial niche partitioning and co existence of diverse grazing herbivores kihwele et al 2020 further the grumeti river in snp drains land from outside snp in the loliondo game controlled area lgca which has a forest in its highlands this forest is being degraded but efforts are underway to conserve some of it https sema fzs org en loliondo forest the population has become hostile to snp and in 2019 tanapa had to stop its hydrology investigations in that area however before that happened kihwele et al 2021 documented large scale overgrazing by cattle resulting in major erosion and gully formation in the small streams in lgca draining in the grumeti river soil compaction resulting in reduced infiltration leading to reduced base flow as a result the base flow recession period of these small cattle impacted streams is only 2 hours as opposed to 1 97 days in small streams of the same size just inside snp next to lgca in the same landscape thus the flows in lgca have become extremely short lived therefore largely useless for wildlife drinking these flows are also very flashy with intense local floods lasting a few hours and their swift currents transport the eroded sediment from lgca into snp this sediment is expected to silt and ultimately dry out the dry season water holes in the grumeti river this will have a severe impact on the ecosystem because these scatter water holes allow for spatial niche partitioning and co existence of diverse grazing herbivores kihwele et al 2020 even for catchments inside snp where tanapa has control as exemplified by the seronera river the sedimentation of water holes from the wet season erosion from dirt roads is severe kihwele et al 2021 there are also proposals to build a number of dams on the mara river in kenya as well as to divert mara river water to another river catchment figure 7a the dams are located upstream of the commercially irrigated fields in kenya and their proposed minimum environmental flow is smaller than the flow required for the irrigated fields this will result in zero flow in the mara river in snp this will ruin the serengeti ecosystem mnaya et al 2017 thus the future availability of water for snp is threatened this has major environmental and socio economic consequences for tanzania and its people the whole serengeti ecosystem and its wildlife 5 2 ecohydrology solutions ecohydrology based solutions are urgently needed to reduce catchment degradation while ensuring sustainable water provision for wildlife inside the snp where tanapa has control erosion control measures need to be strengthened along the dirt roads some water holes along the seronera river are occasionally dredged after silting the empirical threshold is that dredging is needed when hippos vacate the water hole this practice needs to be applied to other rivers including the grumeti river to combat siltation from eroded land in the lgca in lgca the issue is outside control of tanapa the number of cattle in lgca must be controlled to prevent overgrazing this is an issue of state governance the threat to the perenniality of the mara river flow is an international issue between kenya and tanzania outside the control of tanapa tanapa has informed the government of tanzania and the national authorities have taken the issue on board some local remedial measures are possible such as constructing a dozen or so low level small weirs at rock bars all along the mara river reach in snp so as to store water during a drought and extending the snp to lake victoria s speke gulf tanapa in collaboration with conservation stakeholders has already proposed the second measure which is awaiting the decision of the parliament the experience in southern africa weeber et al 2020 suggests that such measures may save the resident wildlife in a drought 6 tarangire national park 6 1 ecohydrology findings the tarangire national park tnp figure 8 a has only one river the tarangire river its dry season water tower is the isabe and salanga forest reserves that are being degraded by wood collectors and farming land at their boundaries charley and overton 2006 wet season runoff also comes from the rangelands to the east which are becoming heavily populated and overgrazed and several cattle dams have been built figure 2i miller and joy 2014 in the only published study of the biophysics in tnp gereta et al 2004 reported that in the dry season the only drinking water available for wildlife was the tarangire river and a number of small scattered wetland fringed water holes but their salinity was often high 8 ppt and unsuitable for dinking these animals aggregated in the dry season in areas with the least salty water all wildebeests most zebras and some elephants and buffaloes migrated out of tarangire national park and into the wider tarangire ecosystem at the start of the wet season and they returned into the park in the dry season this seasonal migration sketched in figure 1c is now largely confined to the tnp because of the recent human settlements and cattle outside tnp we undertook exploratory biophysical studies of tnp in october 2017 we found that the system had degraded since gereta et al 2004 in october 2017 and 2018 during the dry season the river had no surface water figure 2m except at three rock bars that forced the groundwater to rise above ground and form a small pool figure 2n p all the wildlife depended on these small pools of water for drinking there were small pools of water in the silale wetlands in the park but the salinity 7 ppt was too high for the wildlife to drink much 90 of the park was then deserted of large mammals in october 2017 during a drought and 2018 we measured a flow of 0 006 m3 s 1 over the matete rock bar in the north of the park the itwasi dam located between the water tower and the park was found to be dry figure 2h rainfall data reveal that there was a worse drought in 2000 however the matete dam then had water the dam built in 1960 never dried before except once in 1994 a ranger who has been in the park 29 years stated that 20 years ago the tarangire river in the south of the park stopped flowing by september october and that now it stops flowing by june july the reason for all that is likely to be the increased use of water for people and cattle attracted by the water provided freely at the dam from which no enviromental flow is provided from 2014 2015 to 2016 2017 the human population grew by 28 the cattle population by 116 and the goat population by 111 at the itwasi village land near the dam in 2017 we started ecohydrology monitoring in tnp initial results showed that at the matete rock bar the river flow is highly variable it decreases rapidly after a flood to small values of only liters per second but it never ceases figure 8b 6 2 ecohydrology solutions a water crisis is developing and needs to be addressed water management outside of the park is a state governance issue when the itwasi dam was built tanapa was not nominated as a stakeholder in the operation of the dam tanapa has to become a stakeholder and actively involved in water issues at the village level for the itwasi dam for the eastern watersheds and the isabe and salanga forest reserves there is clearly a need to control the number of livestock around itwasi dam and to release some environmental flow to the tarangire river within the park there is a need to evaluate the usefulness of otherwise to construct small weirs at the three rock bars of the tarangire river to secure water for the wildlife in a drought one reason being that there may be less groundwater flow in the future if upstream water users use dams to stop the wet season recharge of groundwater there is also a need to construct some water holes deep enough to retain sufficient water after evaporation over 6 8 months of the dry season in the south of the park where there are no rock bars to provide surface water 7 saadani national park this is a small park along the indian ocean coast figure 9 a it is unique in africa that it provides a continuum of ecosystems each with its associated wildlife from savannah to a mangrove fringed estuary to a stretch of a sandy beach that is a nesting ground for sea turtles and seagrass meadows at sea its only perennial river is the wami river that drains an area of 43 946 km2 the river reach including meanders inside the park is only about 8 km long only the top 2 km of the river in the park is not tidal in the wet season the estuary has freshwater up to the mouth and in the dry season saline water intrudes from the ocean up the estuary kiwango et al 2015 2018 historically the uppermost reach of the estuary in the park remained freshwater and thus drinkable by wildlife in the dry season the estuary water residence time is short 7 days kiwango et al 2018 thus saltwater salinity intrudes quickly within a week in the estuary during wami river low flow events such low flow events are becoming more frequent figure 9b because water is increasingly extracted from the river throughout its basin miraji et al 2019 indeed in recent years the whole estuary had high salinity water that wildlife cannot drink the estuary hosts a large number of hippos and crocodiles refugees from the river upstream outside the park these animals move upstream to drink and then return in the saline estuary when the whole estuary becomes too saline this daily migration brings them outside the park where they are in great danger there are approved plans for large scale irrigation in the river basin e g https www dailynews co tz news bakhresa kicks off sugar production aspx which will further aggravate the water crisis in the park due to recent land use changes in the river basin the wami river has become very turbid this sediment load is silting the estuary with mud waves detected by loggers and this benefits the mangroves however the sediment impact on aquatic and marine life including the seagrass is unknown kiwango et al 2018 7 1 ecohydrology solutions the decreasing flows in the wami river is an issue of state governance outside the reach of tanapa which has however joined the stakeholders working group in the central and northern regions of the park water holes have been constructed those that were dug deep enough are perennial but they are located too far for the animals in the wami estuary to find them to save these animals in the dry season we proposed to tanapa to excavate a large hole in clay soils next to the estuary and using solar water pumps to fill it with freshwater from the estuary in the wet season in view of evaporation this water hole would have to be about 2 m deep to retain water throughout the year this would provide drinkable freshwater to the animals in the dry season 8 rubondo island national park 8 1 ecohydrology findings the park figure 10 a comprises rubondo island eleven smaller islets and a lake buffer zone all around the island terrestrial wildlife has access to freshwater all along the shores there are extensive and healthy papyrus wetlands mnaya et al 2007 there are also rich tilapia fisheries which in turn support nile perch fisheries which are supported by the papyrus wetlands one key process sustaining these fisheries was that the papyrus wetlands create an oxygenated well flushed 5 m thick buffer zone between the oxygenated lake water and the anoxic waters in the wetlands beyond the juvenile tilapia fish take refuge from predators including the nile perch in that buffer zone in daytime and come out on moonless night to feed in the lake mnaya and wolanski 2002 mnaya et al 2006 in the early 2000s the lake level dropped swiftly by 2 m the papyrus was exposed and could not re establish itself quickly at the lower elevations this decrease was attributed to uganda s two hydroelectric dams at the outlet of lake victoria in jinja figure 10b because these two dams are in parallel each dam requires water independently of the other dam if they were in series they would use the same water thus they discharge in the white nile nearly twice the amount of lake victoria water than they should if they followed the agreed curve figure 10c eac 2006 kiwango and wolanski 2008 mnaya et al 2011 the agreed curve is the discharge of the white nile river at jinja that should be maintained so that the lake victoria s water level would be natural as if there was no dam the juvenile tilapia population in the park deprived of their papyrus refuge crashed by 95 figure 10d kiwango and wolanski 2008 this man made natural decrease of the water level impacted fishing all over lake victoria as papyrus wetlands dried out all along its shores in uganda tanzania and kenya and this exacerbated the human poverty of the riparian communities this was then once again a scenario of winners i e uganda s urban electricity users and losers i e the riparian communities of lake victoria these communities are already impoverished by the eutrophication of lake victoria which results in occasional red tides now occurring in patches and with a severe problem with invasive species especially the hyacinth sitoki et al 2010 8 2 ecohydrology solutions tanapa is not contributing to the eutrophication of lake victoria and the problem with invasive species to address these issues a basin wide action by kenya uganda and tanzania is needed none is apparently forthcoming so far at the local scale to help the riparian communities improve their fish catch and hopefully reduce their fishing raids in the rubondo national park tanapa created in 2011 two small 100 m long demonstration papyrus wetlands on village land on the shore of lake victoria kiwango et al 2013 the wetlands were constructed over former papyrus wetlands that had been destroyed by human activities in collaboration with the villages that donated the land the villages were given ownership of the created wetlands and promised to manage them in the future to improve the socio economics of the local communities fishing was to be regulated by the village authority and any earnings were for expenses approved by that authority the wetlands were protected by a fence on the landside to inhibit intrusion by people and ubiquitous goats they were constructed using runnels to maximise the habitats for juvenile tilapia fish in the papyrus boundary layer which was discovered by mnaya et al 2006 in rubondo s pristine papyrus wetlands one created wetland was soon degraded by benign neglect of the villagers but the other wetland was maintained figure 10f two years after creation the aboveground papyrus biomass was found to be comparable with that of pristine papyrus wetlands in rubondo island national park light trap data shows increased fish around the area and indeed they were readily visible at night figure 10g the created papyrus wetlands sites also attracted birds including fish eagles cormorants little egrets storks jacana and golden weavers others wildlife identified included monitor lizards frogs and pythons and these were rare or inexistent outside of these wetlands 9 kilimanjaro and arusha national parks 9 1 ecohydrology findings these two parks are in mountain forests and they are the water tower of the rivers in the kilimanjaro landscape figure 11 these rivers support extensive agriculture in heavily populated areas both south of the forests the rivers are an important and reliable source of water for the rich wildlife within the parks as well as in the northern semi arid west kilimanjaro region they also reliably replenish the water of the nyumba ya mungu hydroelectric dam which is important for tanzania s economy these two parks also are important supply of water through groundwater flow for lakes chala jipe and amboseli elisa phd thesis in prep for the period november 2011 to march 2020 elisa found that the mean groundwater flow from kilimanjaro to lake chala was 0 18 m3 s 1 a result which agrees well with the finding of payne 1970 in the late 1960s for the same period elisa also found that the mean annual groundwater inflow from kilimanjaro to lake jipe for the same period was about 8 m3 s 1 which is about 4 times larger than the inflow from the lumi river and 10 times larger than the inflow from rainfall thus the groundwater flow from kilimanjaro is the dominant source of water of lake jipe elisa also estimated the mean annual groundwater inflow from kilimanjaro to lake amboseli is about 0 2 m3 s 1 and in the absence of other surface water source this inflow is essential for the maintenance of the wetlands of amboseli national park in kenya one of the purposes of establishing national parks is to provide ecosystem services including water to tanzanian communities tanapa in collaboration with the basin water offices authorised intake of water from small streams in these two parks these comprise small weirs or traps to capture the water and pipes to bring the water to communities outside the park at most of the water intakes during the dry season all the water is extracted and nothing is left for the environment downstream the environmental impact of such practice was detailed by elisa et al 2016 for arusha national park they found that diverted water was of better quality i e the water extractors were careful in choosing which streams to tap while water left for the ecosystem was of poorer in quality with higher salinity levels and or fluoride levels there were more animals in the upstream areas compared to downstream areas in the water capture areas there were more invasive spp and less or absence of natural wetland vegetation such as rushes and sedges in streams where water was completely abstracted and in those areas invasive species prevailed mostly ageratum conyzoides others included vernonia auriculifera caesalpinia decapetala senna spectabilis and solanum spp 9 2 ecohydrology solutions by providing perennial surface and groundwater runoff the arusha and kilimanjaro national parks are the water towers essential for the ecology and the human activities in the kilimanjaro landscape they clearly need to be preserved the historical practice of allowing stream water capture inside these two parks needs to be strictly controlled and monitored 10 conclusions a serious water crisis already exists and is ever growing throughout tanzania due to the exponential growth of the human and cattle population for instance the human population has increased 20 times in the last 100 years this water crisis flows down with the rivers into the national parks due to human activities upstream of the parks this is degrading the ecosystem of these parks including seriously impacting their wildlife mainly through drying out in the dry season of formerly perennial rivers in the parks tanapa which is the authority managing the national parks of tanzania has taken proactive initiatives and actions to tackle the water crisis in its national parks these initiatives and actions have followed the ecohydrology principles for water management zalewski 2002 and 2011 first studies were undertaken to understand and quantify the biophysical processes linking water quantity and quality and wildlife both in the parks and at the catchment scale second an effort is made or planned to restore the ecosystem capacity to absorb the human impact third an effort is made or planned to use the ecosystem properties as a management tool several such tools were used and they varied from park to park according to the local conditions figure 12 a tanapa has no practical control on activities outside the parks and therefore there are limits to what it can achieve to save its national parks from the water crisis however we are grateful to the government of tanzania for its efforts to approve collaboration between tanapa and the national commission for land use to work with local communities adjacent to the national parks on the establishment of sustainable land use such governance issues involve protecting the water tower in the uplands ensuring environmental flows from dams removing illegal weirs and illegal water pumping regulating irrigation restoring degraded papyrus wetlands promoting sustainable cattle husbandry and controlling erosion figure 12b without this governance at the basin scale some parks will continue to degrade other parks such as serengeti and rubondo require multi national actions to be saved from degradation due to human activities outside tanzania these require cooperation

999,the concept of water security considers the availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality for human activities and ecosystem maintenance in a resilient stable politic and peaceful climate the cooperation and interaction between human activities and ecosystems has not been clearly understood which undermines the resilience of society and the environment against water related disasters thus we presented a theoretical approach of multistage risk management combining nature based solutions nbs multidimensional indices and raising awareness measures to increase water security our results show how this proposal can improve risk management decreasing economic global losses from natural hazards and increasing willingness to adapt and preparedness better than in some real cases analyzed here we concluded that the understanding of the relationship among water security elements can increase the resilience of cities and urban centers through the implementation of new tools such as nbs multidimensional indices and other novel non structural measures keywords multistage risk management natural disaster anthropological activities resilience ecohydrology 1 introduction water is essential for subsistence and productive human activities the agricultural industrial and residential sectors need large volumes of water joseph et al 2020 due to the increase in population growth and densification of cities iwa 2016 the tendency for this growth to continue in the coming years intensifies the pressure on finite water resources at the same time human intervention to satisfy the needs of a growing population has brought changes in land use cunha et al 2016 increasing impermeable areas with the growth of cities eliminating the native vegetation in favor of agricultural expansion fao 2011 and cattle farming which increases erosion and decreases water quality oliveira et al 2019 on one hand the water used by productive and domestic sectors does not receive the correct treatment and disposal returning to the environment and causing eutrophication of water bodies lakes and estuaries sinha et al 2017 álvarez et al 2017 affecting ecosystems and other downstream populations marinho et al 2020 these actions have consequences undermining water quality and it has aggravated water scarcity over time de lima lombardo magaña 2018 causing an increase in the demand for new alternative water sources inbar et al 2020 martinez alvarez et al 2020 r e et al 2020 on the other hand the search for new sources of water has led to conflicts between different users wei et al 2020 affecting more than 2 billion people only in the 21st century unep 2020 the conflicts and disputes on water use intensify in areas exposed to declining rainfall patterns associated with climate change flörke et al 2018 this scenario of scarcity is affecting productive activities in urban and agricultural landscapes and adverse impacts on ecosystems jeppesen et al 2015 due to this reduction of water surface sources water quality tends to deteriorate barbosa et al 2021 moreover changes in land use and land cover as well as its unsustainable exploitation have reduced and weakened ecosystem resilience in many countries swiss re institute 2020 naturally ecosystems and humans are exposed to natural hazards whether they are related to nature s cyclical processes products of human interventions themselves or other non stationary events salas and obeysekera 2014 events such as prolonged droughts due to rising air mass temperatures reduce the speed and stability of the hydrological cycle dynamics therefore water availability decreases jehanzaib and kim 2020 for human activities and provision of ecosystem services fao 2011 these non stationary events changes in land use population growing climate change etc that put water availability on checkmate are the same that put populations and economical activities at risk when facing intense precipitation events santos 2013 and water scarcity scenarios ward et al 2020 changes in land use have increased impermeable areas and with it have increased runoff volumes and peaks the growth of cities and the misuse of risk areas for residential use increase people s exposure to natural hazards waghwala and agnihotri 2019 individuals affected and estimated damage from water related disasters are very high and continue to increase as well as to other impacts such as urban heat waves carvalho et al 2017 the number of people at risk of flooding is expected to rise from 1 2 billion today to about 1 6 billion by 2050 almost 20 of the world s population and the economic value of assets at risk is about us 45 trillion by 2050 up 340 from 2010 oecd 2012 over the period 1995 to 2015 floods and droughts are estimated to have affected approximately 2 3 and 1 1 billion people representing us 662 billion and us 100 billion damage respectively wwap 2019 see illustrative pictures in the appendix b developing countries are more vulnerable to climate risks such as drought or flooding due to their greater economic dependence on climate sensitive primary activities and the infrastructure finances and other factors that hinder successful adaptation kunreuther et al 2014 brazil is a country where the risk of extreme events and economic losses is high between 1991 and 2012 droughts and floods accounted for 84 of the country s total natural disasters affecting about 127 million people in over 39 000 records in economic terms total losses are us 1 1 all values were calculated in brazilian reais and converted into us dollars at the ratio of 3 80 the average between 2018 and 2019 2 4 billion per year ana 2017 thus problems linked to water related disaster must be covered within the concept of water security un water 2013 to reduce the risks associated with hydrological hazards in cities and ecosystems by mitigation and adaptation actions as part of the resilience concept unep 2021 which aim to reduce the economic social and environmental losses associated with natural hazard even though the topic of water security is a multi faceted problem srinivasan konar and sivapalan 2017 it has been approached as a comparison of sanitation demands reis et al 2020 always increasing due to anthropological issues against resource availability in scarcity drought or abundance flood due to extreme events influenced or not by climate change population growth changes in land use or uncertain factors westerberg et al 2017 from the results of these comparisons it was possible to obtain the number of fragile areas that should be protected the possible future scarcity scenarios and the costs associated with economic losses from natural threats such as material losses from flooding in extreme precipitation events mohor hudson and thieken 2020 and agricultural losses from lack of water for irrigation unlike the traditional risk management that has one stage solution the multistage risk management guzman et al 2017 mohor and mendiondo 2017 tafarello et al 2018 is based on computing the damage and its economic and ecosystems losses in order to propose the adequate combination of adaptation or mitigation measures transference of the cost of the losses to third parties insurance policies and structural measurement that minimizes the impact of the hazard are examples of these adaptation and mitigation measures that could be mixed therefore the aim of this paper is to define this novel multistage risk management model that integrates nature based solution nbs multidimensional indices and insurance policies this theoretical approach uses the interactions among water security elements in a holistic vision to improve water security resilience for a better understanding we present this innovative approach in 5 sections this first section is a contextualization of the problem the second section shows the relationships of human activities and ecosystem maintenance in the traditional approach and presents a novel proposal using nbs insurance policy and multidimensional indices to improve water security resilience the third section discusses how resilience can be strengthened in the face of water related disasters using structural and non structural measures the fourth section presents two multidimensional indices on how to improve water security in the fifth section a novel multistage risk management proposal is presented considering hazard vulnerability and willingness to adapt by water related disaster in the last section conclusions about the relationships between the elements of water security and a novel approach of risk management using multistage analyses are presented 2 how the three main water security elements interact the concept of water security un water 2013 involves the use of adequate quantities of water in an acceptable quality for human activities such as livelihoods human well being and socio economic development and preserving the ecosystem in an environment of peace political stability and resilience against water disease and water related disasters the understanding of the interaction between water security elements explains how the cooperation and relationship between human activities and the maintenance of ecosystems works equally as the ecohydrology explains the dynamics of the catchment water and biota for the improvement and management of freshwater resources zalewski et al 1997 as a result it increases resilience and adaptation to natural hazards and avoids as much as possible their impacts in a climate of peace and political stability figure 1 shows all the elements involved in this dynamic where the gray boxes show the three elements of water security cited before i human activities ii ecosystem and iii environment resilient peace political stability and strong institutions are considered to be environmentally resilient usually human activities need natural resources for their execution in most cases the need for water is real or virtual for example there are multiple interfaces between water and food security and nutrition hlpe 2015 because in addition to water for agriculture water is needed for food processing and preparation as well as water to produce energy depending on the energy matrix of the country needed for the processes above of the 17 un sustainable development goals un sdgs established in the agenda 2030 by the un in 2015 un environment programmer 2020 the sdg 6 clean water and sanitation that states about sanitation and drinking water is a starting point for eight other goals sdg 2 zero hunger sdg 3 good health and well being sdg 7 affordable and clean energy sdg 8 decent work and economic growth sdg 9 industry innovation and infrastructure sdg 11 sustainable cities and communities sdg 13 climate action and sdg 15 life on land paul et al 2020 ecosystems provide services that preserve natural resources used for economic activities for example the hydrological cycle is an ecosystem service that maintains water in the environment which can be used as a resource for human demands such as domestic uses these activities need to be maintained with the minimum of variations because in this way the correct functioning of human activities can be ensured otherwise situations happen such as shortages in the supply of sanitation services as in the case of the cantareira water supply system in brazil that in 2014 2015 suffered from a drastic decrease in precipitation which compromised the water supply of more than 6 million people living in the metropolitan region of sao paulo rodrigues gupta and mendiondo 2014 mohor and mendiondo 2017 the flowchart s figure 1 shows two moments of interactions between the human activities and the water security cycle the first one with the lines in orange consists of the unsustainable approach in which there is no benefit for human activities to invest in ecosystem services in this scenario ecosystems preserve resources such as water without any kind of exchange or protection for themselves even so ecosystems in their natural condition provide services of mitigation to natural hazard however resilience comes from investments in grey infrastructure such as dams for flood control or water storage as it usually happens a convenient approach is not enough for future demand that could promote fragile peace and political instability especially among water users increasing in the transboundary water cooperation cases the second moment presents our new relationship between water security elements in a more supportive and sustainable approach with collaborative interactions and with a concept of sustainable development in this scenario human activities invest in nature based solution nbs which is converted into a low impact development lid ecosystem based adaptation eba ecosystem based disaster risk reduction eco drr and other nbs improving resilience by providing positive feedback loops contributing to ecosystem services bridgewater 2018 in addition multidimensional indices reinforce the use of nbs and awaked populations and governments to adapt and protect to non stationary events by the use of insurance policies alerts and other non structural measures all this concept cited before will be explained in the next sections using the flowchart of figure 1 an example of the interactions between the elements of water security is developed using the case of water consumption for residential use this human activity needs water as a raw material which can be provided only by the activities of the hydrological cycle whether obtaining surface or underground it is necessary to maintain the flow of matter and energy for which ecosystem services are indispensable paul et al 2020 but this maintenance of the hydrological cycle can be sustained as long as and when two situations do not occur excessive human intervention or exposure to threats of natural extreme events in these cases humans to protect themselves opt mainly for conventional structural measures such as dams to water storage which is not always the best economic solution in our second view of the relationships of the elements of water security which is intended to show better results in terms of increased resilience per dollar invested reguero et al 2020 part of the investments in structural measures will be directed to nbs for example ecosystem protection with water pes taffarello et al 2017 that consist of payment for environmental services pes directed to the protection of water resources or biodiversity or ecohydrological nbs that has as prerequisite recognized the relationships between biotic and hydrological processes izydorczyk et al 2019 in any case this kind of eba has the advantage that it can address many water security objectives for example in agriculture landscape eba can involve payment to landowners for reforestation of paddock areas and restoration and conservation of ecotone buffer zones between land and water zalewski et al 1997 which favors infiltration and groundwater recharge processes contributing to a more stable condition of river flows over time wei et al 2020 and reducing the leakage of nutrients and other agricultural contaminants into flow s river izydorczyk et al 2019 furthermore in the event of rainfall it reduces the intensity of runoff peaks addressing both flood related and drought related problems bremer et al 2020 in an urban area this kind of eba has already been implemented mendiondo 2008 e g the blue green network concept applied in the city of lodz poland was able to increase resilience against extreme storm events by increasing the stormwater retention capacity and also reducing concentrations of total nitrogen phosphorus and other contaminants zalewski et al 2012 3 increasing resilience of the water security in this section is identified the elements that contribute to increasing water security resilience they can be divided into two categories structural and non structural the first one can be divided into two groups one group is grey infrastructure as known as a traditional infrastructure of managing water it does not give a multiple benefit as other structural groups nwrm 2015 it includes robust infrastructure man made as the dams for flood control shrestha and kawasaki 2020 and water storage also include minor elements such as pipes channels sewer etc these elements are characterized by the rapid evacuation of rainwater tucci 2012 avoiding water retention capacity and restoration of more natural patterns of runoff and infiltration nwrm 2015 a second group is green infrastructure which is alternative systems to manage flood and drought risks and improve water quality mainly in urban basins fletcher et al 2013 they are also known with other nomenclatures such as low impact development lid sustainable urban drainage systems suds compensatory techniques ct stormwater control measures scm water sensitive urban design wsud souza 2008 mcclymont et al 2020 macedo et al 2021 in general these systems with compensatory technologies mimic natural processes of the water cycle to restore natural processes of infiltration evapotranspiration and pollutant removal improving the quality of the stormwater epa 2020 this infrastructure can be divided into source control such as rain barrels green roofs bioretention tanks vegetation grass swales and permeable pavements or centralized practices such as detention and retention basins penna et al 2019 also depending on the performance of the function and evolution the lid could be divided in first generation lid 1g second generation lid 2g and third generation lid 3g macedo et al 2021 being the latter as better prepared to perform resilience to non stationary events as climate and land use changes and integrate multiple sdg purposes despite the conceptual division of structural measures into gray and green infrastructure it is common to use hybrid systems in the practical application of these infrastructures hybrid systems combine the principles used in gray and green infrastructure such as hydraulic engineering ecohydrology and biological measures in the hybrid systems green infrastructures are generally designed for mitigation and adaptation to less intense and more recurrent storm events aiming at the combined purpose of runoff control and improving water quality due to its capacity to treat and purify stormwater in addition gray infrastructures such as large detention basins are used as a complementary mitigation measure for more extreme storm events and less recurrence with greater focus on the prevention and mitigation of critical floods reducing the probability of disruption of essential services significant economic losses and injuries to the population the application of the hybrid systems can be applied as a high reliability management alternative to be used in densely populated city zones that have low land availability and are at high vulnerability krauze and wagner 2019 as an example in the application of hybrid systems jurczak et al 2018 presented a case study for a hybrid system in which a sequential sedimentation and biofiltration system is used upstream of a gray infrastructure composed of a cascade of recreational and flood control reservoirs the use of this hybrid system allowed the reduction of total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads up to 72 and 66 respectively and 86 of total suspended solids in the first two years of operation reducing the risks of eutrophication of the urban rivers at the application site furthermore the green infrastructure of the hybrid system was able to amortize the flows from rainfall of up to 9mm on a different perspective kiedrzyńska et al 2017 have evaluated the use of hybrid systems as additional mitigation measures in wastewater treatment plants wwtp that have as a challenge the treatment of nutrients and emerging pollutants with persistent organic pollutants obtaining promising results in the application of these hybrid systems in wwtp as complementary treatment technology the second big category non structural measures can be divided into three groups the first one can be classified as institutional level measures veiga and magrini 2013 such as policies to strengthen the government institutions or to promote public private partnerships that could be used to improve the management of water control for the proper functioning of ecosystems economic activities within a resilient environment it is important to point out that these policies do not have a sustainability approach but more a legacy and management purpose a second kind of non structural measure focus in sustainability policies such as the ecological property taxes charged by municipalities that can consist of some subsidy on land or property that allows to control the volume of rainfall at the level of urban lots increasing permeable areas green roofs that slow down runoff or any other lid system or practice for small spaces epa 2018 these measures are top down management loucks and beek 2005 promoting the use of lid or any structural measures of this kind a third class of non structural measure consists in raising awareness about the risks and potential damages of flooding sarmento buarque et al 2020 and warning systems before extreme events for the protection of lives and material goods silva 2017 in addition the risk transfer could be part of this class because the risk awareness population will accept and pay to transfer the risk it consists when the risk owner who is exposed directly to the hazard transfers part of its risk through insurance reguero et al 2020 the use of insurance is based on providing compensation for economic losses due to the natural disaster marchal et al 2019 also the awareness population could pay for reinforcement adaptations and mitigation measures cited before in recent years the use of nature base solutions nbs unep 2021 to reduce risk and the impacts for people and ecosystems from non stationary events e g climate and land use change is growing this concept is defined as actions to protect sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively simultaneously providing human well being and biodiversity benefits iucn 2020 the use of nbs must be made considering the context of ecosystem approach by including in the urban environment technologies that can mimic nature processes such as abiotic biotic and biogeoclimatic regulation environmental and resources cycling and ecosystem maturity krauze and wagner 2019 by these processes the nbs can provide benefits that include climate adaptation climate mitigation disaster risk reduction food energy and water security reducing poverty and driving economic growth unep 2021 recently it has been discussed the importance of also considering social and cultural elements to build communities and societies that are socio ecological resilient bridgewater 2018 although the nbs have been increasingly used and incorporated in the international guidelines and in national and regional public policies it is important to highlight that the resilience contribution of the nbs will vary according to the current state of the anthropogenic pressure in the urban environment where they will be applied krauze and wagner 2019 in peri urban areas under low or intermediate stress the use of nbs will contribute to maintain system resilience along its development and in future scenarios however in places highly urbanized and with low land availability the nbs will help to enable nature and ecological processes with a mainly contribution in remediation and compensation other then increasing resilience krauze and wagner 2019 this clarity is important to not generate false expectations in the public managers and stakeholders leading to a lack of trust in these systems different types of actions and approaches can be integrated with the nbs with a special focus to ecohydrology and ecosystem based adaptation eba measures when regarding water related issues bridgewater 2018 these approaches aim to optimize or restore ecosystem services provided by nature more broadly defined as nature s contribution to people by diaz et al 2018 based on ecosystem management and ecological engineering actions taken by the population itself in order to contribute for the preservation of nature thus creating a positive feedback loop between nature and society bridgewater 2018 krauze and wagner 2019 the eba for example uses biodiversity and ecosystem service as adaptation strategy against climate change effects cbd 2009 helping people to reduce impact and damage of the increasing natural hazard pagiola von glehn and taffarello 2013 marengo et al 2015 taffarello et al 2017 ebas as an element of resilience can also be divided in structural eba activities on the ground when an action is materialized such as river restoration projects for biodiversity enhancement mendiondo 2008 which decreases the volume of surface runoff rainfall epa 2012 and the velocity of this runoff by favoring interception infiltration and the quality water and non structural eba enabling activities donatti et al 2020 when the measure does not have a quantifiable physical result this umbrella term nbs includes specific activities or approaches to particular areas for example the ecohydrology nbs lid or as another term that is used by this concept ecosystem based adaptation eba and ecosystem based disaster risk reduction eco drr agr2020 eba is focused to help people to adapt only to the effects of climate kabish et al 2017 different to the lid 3g that aim more objective as contribute to different un sdg and increase cities resilience against non stationary event macedo et al 2021 and when integrated hydrological processes with biota dynamics could be defined as ecohydrology nbs izydorczyk et al 2019 but both of them are entirely inside the concept of nbs on the other hand eco drr young et al 2019 is partially within the nbs because non climatic disaster risk e g earthquakes is included in eco drr unep 2021 for these reasons it will use the term nbs to refer to any of these concepts in this paper 4 multidimensional indices to improve risk perception any human activities like agriculture tourism mining can be registered by indicators e g gross domestic product gdp of a country m2 of cultivation m3 of mineral etc also they can be expressed in cubic meters of water incorporated in a product known as virtual water da silva et al 2016 besides that it could project the water consumption and abstraction and contrast with the availability scarcity and vulnerability of any region rodrigues et al 2015 the outcomes of these indicators can hardly be traced as a product of political decisions types of investments cooperation and partnerships between economic sectors and communities socio cultural behaviors etc there is a need to add holistic approaches considering social economic or political parameters in the indicators brelsford et al 2020 and link them to water resources management for the reasons given above the indices based on holistic approaches can be used not only to directly measure water security or to measure the resilience of the urban center but also to improve resilience in cities and communities thus the purpose is to use the indices of multiple dimensions in an interdisciplinary approach in economic political and social aspects and not necessarily of hydrological variables it is considered that these indices have more value for decision makers authorities users and other stakeholders involved in the management of water resources and for the water energy and food security nexus fao 2014 eiu 2019 4 1 blue peace index bpi the blue peace index bpi from the economist intelligence unit eiu 2019 is an index that measures the use of the water resource in sustainable equally and collaborative ways in cases of transboundary rivers where the resource has multiple uses and divergent interests wei et al 2020 as the river passes through several countries with an internationally shared basin the index allows the dimensions to be assessed at country and basin scales the index uses 74 qualitative and quantitative indicators in a holistic analysis of political and economic conditions see figure a 1 in the supplementary material geographic and hydrological indicators are excluded from the analysis since water security is treated as a management issue this index can be used to make decisions about investments in water security policies evaluating the best conditions to make investments when international donors are involved or to follow up on investments made by governments in this theme furthermore the index allows the identification of challenges and opportunities to improve cooperation and management of water resources such as legal frameworks for public private partnerships ppp among other advantages the index is based on encouraging policies on water use it strengthens institutions in charging for water use and above all it deals with the conflict between stakeholders in the dilemma protecting ecosystems and resources or exploring the potential of water and its surroundings moreover it can serve to initiate alliances with a common goal among communities and the continuous participation of the population and communication among citizen leaders thus avoiding resource depletion which can create conflicts since the index is intended to avoid any kind of conflict when some of its values sustainable equally and collaborative are absent on the other hand it presents limitations as its nature as an indicator being a simple representation of the reality of a static moment and disregarding other relationships that are not governmental competencies because even though it facilitates the participation of the communities these are not considered in the analysis its nature is for follow ups and evaluation of long term results because in the short term it can generate conflicts of interest between use and preservation of the resource eiu 2019 finally generating or obtaining the information that feeds the index is difficult or in some cases not available this constraint can be observed even in transboundary rivers that provide 60 of the clean water available for their consumption by 40 of the world s population eiu 2019 4 2 biodiversity and ecosystem services index besi another index that can describe the resilience of human activities and ecosystem functioning is the biodiversity and ecosystem services index besi it is developed by the swiss re institute sri and shows the state of ecosystems on a global level as well as a broader worldwide view at a resolution of 1 km² areas with fragile or intact ecosystems can be identified with five states intermediate between these extremes swiss re institute 2020 the index considers ten biodiversity and ecosystem services bes see figure a 2 in the supplementary material zalewski 2021 points how ecosystem biotechnologies for the enhancement of ecohydrological potential of the catchments are needed through the water biodiversity ecosystem services resilience culture and education nexus wbesrce the index represents the close relationship between ecosystems and human activities for example according to this index indonesia a developing country with large agricultural activity has 80 of its gdp depending on bes besides that it has 43 share of intact ecosystems in besi and 3 share of fragile ecosystems in besi elucidating its ability to provide the ecosystem services needed to maintain its economic activities sri 2013 an opposite example is india which has 70 gdp dependency on besi presenting a 28 share of fragile ecosystems the index can guide the decision making of governments and other sectors to secure their productive activities by investing in ecosystems and biodiversity 5 risk management approach composed of multistage quadrants a novel risk management approach is introduced in this paper to integrate nature based solution nbs insurance and multidimensional indices to improve urban centers and ecosystem resilience this novel risk management approach is shown in figure 2 the quadrant i upper right is the hazard vulnerability quadrant it relates the intensity and frequency of an event hazard represented by the variable return period rp of a storm or drought event and the possible damages to the study area vulnerability represented by the variable economic losses per area ela in us per area commercial area crop area km2 ha etc two different relations are presented the first one represented by the solid line in quadrant i consider only the hazard and vulnerability for the current scenario and assume stationarity for future scenarios the second one represented by the dashed line in quadrant i represent the changes in the hazard and vulnerability relations e g increase in economic losses considering future non stationary effects such as climate change population growth land use and land cover changes or other sources of uncertainty the quadrant ii upper left is the vulnerability exposure which relates the insurance coverage area ica or insurance coverage ratio icr and the economic losses per area ela in this case the solid line is the usual protection without considering sustainability infrastructure or any adaptation based on ecosystem or biodiversity such as grey infrastructure the dashed line represents the case when nature based solution nbs is used to reduce the vulnerability of urban centers and ecosystems we can observe that quadrants i and ii have communication among them the same event e g an extreme rain event rp 100 years has more economic losses in a non stationary approach than in a stationary one although when nbs is used the coverage area is reduced compared to a regular case in this condition it became a safe environment to the insurance buyer since less area needs protection in the iii lower left and iv quadrants lower right multidimensional indices and non structural measures are used as a tool to inform the population and governments about investing in sustainable solutions to adapt and mitigate extreme events increasing the resilience of the urban centers in the iii quadrant the individual risk perception is represented e g person family owner of a store smaller farmer small community etc the quadrant relates the ica or icr to the willingness to pay wtp or willingness to adapt wta 2 2 in this paper we use wta as willingness to adapt to climate events and non as willingness to accept compensation wta as it is used in some economic literature in us this concept consists of the maximum monetary amount that a stakeholder would pay to adapt mitigate or prepare against a climate hazard brown and gregory 1999 in this case the solid line represents the use of non structural structures with low impact as institutional level measures and poor sustainability policies the dashed line indicates the use of multidimensional indices and non structural measures that raise awareness about the risks making bottom up processing loucks and beek 2005 shift the position of the solid curves first moment to the dashed lines second moment in this way a certain percentage of area with insurance coverage will have more willingness from the population to adapt against extreme events when these indices are measured reported and informed together with the other non structural measures a similar situation happens in the iv quadrant it represents the government and group perception of risk in this quadrant is related the rp of an event and the wtp or wta in a political context such as watersheds states nations or economic blocks in this case the measurement reporter and informer of multidimensional indices such as bpi and besi impacts larger groups of people that makes top down processing loucks and beek 2005 and guides political decisions to improve resilience when it occurs the position of the solid curves first moment shift to the dashed lines second moment similarly to quadrants i and ii quadrants iii and iv have a communication among them the ica has more economical resources to adapt for shorter rp when multidimensional indices and raising awareness measures are applied than when they are not finally a complete counterclockwise relationship can be made starting in the i quadrant an extreme event will register more losses per area when considering non stationary events points a to a even so in the ii quadrant less area is impacted when nbs is used than only using a grey infrastructure points b to b as the economic losses per area are constant the total losses are reduced by climate disaster in iii quadrant the ica or icr will have more economic source points c to and c due information provided by non structure measures and indices such as besi and bpi to improve willing population to adapt the last quadrant shows a better adaptation for extreme events points d and d given in a political context by the use of multidimensionality that result in a more economic resource for adaptation to climate hazards also information by multidimensional indices could measure political stability and peace in table 1 it is shown four examples of how could be applied to the novel risk management proposed using hazards such as drought and urban and local floods that impact many risk aversion sectors or economic activities it shows that in any case at least one quadrant is incomplete because it was not considered in the approach it remains for future work and discussion the range of rp and coverage areas when it is necessary the traditional infrastructure insurance policy nbs or hybrid solutions in order to design a diversified portfolio of resilience elements based on this relationship adjustments can be made to figure 2 to improve the resilient environment in anycase it can be considered an amplification of chance to achieve successful implementation zalewski et al 1997 additionally an economic financial analysis de risi et al 2018 could be applied into a portfolio to find a better combination of elements looking for economic returns the proper equation of these structural and non structural measures aims to achieve the highest degree of water security at the lowest possible cost considering the interactions and use of spaces or areas between human activities and the functioning of ecosystems complementing and accepting their limitations sarmento et al 2020 6 conclusion studying and detailing the relationships among water security elements can better explain their interaction and cooperation in favor of local or regional levels of resilience individualistic relationships in which human activities do not invest in ecosystem services tend to weaken natural resources and ecosystems decreasing the maintenance of energy and mass and increasing the exposure to cities and other productive centers to water insecurity investments in nbs as ebas lid and other ecosystem services increase resilience by enhancing the protection of human life and material goods as well as protecting ecosystems from natural hazards in addition human activities can maintain their natural resources for consumption in a sustainable way complex issues such as resilience within the context of water security must be analyzed with a holistic view considering the various dimensions and interrelationships involved in the use of multidimensional indices as bpi and bise these indices together with raising awareness measures could generate a population most prepared to pay and adapt to non stationary events also the indices could improve cooperation between water users with better management and reduce competition over physical resources stimulating a peaceful climate the risk management framework presented here in a four quadrant graph shows how the relationship between water security elements could be stronger when resilience elements such as nbs multidimensional indices and raising awareness measures are used declaration of competing interest

999,the concept of water security considers the availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality for human activities and ecosystem maintenance in a resilient stable politic and peaceful climate the cooperation and interaction between human activities and ecosystems has not been clearly understood which undermines the resilience of society and the environment against water related disasters thus we presented a theoretical approach of multistage risk management combining nature based solutions nbs multidimensional indices and raising awareness measures to increase water security our results show how this proposal can improve risk management decreasing economic global losses from natural hazards and increasing willingness to adapt and preparedness better than in some real cases analyzed here we concluded that the understanding of the relationship among water security elements can increase the resilience of cities and urban centers through the implementation of new tools such as nbs multidimensional indices and other novel non structural measures keywords multistage risk management natural disaster anthropological activities resilience ecohydrology 1 introduction water is essential for subsistence and productive human activities the agricultural industrial and residential sectors need large volumes of water joseph et al 2020 due to the increase in population growth and densification of cities iwa 2016 the tendency for this growth to continue in the coming years intensifies the pressure on finite water resources at the same time human intervention to satisfy the needs of a growing population has brought changes in land use cunha et al 2016 increasing impermeable areas with the growth of cities eliminating the native vegetation in favor of agricultural expansion fao 2011 and cattle farming which increases erosion and decreases water quality oliveira et al 2019 on one hand the water used by productive and domestic sectors does not receive the correct treatment and disposal returning to the environment and causing eutrophication of water bodies lakes and estuaries sinha et al 2017 álvarez et al 2017 affecting ecosystems and other downstream populations marinho et al 2020 these actions have consequences undermining water quality and it has aggravated water scarcity over time de lima lombardo magaña 2018 causing an increase in the demand for new alternative water sources inbar et al 2020 martinez alvarez et al 2020 r e et al 2020 on the other hand the search for new sources of water has led to conflicts between different users wei et al 2020 affecting more than 2 billion people only in the 21st century unep 2020 the conflicts and disputes on water use intensify in areas exposed to declining rainfall patterns associated with climate change flörke et al 2018 this scenario of scarcity is affecting productive activities in urban and agricultural landscapes and adverse impacts on ecosystems jeppesen et al 2015 due to this reduction of water surface sources water quality tends to deteriorate barbosa et al 2021 moreover changes in land use and land cover as well as its unsustainable exploitation have reduced and weakened ecosystem resilience in many countries swiss re institute 2020 naturally ecosystems and humans are exposed to natural hazards whether they are related to nature s cyclical processes products of human interventions themselves or other non stationary events salas and obeysekera 2014 events such as prolonged droughts due to rising air mass temperatures reduce the speed and stability of the hydrological cycle dynamics therefore water availability decreases jehanzaib and kim 2020 for human activities and provision of ecosystem services fao 2011 these non stationary events changes in land use population growing climate change etc that put water availability on checkmate are the same that put populations and economical activities at risk when facing intense precipitation events santos 2013 and water scarcity scenarios ward et al 2020 changes in land use have increased impermeable areas and with it have increased runoff volumes and peaks the growth of cities and the misuse of risk areas for residential use increase people s exposure to natural hazards waghwala and agnihotri 2019 individuals affected and estimated damage from water related disasters are very high and continue to increase as well as to other impacts such as urban heat waves carvalho et al 2017 the number of people at risk of flooding is expected to rise from 1 2 billion today to about 1 6 billion by 2050 almost 20 of the world s population and the economic value of assets at risk is about us 45 trillion by 2050 up 340 from 2010 oecd 2012 over the period 1995 to 2015 floods and droughts are estimated to have affected approximately 2 3 and 1 1 billion people representing us 662 billion and us 100 billion damage respectively wwap 2019 see illustrative pictures in the appendix b developing countries are more vulnerable to climate risks such as drought or flooding due to their greater economic dependence on climate sensitive primary activities and the infrastructure finances and other factors that hinder successful adaptation kunreuther et al 2014 brazil is a country where the risk of extreme events and economic losses is high between 1991 and 2012 droughts and floods accounted for 84 of the country s total natural disasters affecting about 127 million people in over 39 000 records in economic terms total losses are us 1 1 all values were calculated in brazilian reais and converted into us dollars at the ratio of 3 80 the average between 2018 and 2019 2 4 billion per year ana 2017 thus problems linked to water related disaster must be covered within the concept of water security un water 2013 to reduce the risks associated with hydrological hazards in cities and ecosystems by mitigation and adaptation actions as part of the resilience concept unep 2021 which aim to reduce the economic social and environmental losses associated with natural hazard even though the topic of water security is a multi faceted problem srinivasan konar and sivapalan 2017 it has been approached as a comparison of sanitation demands reis et al 2020 always increasing due to anthropological issues against resource availability in scarcity drought or abundance flood due to extreme events influenced or not by climate change population growth changes in land use or uncertain factors westerberg et al 2017 from the results of these comparisons it was possible to obtain the number of fragile areas that should be protected the possible future scarcity scenarios and the costs associated with economic losses from natural threats such as material losses from flooding in extreme precipitation events mohor hudson and thieken 2020 and agricultural losses from lack of water for irrigation unlike the traditional risk management that has one stage solution the multistage risk management guzman et al 2017 mohor and mendiondo 2017 tafarello et al 2018 is based on computing the damage and its economic and ecosystems losses in order to propose the adequate combination of adaptation or mitigation measures transference of the cost of the losses to third parties insurance policies and structural measurement that minimizes the impact of the hazard are examples of these adaptation and mitigation measures that could be mixed therefore the aim of this paper is to define this novel multistage risk management model that integrates nature based solution nbs multidimensional indices and insurance policies this theoretical approach uses the interactions among water security elements in a holistic vision to improve water security resilience for a better understanding we present this innovative approach in 5 sections this first section is a contextualization of the problem the second section shows the relationships of human activities and ecosystem maintenance in the traditional approach and presents a novel proposal using nbs insurance policy and multidimensional indices to improve water security resilience the third section discusses how resilience can be strengthened in the face of water related disasters using structural and non structural measures the fourth section presents two multidimensional indices on how to improve water security in the fifth section a novel multistage risk management proposal is presented considering hazard vulnerability and willingness to adapt by water related disaster in the last section conclusions about the relationships between the elements of water security and a novel approach of risk management using multistage analyses are presented 2 how the three main water security elements interact the concept of water security un water 2013 involves the use of adequate quantities of water in an acceptable quality for human activities such as livelihoods human well being and socio economic development and preserving the ecosystem in an environment of peace political stability and resilience against water disease and water related disasters the understanding of the interaction between water security elements explains how the cooperation and relationship between human activities and the maintenance of ecosystems works equally as the ecohydrology explains the dynamics of the catchment water and biota for the improvement and management of freshwater resources zalewski et al 1997 as a result it increases resilience and adaptation to natural hazards and avoids as much as possible their impacts in a climate of peace and political stability figure 1 shows all the elements involved in this dynamic where the gray boxes show the three elements of water security cited before i human activities ii ecosystem and iii environment resilient peace political stability and strong institutions are considered to be environmentally resilient usually human activities need natural resources for their execution in most cases the need for water is real or virtual for example there are multiple interfaces between water and food security and nutrition hlpe 2015 because in addition to water for agriculture water is needed for food processing and preparation as well as water to produce energy depending on the energy matrix of the country needed for the processes above of the 17 un sustainable development goals un sdgs established in the agenda 2030 by the un in 2015 un environment programmer 2020 the sdg 6 clean water and sanitation that states about sanitation and drinking water is a starting point for eight other goals sdg 2 zero hunger sdg 3 good health and well being sdg 7 affordable and clean energy sdg 8 decent work and economic growth sdg 9 industry innovation and infrastructure sdg 11 sustainable cities and communities sdg 13 climate action and sdg 15 life on land paul et al 2020 ecosystems provide services that preserve natural resources used for economic activities for example the hydrological cycle is an ecosystem service that maintains water in the environment which can be used as a resource for human demands such as domestic uses these activities need to be maintained with the minimum of variations because in this way the correct functioning of human activities can be ensured otherwise situations happen such as shortages in the supply of sanitation services as in the case of the cantareira water supply system in brazil that in 2014 2015 suffered from a drastic decrease in precipitation which compromised the water supply of more than 6 million people living in the metropolitan region of sao paulo rodrigues gupta and mendiondo 2014 mohor and mendiondo 2017 the flowchart s figure 1 shows two moments of interactions between the human activities and the water security cycle the first one with the lines in orange consists of the unsustainable approach in which there is no benefit for human activities to invest in ecosystem services in this scenario ecosystems preserve resources such as water without any kind of exchange or protection for themselves even so ecosystems in their natural condition provide services of mitigation to natural hazard however resilience comes from investments in grey infrastructure such as dams for flood control or water storage as it usually happens a convenient approach is not enough for future demand that could promote fragile peace and political instability especially among water users increasing in the transboundary water cooperation cases the second moment presents our new relationship between water security elements in a more supportive and sustainable approach with collaborative interactions and with a concept of sustainable development in this scenario human activities invest in nature based solution nbs which is converted into a low impact development lid ecosystem based adaptation eba ecosystem based disaster risk reduction eco drr and other nbs improving resilience by providing positive feedback loops contributing to ecosystem services bridgewater 2018 in addition multidimensional indices reinforce the use of nbs and awaked populations and governments to adapt and protect to non stationary events by the use of insurance policies alerts and other non structural measures all this concept cited before will be explained in the next sections using the flowchart of figure 1 an example of the interactions between the elements of water security is developed using the case of water consumption for residential use this human activity needs water as a raw material which can be provided only by the activities of the hydrological cycle whether obtaining surface or underground it is necessary to maintain the flow of matter and energy for which ecosystem services are indispensable paul et al 2020 but this maintenance of the hydrological cycle can be sustained as long as and when two situations do not occur excessive human intervention or exposure to threats of natural extreme events in these cases humans to protect themselves opt mainly for conventional structural measures such as dams to water storage which is not always the best economic solution in our second view of the relationships of the elements of water security which is intended to show better results in terms of increased resilience per dollar invested reguero et al 2020 part of the investments in structural measures will be directed to nbs for example ecosystem protection with water pes taffarello et al 2017 that consist of payment for environmental services pes directed to the protection of water resources or biodiversity or ecohydrological nbs that has as prerequisite recognized the relationships between biotic and hydrological processes izydorczyk et al 2019 in any case this kind of eba has the advantage that it can address many water security objectives for example in agriculture landscape eba can involve payment to landowners for reforestation of paddock areas and restoration and conservation of ecotone buffer zones between land and water zalewski et al 1997 which favors infiltration and groundwater recharge processes contributing to a more stable condition of river flows over time wei et al 2020 and reducing the leakage of nutrients and other agricultural contaminants into flow s river izydorczyk et al 2019 furthermore in the event of rainfall it reduces the intensity of runoff peaks addressing both flood related and drought related problems bremer et al 2020 in an urban area this kind of eba has already been implemented mendiondo 2008 e g the blue green network concept applied in the city of lodz poland was able to increase resilience against extreme storm events by increasing the stormwater retention capacity and also reducing concentrations of total nitrogen phosphorus and other contaminants zalewski et al 2012 3 increasing resilience of the water security in this section is identified the elements that contribute to increasing water security resilience they can be divided into two categories structural and non structural the first one can be divided into two groups one group is grey infrastructure as known as a traditional infrastructure of managing water it does not give a multiple benefit as other structural groups nwrm 2015 it includes robust infrastructure man made as the dams for flood control shrestha and kawasaki 2020 and water storage also include minor elements such as pipes channels sewer etc these elements are characterized by the rapid evacuation of rainwater tucci 2012 avoiding water retention capacity and restoration of more natural patterns of runoff and infiltration nwrm 2015 a second group is green infrastructure which is alternative systems to manage flood and drought risks and improve water quality mainly in urban basins fletcher et al 2013 they are also known with other nomenclatures such as low impact development lid sustainable urban drainage systems suds compensatory techniques ct stormwater control measures scm water sensitive urban design wsud souza 2008 mcclymont et al 2020 macedo et al 2021 in general these systems with compensatory technologies mimic natural processes of the water cycle to restore natural processes of infiltration evapotranspiration and pollutant removal improving the quality of the stormwater epa 2020 this infrastructure can be divided into source control such as rain barrels green roofs bioretention tanks vegetation grass swales and permeable pavements or centralized practices such as detention and retention basins penna et al 2019 also depending on the performance of the function and evolution the lid could be divided in first generation lid 1g second generation lid 2g and third generation lid 3g macedo et al 2021 being the latter as better prepared to perform resilience to non stationary events as climate and land use changes and integrate multiple sdg purposes despite the conceptual division of structural measures into gray and green infrastructure it is common to use hybrid systems in the practical application of these infrastructures hybrid systems combine the principles used in gray and green infrastructure such as hydraulic engineering ecohydrology and biological measures in the hybrid systems green infrastructures are generally designed for mitigation and adaptation to less intense and more recurrent storm events aiming at the combined purpose of runoff control and improving water quality due to its capacity to treat and purify stormwater in addition gray infrastructures such as large detention basins are used as a complementary mitigation measure for more extreme storm events and less recurrence with greater focus on the prevention and mitigation of critical floods reducing the probability of disruption of essential services significant economic losses and injuries to the population the application of the hybrid systems can be applied as a high reliability management alternative to be used in densely populated city zones that have low land availability and are at high vulnerability krauze and wagner 2019 as an example in the application of hybrid systems jurczak et al 2018 presented a case study for a hybrid system in which a sequential sedimentation and biofiltration system is used upstream of a gray infrastructure composed of a cascade of recreational and flood control reservoirs the use of this hybrid system allowed the reduction of total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads up to 72 and 66 respectively and 86 of total suspended solids in the first two years of operation reducing the risks of eutrophication of the urban rivers at the application site furthermore the green infrastructure of the hybrid system was able to amortize the flows from rainfall of up to 9mm on a different perspective kiedrzyńska et al 2017 have evaluated the use of hybrid systems as additional mitigation measures in wastewater treatment plants wwtp that have as a challenge the treatment of nutrients and emerging pollutants with persistent organic pollutants obtaining promising results in the application of these hybrid systems in wwtp as complementary treatment technology the second big category non structural measures can be divided into three groups the first one can be classified as institutional level measures veiga and magrini 2013 such as policies to strengthen the government institutions or to promote public private partnerships that could be used to improve the management of water control for the proper functioning of ecosystems economic activities within a resilient environment it is important to point out that these policies do not have a sustainability approach but more a legacy and management purpose a second kind of non structural measure focus in sustainability policies such as the ecological property taxes charged by municipalities that can consist of some subsidy on land or property that allows to control the volume of rainfall at the level of urban lots increasing permeable areas green roofs that slow down runoff or any other lid system or practice for small spaces epa 2018 these measures are top down management loucks and beek 2005 promoting the use of lid or any structural measures of this kind a third class of non structural measure consists in raising awareness about the risks and potential damages of flooding sarmento buarque et al 2020 and warning systems before extreme events for the protection of lives and material goods silva 2017 in addition the risk transfer could be part of this class because the risk awareness population will accept and pay to transfer the risk it consists when the risk owner who is exposed directly to the hazard transfers part of its risk through insurance reguero et al 2020 the use of insurance is based on providing compensation for economic losses due to the natural disaster marchal et al 2019 also the awareness population could pay for reinforcement adaptations and mitigation measures cited before in recent years the use of nature base solutions nbs unep 2021 to reduce risk and the impacts for people and ecosystems from non stationary events e g climate and land use change is growing this concept is defined as actions to protect sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively simultaneously providing human well being and biodiversity benefits iucn 2020 the use of nbs must be made considering the context of ecosystem approach by including in the urban environment technologies that can mimic nature processes such as abiotic biotic and biogeoclimatic regulation environmental and resources cycling and ecosystem maturity krauze and wagner 2019 by these processes the nbs can provide benefits that include climate adaptation climate mitigation disaster risk reduction food energy and water security reducing poverty and driving economic growth unep 2021 recently it has been discussed the importance of also considering social and cultural elements to build communities and societies that are socio ecological resilient bridgewater 2018 although the nbs have been increasingly used and incorporated in the international guidelines and in national and regional public policies it is important to highlight that the resilience contribution of the nbs will vary according to the current state of the anthropogenic pressure in the urban environment where they will be applied krauze and wagner 2019 in peri urban areas under low or intermediate stress the use of nbs will contribute to maintain system resilience along its development and in future scenarios however in places highly urbanized and with low land availability the nbs will help to enable nature and ecological processes with a mainly contribution in remediation and compensation other then increasing resilience krauze and wagner 2019 this clarity is important to not generate false expectations in the public managers and stakeholders leading to a lack of trust in these systems different types of actions and approaches can be integrated with the nbs with a special focus to ecohydrology and ecosystem based adaptation eba measures when regarding water related issues bridgewater 2018 these approaches aim to optimize or restore ecosystem services provided by nature more broadly defined as nature s contribution to people by diaz et al 2018 based on ecosystem management and ecological engineering actions taken by the population itself in order to contribute for the preservation of nature thus creating a positive feedback loop between nature and society bridgewater 2018 krauze and wagner 2019 the eba for example uses biodiversity and ecosystem service as adaptation strategy against climate change effects cbd 2009 helping people to reduce impact and damage of the increasing natural hazard pagiola von glehn and taffarello 2013 marengo et al 2015 taffarello et al 2017 ebas as an element of resilience can also be divided in structural eba activities on the ground when an action is materialized such as river restoration projects for biodiversity enhancement mendiondo 2008 which decreases the volume of surface runoff rainfall epa 2012 and the velocity of this runoff by favoring interception infiltration and the quality water and non structural eba enabling activities donatti et al 2020 when the measure does not have a quantifiable physical result this umbrella term nbs includes specific activities or approaches to particular areas for example the ecohydrology nbs lid or as another term that is used by this concept ecosystem based adaptation eba and ecosystem based disaster risk reduction eco drr agr2020 eba is focused to help people to adapt only to the effects of climate kabish et al 2017 different to the lid 3g that aim more objective as contribute to different un sdg and increase cities resilience against non stationary event macedo et al 2021 and when integrated hydrological processes with biota dynamics could be defined as ecohydrology nbs izydorczyk et al 2019 but both of them are entirely inside the concept of nbs on the other hand eco drr young et al 2019 is partially within the nbs because non climatic disaster risk e g earthquakes is included in eco drr unep 2021 for these reasons it will use the term nbs to refer to any of these concepts in this paper 4 multidimensional indices to improve risk perception any human activities like agriculture tourism mining can be registered by indicators e g gross domestic product gdp of a country m2 of cultivation m3 of mineral etc also they can be expressed in cubic meters of water incorporated in a product known as virtual water da silva et al 2016 besides that it could project the water consumption and abstraction and contrast with the availability scarcity and vulnerability of any region rodrigues et al 2015 the outcomes of these indicators can hardly be traced as a product of political decisions types of investments cooperation and partnerships between economic sectors and communities socio cultural behaviors etc there is a need to add holistic approaches considering social economic or political parameters in the indicators brelsford et al 2020 and link them to water resources management for the reasons given above the indices based on holistic approaches can be used not only to directly measure water security or to measure the resilience of the urban center but also to improve resilience in cities and communities thus the purpose is to use the indices of multiple dimensions in an interdisciplinary approach in economic political and social aspects and not necessarily of hydrological variables it is considered that these indices have more value for decision makers authorities users and other stakeholders involved in the management of water resources and for the water energy and food security nexus fao 2014 eiu 2019 4 1 blue peace index bpi the blue peace index bpi from the economist intelligence unit eiu 2019 is an index that measures the use of the water resource in sustainable equally and collaborative ways in cases of transboundary rivers where the resource has multiple uses and divergent interests wei et al 2020 as the river passes through several countries with an internationally shared basin the index allows the dimensions to be assessed at country and basin scales the index uses 74 qualitative and quantitative indicators in a holistic analysis of political and economic conditions see figure a 1 in the supplementary material geographic and hydrological indicators are excluded from the analysis since water security is treated as a management issue this index can be used to make decisions about investments in water security policies evaluating the best conditions to make investments when international donors are involved or to follow up on investments made by governments in this theme furthermore the index allows the identification of challenges and opportunities to improve cooperation and management of water resources such as legal frameworks for public private partnerships ppp among other advantages the index is based on encouraging policies on water use it strengthens institutions in charging for water use and above all it deals with the conflict between stakeholders in the dilemma protecting ecosystems and resources or exploring the potential of water and its surroundings moreover it can serve to initiate alliances with a common goal among communities and the continuous participation of the population and communication among citizen leaders thus avoiding resource depletion which can create conflicts since the index is intended to avoid any kind of conflict when some of its values sustainable equally and collaborative are absent on the other hand it presents limitations as its nature as an indicator being a simple representation of the reality of a static moment and disregarding other relationships that are not governmental competencies because even though it facilitates the participation of the communities these are not considered in the analysis its nature is for follow ups and evaluation of long term results because in the short term it can generate conflicts of interest between use and preservation of the resource eiu 2019 finally generating or obtaining the information that feeds the index is difficult or in some cases not available this constraint can be observed even in transboundary rivers that provide 60 of the clean water available for their consumption by 40 of the world s population eiu 2019 4 2 biodiversity and ecosystem services index besi another index that can describe the resilience of human activities and ecosystem functioning is the biodiversity and ecosystem services index besi it is developed by the swiss re institute sri and shows the state of ecosystems on a global level as well as a broader worldwide view at a resolution of 1 km² areas with fragile or intact ecosystems can be identified with five states intermediate between these extremes swiss re institute 2020 the index considers ten biodiversity and ecosystem services bes see figure a 2 in the supplementary material zalewski 2021 points how ecosystem biotechnologies for the enhancement of ecohydrological potential of the catchments are needed through the water biodiversity ecosystem services resilience culture and education nexus wbesrce the index represents the close relationship between ecosystems and human activities for example according to this index indonesia a developing country with large agricultural activity has 80 of its gdp depending on bes besides that it has 43 share of intact ecosystems in besi and 3 share of fragile ecosystems in besi elucidating its ability to provide the ecosystem services needed to maintain its economic activities sri 2013 an opposite example is india which has 70 gdp dependency on besi presenting a 28 share of fragile ecosystems the index can guide the decision making of governments and other sectors to secure their productive activities by investing in ecosystems and biodiversity 5 risk management approach composed of multistage quadrants a novel risk management approach is introduced in this paper to integrate nature based solution nbs insurance and multidimensional indices to improve urban centers and ecosystem resilience this novel risk management approach is shown in figure 2 the quadrant i upper right is the hazard vulnerability quadrant it relates the intensity and frequency of an event hazard represented by the variable return period rp of a storm or drought event and the possible damages to the study area vulnerability represented by the variable economic losses per area ela in us per area commercial area crop area km2 ha etc two different relations are presented the first one represented by the solid line in quadrant i consider only the hazard and vulnerability for the current scenario and assume stationarity for future scenarios the second one represented by the dashed line in quadrant i represent the changes in the hazard and vulnerability relations e g increase in economic losses considering future non stationary effects such as climate change population growth land use and land cover changes or other sources of uncertainty the quadrant ii upper left is the vulnerability exposure which relates the insurance coverage area ica or insurance coverage ratio icr and the economic losses per area ela in this case the solid line is the usual protection without considering sustainability infrastructure or any adaptation based on ecosystem or biodiversity such as grey infrastructure the dashed line represents the case when nature based solution nbs is used to reduce the vulnerability of urban centers and ecosystems we can observe that quadrants i and ii have communication among them the same event e g an extreme rain event rp 100 years has more economic losses in a non stationary approach than in a stationary one although when nbs is used the coverage area is reduced compared to a regular case in this condition it became a safe environment to the insurance buyer since less area needs protection in the iii lower left and iv quadrants lower right multidimensional indices and non structural measures are used as a tool to inform the population and governments about investing in sustainable solutions to adapt and mitigate extreme events increasing the resilience of the urban centers in the iii quadrant the individual risk perception is represented e g person family owner of a store smaller farmer small community etc the quadrant relates the ica or icr to the willingness to pay wtp or willingness to adapt wta 2 2 in this paper we use wta as willingness to adapt to climate events and non as willingness to accept compensation wta as it is used in some economic literature in us this concept consists of the maximum monetary amount that a stakeholder would pay to adapt mitigate or prepare against a climate hazard brown and gregory 1999 in this case the solid line represents the use of non structural structures with low impact as institutional level measures and poor sustainability policies the dashed line indicates the use of multidimensional indices and non structural measures that raise awareness about the risks making bottom up processing loucks and beek 2005 shift the position of the solid curves first moment to the dashed lines second moment in this way a certain percentage of area with insurance coverage will have more willingness from the population to adapt against extreme events when these indices are measured reported and informed together with the other non structural measures a similar situation happens in the iv quadrant it represents the government and group perception of risk in this quadrant is related the rp of an event and the wtp or wta in a political context such as watersheds states nations or economic blocks in this case the measurement reporter and informer of multidimensional indices such as bpi and besi impacts larger groups of people that makes top down processing loucks and beek 2005 and guides political decisions to improve resilience when it occurs the position of the solid curves first moment shift to the dashed lines second moment similarly to quadrants i and ii quadrants iii and iv have a communication among them the ica has more economical resources to adapt for shorter rp when multidimensional indices and raising awareness measures are applied than when they are not finally a complete counterclockwise relationship can be made starting in the i quadrant an extreme event will register more losses per area when considering non stationary events points a to a even so in the ii quadrant less area is impacted when nbs is used than only using a grey infrastructure points b to b as the economic losses per area are constant the total losses are reduced by climate disaster in iii quadrant the ica or icr will have more economic source points c to and c due information provided by non structure measures and indices such as besi and bpi to improve willing population to adapt the last quadrant shows a better adaptation for extreme events points d and d given in a political context by the use of multidimensionality that result in a more economic resource for adaptation to climate hazards also information by multidimensional indices could measure political stability and peace in table 1 it is shown four examples of how could be applied to the novel risk management proposed using hazards such as drought and urban and local floods that impact many risk aversion sectors or economic activities it shows that in any case at least one quadrant is incomplete because it was not considered in the approach it remains for future work and discussion the range of rp and coverage areas when it is necessary the traditional infrastructure insurance policy nbs or hybrid solutions in order to design a diversified portfolio of resilience elements based on this relationship adjustments can be made to figure 2 to improve the resilient environment in anycase it can be considered an amplification of chance to achieve successful implementation zalewski et al 1997 additionally an economic financial analysis de risi et al 2018 could be applied into a portfolio to find a better combination of elements looking for economic returns the proper equation of these structural and non structural measures aims to achieve the highest degree of water security at the lowest possible cost considering the interactions and use of spaces or areas between human activities and the functioning of ecosystems complementing and accepting their limitations sarmento et al 2020 6 conclusion studying and detailing the relationships among water security elements can better explain their interaction and cooperation in favor of local or regional levels of resilience individualistic relationships in which human activities do not invest in ecosystem services tend to weaken natural resources and ecosystems decreasing the maintenance of energy and mass and increasing the exposure to cities and other productive centers to water insecurity investments in nbs as ebas lid and other ecosystem services increase resilience by enhancing the protection of human life and material goods as well as protecting ecosystems from natural hazards in addition human activities can maintain their natural resources for consumption in a sustainable way complex issues such as resilience within the context of water security must be analyzed with a holistic view considering the various dimensions and interrelationships involved in the use of multidimensional indices as bpi and bise these indices together with raising awareness measures could generate a population most prepared to pay and adapt to non stationary events also the indices could improve cooperation between water users with better management and reduce competition over physical resources stimulating a peaceful climate the risk management framework presented here in a four quadrant graph shows how the relationship between water security elements could be stronger when resilience elements such as nbs multidimensional indices and raising awareness measures are used declaration of competing interest
