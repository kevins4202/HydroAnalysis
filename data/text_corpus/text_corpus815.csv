4075,in recent years due to the influence of human activities and changing climate conditions precipitation time series have had increasing non stationarity and randomness therefore the scientific and accurate prediction of precipitation has become increasingly difficult to improve precipitation prediction accuracy nonlinear precipitation data was decomposed into several subcomponents via three decomposition methods time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd wavelet transform wt and complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd then the elman neural network enn was used to construct tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn models to predict the subcomponents of precipitation finally these three models were applied to the monthly and daily precipitation series from different meteorological stations the results showed that tvf emd enn made relatively stable predictions for monthly and daily precipitation and was better than wt enn ceemd enn and other models predictions for turpan station were generally poor likely due to the discontinuous resonance periods and abnormal resonance periods between precipitation and climate indices overall the predictions by tvf emd enn were better which was clearly reflected in the variance contribution rates vcr of high frequency subcomponents which were lower than those of wt and ceemd parameter sensitivities of tvf emd indicated that the bandwidth threshold bt and the b spline order bso had a strong influence on model performance and that bt and bso should remain within 0 15 0 50 and 15 65 respectively this study has provided a new approach to precipitation prediction that is better equipped to handle non stationarity and randomness keywords decomposition methods elman neural network climate indices sensitivity analysis precipitation prediction 1 introduction due to the influence of climate change and human activities precipitation time series have become increasingly nonlinear random and complex danandeh 2018 nourani et al 2017 which has made predicting precipitation much more difficult the scientific and accurate prediction of precipitation can provide useful information for water resources management agricultural planning and associated crop insurance garbrecht et al 2010 over the past few decades various methods for predicting rainfall have been proposed and they generally fall into two categories white box or black box models white box modeling is an approach that relies on physical processes nourani et al 2018 while black box models apply historical data observed data to make predictions the conceptual approaches behind white box modeling can be more reliable when analyzing physical phenomena but they have disadvantages such as being complex and time consuming relying on there being sufficient modeling data and often producing inaccurate results nourani et al 2019 black box models on the other hand have developed based on statistical methods therefore once an accurate estimation of the process becomes more important than the physical interpretation a data driven black box approach is a better choice chau 2017 wu and chau 2011 yaseen et al 2019 choubin et al 2016 in recent decades artificial neural network techniques such as the black box approach have been successfully applied to modeling hydrological processes in which there was nonlinearity and uncertainty in the data ali ghorbani et al 2018 studies have also reported that artificial neural network based technologies produce more reliable output when applied to precipitation predictions compared to the white box model abbot and marohasy 2012 more recently the artificial neural network ann has been widely used to solve practical problems in water resources management devi et al 2017 applied an ann model to precipitation time series prediction and showed that the wavelet elman model was the best model for predicting precipitation mehdizadeh et al 2018 introduced two new hybrid models the artificial neural networks autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity and the gene expression programming autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models and used them to predict monthly precipitation time series abbot and marohasy 2014 used an ann model to predict monthly rainfall using climate indices as inputs maria et al 2005 used a feedforward neural network to forecast precipitation in sao paulo in addition neural network and fuzzy inference are combined to deal with non stationary hydrological series brazil rafiei sardooi et al 2018 used neuro fuzzy model to process non stationary standardized precipitation indexes choubin et al 2017 used the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and multi layer perceptron model to predict the time series of seasonal aggregated precipitation recently neural network models and classified regression tree models considering climate signals have also been reported successfully in precipitation prediction sigaroodi et al 2014 choubin et al 2018 although an ann model is an effective method for modeling physical processes the accuracy of the model decreases below acceptable levels when precipitation series have high non stationarity due to the influence of human activities and climate change nourani et al 2018 to improve the prediction performances of ann models input data preprocessing by signal decomposition tools has been suggested these signal decomposition tools include wavelet transform wt ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd the abilities of wt eemd and ceemd to decompose hydrological time series with high non stationarity to sub series at several time scales can effectively increase the reliability of hydrological phenomena interpretations these methods function by decomposing signals into sub signals to improve the capability of models by extracting useful information at different scales nourani et al 2019 some successful applications of these tools have been reported he et al 2015 wang et al 2015 graf et al 2019 ali et al 2020 shafaei and kisi 2016 for example he et al 2015 used a hybrid wavelet neural network model to effectively predict monthly precipitation and climate indices wang et al 2015 used eemd and auto regressive integrated moving average to predict the annual runoff from a reservoir graf et al 2019 combined wt and ann to predict the daily water temperature of rivers ali et al 2020 used ceemd random forest and kernel ridge regression algorithm to construct a hybrid model to predict monthly precipitation in the mountains of pakistan shafaei and kisi 2016 applied integrated wavelet and auto regressive moving average adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and support vector regression models to forecast monthly lake level fluctuations despite all the successful applications of these tools a literature review reveals a lack of research on certain key aspects of these models first although some researchers have applied wt and ceemd to hydrological prediction the new signal decomposition method developed in recent years time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd has received relatively little attention in regard to water resource prediction second there is a lack of research on the differences between the tvf emd wt and ceemd decomposition tools especially on precipitation subcomponents third there is a lack of side by side applications of tvf emd wt and ceemd to compare their monthly and daily precipitation prediction performances especially in verifying their robustness using different meteorological stations in multiple regions finally until now to our knowledge no study has reported on how tvf emd decomposition parameters affect model prediction performance especially in precipitation forecasting the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the principles of the tvf emd wt ceemd enn tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn methods are introduced in section 2 the study area and data sources are introduced in section 3 section 4 1 focuses on the prediction performance of the three methods of interest section 4 2 lays out the differences between station precipitation and climate indices differences among the precipitation subcomponents obtained by the three decomposition methods differences among the three models in daily precipitation prediction performance and the sensitivity analysis of tvf emd parameters conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methods this section mainly introduces the three decomposition methods and the construction of the prediction models the three decomposition methods are tvfemd wt and ceemd and the associated prediction models are tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn respectively 2 1 time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd tvf emd li et al 2017 is an improved algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition compared with empirical mode decomposition this method has been shown to successfully improve on the frequency division performance stability under low sampling rates and robustness against noise interference tvf emd mainly includes three main processes the sifting process of emd local cut off frequency realignment and the sifting process based on time varying filtering more details on the tvf emd method can be found in the paper by li et al 2017 the implementation steps for tvf emd are shown in fig 1 2 2 wavelet transform wt mathematical transformations are often used to extract information from time series data that are not readily available in their raw form wavelets are mathematical functions that give a time scale representation of the time series data and their relationships they are suitable for analyzing time series data that contain processes with non stationarity shoaib et al 2016 wt tools can be divided into two main categories continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt compared with the classical cwt which requires a significant amount of computational time and data dwt needs less time and is therefore easier to implement nayak et al 2016 in this study wt was used to decompose monthly precipitation series data in wt digital filtering techniques are used to acquire time scale signals the original time series is passed through high pass and low pass filters and the detailed coefficients and approximate sequences are obtained through the wavelet algorithm gurley and kareem 1999 the dwt scales and positions are based on the power of two binary scales and positions and can be defined for a discrete time series f t 1 w a b d 2 j 2 j 1 j j ψ 2 j 2 k f t d t where the real numbers j and k are integers that control the wavelet dilation and translation respectively as a time series is passed through high pass and a low pass filters approximations a n and details d n respectively are produced high pass filters are used to analyze high frequency signals while low pass filters are used to analyze low frequency signals the approximation is the low frequency component of the signal and the detail is the high frequency component of the signal the low frequency component is an important part of the signal representing the core characteristics of the signal while the high frequency portion gives subtle differences to the signal the decomposition of temporal data by dwt satisfies the following conditions f t d 1 a 1 d 1 d 2 a 2 d 1 d 2 d 3 a 3 and so on 2 3 complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd ceemd is an improved version of the noise enhanced data analysis algorithm in this approach the residuals of added white noise can be extracted from the mixed data by identifying white noise via pairs of complementary ensemble intrinsic mode functions imfs with positive and negative added white noise yeh et al 2010 which was shown to effectively eliminate residual noise in the imfs the steps of the ceemd algorithm are as follows add white noise ω t to the original series x t 2 x t x t ω t use emd to decompose x t to get the first subcomponent imf1 repeat steps 1 and 2 with distinct numbers of realizations this process is usually repeated τ number of times ensemble number each with different realizations calculate the mean of all imf1 3 im f 1 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ω k t where ψ 1 is the computation of k th imf and ε specifies the amplitude regulation necessary to obtain an appropriate signal ali et al 2020 calculate the first residual component or the remaining component results as follows 4 r 1 t x t i m f 1 t next imf2 is extracted from the original signal x t the imf2 is defined as 5 im f 2 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ψ 1 ω k t repeat steps 1 to 6 to acquire the β 1 th imf factor as 6 im f β 1 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ψ β ω k t therefore the original signal x t can be reconstructed as follows 7 x t i 1 n im f i t r n t where im f i t is the i th imf and r n t is the n th residual for more information please the relevant publications regarding the ceemd method i e yeh et al 2010 ali et al 2020 2 4 elman neural network the enn elman 1990 is a feedback neural network composed of four levels which include the input layer hidden layer context layer and output layer the additional internal feedback from the receiver layer increases the sensitivity of enn to historical data and its capacity to forecast time series data and handle dynamic information thus enabling it to perform dynamic modeling pan et al 2017 the enn is defined as follows 8 x jt 0 k f h i 1 m ω ij i x it k b i j 1 n ω j r x jt 0 k 1 9 y t 1 k f 0 j 1 m ω j 0 x jt k b j where x jt is the input to the network at time t x jt 0 j 1 2 3 n is the output of the hidden layer at time t y t 1 is the output of the network at time t 1 ω ij i is the connection weight of the input layer to the hidden layer ω j r is the connection weight of the context layer to the hidden layer ω j 0 is the connection weight of the hidden layer to the output layer and f h and f 0 are the transfer functions of the hidden layer and the output layer respectively more information on the enn method is available in elman 1990 and ardalani farsa and zolfaghari 2010 see fig 2 2 5 establishment of tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn the technical routes of tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn are shown in fig 3 2 6 performance metrics in this study the following three indices that have been widely used to assess modeling performance were applied the root mean square error rmse 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 where x i represents the true value x i represents the predicted value and n is the number of predicted values x i and x i have the same meaning in the following equations the smaller the rmse the better the prediction performance of the model the mean absolute error mae 11 mae 1 n i 1 n x i x i the smaller the mae the better the prediction performance of the model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 12 nse 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where x represents the average value the range of nse is within 1 the larger the value of nse the better the prediction performance of the model 3 study area and data sources 3 1 study area in this study meteorological stations located in 12 different regions were taken as the research objects they were the baoshan guangzhou turpan wudaoliang yanji zedang wuhan zhengzhou liuzhou haikou beijing and huhhot meteorological stations wudaoliang meteorological station is located in gemuer city qinghai province where the average monthly precipitation amp over many years is 25 14 mm zedang meteorological station is located in shannan city tibet autonomous region and the amp is 32 73 mm guangzhou meteorological station is located in guangzhou and the amp is 150 86 mm turpan meteorological station is located in turpan city and the amp is 1 23 mm yanji meteorological station is located in yanji city jilin province and the amp is 44 31 mm baoshan meteorological station is located in baoshan district shanghai and the amp is 95 41 mm it is worth noting that we specifically selected meteorological stations with different amp to verify the robustness of the model the remaining six meteorological stations were used for daily precipitation predictions in the discussion the locations of the 12 meteorological stations are shown in fig 4 3 2 data sources the monthly precipitation data in this study spanned from 1961 to 2020 and were collected from the china meteorological data website http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn mul mon html for each meteorological station data sets were divided chronologically into training 80 and testing 20 periods the paired meteorological stations with training and testing periods are summarized in table 1 it can be seen from fig 5 that monthly precipitation at guangzhou station was relatively high with a maximum of 834 6 mm while the monthly precipitation at turpan station was low with a maximum of 25 9 mm precipitation at all six meteorological stations exhibited fluctuation and periodicity so all six stations had the characteristic of non stationarity 4 results and discussion 4 1 model prediction results in enn the input and network parameters are the main factors that determine the prediction performance of the model since monthly precipitation had an obvious 12 month cycle we utilized autocorrelation analysis kasiviswanathan et al 2016 to identify the influencing variables that corresponded to different time delays and took the duration of the collected data and other factors into consideration after comprehensive consideration we used the data from the past 12 months as the input and the data of the 13th month as the output for the network parameters we set the layer delay to 1 2 the number of iterations to 1000 and the number of hidden layer neurons to 12 it should be noted that the enn parameters were consistent across all models used for monthly precipitation prediction 4 1 1 tvf emd enn prediction results the three most important parameters that determine the decomposition effect of tvf emd are the max output of the imfs moi the b spline order bso and the bandwidth threshold bt in that order in this study the moi bso and bt were 100 26 and 0 3 respectively the decomposition results of monthly precipitation at the six stations are shown in fig 6 the monthly precipitation data from the six stations were decomposed into several subcomponents the subsequences show regular periodic change as the number of decomposition levels increases the frequencies and amplitudes of subsequences decrease and their non stationarity decreases which provides a good data input for enn prediction the prediction performance of tvf emd enn for the precipitation subcomponents and monthly precipitation of the six stations is shown in fig 7 strong correlations between observed and forecasted monthly precipitation values can be seen throughout fig 7 for nse the prediction performances of the training and test data sets at turpan station were slightly worse than those of the other five stations in the test data set the maximum nse of monthly precipitation at turpan station was only 0 903 which was significantly lower than that at other 5 stations for the first subcomponent sc 1 the prediction performance was lower and its nse was significantly weaker than the other components the nse values of sc 1 at turpan station were the smallest in training data set and test data set which were 0 832 and 0 853 respectively for rmse the prediction performances for the training and test data sets from guangzhou and baoshan stations were slightly worse than those of the other four stations the rmse of monthly precipitation at guangzhou station was the largest in the test data set which was 23 755 mm baoshan station had the largest rmse in the test data set which was 17 888 mm for mae the prediction performances for the training and test data sets from guangzhou and baoshan stations were slightly worse than those of the other four stations the mae of monthly precipitation at guangzhou station was the largest in the test data set which was 18 474 mm baoshan station had the largest rmse in the test data set which was 13 799 mm 4 1 2 weight enn prediction results the two most important influential parameters that determine the decomposition effect of wt are wavelet basis function and decomposition level in that order in this study to better extract the long term trend of precipitation the decomposition level and wavelet basis function were set to 9 and db5 respectively the decomposition effect is shown in fig 8 the decomposition effect of wt was similar to that of tvf emd by increasing the number of decomposition levels the frequencies and amplitudes of the subsequences decreased and their non stationarity also decreased the prediction performance of wt enn for the precipitation subcomponents of the six stations is shown in fig 9 clear correlations between forecasted and observed monthly precipitation values could be observed in fig 9 for nse the prediction performances of the training and test data sets of turpan station were slightly worse than those of the other five stations in the training data set the maximum nse of monthly precipitation at turpan station was only 0 872 which was significantly lower than that at other 5 stations for the first subcomponent sc 1 the prediction performance was lower and its nse was significantly weaker than the other components in the training data set the nse of sc 1 at guangzhou station was the smallest which was only 0 772 in the test data set wudaoliang station had the smallest sc 1 which was only 0 749 the rmse and mae of subcomponents had a common feature that as the number of decomposition levels increases the rmse and mae of the subcomponents gradually decreased the rmse and mae values of sc 1 were the largest while the rmse and mae values of the last subcomponent trend were smaller 4 1 3 ceemd enn prediction results the three most important parameters that determine the decomposition effect of ceemd are noise standard deviation ensemble number and decomposition level in that order we set the noise standard deviation to 0 2 the ensemble number to 100 the decomposition results of ceemd are shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows that as the number of decomposition levels increases the frequencies and amplitudes of the subcomponents gradually decreased along with their non stationarity the prediction performances of the precipitation subcomponents of ceemd enn for the six stations are shown in fig 11 fig 11 clearly illustrates the degree of correlation between forecasted and predicted values for nse the prediction performances of the training and test data sets of turpan station were slightly worse than those of the other five stations the maximum nse value of monthly precipitation at turpan station was only 0 651 which was significantly lower than that at other 5 stations for the first subcomponent sc 1 the prediction performance was lower and its nse was significantly weaker than the other components in the training data set the sc 1 at baoshan station was the smallest which was only 0 3 in the test data set zedang station had the smallest sc 1 value which was only 0 004 the rmse and mae of subcomponents had a common feature that as the number of decomposition levels increases the rmse and mae of the subcomponents gradually decreased the rmse and mae values of sc 1 were the largest while the rmse and mae values of the last subcomponent trend were smaller 4 1 4 comparison of prediction performance among models ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and empirical mode decomposition emd are two common methods used for nonlinear signal processing tvf emd is also comparable to these methods in addition the prediction performance of a single enn was included for comparison the prediction performances of all models are shown in fig 12 as can be seen from fig 12 the prediction performance of tvf emd enn was the best the nse values were the largest with the nse values of six stations above 0 903 rmses lower than 23 775 mm and maes lower than 18 474 mm the prediction performance of enn without signal decomposition was the worst with the lowest nse and highest rmse and mae in general the order of prediction performance of the model from best to worst was tvf emd enn wt enn ceemd enn eemd enn emd enn and enn 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 correlation analysis with climate indices the analysis presented in section 4 1 showed that of the six meteorological stations the prediction performance was worst for turpan station this poor prediction performance may have been related to the climate index at that station in this study a selection of climate indices were selected to compare their predictive performance where precipitation is increasingly nonlinearly the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet spectrum of two time series with background power spectra p k x and p k y is given by torrence and compo 1998 as 13 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y q z ν p ν p k x p k y where σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of time series x and y respectively and z ν p is the confidence level associated with the probability p for a defined by the square root of the product of two χ 2 distributions for example when ν 2 at a significance level of 0 05 z 2 95 3 999 and as determined by the red noise test increasing power with decreasing frequency it is established that the two are significantly correlated the 95 significance level is calculated using the monte carlo method grinsted et al 2004 referring to existing research e g tao et al 2021 xiao et al 2016 yang 2011 ouyang et al 2014 the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo atlantic oscillation ao north atlantic oscillation nao niño 3 4 pacific decadal oscillation pdo and pacific north america indices pna were selected to analyze the differences in precipitation at each station the data is available on https www psl noaa gov data climateindices the cross wavelet spectrum of monthly precipitation and climate indices at the six stations are shown in fig 13 some obvious trends and relationships can be seen in fig 13 the monthly precipitation and some climate indices of the six stations all had a significant oscillation period of 12 months compared with turpan station the monthly precipitation and pdo niño 3 4 and amo of the other five stations showed some continuous resonance periods for example in the 12 month period pdo niño 3 4 and amo of the other five stations showed continuous resonance periods in 350 500 20 320 340 700 and 500 700 months respectively however the resonance period of monthly precipitation and some climate indices at turpan station was intermittent or even abnormal for example the monthly precipitation and amo ao nao niño 3 4 and pna had abnormal resonance periods in 36 48 24 48 128 144 36 48 and 128 144 32 64 months respectively we speculate that the poor precipitation prediction performance of turpan station which was worse than that of the other five stations was due to the discontinuous resonance periods and abnormal resonance periods between precipitation and climate indices at this station in addition turpan station is located in the northwest of china where different meteorological conditions and other factors may have also affected precipitation 4 2 2 comparing the three decomposition methods although the tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn models all achieved satisfactory results generally there is a lack of systematic comparisons of decomposition subcomponents among tvf emd wt and ceemd especially from a mathematical point of view therefore the variance contribution rate vcr was introduced to describe the differences between different decomposition methods the larger the vcr the greater is the contribution of the subcomponents to the original sequence the variance is defined as follows 14 σ x 2 e 2 x e x 2 where e x is the expected value of x the vcr is defined as follows 15 vcr i σ xi 2 σ x 1 2 σ x 2 2 σ xn 2 where i 1 2 n and n is the number of subcomponents obtained by tvf emd wt and ceemd the vcr values of the tvf emd wt and ceemd methods are shown in fig 14 fig 14 shows clear differences among the vcr values of subcomponents sc from different models for sc 1 overall the vcr of tvf emd of all six stations was smaller than those of wt and ceemd for sc 2 overall the vcr of tvf emd was smaller in all six stations than wt and ceemd for tvf emd wt and ceemd except for the first three subcomponents the vcr of the other subcomponents generally decreased with the increased of the number of decomposition levels however the non stationarity was strongest for the first subcomponent sc 1 but weakened with each further signal decomposition and was weakest for trend because a large proportion of the whole signal is extracted in sc 1 it will have a relatively large impact on the accuracy of the model however this impact will not be exceedingly large because the error of the model is determined by accounting for all six subcomponents the tvf emd enn model was superior to the wt enn and ceemd enn models which was apparent because the vcr of sc 1 from tvf was smaller than those of wt and ceemd tvf emd wt and ceemd are effective tools for nonlinear signal processing wt has been widely used in the field of hydrology and many reports have described its successful application however the application of ceemd has not been as common as wt and reports about using tvf emd in the field of water resources are rare the results of this study showed that as indicated by the nse rmse and mae values tvf emd enn was better than wt enn and ceemd enn therefore when making precipitation predictions we would first recommend using tvf emd to preprocess the precipitation data of course we can also use wt to process precipitation data because the difference between the wt enn and tvf emd enn is very small 4 2 3 case study in daily precipitation the daily precipitation data for this study spanned from 2019 1 1 to 2020 4 8 and were collected from the china meteorological data website http data cma cn dataservice cdcindex datacode surf cli chn mul day show value normal html according to the time sequence 80 of the data was used for training and 20 for testing since tvf emd enn produced satisfactory predictions for monthly precipitation trends we decided to determine whether the model can also achieve satisfactory results in predicting daily precipitation for this case study we selected six different meteorological stations the wuhan beijing haikou zhengzhou liuzhou and hohhot stations daily precipitation at the six stations is shown in fig 15 the precipitation of the six stations presented varying degrees of non stationarity and fluctuation precipitation was lowest in spring and winter and highest in summer in addition variability in precipitation was different among the six stations during the same period which was conducive to testing the robustness of the tvf emd enn model the decomposition results of tvf emd wt and ceemd on daily precipitation are shown in fig 16 it can be seen from fig 16 tvf emd wt and ceemd had a common feature for daily precipitation decomposition as the number of decomposition levels increases the frequencies and amplitudes of the subcomponents gradually decreased along with their non stationarity the first subcomponent sc 1 has the highest frequency while the last subcomponent trend has the lowest frequency the vcr values of subcomponents of tvf emd wt and ceemd are shown in fig 17 for daily precipitation the vcr values of tvf emd sc 1 was lower than that of ceemd but close to that of wt sc 1 except sc 1 the vcr values of the other components of the three decomposition methods were not significantly different the vcr values of the subcomponent generally decrease with the increase of the number of decomposition levels this was consistent with the trends observed in the vcr values of subcomponents from the monthly precipitation data so we can infer that the prediction performance of tvf emd enn in daily precipitation would also be better than the performance of wt enn and ceemd enn referring to section 4 1 decided the input and parameters of enn and combined with the wavelet main cycle periods of the daily precipitation at the six stations we determined that haikou beijing liuzhou and hohhot stations time series should be partitioned into the first five days as input and the data of the sixth day as output while for wuhan and zhengzhou stations the data of the first six days should be the input and the data of the seventh day should be the output the corresponding enn parameter layer delay of all the six stations was 1 2 the number of iterations was 1000 and the number of hidden layer neurons was 5 the prediction performance of the daily precipitation of tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn is shown in fig 18 it can be seen from fig 18 that tvf emd enn was again the most robust and returned relatively stable prediction performances for daily precipitation at the six stations tvf emd enn had the best nse rmse and mae values and nse differed little among the training and test data sets specifically for nse nse of tvf emd enn was greater than wt enn and ceemd enn for rmse and mae rmse and mae of tvf emd enn were lower than those of wt enn and ceemd enn the prediction performance of ceemd enn for daily precipitation was poor and unstable and the nse of wuhan station differed greatly among the training and test data sets the prediction performance of wt enn was better than that of ceemd enn but worse than that of tvf emd enn in summary even for daily precipitation predictions tvf emd enn was still the most robust for different stations and the prediction performance of the model was good 4 2 4 tvf emd enn model sensitivity analysis previous studies have examined the effects of wavelet based functions and decomposition levels on the prediction performances of wavelet neural networks e g shoaib et al 2019 barzegar et al 2017 nourani et al 2009 however until now no study that we know of has reported how the different parameters of the tvf emd affect performance during precipitation predictions in the tvf emd enn model the decomposition effect has the largest influence on the predictive performance of the model and for tvf emd the influential parameters for decomposition effect are bandwidth threshold bt b spline order bso max output imfs moi has little influence on the prediction results in section 4 1 when tvf emd was used to decompose the precipitation data from six stations the parameters were set to bt 0 3 moi 100 and bso 26 however how changes in these parameters affect prediction performance of the tvf emd enn was not examined it should be noted that sensitivity analysis focused on changes in tvf emd parameters while the conditions of the enn remain unchanged therefore sensitivity to changes in enn parameters was not considered in this study in this paper turpan station which was relatively difficult to predict was used for the sensitivity analysis the prediction performances of the test data set using the tvf emd enn model with different parameters are shown in fig 19 as can be seen from fig 19 when parameters moi and bso remained unchanged but parameter bt was increased from 0 1 to 1 0 the nse decreased from 0 99 to 0 5 and the decomposition time also decreased from 3 05 s to 0 14 s the number of subcomponents also decreased gradually from 20 to 1 when bt was lower than 0 1 0 02 and 0 05 the corresponding nse was the lowest which was 2 50 and 1 33 respectively the corresponding decomposition time was 25 34 s and 6 55 s respectively and the corresponding number of sub components was relatively large which was 31 and 29 respectively when the bt and moi parameters remained unchanged but the bso increased from 5 to 150 the decomposition time showed an upward trend and the number of subcomponents ranged from 7 to 11 when bso was greater than 65 the nse decreased gradually and was significantly lower than that corresponding to the bso range from 15 to 65 considering that the number of subcomponents will influence the workload of precipitation prediction calculation combined with the change of nse of the model based on comprehensive consideration we recommend that bt should range from 0 15 to 0 50 and bso should range from 15 to 65 5 conclusions under the background of human activities and global warming precipitation data has exhibited increasing non stationarity which makes scientific and accurate predictions of precipitation more difficult this study examined the effectiveness of different models in predicting data with high non stationarity and made the following conclusions the tvf emd enn model is better than wt enn ceemd enn eemd enn emd enn and enn models in predicting monthly precipitation and made highly robust predictions this was true even for the daily precipitation predictions where it also made satisfactory predictions outperforming both the wt enn and ceemd enn models the predictions for turpan station were slightly worse than those for the other five stations probably because there were discontinuous resonance periods and abnormal resonance periods between precipitation and climate indices the tvf emd enn model was better than wt enn and ceemd enn which was clearly reflected in the vcr values of the high frequency subcomponents of the tvf emd the vcr values of the high frequency subcomponents of the tvf emd was smaller and the high frequency subcomponents accounted for a considerable proportion in the precipitation the smaller the proportion the weaker the non stationary tvf emd enn can better simulate the high frequency subcomponents of precipitation and improve the prediction performance of the precipitation bt and bso parameters had a strong influence on the prediction performance of tvf emd enn and too large or too small values for bt and bso are not recommended bt and bso should remain in the range of 0 15 0 50 and 15 65 respectively the development of hybrid prediction models by introducing signal decomposition methods will enable more accurate and stable prediction results while also advancing research related to hydrological time series prediction and addressing a wide range of issues related to effective water resource management

4075,in recent years due to the influence of human activities and changing climate conditions precipitation time series have had increasing non stationarity and randomness therefore the scientific and accurate prediction of precipitation has become increasingly difficult to improve precipitation prediction accuracy nonlinear precipitation data was decomposed into several subcomponents via three decomposition methods time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd wavelet transform wt and complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd then the elman neural network enn was used to construct tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn models to predict the subcomponents of precipitation finally these three models were applied to the monthly and daily precipitation series from different meteorological stations the results showed that tvf emd enn made relatively stable predictions for monthly and daily precipitation and was better than wt enn ceemd enn and other models predictions for turpan station were generally poor likely due to the discontinuous resonance periods and abnormal resonance periods between precipitation and climate indices overall the predictions by tvf emd enn were better which was clearly reflected in the variance contribution rates vcr of high frequency subcomponents which were lower than those of wt and ceemd parameter sensitivities of tvf emd indicated that the bandwidth threshold bt and the b spline order bso had a strong influence on model performance and that bt and bso should remain within 0 15 0 50 and 15 65 respectively this study has provided a new approach to precipitation prediction that is better equipped to handle non stationarity and randomness keywords decomposition methods elman neural network climate indices sensitivity analysis precipitation prediction 1 introduction due to the influence of climate change and human activities precipitation time series have become increasingly nonlinear random and complex danandeh 2018 nourani et al 2017 which has made predicting precipitation much more difficult the scientific and accurate prediction of precipitation can provide useful information for water resources management agricultural planning and associated crop insurance garbrecht et al 2010 over the past few decades various methods for predicting rainfall have been proposed and they generally fall into two categories white box or black box models white box modeling is an approach that relies on physical processes nourani et al 2018 while black box models apply historical data observed data to make predictions the conceptual approaches behind white box modeling can be more reliable when analyzing physical phenomena but they have disadvantages such as being complex and time consuming relying on there being sufficient modeling data and often producing inaccurate results nourani et al 2019 black box models on the other hand have developed based on statistical methods therefore once an accurate estimation of the process becomes more important than the physical interpretation a data driven black box approach is a better choice chau 2017 wu and chau 2011 yaseen et al 2019 choubin et al 2016 in recent decades artificial neural network techniques such as the black box approach have been successfully applied to modeling hydrological processes in which there was nonlinearity and uncertainty in the data ali ghorbani et al 2018 studies have also reported that artificial neural network based technologies produce more reliable output when applied to precipitation predictions compared to the white box model abbot and marohasy 2012 more recently the artificial neural network ann has been widely used to solve practical problems in water resources management devi et al 2017 applied an ann model to precipitation time series prediction and showed that the wavelet elman model was the best model for predicting precipitation mehdizadeh et al 2018 introduced two new hybrid models the artificial neural networks autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity and the gene expression programming autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models and used them to predict monthly precipitation time series abbot and marohasy 2014 used an ann model to predict monthly rainfall using climate indices as inputs maria et al 2005 used a feedforward neural network to forecast precipitation in sao paulo in addition neural network and fuzzy inference are combined to deal with non stationary hydrological series brazil rafiei sardooi et al 2018 used neuro fuzzy model to process non stationary standardized precipitation indexes choubin et al 2017 used the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and multi layer perceptron model to predict the time series of seasonal aggregated precipitation recently neural network models and classified regression tree models considering climate signals have also been reported successfully in precipitation prediction sigaroodi et al 2014 choubin et al 2018 although an ann model is an effective method for modeling physical processes the accuracy of the model decreases below acceptable levels when precipitation series have high non stationarity due to the influence of human activities and climate change nourani et al 2018 to improve the prediction performances of ann models input data preprocessing by signal decomposition tools has been suggested these signal decomposition tools include wavelet transform wt ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd the abilities of wt eemd and ceemd to decompose hydrological time series with high non stationarity to sub series at several time scales can effectively increase the reliability of hydrological phenomena interpretations these methods function by decomposing signals into sub signals to improve the capability of models by extracting useful information at different scales nourani et al 2019 some successful applications of these tools have been reported he et al 2015 wang et al 2015 graf et al 2019 ali et al 2020 shafaei and kisi 2016 for example he et al 2015 used a hybrid wavelet neural network model to effectively predict monthly precipitation and climate indices wang et al 2015 used eemd and auto regressive integrated moving average to predict the annual runoff from a reservoir graf et al 2019 combined wt and ann to predict the daily water temperature of rivers ali et al 2020 used ceemd random forest and kernel ridge regression algorithm to construct a hybrid model to predict monthly precipitation in the mountains of pakistan shafaei and kisi 2016 applied integrated wavelet and auto regressive moving average adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and support vector regression models to forecast monthly lake level fluctuations despite all the successful applications of these tools a literature review reveals a lack of research on certain key aspects of these models first although some researchers have applied wt and ceemd to hydrological prediction the new signal decomposition method developed in recent years time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd has received relatively little attention in regard to water resource prediction second there is a lack of research on the differences between the tvf emd wt and ceemd decomposition tools especially on precipitation subcomponents third there is a lack of side by side applications of tvf emd wt and ceemd to compare their monthly and daily precipitation prediction performances especially in verifying their robustness using different meteorological stations in multiple regions finally until now to our knowledge no study has reported on how tvf emd decomposition parameters affect model prediction performance especially in precipitation forecasting the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the principles of the tvf emd wt ceemd enn tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn methods are introduced in section 2 the study area and data sources are introduced in section 3 section 4 1 focuses on the prediction performance of the three methods of interest section 4 2 lays out the differences between station precipitation and climate indices differences among the precipitation subcomponents obtained by the three decomposition methods differences among the three models in daily precipitation prediction performance and the sensitivity analysis of tvf emd parameters conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methods this section mainly introduces the three decomposition methods and the construction of the prediction models the three decomposition methods are tvfemd wt and ceemd and the associated prediction models are tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn respectively 2 1 time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition tvf emd tvf emd li et al 2017 is an improved algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition compared with empirical mode decomposition this method has been shown to successfully improve on the frequency division performance stability under low sampling rates and robustness against noise interference tvf emd mainly includes three main processes the sifting process of emd local cut off frequency realignment and the sifting process based on time varying filtering more details on the tvf emd method can be found in the paper by li et al 2017 the implementation steps for tvf emd are shown in fig 1 2 2 wavelet transform wt mathematical transformations are often used to extract information from time series data that are not readily available in their raw form wavelets are mathematical functions that give a time scale representation of the time series data and their relationships they are suitable for analyzing time series data that contain processes with non stationarity shoaib et al 2016 wt tools can be divided into two main categories continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt compared with the classical cwt which requires a significant amount of computational time and data dwt needs less time and is therefore easier to implement nayak et al 2016 in this study wt was used to decompose monthly precipitation series data in wt digital filtering techniques are used to acquire time scale signals the original time series is passed through high pass and low pass filters and the detailed coefficients and approximate sequences are obtained through the wavelet algorithm gurley and kareem 1999 the dwt scales and positions are based on the power of two binary scales and positions and can be defined for a discrete time series f t 1 w a b d 2 j 2 j 1 j j ψ 2 j 2 k f t d t where the real numbers j and k are integers that control the wavelet dilation and translation respectively as a time series is passed through high pass and a low pass filters approximations a n and details d n respectively are produced high pass filters are used to analyze high frequency signals while low pass filters are used to analyze low frequency signals the approximation is the low frequency component of the signal and the detail is the high frequency component of the signal the low frequency component is an important part of the signal representing the core characteristics of the signal while the high frequency portion gives subtle differences to the signal the decomposition of temporal data by dwt satisfies the following conditions f t d 1 a 1 d 1 d 2 a 2 d 1 d 2 d 3 a 3 and so on 2 3 complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd ceemd is an improved version of the noise enhanced data analysis algorithm in this approach the residuals of added white noise can be extracted from the mixed data by identifying white noise via pairs of complementary ensemble intrinsic mode functions imfs with positive and negative added white noise yeh et al 2010 which was shown to effectively eliminate residual noise in the imfs the steps of the ceemd algorithm are as follows add white noise ω t to the original series x t 2 x t x t ω t use emd to decompose x t to get the first subcomponent imf1 repeat steps 1 and 2 with distinct numbers of realizations this process is usually repeated τ number of times ensemble number each with different realizations calculate the mean of all imf1 3 im f 1 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ω k t where ψ 1 is the computation of k th imf and ε specifies the amplitude regulation necessary to obtain an appropriate signal ali et al 2020 calculate the first residual component or the remaining component results as follows 4 r 1 t x t i m f 1 t next imf2 is extracted from the original signal x t the imf2 is defined as 5 im f 2 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ψ 1 ω k t repeat steps 1 to 6 to acquire the β 1 th imf factor as 6 im f β 1 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ψ β ω k t therefore the original signal x t can be reconstructed as follows 7 x t i 1 n im f i t r n t where im f i t is the i th imf and r n t is the n th residual for more information please the relevant publications regarding the ceemd method i e yeh et al 2010 ali et al 2020 2 4 elman neural network the enn elman 1990 is a feedback neural network composed of four levels which include the input layer hidden layer context layer and output layer the additional internal feedback from the receiver layer increases the sensitivity of enn to historical data and its capacity to forecast time series data and handle dynamic information thus enabling it to perform dynamic modeling pan et al 2017 the enn is defined as follows 8 x jt 0 k f h i 1 m ω ij i x it k b i j 1 n ω j r x jt 0 k 1 9 y t 1 k f 0 j 1 m ω j 0 x jt k b j where x jt is the input to the network at time t x jt 0 j 1 2 3 n is the output of the hidden layer at time t y t 1 is the output of the network at time t 1 ω ij i is the connection weight of the input layer to the hidden layer ω j r is the connection weight of the context layer to the hidden layer ω j 0 is the connection weight of the hidden layer to the output layer and f h and f 0 are the transfer functions of the hidden layer and the output layer respectively more information on the enn method is available in elman 1990 and ardalani farsa and zolfaghari 2010 see fig 2 2 5 establishment of tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn the technical routes of tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn are shown in fig 3 2 6 performance metrics in this study the following three indices that have been widely used to assess modeling performance were applied the root mean square error rmse 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 where x i represents the true value x i represents the predicted value and n is the number of predicted values x i and x i have the same meaning in the following equations the smaller the rmse the better the prediction performance of the model the mean absolute error mae 11 mae 1 n i 1 n x i x i the smaller the mae the better the prediction performance of the model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 12 nse 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where x represents the average value the range of nse is within 1 the larger the value of nse the better the prediction performance of the model 3 study area and data sources 3 1 study area in this study meteorological stations located in 12 different regions were taken as the research objects they were the baoshan guangzhou turpan wudaoliang yanji zedang wuhan zhengzhou liuzhou haikou beijing and huhhot meteorological stations wudaoliang meteorological station is located in gemuer city qinghai province where the average monthly precipitation amp over many years is 25 14 mm zedang meteorological station is located in shannan city tibet autonomous region and the amp is 32 73 mm guangzhou meteorological station is located in guangzhou and the amp is 150 86 mm turpan meteorological station is located in turpan city and the amp is 1 23 mm yanji meteorological station is located in yanji city jilin province and the amp is 44 31 mm baoshan meteorological station is located in baoshan district shanghai and the amp is 95 41 mm it is worth noting that we specifically selected meteorological stations with different amp to verify the robustness of the model the remaining six meteorological stations were used for daily precipitation predictions in the discussion the locations of the 12 meteorological stations are shown in fig 4 3 2 data sources the monthly precipitation data in this study spanned from 1961 to 2020 and were collected from the china meteorological data website http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn mul mon html for each meteorological station data sets were divided chronologically into training 80 and testing 20 periods the paired meteorological stations with training and testing periods are summarized in table 1 it can be seen from fig 5 that monthly precipitation at guangzhou station was relatively high with a maximum of 834 6 mm while the monthly precipitation at turpan station was low with a maximum of 25 9 mm precipitation at all six meteorological stations exhibited fluctuation and periodicity so all six stations had the characteristic of non stationarity 4 results and discussion 4 1 model prediction results in enn the input and network parameters are the main factors that determine the prediction performance of the model since monthly precipitation had an obvious 12 month cycle we utilized autocorrelation analysis kasiviswanathan et al 2016 to identify the influencing variables that corresponded to different time delays and took the duration of the collected data and other factors into consideration after comprehensive consideration we used the data from the past 12 months as the input and the data of the 13th month as the output for the network parameters we set the layer delay to 1 2 the number of iterations to 1000 and the number of hidden layer neurons to 12 it should be noted that the enn parameters were consistent across all models used for monthly precipitation prediction 4 1 1 tvf emd enn prediction results the three most important parameters that determine the decomposition effect of tvf emd are the max output of the imfs moi the b spline order bso and the bandwidth threshold bt in that order in this study the moi bso and bt were 100 26 and 0 3 respectively the decomposition results of monthly precipitation at the six stations are shown in fig 6 the monthly precipitation data from the six stations were decomposed into several subcomponents the subsequences show regular periodic change as the number of decomposition levels increases the frequencies and amplitudes of subsequences decrease and their non stationarity decreases which provides a good data input for enn prediction the prediction performance of tvf emd enn for the precipitation subcomponents and monthly precipitation of the six stations is shown in fig 7 strong correlations between observed and forecasted monthly precipitation values can be seen throughout fig 7 for nse the prediction performances of the training and test data sets at turpan station were slightly worse than those of the other five stations in the test data set the maximum nse of monthly precipitation at turpan station was only 0 903 which was significantly lower than that at other 5 stations for the first subcomponent sc 1 the prediction performance was lower and its nse was significantly weaker than the other components the nse values of sc 1 at turpan station were the smallest in training data set and test data set which were 0 832 and 0 853 respectively for rmse the prediction performances for the training and test data sets from guangzhou and baoshan stations were slightly worse than those of the other four stations the rmse of monthly precipitation at guangzhou station was the largest in the test data set which was 23 755 mm baoshan station had the largest rmse in the test data set which was 17 888 mm for mae the prediction performances for the training and test data sets from guangzhou and baoshan stations were slightly worse than those of the other four stations the mae of monthly precipitation at guangzhou station was the largest in the test data set which was 18 474 mm baoshan station had the largest rmse in the test data set which was 13 799 mm 4 1 2 weight enn prediction results the two most important influential parameters that determine the decomposition effect of wt are wavelet basis function and decomposition level in that order in this study to better extract the long term trend of precipitation the decomposition level and wavelet basis function were set to 9 and db5 respectively the decomposition effect is shown in fig 8 the decomposition effect of wt was similar to that of tvf emd by increasing the number of decomposition levels the frequencies and amplitudes of the subsequences decreased and their non stationarity also decreased the prediction performance of wt enn for the precipitation subcomponents of the six stations is shown in fig 9 clear correlations between forecasted and observed monthly precipitation values could be observed in fig 9 for nse the prediction performances of the training and test data sets of turpan station were slightly worse than those of the other five stations in the training data set the maximum nse of monthly precipitation at turpan station was only 0 872 which was significantly lower than that at other 5 stations for the first subcomponent sc 1 the prediction performance was lower and its nse was significantly weaker than the other components in the training data set the nse of sc 1 at guangzhou station was the smallest which was only 0 772 in the test data set wudaoliang station had the smallest sc 1 which was only 0 749 the rmse and mae of subcomponents had a common feature that as the number of decomposition levels increases the rmse and mae of the subcomponents gradually decreased the rmse and mae values of sc 1 were the largest while the rmse and mae values of the last subcomponent trend were smaller 4 1 3 ceemd enn prediction results the three most important parameters that determine the decomposition effect of ceemd are noise standard deviation ensemble number and decomposition level in that order we set the noise standard deviation to 0 2 the ensemble number to 100 the decomposition results of ceemd are shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows that as the number of decomposition levels increases the frequencies and amplitudes of the subcomponents gradually decreased along with their non stationarity the prediction performances of the precipitation subcomponents of ceemd enn for the six stations are shown in fig 11 fig 11 clearly illustrates the degree of correlation between forecasted and predicted values for nse the prediction performances of the training and test data sets of turpan station were slightly worse than those of the other five stations the maximum nse value of monthly precipitation at turpan station was only 0 651 which was significantly lower than that at other 5 stations for the first subcomponent sc 1 the prediction performance was lower and its nse was significantly weaker than the other components in the training data set the sc 1 at baoshan station was the smallest which was only 0 3 in the test data set zedang station had the smallest sc 1 value which was only 0 004 the rmse and mae of subcomponents had a common feature that as the number of decomposition levels increases the rmse and mae of the subcomponents gradually decreased the rmse and mae values of sc 1 were the largest while the rmse and mae values of the last subcomponent trend were smaller 4 1 4 comparison of prediction performance among models ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and empirical mode decomposition emd are two common methods used for nonlinear signal processing tvf emd is also comparable to these methods in addition the prediction performance of a single enn was included for comparison the prediction performances of all models are shown in fig 12 as can be seen from fig 12 the prediction performance of tvf emd enn was the best the nse values were the largest with the nse values of six stations above 0 903 rmses lower than 23 775 mm and maes lower than 18 474 mm the prediction performance of enn without signal decomposition was the worst with the lowest nse and highest rmse and mae in general the order of prediction performance of the model from best to worst was tvf emd enn wt enn ceemd enn eemd enn emd enn and enn 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 correlation analysis with climate indices the analysis presented in section 4 1 showed that of the six meteorological stations the prediction performance was worst for turpan station this poor prediction performance may have been related to the climate index at that station in this study a selection of climate indices were selected to compare their predictive performance where precipitation is increasingly nonlinearly the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet spectrum of two time series with background power spectra p k x and p k y is given by torrence and compo 1998 as 13 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y q z ν p ν p k x p k y where σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of time series x and y respectively and z ν p is the confidence level associated with the probability p for a defined by the square root of the product of two χ 2 distributions for example when ν 2 at a significance level of 0 05 z 2 95 3 999 and as determined by the red noise test increasing power with decreasing frequency it is established that the two are significantly correlated the 95 significance level is calculated using the monte carlo method grinsted et al 2004 referring to existing research e g tao et al 2021 xiao et al 2016 yang 2011 ouyang et al 2014 the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo atlantic oscillation ao north atlantic oscillation nao niño 3 4 pacific decadal oscillation pdo and pacific north america indices pna were selected to analyze the differences in precipitation at each station the data is available on https www psl noaa gov data climateindices the cross wavelet spectrum of monthly precipitation and climate indices at the six stations are shown in fig 13 some obvious trends and relationships can be seen in fig 13 the monthly precipitation and some climate indices of the six stations all had a significant oscillation period of 12 months compared with turpan station the monthly precipitation and pdo niño 3 4 and amo of the other five stations showed some continuous resonance periods for example in the 12 month period pdo niño 3 4 and amo of the other five stations showed continuous resonance periods in 350 500 20 320 340 700 and 500 700 months respectively however the resonance period of monthly precipitation and some climate indices at turpan station was intermittent or even abnormal for example the monthly precipitation and amo ao nao niño 3 4 and pna had abnormal resonance periods in 36 48 24 48 128 144 36 48 and 128 144 32 64 months respectively we speculate that the poor precipitation prediction performance of turpan station which was worse than that of the other five stations was due to the discontinuous resonance periods and abnormal resonance periods between precipitation and climate indices at this station in addition turpan station is located in the northwest of china where different meteorological conditions and other factors may have also affected precipitation 4 2 2 comparing the three decomposition methods although the tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn models all achieved satisfactory results generally there is a lack of systematic comparisons of decomposition subcomponents among tvf emd wt and ceemd especially from a mathematical point of view therefore the variance contribution rate vcr was introduced to describe the differences between different decomposition methods the larger the vcr the greater is the contribution of the subcomponents to the original sequence the variance is defined as follows 14 σ x 2 e 2 x e x 2 where e x is the expected value of x the vcr is defined as follows 15 vcr i σ xi 2 σ x 1 2 σ x 2 2 σ xn 2 where i 1 2 n and n is the number of subcomponents obtained by tvf emd wt and ceemd the vcr values of the tvf emd wt and ceemd methods are shown in fig 14 fig 14 shows clear differences among the vcr values of subcomponents sc from different models for sc 1 overall the vcr of tvf emd of all six stations was smaller than those of wt and ceemd for sc 2 overall the vcr of tvf emd was smaller in all six stations than wt and ceemd for tvf emd wt and ceemd except for the first three subcomponents the vcr of the other subcomponents generally decreased with the increased of the number of decomposition levels however the non stationarity was strongest for the first subcomponent sc 1 but weakened with each further signal decomposition and was weakest for trend because a large proportion of the whole signal is extracted in sc 1 it will have a relatively large impact on the accuracy of the model however this impact will not be exceedingly large because the error of the model is determined by accounting for all six subcomponents the tvf emd enn model was superior to the wt enn and ceemd enn models which was apparent because the vcr of sc 1 from tvf was smaller than those of wt and ceemd tvf emd wt and ceemd are effective tools for nonlinear signal processing wt has been widely used in the field of hydrology and many reports have described its successful application however the application of ceemd has not been as common as wt and reports about using tvf emd in the field of water resources are rare the results of this study showed that as indicated by the nse rmse and mae values tvf emd enn was better than wt enn and ceemd enn therefore when making precipitation predictions we would first recommend using tvf emd to preprocess the precipitation data of course we can also use wt to process precipitation data because the difference between the wt enn and tvf emd enn is very small 4 2 3 case study in daily precipitation the daily precipitation data for this study spanned from 2019 1 1 to 2020 4 8 and were collected from the china meteorological data website http data cma cn dataservice cdcindex datacode surf cli chn mul day show value normal html according to the time sequence 80 of the data was used for training and 20 for testing since tvf emd enn produced satisfactory predictions for monthly precipitation trends we decided to determine whether the model can also achieve satisfactory results in predicting daily precipitation for this case study we selected six different meteorological stations the wuhan beijing haikou zhengzhou liuzhou and hohhot stations daily precipitation at the six stations is shown in fig 15 the precipitation of the six stations presented varying degrees of non stationarity and fluctuation precipitation was lowest in spring and winter and highest in summer in addition variability in precipitation was different among the six stations during the same period which was conducive to testing the robustness of the tvf emd enn model the decomposition results of tvf emd wt and ceemd on daily precipitation are shown in fig 16 it can be seen from fig 16 tvf emd wt and ceemd had a common feature for daily precipitation decomposition as the number of decomposition levels increases the frequencies and amplitudes of the subcomponents gradually decreased along with their non stationarity the first subcomponent sc 1 has the highest frequency while the last subcomponent trend has the lowest frequency the vcr values of subcomponents of tvf emd wt and ceemd are shown in fig 17 for daily precipitation the vcr values of tvf emd sc 1 was lower than that of ceemd but close to that of wt sc 1 except sc 1 the vcr values of the other components of the three decomposition methods were not significantly different the vcr values of the subcomponent generally decrease with the increase of the number of decomposition levels this was consistent with the trends observed in the vcr values of subcomponents from the monthly precipitation data so we can infer that the prediction performance of tvf emd enn in daily precipitation would also be better than the performance of wt enn and ceemd enn referring to section 4 1 decided the input and parameters of enn and combined with the wavelet main cycle periods of the daily precipitation at the six stations we determined that haikou beijing liuzhou and hohhot stations time series should be partitioned into the first five days as input and the data of the sixth day as output while for wuhan and zhengzhou stations the data of the first six days should be the input and the data of the seventh day should be the output the corresponding enn parameter layer delay of all the six stations was 1 2 the number of iterations was 1000 and the number of hidden layer neurons was 5 the prediction performance of the daily precipitation of tvf emd enn wt enn and ceemd enn is shown in fig 18 it can be seen from fig 18 that tvf emd enn was again the most robust and returned relatively stable prediction performances for daily precipitation at the six stations tvf emd enn had the best nse rmse and mae values and nse differed little among the training and test data sets specifically for nse nse of tvf emd enn was greater than wt enn and ceemd enn for rmse and mae rmse and mae of tvf emd enn were lower than those of wt enn and ceemd enn the prediction performance of ceemd enn for daily precipitation was poor and unstable and the nse of wuhan station differed greatly among the training and test data sets the prediction performance of wt enn was better than that of ceemd enn but worse than that of tvf emd enn in summary even for daily precipitation predictions tvf emd enn was still the most robust for different stations and the prediction performance of the model was good 4 2 4 tvf emd enn model sensitivity analysis previous studies have examined the effects of wavelet based functions and decomposition levels on the prediction performances of wavelet neural networks e g shoaib et al 2019 barzegar et al 2017 nourani et al 2009 however until now no study that we know of has reported how the different parameters of the tvf emd affect performance during precipitation predictions in the tvf emd enn model the decomposition effect has the largest influence on the predictive performance of the model and for tvf emd the influential parameters for decomposition effect are bandwidth threshold bt b spline order bso max output imfs moi has little influence on the prediction results in section 4 1 when tvf emd was used to decompose the precipitation data from six stations the parameters were set to bt 0 3 moi 100 and bso 26 however how changes in these parameters affect prediction performance of the tvf emd enn was not examined it should be noted that sensitivity analysis focused on changes in tvf emd parameters while the conditions of the enn remain unchanged therefore sensitivity to changes in enn parameters was not considered in this study in this paper turpan station which was relatively difficult to predict was used for the sensitivity analysis the prediction performances of the test data set using the tvf emd enn model with different parameters are shown in fig 19 as can be seen from fig 19 when parameters moi and bso remained unchanged but parameter bt was increased from 0 1 to 1 0 the nse decreased from 0 99 to 0 5 and the decomposition time also decreased from 3 05 s to 0 14 s the number of subcomponents also decreased gradually from 20 to 1 when bt was lower than 0 1 0 02 and 0 05 the corresponding nse was the lowest which was 2 50 and 1 33 respectively the corresponding decomposition time was 25 34 s and 6 55 s respectively and the corresponding number of sub components was relatively large which was 31 and 29 respectively when the bt and moi parameters remained unchanged but the bso increased from 5 to 150 the decomposition time showed an upward trend and the number of subcomponents ranged from 7 to 11 when bso was greater than 65 the nse decreased gradually and was significantly lower than that corresponding to the bso range from 15 to 65 considering that the number of subcomponents will influence the workload of precipitation prediction calculation combined with the change of nse of the model based on comprehensive consideration we recommend that bt should range from 0 15 to 0 50 and bso should range from 15 to 65 5 conclusions under the background of human activities and global warming precipitation data has exhibited increasing non stationarity which makes scientific and accurate predictions of precipitation more difficult this study examined the effectiveness of different models in predicting data with high non stationarity and made the following conclusions the tvf emd enn model is better than wt enn ceemd enn eemd enn emd enn and enn models in predicting monthly precipitation and made highly robust predictions this was true even for the daily precipitation predictions where it also made satisfactory predictions outperforming both the wt enn and ceemd enn models the predictions for turpan station were slightly worse than those for the other five stations probably because there were discontinuous resonance periods and abnormal resonance periods between precipitation and climate indices the tvf emd enn model was better than wt enn and ceemd enn which was clearly reflected in the vcr values of the high frequency subcomponents of the tvf emd the vcr values of the high frequency subcomponents of the tvf emd was smaller and the high frequency subcomponents accounted for a considerable proportion in the precipitation the smaller the proportion the weaker the non stationary tvf emd enn can better simulate the high frequency subcomponents of precipitation and improve the prediction performance of the precipitation bt and bso parameters had a strong influence on the prediction performance of tvf emd enn and too large or too small values for bt and bso are not recommended bt and bso should remain in the range of 0 15 0 50 and 15 65 respectively the development of hybrid prediction models by introducing signal decomposition methods will enable more accurate and stable prediction results while also advancing research related to hydrological time series prediction and addressing a wide range of issues related to effective water resource management

4076,hydrological models have traditionally been calibrated and evaluated against point scale observations such as streamflow emphasizing the temporal but not necessarily the spatial component of a model the main goal of this study is to improve the spatial pattern performance of simulated actual evapotranspiration aet a key variable in the land atmosphere interface for the entire land phase of denmark this is achieved by integrating fully distributed remote sensing rs data and robust objective functions in the regionalization and optimization of the national water resources model of denmark dk model for this monthly spatial patterns of modis16 et at 1 km resolution are used as a reference rs et estimate in the model calibration we applied a gradient based nonlinear gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm for parameter estimation via inverse modeling the proposed optimization framework includes three calibration strategies cal01 represents the traditional calibration approach against discharge and groundwater head observations only cal02 expands cal01 by means of a spatial pattern oriented objective function namely the spatial efficiency spaef metric targeting et pattern performance cal03 adds to cal02 an additional parameter regionalization scheme where the original fixed land use class dependent distribution and seasonal development of leaf area index lai crop coefficient kc and root depth rd are replaced with empirical schemes driven by distributed vegetation ndvi and soil texture clay fraction data our results reveal that a significant improvement in the simulated spatial patterns of aet is obtained when combining regionalization schemes and a spatial pattern oriented objective function in cal03 which is highlighted by a copula analysis also at the same time a very limited trade off in the model performance of aet patterns streamflow and groundwater heads is observed finally the regionalization scheme cal03 affected the simulated groundwater recharge according to changes of aet the findings of this study contribute to further improve spatial representation and evaluation of hydrological models and highlight the need to carefully design regionalization schemes as well as objective functions in fully distributed models keywords spatial evapotranspiration patterns streamflow and groundwater heads satellite remote sensing model parameterization and calibration hydrological modeling 1 introduction physically based distributed hydrological models are an essential tool for a wide range of water resources applications such as providing overall insights into catchment scale water and energy budgets or quantification and prediction of hydrological responses under changing conditions such models unlike lumped models are particularly useful for quantifying the effect of human interferences on land use change and groundwater abstraction beven 1996 refsgaard 1996 butts and graham 2014 the spatial predictive performance of these models is severely hampered by the general lack of suitable spatial pattern oriented model evaluation frameworks because their evaluations traditionally focus on the spatially aggregated objective functions like streamflow beven 1996 beven and freer 2001 grayson et al 2002 demirel et al 2018 if the spatial variability of a hydrological system is neglected in the evaluation it may not be worth applying a physically based distributed model in the first place since many studies indicate that equal model performance could be achieved using lumped and semi distributed conceptual modelling approaches when evaluated merely at the catchment outlet stisen et al 2011 butts and graham 2014 vansteenkiste et al 2014 automatic optimization algorithms are required when comparing different calibration designs since they enable an objective search process and more robust results bahremand and de smedt 2008 stisen et al 2011 among the optimization algorithms used in hydrological modelling the gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm as included in the parameter estimation tool pest estimates parameters of non linear models using often fewer model runs than alternative optimization techniques doherty 2002 it is noted that gml is based on a local search algorithm meaning that its results could be influenced by the parameters initial values kunstmann et al 2006 traditional hydrological model calibration based on a limited number of discharge stations lumps all hydrological processes together which makes it unsuitable for laying confidence on the predicted spatial variability of hydrological processes within the catchment stisen et al 2018 therefore for distributed models it is necessary to expand the traditional calibration paradigm to a more adequate framework through inclusion of observed spatial patterns in order to have confidence in the modelled spatially distributed outputs vereecken et al 2016 for this purpose satellite remote sensing rs data are considered as a reliable data source with a reasonable spatiotemporal resolution which have been utilized for model parameterizations e g schuurmans et al 2011 mendiguren et al 2017 hunink et al 2017 mizukami et al 2017 samaniego et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 and also to calibrate hydrological models e g hendricks franssen et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 li et al 2009 richey et al 2015 guzinski et al 2015 githui et al 2016 herman et al 2018 dembélé et al 2020a dembélé et al 2020b therefore applications of satellite based observations for parameter regionalization and model calibration is not novel however the spatial pattern evaluation is often overlooked demirel et al 2018 dembélé et al 2020a the rs data provides independent spatial observations of hydrological variables such as actual evapotranspiration aet that can complement the temporal data traditionally used for calibration despite overall uncertainty the rs aet data contain valuable pattern information mascaro et al 2015 which is the focus of this study here we aim at expanding the existing calibration framework for the national water resources model of denmark dk model a distributed coupled groundwater surface water model to include parametrizations and objectives focusing on the spatial pattern performance of aet we suggest a flexible spatial parameterization scheme based on available fully distributed data opposed to the typically parameter assignment based on discrete classes of landuse and soil type which can result in unrealistic parameter distributions such a spatial parameter regionalization is important as estimating spatially distributed hydrologic parameters remains a major challenge in the hydrological modeling experiments gupta et al 2014 clark et al 2016 mizukami et al 2017 seamless and physical consistent parameter distributions can be obtained with regionalization schemes where the fully distributed catchment properties soil texture topography or vegetation are linked to the effective model parameters via transfer functions these transfer functions have a low number of calibration parameters and ensure seamless distributions of the model parameters mizukami et al 2017 samaniego et al 2017 moreover we utilize a recently developed bias insensitive objective function for targeting the spatial pattern performance of aet we regard stream discharge data as the most reliable source of the water balance evaluation at catchment scale while the rs data contains valuable spatial pattern information thus the actual values of rs based aet are not the focus of the objective function because the aggregated water balance evaluation is covered by discharge observations overall a flexible transfer function is needed to generate spatially seamless model parameterizations that can potentially minimize spatial pattern oriented objective functions for calibration and evaluation of distributed hydrological models it is important to choose an appropriate set of objective functions and statistical metrics in order to build a robust optimization strategy and model performance analysis this is necessary as there is usually trade offs between different objective functions or redundant information demirel et al 2018 traditionally objective functions that evaluate cell to cell correlation and deviations e g correlation coefficient r and bias are applied for distributed models for this study we also employ an alternative objective function spatial efficiency spaef metric for the model optimization koch et al 2018 demirel et al 2018 for post calibration evaluation of the model performance in addition to the typical linear statistical metrics a robust non linear empirical copula based function sklar 1959 is applied which is capable of capturing the complex underlying dependence structures of the modelled and observed variables bárdossy 2006 recent applications highlighted the worth of using copulas for the performance evaluation of distributed hydrological models e g laux et al 2011 soltani et al 2018 in the literature of the study area only few studies utilized rs estimates to evaluate distributed hydrological models focusing on the et patterns either at a catchment scale e g guzinski et al 2015 demirel et al 2018 or the national scale of denmark e g mendiguren et al 2017 the general conclusion of the listed studies was that the spatial performance of the applied distributed hydrological models was considerably improved when the remote sensing derived datasets were implemented either for the parameter regionalization or calibration in the models applied however a spatial pattern oriented integration of remote sensing data in the model parameterization and optimization is still missing at the national scale of denmark in other words integrating rs derived spatial information into the hydrological models was suggested by guzinski et al 2015 later mendiguren et al 2017 applied the approach by replacing the rs derived temporal dynamics of leaf area index lai root depth rd and crop coefficient kc with those of the default tables in the dk model through a simple model parameterization scheme however the model was not calibrated against the remote sensing based aet patterns given the gaps described above this study addresses the following objectives i developing a national scale denmark spatially distributed regionalization optimization and evaluation framework through integrating remote sensing based et data in the dk model ii improving model s performance in simulating the spatial evapotranspiration patterns using the developed framework and iii quantifying the trade offs in the model performance on streamflow groundwater heads and aet as well as assessing the impact of the developed framework on the simulated groundwater recharge pattern across denmark 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the study area is denmark with a total land area of 42 394 km2 located in northern europe fig 1 a which has in general a flat terrain with a maximum elevation of 171 m a s l fig 1b the climate conditions of denmark are cool temperate meaning that winters are mild and summers are cool the hydroclimate is dominated by energy limited conditions for most of the year soltani et al 2021 the western regions of the country receive more than 1000 mm year annual mean precipitation which decreases towards the east fig 1c as shown in fig 1d agriculture with more than 70 coverage is the predominant land cover type together with patches of coniferous and deciduous forests while the eastern part of the country is extensively dominated by soils with a high clay fraction above 20 the western part is mainly covered with sandy soil i e less than 5 clay fraction fig 1e also the vegetation density expressed by the leaf area index is lowest in central jutland fig 1f 2 2 distributed hydrological model the dk model the national water resources model of denmark dk model was used for the simulations in this study the dk model has been developed and updated several times by the geological survey of denmark and greenland henriksen et al 2003 stisen et al 2012 højberg et al 2013 and executed within the mike she hydrological model code abbott et al 1986 mike she is a physically based distributed modelling system covering the entire land phase of the hydrological cycle abbott et al 1986 graham and butts 2005 unlike other hydrological integrated models e g parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 that apply a 3d richards equation to solve subsurface variably saturated equations mike she describes a full 3d finite difference groundwater flow 1d unsaturated flow and 2d overland flow in separate modules that are coupled two ways at every time step considering the fact that fully integrated physically based distributed hydrological models are typically computationally demanding limiting their applications to smaller areas soltani et al 2019 or without calibration maxwell et al 2015 the coupled models in mike she are computationally much more efficient which in turn enables an extensive inverse modelling for large regions stisen et al 2012 such as the national scale of denmark the national model is based on a regular 500 m grid resolution running with a daily simulation time step for increased parallelization and computational efficiency the national model is split in seven domains højberg et al 2013 which six are included in this study covering 98 of denmark excluding the baltic island of bornholm the applied domains are presented in fig 1b for detailed information about the mike she code and the dk model setup we refer to graham and butts 2005 and stisen et al 2011 and 2012 the dk model uses a two layer water balance method to calculate aet in the unsaturated zone uz as shown in fig 2 the main purpose of the two layer uz aet module which is based on a formulation presented in yan and smith 1994 is to provide an estimate of the actual evapotranspiration and the amount of water that recharges the saturated zone the method considers the entire uz which consist of two layers representing average uz conditions for which it assumes that if sufficient water is available in the root zone the water will be available for aet in the original dk model the uz aet module is parametrized by the standard curves of lai kc and rd with specific curves for specific landuse classes in this study however these variables i e lai kc and rd are modified using a regionalization scheme based on remote sensing and soil texture datasets which is fully described in section 2 2 2 2 2 1 input datasets the meteorological datasets i e precipitation temperature and reference et morphological datasets i e elevation soil type land cover and geology and regionalization datasets ndvi and clay fraction used to setup and run the dk model are overviewed in table 1 the meteorological data are daily values of dynamically corrected precipitation reference et and air temperature all provided by the danish meteorological institute dmi the reference et is calculated based on makkink stisen et al 2012 the annual precipitation in denmark is fairly evenly distributed over the year the reference et on the contrary shows a strong seasonal cycle with the lowest values in winter resulting in a distinct seasonal pattern in groundwater recharge rates with low values in summer and high in winter stisen et al 2012 the regionalization data derived from modis vegetation data ndvi and soil texture clay fraction are described in the follow up section in situ streamflow and groundwater heads gw heads datasets are used for model calibration and evaluation the discharge stations are selected based on the original dk model højberg et al 2015 stisen et al 2019 the groundwater head observations are extracted from the national well database jupiter hansen and pjetursson 2011 and a quality control process applied in which the outliers were excluded i e boreholes that deviated strongly from the surrounding groundwater wells we used the moderate resolution modis based et data derived from the modis16 hereafter mod16 algorithm mu et al 2007 at 1 km spatial resolution for calibration the algorithm is based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 and as a vegetation based rs et model it applies lai as a scalar for estimating canopy conductance and ndvi for calculation of the vegetation cover fraction mu et al 2011 since our focus is on the spatial evapotranspiration patterns thus remote sensing et estimates that are not based on land surface models but confined to the available satellite observations and their spatial information content were preferred therefore we only considered modis based et estimates in this study as they can provide a desired spatial resolution compatible with the dk model unlike coarser rs et datasets e g gleam miralles et al 2011 or the meteosat based lsa saf et ghilain et al 2011 the selected mod16 et product had previously been evaluated favorably among other modis based et estimates i e tseb and pml v2 when benchmarked against catchment scale water balance et estimates for denmark soltani et al 2021 in that paper 146 runoff gauges were chosen for a 13 year period of 2002 2014 which appropriately covered the entire denmark we estimated the water balance evapotranspiration wb et based on two standard and modified approaches in the standard method wb et was calculated using p precipitation and q discharge e t q p q where the water storage changes δs were ignored as δs can typically assumed to be negligible at long term scales mao and wang 2017 in the modified method the net intercatchment groundwater boundary flow g w n e t simulated by the dk model was also included e t q g w p q g w n e t which was used to evaluate the rs et datasets for detailed information it is referred to soltani et al 2021 2 2 2 model regionalization input data and procedure in this study the standard curves of leaf area index lai crop coefficient kc and root depth rd applied in the original dk model were replaced by the empirically derived estimates using the remote sensing vegetation data ndvi and the soil type data clay fraction through a spatial parameter regionalization scheme described below thereby the parameters distributions changes from being landuse class depended to being fully distributed lai as a parameter that describes the abundance of vegetation cannot be measured directly from satellite remote sensing however since lai and ndvi are strongly and non linearly correlated sellers et al 1992 boegh et al 2004 senay et al 2011 kamble et al 2013 ndvi is commonly used as the rs measure of vegetation greenness or photosynthetic activity ranging between 1 and 1 lai was derived from ndvi using the following empirical relationship boegh et al 2004 mendiguren et al 2017 1 l a i m 2 m 2 0 0633 e 5 524 n d v i the empirical function was chosen because it was derived from danish field data and because the standard modis lai product did not have data that passed the quality control for denmark during winter months the ndvi dataset applied for calculating lai is the mod13a1 006 terra vegetation indices 16 day global 500 m spatial resolution didan 2015 the original data has been processed into one annual curve describing the long term average climatology for each pixel this minimizes the noise but removes any inter annual variability however it is believed that inter annual variability is similar in size to the noise and it is prioritized to keep the overall annual dynamics and the spatial pattern in the data mendiguren et al 2017 the resulting mean annual climatology is repeated for each year over the entire simulation period kc is a correction parameter that accounts for the different characteristics that distinguish actual vegetation from the reference grass assumed for the reference et used in the hydrological model it is based on the lookup tables for different landuse types in the original dk model setup mendiguren et al 2017 however for the spatial parameterization scheme applied herein the spatially and temporally distributed kc was calculated as a function of lai following the approach presented in allen et al 1998 and used by stisen et al 2008 2 k c k c m i n k c m a x k c m i n 1 e a l a i where k c m i n and k c m a x are the minimum and maximum values for kc and a controls the slope of the regression which are all subject to calibration here lai was obtained from eq l rd is a vital parameter for estimating available water content and thereby et the spatio temporal distribution of rd is complex and depends on vegetation species farming practice soil climate etc for danish agricultural sites root depths have been linked mainly to crop and soil type madsen 1985 madsen 1986 madsen and platou 1983 olesen and heidmann 2002 similarly recent controlled field experiments in germany have indicated that root depths of winter wheat are significantly shallower for coarse grained soils than silty soils cai et al 2018 consequently the recommendation for danish evapotranspiration calculations are to apply a crop and soil specific root depth parametrization refsgaard et al 2011 which is also the case for the current dk model and for several danish modelling studies mendiguren et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 so far the dk model parametrization for root depth consists of 20 classes based on combinations of crop and soil type with predefined seasonality and mutually linked by a scaling factor during calibration stisen et al 2019 the key variable that defines soil type and thereby effective rooting depth according to the danish recommendations is the clay content in addition clay dominated soils have a higher water holding capacity compared to sandy soils which in combination with the higher effective rooting depth generally will induce higher evapotranspiration rates furthermore the effective rooting depth of a crop will normally vary over the season as the crops grow and wilt for this reason ndvi should also be included in the root depth parameterization as a measure of the temporal and spatial changes in vegetation koch et al 2017 mendiguren et al 2017 the soil data applied in this study is based on laboratory analysis of 40 000 samples of top soil collected across the study area see fig 1e that have been interpolated to a 250 250 m raster grid of soil characteristics for denmark greve et al 2007 it is assumed that effective root depth is positively correlated to clay fraction and ndvi the proposed formulation for estimating root depth consists of several steps as follows a flexible function was first designed which determines the shape of the function relating clay fraction and root depth between a specified range of minimum and maximum values this was performed to avoid making any strict assumptions on the shape of the curve instead letting the optimal solution be identified through calibration then root depth is scaled to ndvi in order to include the temporal variation of vegetation finally a weighting factor was introduced which determines the relative importance of clay fraction and ndvi in calculating the root depth distribution the equations applied are described below first an intermediate root depth in each cell i was calculated as a function of clay fraction cf using a modification of the generalized logistic function as it allows for high flexibility 3 r d i n t e r i 1 1 e x p c c f i m where c and m control the curve shape and midpoint of the curve respectively see fig 3 the clay fraction map can initially be truncated by a saturation threshold cfsat above which rd does not follow clay fraction the intermediate root depth map r d i n t e r was subsequently normalized between 0 and 1 and scaled to the calibration parameters r d u p p e r and r d l o w e r which control the upper and lower bounds of the annual maximum root depth and calculated as follows 4 r d m a x i c f m m r d i n t e r i r d i n t e r m i n r d i n t e r m a x r d i n t e r m i n r d u p p e r r d l o w e r r d l o w e r where r d i n t e r m i n and r d i n t e r m a x are minimum and maximum values of the intermediate root depth map r d m a x i as a function of clay fraction for different combinations of c and m with fixed values r d u p p e r 1500 mm and r d l o w e r 1000 mm is represented in fig 3a which illustrates eqs 3 and 4 the maximum root depth was scaled to ndvi the ndvi in grid cell i and timestep t was scaled using the following equation 5 n d v i s c a l e d i t n d v i i t n d v i m i n n d v i m a x a v e n d v i m i n where n d v i m i n is an array of min values over all time steps and n d v i m a x a v e is the mean value across the domain of the ndvi maximum array over all time steps through the rescaling ndviscaled i t becomes a factor reflecting both seasonality and peak summer ndvi relative to other grids a final calibration parameter w ranging between 0 and 1 was introduced which determines the weight importance of ndvi relative to clay fraction and finally the effective root depth parameter in each grid cell and timestep r d i t was calculated as follows 6 r d i t m m 1 w r d m a x i c f w r d m a x i c f n d v i s c a l e d i t which consists of two parts the first part is the weighted function for maximum root depth r d m a x c f and the second weighted r d m a x c f was scaled to ndvi thus the root depth of pixel i will be equal to r d m a x if ndvi of that pixel is equal to 1 and w 1 as a flexible function a range of w parameter values can be applied in the rd weighted function a very low fig 3b and very high fig 3d values of the w parameter indicate that rd is largely controlled by the clay fraction or ndvi respectively and a combination of them when a middle range of w parameter values is used fig 3c finally these five parameters rdupper rdlower c m and w are calibration parameters see section 2 3 2 the developed spatio temporal root depth parametrization scheme is designed to match the current understanding of root depth dependency with soil type and vegetation for danish conditions it might not be valid outside our study area since other factors such as species groundwater depth and climate might dominated in other regions however we expect that the flexibility of the applied regionalization scheme should allow rd to be calibrated to most conditions 2 3 calibration scheme the parameter estimation tool pest doherty 2002 was used for the parameter estimation of the dk model based on the gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm the algorithm applies a gradient based local search method which assumes a linear optimization problem pest is model independent and can be coupled to any model through its input and output files doherty et al 2010 it minimizes a least squares objective function which is the sum of squared weighted residuals doherty 2016 7 i 1 m w i r i 2 where r i the i th residual is the difference between the model outcome and the observation for the i th observation and w is the weight applied to the objective function the parameters are optimized when is minimal while optimization of simple linear models can be achieved in one step soltani et al 2019 for nonlinear models such as the dk model setup in mike she the relationships between the model parameters and observations must be linearized to achieve the parameter estimation through an iterative process doherty 2016 subsequently the derivatives with respect to all parameters are calculated for further information about pest it is referred to doherty 2015 local search algorithms such as gml can be sensitive to the initial values of calibration parameters however this drawback can be largely minimized through repeated calibrations or in the current study deriving initial parameters from previous calibration exercises which then is further optimized by pest the main advantage of gml is its computationally effective search for a suitable parameter set soltani et al 2019 2 3 1 objective functions multiple objective functions are employed for each calibration dataset of streamflow groundwater heads and mod16 aet as no single objective encapsulates all desired aspects of the model stisen et al 2012 højberg et al 2013 the four objective functions applied in this study are overviewed below and their equations with descriptions are given in table 2 for streamflow calibration a total number of 305 stations we used the kling gupta efficiency kge metric kling and gupta 2009 for the general streamflow optimization in addition to kge we also used pbias s the water balance percent bias for the summer period pbias s pbias s was included since kge addresses the total annual bias and not the summer flow bias specifically højberg et al 2015 for the calibration of groundwater heads a total number of 28 277 stations an objective function based on the continuous ranked probability score crps is used for a large sets of point observations crps is a popular evaluation tool for probabilistic forecasts and model performances with an optimal value of zero gneiting et al 2005 however we used it herein as an objective function to describe the deviations between observed and simulated groundwater heads schneider et al 2020 finally the mean spatial pattern performance of aet was evaluated using the spaef metric koch et al 2018 demirel et al 2018 as objective function spaef was applied on the seasonal climatology spring and summer of the simulated and the observed spatial patterns of aet the optimal value of spaef for a perfect pattern match is 1 since three components of α β and γ see table 2 for details are bias insensitive spaef constrains merely the model outputs with regard to the pattern information derived from the remote sensing data while the water balance bias is constrained by the streamflow metrics as explained above the spatial pattern evaluation focus on the growing season april september since aet is very low and approaches potential et outside of this period and because the spatial pattens in aet vary spatially in response to soil and vegetation pattern for the growing season 2 3 2 parameter estimation strategy three different model calibration strategies were applied in this study as follows calibrating the model against discharge q and groundwater head gw heads observations hereafter cal01 extending cal01 with spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration climatology aet using spaef hereafter cal02 and adding spatial regionalization schemes of rd and kc to cal02 hereafter cal03 in the cal01 approach we calibrated the dk model based on the traditional setup meaning that no spatial parameter regionalization or aet spatial pattern objective function was applied thus cal01 is considered as a benchmark model for comparison in cal02 the spaef metric was applied for the spatial pattern performance of aet finally in cal03 which covers the main aim of the current study both spaef objective function and the model parameter regionalization scheme was applied see section 2 2 2 for details the main focus is to improve the spatial patterns of aet however in order to minimize the trade off between the water cycle components streamflow and groundwater heads were also considered which are evaluated through pbias s kge and crps objective functions see table 2 for details in all the three calibrations explained above the model was run for the period of 1990 2010 and the simulations were evaluated for the calibration period of 2000 2010 this ensures a ten year warm up period for the simulated hydrological system since initial conditions from the end of a previous model run are assigned stisen et al 2012 it is also noted that in this study a validation period was excluded due to issues related to inconsistent records of precipitation measurements after the year 2010 caused by significant rain gauge network changes in cal01 and cal02 a total number of 136 parameters of the dk model were included in the optimization process of which 21 were adjustable calibration parameters and 115 parameters were tied to them including 21 root depth parameters for the table based landuse classes however in the cal03 a total of 123 total parameters were included of which 29 were adjustable see table 3 for detailed description and 94 parameters were tied to them where those 21 root depth parameters for the table based landuse classes were excluded due to distributed rd parameterization it is noted that the selection of the 21 calibration parameters was based on the previous modelling experiments performed with the dk model while the selection of the additional 8 free parameters for cal03 is described in further detail in section 2 3 3 2 3 3 parameter sensitivity estimation a sensitivity analysis is generally capable of identifying the most important parameters that are highly sensitive to the model outputs and thus can enhance the efficiency of the calibration process soltani et al 2019 in this study the calibration parameters and the initial values were selected based on previous dk model optimizations stisen et al 2019 this selection is not only based on sensitivities but also based on linkages and similarities between parameters e g hydrogeological units and the data available to constrain them however a new sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the sensitivity of the parameters introduced through the developed parameterization schemes for kc and rd in comparison with the original 21 calibration parameters cal01 and cal02 this was achieved using the pest toolbox with perturbations of 1 which is a simple one at a time sensitivity analysis that should only serve as an indication of the parameter sensitivities doherty 2016 2 4 the dk model and pest interface the dk model is linked to pest for an automatic parameter estimation through inverse modelling in this study the procedure is shown in fig 4 the model uses meteorological and morphological inputs together with a remote sensing based parameter regionalization scheme pest requires three types of inputs i template file s to find the model parameters ii instruction file s to find the model observations and iii a control file which supplies pest with the names of all template and instruction files initial parameter values observation groups with their assigned objective functions measurement values and weights etc doherty et al 2010 for further information about the dk model setup and pest algorithm see sects 2 2 and 2 3 respectively 2 5 post calibration evaluation to comprehensively evaluate the dk model outputs a variety of metrics were employed in this study we used pbias pbias s kge see table 2 for details and mean error me i n sim i obs i n metrics to evaluate the temporal dynamics of streamflow and groundwater heads respectively also the taylor diagram taylor 2001 which combines pearson correlation coefficient r standard deviation and centered root mean square rms error and spaef see table 2 for details were used to evaluate the spatial patterns of simulated evapotranspiration since the relationships between water cycle components such as aet may be highly complex and nonlinear we also employ the concept of the empirical copulas described in follow up section to estimate the underlying dependence structures amongst the aet patterns unlike linear statistical measures nonparametric copulas are able to describe the real joint behavior of hydrometeorological variables soltani et al 2018 2 5 1 estimation of aet dependence structures using empirical copulas the copula approach sklar 1959 states that any multivariate distribution function can be decomposed into the marginal distributions and a copula which captures the dependence structure between datasets salvadori et al 2007 in this study we applied the bivariate copulas which is a nonparametric rank based approach dupuis 2007 on the simulated versus observed aet datasets to estimate their joint distributions copulas unlike classical families of symmetrical distributions e g gaussian are asymmetrical based distributions which make it possible to capture which part of the datasets are highly or weakly associated i e at lower or upper tails the copula density c is estimated based on the joint density of pseudo observations u v f x x f y y which are the normalized rank based datasets for this purpose first f x and f y of the marginal distributions are obtained using an empirical distribution function which is a bivariate kernel density estimator and then the pseudo observations are defined finally to capture the real underlying dependence structure of the variables the empirical copula density is estimated as the joint density of u v that is purely based on the real data deheuvels 1979 if r 1 1 r 1 n and r 2 1 r 2 n representing rank space values derived from the marginal distributions therefore it is formulated as 8 c n u v 1 n t 1 n 1 r 1 t n u r 2 t n v where u f x x v f y y and 1 denoting the indicator function that takes a value of 1 if the argument is true maity 2018 and n is the sample size further details about copulas can be found at salvadori et al 2007 and genest and favre 2007 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity results of 29 adjustable parameters see table 3 for details using the approach described in section 2 3 3 are plotted in fig 5 with normalized values ranging from 0 0 to 1 0 it can be seen that the parameters pertaining to the horizontal hydraulic conductivities e g kx kl1 j kx ks1 j and kx kl1 s along with drainage time constants dt agr clay and dt agr sand have the highest sensitivities to the streamflow also the aforementioned parameters show some degrees of sensitivity to the groundwater heads using the crps objective function as well as aet using spaef objective function the stream aquifer leakage parameter leak mainly shows sensitivity to gw heads it is not surprising to see that the regionalization parameters rdlower rdupper cfsat kcmin kcmax a and w affect largely evapotranspiration patterns with minor influence on gw heads and streamflow except for kcmax which also shows a considerable impact on streamflow despite a generally low sensitivity of the newly introduced c and m parameters all rd ad kc related parameters were selected for the subsequent model calibration 3 2 surface streamflow and groundwater heads performance the model performance is first evaluated in relation to streamflow and groundwater heads for evaluation of the streamflow performance 305 discharge stations we used annual pbias and summer pbias s water balance bias percent as well as the kge metric as shown in fig 6 a the annual water balance error results indicate minor changes from cal01 to cal03 mean absolute pbias from 0 148 to 0 140 respectively this implies that the model performance neither improved nor deteriorated in simulating average discharge across the three optimizations with respect to the summer water balance error pbias s fig 6b it points to generally smaller mean pbias s for cal01 approx 1 compared to cal03 approx 8 however a negligible shift between cal01 and cal03 is seen with regards to mean absolute pbias s from 0 245 to 0 251 respectively the kge fig 6c also suggests minor changes in the performance from cal01 to cal03 mean kge from 0 639 to 0 632 respectively although the average differences in streamflow performance across the calibrations are small the absolute pbias improved for most of catchments when moving from cal01 to cal03 this is highlighted in the δpbias mean absolute map in fig 6d which shows that the performance on the pbias generally improves positive absolute δpbias for cal03 compared to cal01 this is especially the case for the larger catchments resulting in a clear improvement from an areal coverage perspective the simulated groundwater heads 28 277 gw head stations were also evaluated using the mean error me for the three calibrations fig 6e together with δme map as shown in fig 6f the performance results are almost identical between the three calibrations of cal01 cal02 and cal03 with the rmse value of approx 3 75 m in all cases and with around 85 of the gw head wells having absolute errors below 5 m also a similar and low average me between cal01 me 0 008 m and cal03 me 0 025 m is achieved this is also represented in the result of δme map with small differences between cal01 and cal03 fig 6f at the national scale although some regional differences occur both streamflow and groundwater head statistics indicate that they are largely unaffected by the changes in model parameters resulting from the three calibration tests although cal03 is favorable from a pbias perspective consequently it could be difficult to select the optimal parametrization based on these objectives alone 3 3 comparison of evapotranspiration spatial patterns fig 7 presents the simulated seasonal i e spring and summer spatial evapotranspiration patterns for the three applied calibration schemes cal01 cal02 and cal03 as well as the reference aet dataset derived from the mod16 the aet maps were normalized i e each map was divided by its mean value as our main focus is to evaluate the spatial pattern similarity of aet with less emphasis on the bias the simulated aet patterns in cal01 in both spring fig 7a and summer fig 7e largely differ when compared to the reference aet model fig 7d and 7h with very low spatial efficiency values spaef 0 09 and 0 08 likewise cal02 fig 7b and 7f resulted in low spaef 0 17 in spring and 0 10 in summer which indicates a low resemblance between the spatial patterns identified in mod16 et and the dk model simulations at the national scale despite including the et pattern in the calibration nevertheless the impacts of deciduous and coniferous forests which have a low aet rate as depicted by the mod16 et fig 7d are well represented by the dk model in central jutland see fig 1 in both cal01 fig 7a and cal02 fig 7b in springtime the results of the model regionalization applied in cal03 are illustrated in fig 7c and 7 g for spring and summer respectively clearly the simulated seasonal aet spatial patterns are much more similar to the reference et data fig 7d and 7 h compared to cal01 and cal02 this is underlined by higher spaef values in both spring and summer spaef 0 52 and 0 46 also the summertime patterns indicate a particularly large improvement from cal01 and cal02 fig 7e and 7f to cal03 fig 7g with regards to the reference et model fig 7h further we analyzed the pattern similarity between the simulated and the reference normalized evapotranspiration data using a taylor diagram in spring fig 8 a and summer fig 8b the correlations r of the simulated aet patterns obtained from cal01 and cal02 with respect to the mod16 et are about r 0 25 and r 0 3 fig 8a and r 0 14 and r 0 15 fig 8b respectively correlation largely improved in cal03 with an approx r 0 6 for both spring fig 8a and summer fig 8b in terms of the centered root mean square error rmse the performance improved and rmse values decreased from 1 4 to 1 across the three calibrations in both seasons and finally the standard deviation sd indicates a reduction from 1 24 to 1 1 in cal03 in spring fig 8a but almost no improvement is notable for the summer patterns fig 8b these results are well comparable with the visual inspection of the spatial patterns in fig 7 further supported by the spaef analysis 3 3 1 copula based dependence structure of evapotranspiration the empirical copula densities correlation between the simulated aet obtained from cal01 cal02 and cal03 against the mod16 et are illustrated in fig 9 overall a linear structure of the joint relationship between cal01 aet fig 9a and cal02 aet fig 9b versus mod16 et is observed in spring in other words the density is clearly symmetrical with the highest associations in lower left corner low values and upper right corner extreme values which indicates a positive linear dependence structure however as shown in fig 9c the copula function captures a much stronger linear dependence structure when the model regionalization was included in calibration as a result both higher and especially lower ranks of cal03 aet distribution is strongly concordant with the corresponding reference et model indicating a strong positive correlation fig 9c further a similar aet dependence structure can be also seen in the summer season however copula densities are much weaker in cal01 and cal02 fig 9d and 9e when compared with the corresponding ones in spring fig 9a and 9b but cal03 is almost as good as the one achieved in spring fig 9c this conveys that a significant improvement was obtained by adding the spatial parameterization scheme to the calibration fig 9f the empirical copula based results are in a good agreement with the findings presented previously see fig 7 and fig 8 4 discussion most land surface and hydrological modelling efforts have so far been on the basis of spatially inconsistent parameter fields generated by the model s default transfer functions that relate geophysical attributes to model parameters via ad hoc parameterization schemes as problematized by e g wöhling et al 2013 rakovec et al 2016 and mizukami et al 2017 as a result models have been capable of simulating streamflow reasonably well but a poor performance has been reported with respect to the distributed model outputs such as aet spatial patterns therefore flexible transfer functions are necessary to be considered in hydrological modelling experiments in order to derive seamless parameters in a spatially consistent way in this concept a multiscale parameter regionalization mpr method was proposed by samaniego et al 2010a b implemented in the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm the method further improved in kumar et al 2013 aiming to estimate seamless global transfer function parameters across scales the robustness of mpr is that it uses transfer functions that convert basin characteristics such as vegetation soil and terrain properties into model parameters at the original scale of the geophysical data and then scales the model parameters to the desired model resolution mizukami et al 2017 however the selection of transfer functions and upscaling operators remains as one of the crucial limitations of the mpr approach samaniego et al 2017 the main focus of this study is the development of a spatial parameterization scheme and spatial pattern oriented model optimization using remote sensing data modis based ndvi and aet spatial patterns to improve the spatial pattern performance of actual evapotranspiration previous studies in denmark have attempted to integrate remote sensing data and distributed hydrological models to improve the spatial performance of the models applied with a focus on aet patterns either at catchment scale guzinski et al 2015 demirel et al 2018 or the national scale of denmark mendiguren et al 2017 the novelty of this research is the applied remote sensing based model parameter regionalization supported by robust objective functions targeting the spatial pattern performance the framework was applied for the entire land phase of denmark using a coupled groundwater surface water model and resulted in a significant improvement in the spatial patterns of simulated actual evapotranspiration fig 7c and 7g we found that the discharge and gw head based calibration strategies cal01 and cal02 conveyed little information in relation to spatial evapotranspiration patterns further traditional calibration variables q and gw heads do not necessarily lead to reasonable aet patterns when considered in the optimization of distributed hydrological models the current study introduced a new spatial regionalization of lai kc and rd based on fully distributed remote sensing vegetation data ndvi and soil texture clay fraction content as fully described in section 2 2 2 typically such datasets capture the spatiotemporal variations with more details compared to the default dk model which includes a unit based parametrization following predefined tables from refsgaard et al 2011 the resulting annual average root depth and crop coefficient maps from the three calibrations are represented in fig 10 it can be seen that the spatial pattern of rd is much more consistent and seamlessly distributed across denmark the rd obtained from cal03 though regionalization using ndvi and clay fraction fig 10c resembles the land surface characteristics better compared to cal01 fig 10a and cal02 fig 10b interestingly the flexible cal03 parametrization resulted in a much smaller range of root depths across denmark compared to the original parametrization where the ranges were fixed from literature values and scaled uniformly this implies that the range and variability of root depths which is optimal for the specific model code and process description of the dk model can be better represented through a more flexible parametrization changes were also observed in the crop coefficient distributed map fig 10f when lai was used for the kc calculation see eq 2 compared to cal01 fig 10d and cal02 fig 10e furthermore the final optimized regionalization functions for rd and kc obtained from cal03 see table 3 are plotted in fig 10g and 10 h it can be seen that a linear transfer function was achieved for the root depth as a function of clay fraction where the maximum rd is linear proportional to clay fraction scaled between rdlower 927 mm and rdupper 1435 mm fig 10g the linear solution was found optimal resulting in a dependency of clay fraction similar to the root depth transfer function example d represented in fig 3a the parameter w represents the weight that is given to the importance of ndvi in the root depth parameterization see fig 3b d an optimal w value of 0 56 see table 3 implies that part of the equation see eq 6 which includes ndvi is weighted 56 and the part which includes clay fraction is weighted by 44 similarly to the example in fig 3c also a near linear function was found for the crop coefficient as a function of ndvi where the optimal parameter values of kcmin 0 55 and kcmax 1 21 with a slope of a 0 88 were obtained fig 10 h these optimization results indicate that simpler linear regionalization functions could have been used however complex non linear and flexible transfer functions allow this to be determined case by case through optimization in different applications we also found that the seasonal aet maps indicate a shifting pattern across denmark where the lowest values in springtime are found in the central and western parts while the low aet region shift towards the eastern regions in the summertime as observed in mod16 et maps fig 7d and 7 h this is appropriately captured in cal03 as a result of the rd and kc spatial parameterizations shown in fig 10c and 10f on the contrary the cal01 and cal02 approaches that use the default tables of rd and kc curves fig 10a d 10b e generally failed to capture this shifting pattern in aet across the country see fig 7 in the hydrological modelling community it is commonly believed that with a lack of valid input data or reasonable parametrizations almost any model will produce unreliable outputs this implies that the quality of a model output is mainly determined by the quality of its input schultz 1988 this study highlights the capability of satellite remote sensing data applied in a model parameter regionalization scheme to improve the spatial representation of hydrological processes such as aet in land surface and hydrological models e g mendiguren et al 2017 herman et al 2018 dembélé et al 2020a it also must be noted that the overall performance of the model on streamflow and groundwater heads see fig 6 did not deteriorate when improving the aet spatial patterns notably by adding new parametrizations and objectives in cal03 see fig 7 this indicates a minimum trade off between the performance on streamflow groundwater head and aet is achievable when the objectives are designed to mutually capture dynamics and water balances groundwater heads and spatial patterns similar results were obtained by mendiguren et al 2017 using the dk model and demirel et al 2018 using the mhm model related to this koch et al 2016 found limited sensitivity of temporal discharge performance to spatial patterns of soil moisture simulated by three different distributed hydrological models future modelling studies should consider a variety of water cycle components discharge evapotranspiration and groundwater heads in the model evaluation process reflecting both temporal and spatial model characteristics besides the model performance against observations it is interesting to evaluate the impact of the developed framework i e the regionalization calibration scheme on additional hydrological fluxes or variables which are not included in the calibration but simulated in the dk model an example of such a variable is the groundwater recharge from unsaturated zone uz to saturated zone sz as shown in fig 11 it can be observed that the spatial pattern of simulated recharge closely follows the distributions of precipitation which decreases smoothly from the western regions towards the east see fig 1c and the soil texture where the most sandy soils with less than 5 clay fraction are found in the western regions see fig 1e across denmark during the calibrations of cal01 fig 11a and cal03 fig 11b however according to the δrecharge map fig 11c the annual recharge to sz decreases the positive values in western jutland and north of sealand see fig 1b for the locations while it increased negative values in most of eastern denmark when moving from cal01 to cal03 this signifies a spatial redistribution in the water balance originating from the corresponding changes in aet fig 7 which also had a generally positive impact on the larger scale water balances compared to streamflow fig 6d in relation to the model performance evaluation the non parametric empirical copula based approach applied herein was appropriately capable of capturing the underlying dependence structures between the spatial evapotranspiration patterns simulated by the model and derived from the remote sensing observations and also amongst other hydrometeorological variables e g bárdossy 2006 laux et al 2011 soltani et al 2018 therefore in addition to the traditional linear based statistical metrics e g correlation coefficient r values copula approach is highly recommended to be considered in other regions with more complex environments for estimating the true relationships amongst water balance or energy balance components 5 conclusions the remote sensing data modis based ndvi and aet spatial patterns was integrated in the dk model to improve the simulations of the spatial patterns in actual evapotranspiration at the national scale of denmark this was achieved by both a spatial parameter regionalization scheme and a spatial pattern oriented optimization based on three model calibration strategies the key findings can be summarized as follows the spatial parameter regionalization using a combination of satellite vegetation data ndvi and soil data clay fraction can largely improve the predictive performance of the distributed hydrological model to accurately reproduce the spatial evapotranspiration patterns model calibration using only streamflow and groundwater heads does not necessarily contribute to improve the distributed aet maps as they convey a little information with regards to aet spatial patterns the proposed rs based parameter regionalization calibration scheme significantly improved the aet spatial patterns with a very limited trade off between the water cycle components of evapotranspiration streamflow and groundwater heads overall the results underline the benefits of using bias insensitive spatial pattern information derived from remote sensing satellite data which yields a better model spatial performance the aet spatial regionalization and optimization approach proposed in this study can be considered by the hydrological modelling community to apply in more complex environments with any hydrological models in particular it is recommended that the results from the developed framework are implemented in the national water resources model dk model to further improve the simulations in major water

4076,hydrological models have traditionally been calibrated and evaluated against point scale observations such as streamflow emphasizing the temporal but not necessarily the spatial component of a model the main goal of this study is to improve the spatial pattern performance of simulated actual evapotranspiration aet a key variable in the land atmosphere interface for the entire land phase of denmark this is achieved by integrating fully distributed remote sensing rs data and robust objective functions in the regionalization and optimization of the national water resources model of denmark dk model for this monthly spatial patterns of modis16 et at 1 km resolution are used as a reference rs et estimate in the model calibration we applied a gradient based nonlinear gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm for parameter estimation via inverse modeling the proposed optimization framework includes three calibration strategies cal01 represents the traditional calibration approach against discharge and groundwater head observations only cal02 expands cal01 by means of a spatial pattern oriented objective function namely the spatial efficiency spaef metric targeting et pattern performance cal03 adds to cal02 an additional parameter regionalization scheme where the original fixed land use class dependent distribution and seasonal development of leaf area index lai crop coefficient kc and root depth rd are replaced with empirical schemes driven by distributed vegetation ndvi and soil texture clay fraction data our results reveal that a significant improvement in the simulated spatial patterns of aet is obtained when combining regionalization schemes and a spatial pattern oriented objective function in cal03 which is highlighted by a copula analysis also at the same time a very limited trade off in the model performance of aet patterns streamflow and groundwater heads is observed finally the regionalization scheme cal03 affected the simulated groundwater recharge according to changes of aet the findings of this study contribute to further improve spatial representation and evaluation of hydrological models and highlight the need to carefully design regionalization schemes as well as objective functions in fully distributed models keywords spatial evapotranspiration patterns streamflow and groundwater heads satellite remote sensing model parameterization and calibration hydrological modeling 1 introduction physically based distributed hydrological models are an essential tool for a wide range of water resources applications such as providing overall insights into catchment scale water and energy budgets or quantification and prediction of hydrological responses under changing conditions such models unlike lumped models are particularly useful for quantifying the effect of human interferences on land use change and groundwater abstraction beven 1996 refsgaard 1996 butts and graham 2014 the spatial predictive performance of these models is severely hampered by the general lack of suitable spatial pattern oriented model evaluation frameworks because their evaluations traditionally focus on the spatially aggregated objective functions like streamflow beven 1996 beven and freer 2001 grayson et al 2002 demirel et al 2018 if the spatial variability of a hydrological system is neglected in the evaluation it may not be worth applying a physically based distributed model in the first place since many studies indicate that equal model performance could be achieved using lumped and semi distributed conceptual modelling approaches when evaluated merely at the catchment outlet stisen et al 2011 butts and graham 2014 vansteenkiste et al 2014 automatic optimization algorithms are required when comparing different calibration designs since they enable an objective search process and more robust results bahremand and de smedt 2008 stisen et al 2011 among the optimization algorithms used in hydrological modelling the gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm as included in the parameter estimation tool pest estimates parameters of non linear models using often fewer model runs than alternative optimization techniques doherty 2002 it is noted that gml is based on a local search algorithm meaning that its results could be influenced by the parameters initial values kunstmann et al 2006 traditional hydrological model calibration based on a limited number of discharge stations lumps all hydrological processes together which makes it unsuitable for laying confidence on the predicted spatial variability of hydrological processes within the catchment stisen et al 2018 therefore for distributed models it is necessary to expand the traditional calibration paradigm to a more adequate framework through inclusion of observed spatial patterns in order to have confidence in the modelled spatially distributed outputs vereecken et al 2016 for this purpose satellite remote sensing rs data are considered as a reliable data source with a reasonable spatiotemporal resolution which have been utilized for model parameterizations e g schuurmans et al 2011 mendiguren et al 2017 hunink et al 2017 mizukami et al 2017 samaniego et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 and also to calibrate hydrological models e g hendricks franssen et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 li et al 2009 richey et al 2015 guzinski et al 2015 githui et al 2016 herman et al 2018 dembélé et al 2020a dembélé et al 2020b therefore applications of satellite based observations for parameter regionalization and model calibration is not novel however the spatial pattern evaluation is often overlooked demirel et al 2018 dembélé et al 2020a the rs data provides independent spatial observations of hydrological variables such as actual evapotranspiration aet that can complement the temporal data traditionally used for calibration despite overall uncertainty the rs aet data contain valuable pattern information mascaro et al 2015 which is the focus of this study here we aim at expanding the existing calibration framework for the national water resources model of denmark dk model a distributed coupled groundwater surface water model to include parametrizations and objectives focusing on the spatial pattern performance of aet we suggest a flexible spatial parameterization scheme based on available fully distributed data opposed to the typically parameter assignment based on discrete classes of landuse and soil type which can result in unrealistic parameter distributions such a spatial parameter regionalization is important as estimating spatially distributed hydrologic parameters remains a major challenge in the hydrological modeling experiments gupta et al 2014 clark et al 2016 mizukami et al 2017 seamless and physical consistent parameter distributions can be obtained with regionalization schemes where the fully distributed catchment properties soil texture topography or vegetation are linked to the effective model parameters via transfer functions these transfer functions have a low number of calibration parameters and ensure seamless distributions of the model parameters mizukami et al 2017 samaniego et al 2017 moreover we utilize a recently developed bias insensitive objective function for targeting the spatial pattern performance of aet we regard stream discharge data as the most reliable source of the water balance evaluation at catchment scale while the rs data contains valuable spatial pattern information thus the actual values of rs based aet are not the focus of the objective function because the aggregated water balance evaluation is covered by discharge observations overall a flexible transfer function is needed to generate spatially seamless model parameterizations that can potentially minimize spatial pattern oriented objective functions for calibration and evaluation of distributed hydrological models it is important to choose an appropriate set of objective functions and statistical metrics in order to build a robust optimization strategy and model performance analysis this is necessary as there is usually trade offs between different objective functions or redundant information demirel et al 2018 traditionally objective functions that evaluate cell to cell correlation and deviations e g correlation coefficient r and bias are applied for distributed models for this study we also employ an alternative objective function spatial efficiency spaef metric for the model optimization koch et al 2018 demirel et al 2018 for post calibration evaluation of the model performance in addition to the typical linear statistical metrics a robust non linear empirical copula based function sklar 1959 is applied which is capable of capturing the complex underlying dependence structures of the modelled and observed variables bárdossy 2006 recent applications highlighted the worth of using copulas for the performance evaluation of distributed hydrological models e g laux et al 2011 soltani et al 2018 in the literature of the study area only few studies utilized rs estimates to evaluate distributed hydrological models focusing on the et patterns either at a catchment scale e g guzinski et al 2015 demirel et al 2018 or the national scale of denmark e g mendiguren et al 2017 the general conclusion of the listed studies was that the spatial performance of the applied distributed hydrological models was considerably improved when the remote sensing derived datasets were implemented either for the parameter regionalization or calibration in the models applied however a spatial pattern oriented integration of remote sensing data in the model parameterization and optimization is still missing at the national scale of denmark in other words integrating rs derived spatial information into the hydrological models was suggested by guzinski et al 2015 later mendiguren et al 2017 applied the approach by replacing the rs derived temporal dynamics of leaf area index lai root depth rd and crop coefficient kc with those of the default tables in the dk model through a simple model parameterization scheme however the model was not calibrated against the remote sensing based aet patterns given the gaps described above this study addresses the following objectives i developing a national scale denmark spatially distributed regionalization optimization and evaluation framework through integrating remote sensing based et data in the dk model ii improving model s performance in simulating the spatial evapotranspiration patterns using the developed framework and iii quantifying the trade offs in the model performance on streamflow groundwater heads and aet as well as assessing the impact of the developed framework on the simulated groundwater recharge pattern across denmark 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the study area is denmark with a total land area of 42 394 km2 located in northern europe fig 1 a which has in general a flat terrain with a maximum elevation of 171 m a s l fig 1b the climate conditions of denmark are cool temperate meaning that winters are mild and summers are cool the hydroclimate is dominated by energy limited conditions for most of the year soltani et al 2021 the western regions of the country receive more than 1000 mm year annual mean precipitation which decreases towards the east fig 1c as shown in fig 1d agriculture with more than 70 coverage is the predominant land cover type together with patches of coniferous and deciduous forests while the eastern part of the country is extensively dominated by soils with a high clay fraction above 20 the western part is mainly covered with sandy soil i e less than 5 clay fraction fig 1e also the vegetation density expressed by the leaf area index is lowest in central jutland fig 1f 2 2 distributed hydrological model the dk model the national water resources model of denmark dk model was used for the simulations in this study the dk model has been developed and updated several times by the geological survey of denmark and greenland henriksen et al 2003 stisen et al 2012 højberg et al 2013 and executed within the mike she hydrological model code abbott et al 1986 mike she is a physically based distributed modelling system covering the entire land phase of the hydrological cycle abbott et al 1986 graham and butts 2005 unlike other hydrological integrated models e g parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 that apply a 3d richards equation to solve subsurface variably saturated equations mike she describes a full 3d finite difference groundwater flow 1d unsaturated flow and 2d overland flow in separate modules that are coupled two ways at every time step considering the fact that fully integrated physically based distributed hydrological models are typically computationally demanding limiting their applications to smaller areas soltani et al 2019 or without calibration maxwell et al 2015 the coupled models in mike she are computationally much more efficient which in turn enables an extensive inverse modelling for large regions stisen et al 2012 such as the national scale of denmark the national model is based on a regular 500 m grid resolution running with a daily simulation time step for increased parallelization and computational efficiency the national model is split in seven domains højberg et al 2013 which six are included in this study covering 98 of denmark excluding the baltic island of bornholm the applied domains are presented in fig 1b for detailed information about the mike she code and the dk model setup we refer to graham and butts 2005 and stisen et al 2011 and 2012 the dk model uses a two layer water balance method to calculate aet in the unsaturated zone uz as shown in fig 2 the main purpose of the two layer uz aet module which is based on a formulation presented in yan and smith 1994 is to provide an estimate of the actual evapotranspiration and the amount of water that recharges the saturated zone the method considers the entire uz which consist of two layers representing average uz conditions for which it assumes that if sufficient water is available in the root zone the water will be available for aet in the original dk model the uz aet module is parametrized by the standard curves of lai kc and rd with specific curves for specific landuse classes in this study however these variables i e lai kc and rd are modified using a regionalization scheme based on remote sensing and soil texture datasets which is fully described in section 2 2 2 2 2 1 input datasets the meteorological datasets i e precipitation temperature and reference et morphological datasets i e elevation soil type land cover and geology and regionalization datasets ndvi and clay fraction used to setup and run the dk model are overviewed in table 1 the meteorological data are daily values of dynamically corrected precipitation reference et and air temperature all provided by the danish meteorological institute dmi the reference et is calculated based on makkink stisen et al 2012 the annual precipitation in denmark is fairly evenly distributed over the year the reference et on the contrary shows a strong seasonal cycle with the lowest values in winter resulting in a distinct seasonal pattern in groundwater recharge rates with low values in summer and high in winter stisen et al 2012 the regionalization data derived from modis vegetation data ndvi and soil texture clay fraction are described in the follow up section in situ streamflow and groundwater heads gw heads datasets are used for model calibration and evaluation the discharge stations are selected based on the original dk model højberg et al 2015 stisen et al 2019 the groundwater head observations are extracted from the national well database jupiter hansen and pjetursson 2011 and a quality control process applied in which the outliers were excluded i e boreholes that deviated strongly from the surrounding groundwater wells we used the moderate resolution modis based et data derived from the modis16 hereafter mod16 algorithm mu et al 2007 at 1 km spatial resolution for calibration the algorithm is based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 and as a vegetation based rs et model it applies lai as a scalar for estimating canopy conductance and ndvi for calculation of the vegetation cover fraction mu et al 2011 since our focus is on the spatial evapotranspiration patterns thus remote sensing et estimates that are not based on land surface models but confined to the available satellite observations and their spatial information content were preferred therefore we only considered modis based et estimates in this study as they can provide a desired spatial resolution compatible with the dk model unlike coarser rs et datasets e g gleam miralles et al 2011 or the meteosat based lsa saf et ghilain et al 2011 the selected mod16 et product had previously been evaluated favorably among other modis based et estimates i e tseb and pml v2 when benchmarked against catchment scale water balance et estimates for denmark soltani et al 2021 in that paper 146 runoff gauges were chosen for a 13 year period of 2002 2014 which appropriately covered the entire denmark we estimated the water balance evapotranspiration wb et based on two standard and modified approaches in the standard method wb et was calculated using p precipitation and q discharge e t q p q where the water storage changes δs were ignored as δs can typically assumed to be negligible at long term scales mao and wang 2017 in the modified method the net intercatchment groundwater boundary flow g w n e t simulated by the dk model was also included e t q g w p q g w n e t which was used to evaluate the rs et datasets for detailed information it is referred to soltani et al 2021 2 2 2 model regionalization input data and procedure in this study the standard curves of leaf area index lai crop coefficient kc and root depth rd applied in the original dk model were replaced by the empirically derived estimates using the remote sensing vegetation data ndvi and the soil type data clay fraction through a spatial parameter regionalization scheme described below thereby the parameters distributions changes from being landuse class depended to being fully distributed lai as a parameter that describes the abundance of vegetation cannot be measured directly from satellite remote sensing however since lai and ndvi are strongly and non linearly correlated sellers et al 1992 boegh et al 2004 senay et al 2011 kamble et al 2013 ndvi is commonly used as the rs measure of vegetation greenness or photosynthetic activity ranging between 1 and 1 lai was derived from ndvi using the following empirical relationship boegh et al 2004 mendiguren et al 2017 1 l a i m 2 m 2 0 0633 e 5 524 n d v i the empirical function was chosen because it was derived from danish field data and because the standard modis lai product did not have data that passed the quality control for denmark during winter months the ndvi dataset applied for calculating lai is the mod13a1 006 terra vegetation indices 16 day global 500 m spatial resolution didan 2015 the original data has been processed into one annual curve describing the long term average climatology for each pixel this minimizes the noise but removes any inter annual variability however it is believed that inter annual variability is similar in size to the noise and it is prioritized to keep the overall annual dynamics and the spatial pattern in the data mendiguren et al 2017 the resulting mean annual climatology is repeated for each year over the entire simulation period kc is a correction parameter that accounts for the different characteristics that distinguish actual vegetation from the reference grass assumed for the reference et used in the hydrological model it is based on the lookup tables for different landuse types in the original dk model setup mendiguren et al 2017 however for the spatial parameterization scheme applied herein the spatially and temporally distributed kc was calculated as a function of lai following the approach presented in allen et al 1998 and used by stisen et al 2008 2 k c k c m i n k c m a x k c m i n 1 e a l a i where k c m i n and k c m a x are the minimum and maximum values for kc and a controls the slope of the regression which are all subject to calibration here lai was obtained from eq l rd is a vital parameter for estimating available water content and thereby et the spatio temporal distribution of rd is complex and depends on vegetation species farming practice soil climate etc for danish agricultural sites root depths have been linked mainly to crop and soil type madsen 1985 madsen 1986 madsen and platou 1983 olesen and heidmann 2002 similarly recent controlled field experiments in germany have indicated that root depths of winter wheat are significantly shallower for coarse grained soils than silty soils cai et al 2018 consequently the recommendation for danish evapotranspiration calculations are to apply a crop and soil specific root depth parametrization refsgaard et al 2011 which is also the case for the current dk model and for several danish modelling studies mendiguren et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 so far the dk model parametrization for root depth consists of 20 classes based on combinations of crop and soil type with predefined seasonality and mutually linked by a scaling factor during calibration stisen et al 2019 the key variable that defines soil type and thereby effective rooting depth according to the danish recommendations is the clay content in addition clay dominated soils have a higher water holding capacity compared to sandy soils which in combination with the higher effective rooting depth generally will induce higher evapotranspiration rates furthermore the effective rooting depth of a crop will normally vary over the season as the crops grow and wilt for this reason ndvi should also be included in the root depth parameterization as a measure of the temporal and spatial changes in vegetation koch et al 2017 mendiguren et al 2017 the soil data applied in this study is based on laboratory analysis of 40 000 samples of top soil collected across the study area see fig 1e that have been interpolated to a 250 250 m raster grid of soil characteristics for denmark greve et al 2007 it is assumed that effective root depth is positively correlated to clay fraction and ndvi the proposed formulation for estimating root depth consists of several steps as follows a flexible function was first designed which determines the shape of the function relating clay fraction and root depth between a specified range of minimum and maximum values this was performed to avoid making any strict assumptions on the shape of the curve instead letting the optimal solution be identified through calibration then root depth is scaled to ndvi in order to include the temporal variation of vegetation finally a weighting factor was introduced which determines the relative importance of clay fraction and ndvi in calculating the root depth distribution the equations applied are described below first an intermediate root depth in each cell i was calculated as a function of clay fraction cf using a modification of the generalized logistic function as it allows for high flexibility 3 r d i n t e r i 1 1 e x p c c f i m where c and m control the curve shape and midpoint of the curve respectively see fig 3 the clay fraction map can initially be truncated by a saturation threshold cfsat above which rd does not follow clay fraction the intermediate root depth map r d i n t e r was subsequently normalized between 0 and 1 and scaled to the calibration parameters r d u p p e r and r d l o w e r which control the upper and lower bounds of the annual maximum root depth and calculated as follows 4 r d m a x i c f m m r d i n t e r i r d i n t e r m i n r d i n t e r m a x r d i n t e r m i n r d u p p e r r d l o w e r r d l o w e r where r d i n t e r m i n and r d i n t e r m a x are minimum and maximum values of the intermediate root depth map r d m a x i as a function of clay fraction for different combinations of c and m with fixed values r d u p p e r 1500 mm and r d l o w e r 1000 mm is represented in fig 3a which illustrates eqs 3 and 4 the maximum root depth was scaled to ndvi the ndvi in grid cell i and timestep t was scaled using the following equation 5 n d v i s c a l e d i t n d v i i t n d v i m i n n d v i m a x a v e n d v i m i n where n d v i m i n is an array of min values over all time steps and n d v i m a x a v e is the mean value across the domain of the ndvi maximum array over all time steps through the rescaling ndviscaled i t becomes a factor reflecting both seasonality and peak summer ndvi relative to other grids a final calibration parameter w ranging between 0 and 1 was introduced which determines the weight importance of ndvi relative to clay fraction and finally the effective root depth parameter in each grid cell and timestep r d i t was calculated as follows 6 r d i t m m 1 w r d m a x i c f w r d m a x i c f n d v i s c a l e d i t which consists of two parts the first part is the weighted function for maximum root depth r d m a x c f and the second weighted r d m a x c f was scaled to ndvi thus the root depth of pixel i will be equal to r d m a x if ndvi of that pixel is equal to 1 and w 1 as a flexible function a range of w parameter values can be applied in the rd weighted function a very low fig 3b and very high fig 3d values of the w parameter indicate that rd is largely controlled by the clay fraction or ndvi respectively and a combination of them when a middle range of w parameter values is used fig 3c finally these five parameters rdupper rdlower c m and w are calibration parameters see section 2 3 2 the developed spatio temporal root depth parametrization scheme is designed to match the current understanding of root depth dependency with soil type and vegetation for danish conditions it might not be valid outside our study area since other factors such as species groundwater depth and climate might dominated in other regions however we expect that the flexibility of the applied regionalization scheme should allow rd to be calibrated to most conditions 2 3 calibration scheme the parameter estimation tool pest doherty 2002 was used for the parameter estimation of the dk model based on the gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm the algorithm applies a gradient based local search method which assumes a linear optimization problem pest is model independent and can be coupled to any model through its input and output files doherty et al 2010 it minimizes a least squares objective function which is the sum of squared weighted residuals doherty 2016 7 i 1 m w i r i 2 where r i the i th residual is the difference between the model outcome and the observation for the i th observation and w is the weight applied to the objective function the parameters are optimized when is minimal while optimization of simple linear models can be achieved in one step soltani et al 2019 for nonlinear models such as the dk model setup in mike she the relationships between the model parameters and observations must be linearized to achieve the parameter estimation through an iterative process doherty 2016 subsequently the derivatives with respect to all parameters are calculated for further information about pest it is referred to doherty 2015 local search algorithms such as gml can be sensitive to the initial values of calibration parameters however this drawback can be largely minimized through repeated calibrations or in the current study deriving initial parameters from previous calibration exercises which then is further optimized by pest the main advantage of gml is its computationally effective search for a suitable parameter set soltani et al 2019 2 3 1 objective functions multiple objective functions are employed for each calibration dataset of streamflow groundwater heads and mod16 aet as no single objective encapsulates all desired aspects of the model stisen et al 2012 højberg et al 2013 the four objective functions applied in this study are overviewed below and their equations with descriptions are given in table 2 for streamflow calibration a total number of 305 stations we used the kling gupta efficiency kge metric kling and gupta 2009 for the general streamflow optimization in addition to kge we also used pbias s the water balance percent bias for the summer period pbias s pbias s was included since kge addresses the total annual bias and not the summer flow bias specifically højberg et al 2015 for the calibration of groundwater heads a total number of 28 277 stations an objective function based on the continuous ranked probability score crps is used for a large sets of point observations crps is a popular evaluation tool for probabilistic forecasts and model performances with an optimal value of zero gneiting et al 2005 however we used it herein as an objective function to describe the deviations between observed and simulated groundwater heads schneider et al 2020 finally the mean spatial pattern performance of aet was evaluated using the spaef metric koch et al 2018 demirel et al 2018 as objective function spaef was applied on the seasonal climatology spring and summer of the simulated and the observed spatial patterns of aet the optimal value of spaef for a perfect pattern match is 1 since three components of α β and γ see table 2 for details are bias insensitive spaef constrains merely the model outputs with regard to the pattern information derived from the remote sensing data while the water balance bias is constrained by the streamflow metrics as explained above the spatial pattern evaluation focus on the growing season april september since aet is very low and approaches potential et outside of this period and because the spatial pattens in aet vary spatially in response to soil and vegetation pattern for the growing season 2 3 2 parameter estimation strategy three different model calibration strategies were applied in this study as follows calibrating the model against discharge q and groundwater head gw heads observations hereafter cal01 extending cal01 with spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration climatology aet using spaef hereafter cal02 and adding spatial regionalization schemes of rd and kc to cal02 hereafter cal03 in the cal01 approach we calibrated the dk model based on the traditional setup meaning that no spatial parameter regionalization or aet spatial pattern objective function was applied thus cal01 is considered as a benchmark model for comparison in cal02 the spaef metric was applied for the spatial pattern performance of aet finally in cal03 which covers the main aim of the current study both spaef objective function and the model parameter regionalization scheme was applied see section 2 2 2 for details the main focus is to improve the spatial patterns of aet however in order to minimize the trade off between the water cycle components streamflow and groundwater heads were also considered which are evaluated through pbias s kge and crps objective functions see table 2 for details in all the three calibrations explained above the model was run for the period of 1990 2010 and the simulations were evaluated for the calibration period of 2000 2010 this ensures a ten year warm up period for the simulated hydrological system since initial conditions from the end of a previous model run are assigned stisen et al 2012 it is also noted that in this study a validation period was excluded due to issues related to inconsistent records of precipitation measurements after the year 2010 caused by significant rain gauge network changes in cal01 and cal02 a total number of 136 parameters of the dk model were included in the optimization process of which 21 were adjustable calibration parameters and 115 parameters were tied to them including 21 root depth parameters for the table based landuse classes however in the cal03 a total of 123 total parameters were included of which 29 were adjustable see table 3 for detailed description and 94 parameters were tied to them where those 21 root depth parameters for the table based landuse classes were excluded due to distributed rd parameterization it is noted that the selection of the 21 calibration parameters was based on the previous modelling experiments performed with the dk model while the selection of the additional 8 free parameters for cal03 is described in further detail in section 2 3 3 2 3 3 parameter sensitivity estimation a sensitivity analysis is generally capable of identifying the most important parameters that are highly sensitive to the model outputs and thus can enhance the efficiency of the calibration process soltani et al 2019 in this study the calibration parameters and the initial values were selected based on previous dk model optimizations stisen et al 2019 this selection is not only based on sensitivities but also based on linkages and similarities between parameters e g hydrogeological units and the data available to constrain them however a new sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the sensitivity of the parameters introduced through the developed parameterization schemes for kc and rd in comparison with the original 21 calibration parameters cal01 and cal02 this was achieved using the pest toolbox with perturbations of 1 which is a simple one at a time sensitivity analysis that should only serve as an indication of the parameter sensitivities doherty 2016 2 4 the dk model and pest interface the dk model is linked to pest for an automatic parameter estimation through inverse modelling in this study the procedure is shown in fig 4 the model uses meteorological and morphological inputs together with a remote sensing based parameter regionalization scheme pest requires three types of inputs i template file s to find the model parameters ii instruction file s to find the model observations and iii a control file which supplies pest with the names of all template and instruction files initial parameter values observation groups with their assigned objective functions measurement values and weights etc doherty et al 2010 for further information about the dk model setup and pest algorithm see sects 2 2 and 2 3 respectively 2 5 post calibration evaluation to comprehensively evaluate the dk model outputs a variety of metrics were employed in this study we used pbias pbias s kge see table 2 for details and mean error me i n sim i obs i n metrics to evaluate the temporal dynamics of streamflow and groundwater heads respectively also the taylor diagram taylor 2001 which combines pearson correlation coefficient r standard deviation and centered root mean square rms error and spaef see table 2 for details were used to evaluate the spatial patterns of simulated evapotranspiration since the relationships between water cycle components such as aet may be highly complex and nonlinear we also employ the concept of the empirical copulas described in follow up section to estimate the underlying dependence structures amongst the aet patterns unlike linear statistical measures nonparametric copulas are able to describe the real joint behavior of hydrometeorological variables soltani et al 2018 2 5 1 estimation of aet dependence structures using empirical copulas the copula approach sklar 1959 states that any multivariate distribution function can be decomposed into the marginal distributions and a copula which captures the dependence structure between datasets salvadori et al 2007 in this study we applied the bivariate copulas which is a nonparametric rank based approach dupuis 2007 on the simulated versus observed aet datasets to estimate their joint distributions copulas unlike classical families of symmetrical distributions e g gaussian are asymmetrical based distributions which make it possible to capture which part of the datasets are highly or weakly associated i e at lower or upper tails the copula density c is estimated based on the joint density of pseudo observations u v f x x f y y which are the normalized rank based datasets for this purpose first f x and f y of the marginal distributions are obtained using an empirical distribution function which is a bivariate kernel density estimator and then the pseudo observations are defined finally to capture the real underlying dependence structure of the variables the empirical copula density is estimated as the joint density of u v that is purely based on the real data deheuvels 1979 if r 1 1 r 1 n and r 2 1 r 2 n representing rank space values derived from the marginal distributions therefore it is formulated as 8 c n u v 1 n t 1 n 1 r 1 t n u r 2 t n v where u f x x v f y y and 1 denoting the indicator function that takes a value of 1 if the argument is true maity 2018 and n is the sample size further details about copulas can be found at salvadori et al 2007 and genest and favre 2007 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity results of 29 adjustable parameters see table 3 for details using the approach described in section 2 3 3 are plotted in fig 5 with normalized values ranging from 0 0 to 1 0 it can be seen that the parameters pertaining to the horizontal hydraulic conductivities e g kx kl1 j kx ks1 j and kx kl1 s along with drainage time constants dt agr clay and dt agr sand have the highest sensitivities to the streamflow also the aforementioned parameters show some degrees of sensitivity to the groundwater heads using the crps objective function as well as aet using spaef objective function the stream aquifer leakage parameter leak mainly shows sensitivity to gw heads it is not surprising to see that the regionalization parameters rdlower rdupper cfsat kcmin kcmax a and w affect largely evapotranspiration patterns with minor influence on gw heads and streamflow except for kcmax which also shows a considerable impact on streamflow despite a generally low sensitivity of the newly introduced c and m parameters all rd ad kc related parameters were selected for the subsequent model calibration 3 2 surface streamflow and groundwater heads performance the model performance is first evaluated in relation to streamflow and groundwater heads for evaluation of the streamflow performance 305 discharge stations we used annual pbias and summer pbias s water balance bias percent as well as the kge metric as shown in fig 6 a the annual water balance error results indicate minor changes from cal01 to cal03 mean absolute pbias from 0 148 to 0 140 respectively this implies that the model performance neither improved nor deteriorated in simulating average discharge across the three optimizations with respect to the summer water balance error pbias s fig 6b it points to generally smaller mean pbias s for cal01 approx 1 compared to cal03 approx 8 however a negligible shift between cal01 and cal03 is seen with regards to mean absolute pbias s from 0 245 to 0 251 respectively the kge fig 6c also suggests minor changes in the performance from cal01 to cal03 mean kge from 0 639 to 0 632 respectively although the average differences in streamflow performance across the calibrations are small the absolute pbias improved for most of catchments when moving from cal01 to cal03 this is highlighted in the δpbias mean absolute map in fig 6d which shows that the performance on the pbias generally improves positive absolute δpbias for cal03 compared to cal01 this is especially the case for the larger catchments resulting in a clear improvement from an areal coverage perspective the simulated groundwater heads 28 277 gw head stations were also evaluated using the mean error me for the three calibrations fig 6e together with δme map as shown in fig 6f the performance results are almost identical between the three calibrations of cal01 cal02 and cal03 with the rmse value of approx 3 75 m in all cases and with around 85 of the gw head wells having absolute errors below 5 m also a similar and low average me between cal01 me 0 008 m and cal03 me 0 025 m is achieved this is also represented in the result of δme map with small differences between cal01 and cal03 fig 6f at the national scale although some regional differences occur both streamflow and groundwater head statistics indicate that they are largely unaffected by the changes in model parameters resulting from the three calibration tests although cal03 is favorable from a pbias perspective consequently it could be difficult to select the optimal parametrization based on these objectives alone 3 3 comparison of evapotranspiration spatial patterns fig 7 presents the simulated seasonal i e spring and summer spatial evapotranspiration patterns for the three applied calibration schemes cal01 cal02 and cal03 as well as the reference aet dataset derived from the mod16 the aet maps were normalized i e each map was divided by its mean value as our main focus is to evaluate the spatial pattern similarity of aet with less emphasis on the bias the simulated aet patterns in cal01 in both spring fig 7a and summer fig 7e largely differ when compared to the reference aet model fig 7d and 7h with very low spatial efficiency values spaef 0 09 and 0 08 likewise cal02 fig 7b and 7f resulted in low spaef 0 17 in spring and 0 10 in summer which indicates a low resemblance between the spatial patterns identified in mod16 et and the dk model simulations at the national scale despite including the et pattern in the calibration nevertheless the impacts of deciduous and coniferous forests which have a low aet rate as depicted by the mod16 et fig 7d are well represented by the dk model in central jutland see fig 1 in both cal01 fig 7a and cal02 fig 7b in springtime the results of the model regionalization applied in cal03 are illustrated in fig 7c and 7 g for spring and summer respectively clearly the simulated seasonal aet spatial patterns are much more similar to the reference et data fig 7d and 7 h compared to cal01 and cal02 this is underlined by higher spaef values in both spring and summer spaef 0 52 and 0 46 also the summertime patterns indicate a particularly large improvement from cal01 and cal02 fig 7e and 7f to cal03 fig 7g with regards to the reference et model fig 7h further we analyzed the pattern similarity between the simulated and the reference normalized evapotranspiration data using a taylor diagram in spring fig 8 a and summer fig 8b the correlations r of the simulated aet patterns obtained from cal01 and cal02 with respect to the mod16 et are about r 0 25 and r 0 3 fig 8a and r 0 14 and r 0 15 fig 8b respectively correlation largely improved in cal03 with an approx r 0 6 for both spring fig 8a and summer fig 8b in terms of the centered root mean square error rmse the performance improved and rmse values decreased from 1 4 to 1 across the three calibrations in both seasons and finally the standard deviation sd indicates a reduction from 1 24 to 1 1 in cal03 in spring fig 8a but almost no improvement is notable for the summer patterns fig 8b these results are well comparable with the visual inspection of the spatial patterns in fig 7 further supported by the spaef analysis 3 3 1 copula based dependence structure of evapotranspiration the empirical copula densities correlation between the simulated aet obtained from cal01 cal02 and cal03 against the mod16 et are illustrated in fig 9 overall a linear structure of the joint relationship between cal01 aet fig 9a and cal02 aet fig 9b versus mod16 et is observed in spring in other words the density is clearly symmetrical with the highest associations in lower left corner low values and upper right corner extreme values which indicates a positive linear dependence structure however as shown in fig 9c the copula function captures a much stronger linear dependence structure when the model regionalization was included in calibration as a result both higher and especially lower ranks of cal03 aet distribution is strongly concordant with the corresponding reference et model indicating a strong positive correlation fig 9c further a similar aet dependence structure can be also seen in the summer season however copula densities are much weaker in cal01 and cal02 fig 9d and 9e when compared with the corresponding ones in spring fig 9a and 9b but cal03 is almost as good as the one achieved in spring fig 9c this conveys that a significant improvement was obtained by adding the spatial parameterization scheme to the calibration fig 9f the empirical copula based results are in a good agreement with the findings presented previously see fig 7 and fig 8 4 discussion most land surface and hydrological modelling efforts have so far been on the basis of spatially inconsistent parameter fields generated by the model s default transfer functions that relate geophysical attributes to model parameters via ad hoc parameterization schemes as problematized by e g wöhling et al 2013 rakovec et al 2016 and mizukami et al 2017 as a result models have been capable of simulating streamflow reasonably well but a poor performance has been reported with respect to the distributed model outputs such as aet spatial patterns therefore flexible transfer functions are necessary to be considered in hydrological modelling experiments in order to derive seamless parameters in a spatially consistent way in this concept a multiscale parameter regionalization mpr method was proposed by samaniego et al 2010a b implemented in the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm the method further improved in kumar et al 2013 aiming to estimate seamless global transfer function parameters across scales the robustness of mpr is that it uses transfer functions that convert basin characteristics such as vegetation soil and terrain properties into model parameters at the original scale of the geophysical data and then scales the model parameters to the desired model resolution mizukami et al 2017 however the selection of transfer functions and upscaling operators remains as one of the crucial limitations of the mpr approach samaniego et al 2017 the main focus of this study is the development of a spatial parameterization scheme and spatial pattern oriented model optimization using remote sensing data modis based ndvi and aet spatial patterns to improve the spatial pattern performance of actual evapotranspiration previous studies in denmark have attempted to integrate remote sensing data and distributed hydrological models to improve the spatial performance of the models applied with a focus on aet patterns either at catchment scale guzinski et al 2015 demirel et al 2018 or the national scale of denmark mendiguren et al 2017 the novelty of this research is the applied remote sensing based model parameter regionalization supported by robust objective functions targeting the spatial pattern performance the framework was applied for the entire land phase of denmark using a coupled groundwater surface water model and resulted in a significant improvement in the spatial patterns of simulated actual evapotranspiration fig 7c and 7g we found that the discharge and gw head based calibration strategies cal01 and cal02 conveyed little information in relation to spatial evapotranspiration patterns further traditional calibration variables q and gw heads do not necessarily lead to reasonable aet patterns when considered in the optimization of distributed hydrological models the current study introduced a new spatial regionalization of lai kc and rd based on fully distributed remote sensing vegetation data ndvi and soil texture clay fraction content as fully described in section 2 2 2 typically such datasets capture the spatiotemporal variations with more details compared to the default dk model which includes a unit based parametrization following predefined tables from refsgaard et al 2011 the resulting annual average root depth and crop coefficient maps from the three calibrations are represented in fig 10 it can be seen that the spatial pattern of rd is much more consistent and seamlessly distributed across denmark the rd obtained from cal03 though regionalization using ndvi and clay fraction fig 10c resembles the land surface characteristics better compared to cal01 fig 10a and cal02 fig 10b interestingly the flexible cal03 parametrization resulted in a much smaller range of root depths across denmark compared to the original parametrization where the ranges were fixed from literature values and scaled uniformly this implies that the range and variability of root depths which is optimal for the specific model code and process description of the dk model can be better represented through a more flexible parametrization changes were also observed in the crop coefficient distributed map fig 10f when lai was used for the kc calculation see eq 2 compared to cal01 fig 10d and cal02 fig 10e furthermore the final optimized regionalization functions for rd and kc obtained from cal03 see table 3 are plotted in fig 10g and 10 h it can be seen that a linear transfer function was achieved for the root depth as a function of clay fraction where the maximum rd is linear proportional to clay fraction scaled between rdlower 927 mm and rdupper 1435 mm fig 10g the linear solution was found optimal resulting in a dependency of clay fraction similar to the root depth transfer function example d represented in fig 3a the parameter w represents the weight that is given to the importance of ndvi in the root depth parameterization see fig 3b d an optimal w value of 0 56 see table 3 implies that part of the equation see eq 6 which includes ndvi is weighted 56 and the part which includes clay fraction is weighted by 44 similarly to the example in fig 3c also a near linear function was found for the crop coefficient as a function of ndvi where the optimal parameter values of kcmin 0 55 and kcmax 1 21 with a slope of a 0 88 were obtained fig 10 h these optimization results indicate that simpler linear regionalization functions could have been used however complex non linear and flexible transfer functions allow this to be determined case by case through optimization in different applications we also found that the seasonal aet maps indicate a shifting pattern across denmark where the lowest values in springtime are found in the central and western parts while the low aet region shift towards the eastern regions in the summertime as observed in mod16 et maps fig 7d and 7 h this is appropriately captured in cal03 as a result of the rd and kc spatial parameterizations shown in fig 10c and 10f on the contrary the cal01 and cal02 approaches that use the default tables of rd and kc curves fig 10a d 10b e generally failed to capture this shifting pattern in aet across the country see fig 7 in the hydrological modelling community it is commonly believed that with a lack of valid input data or reasonable parametrizations almost any model will produce unreliable outputs this implies that the quality of a model output is mainly determined by the quality of its input schultz 1988 this study highlights the capability of satellite remote sensing data applied in a model parameter regionalization scheme to improve the spatial representation of hydrological processes such as aet in land surface and hydrological models e g mendiguren et al 2017 herman et al 2018 dembélé et al 2020a it also must be noted that the overall performance of the model on streamflow and groundwater heads see fig 6 did not deteriorate when improving the aet spatial patterns notably by adding new parametrizations and objectives in cal03 see fig 7 this indicates a minimum trade off between the performance on streamflow groundwater head and aet is achievable when the objectives are designed to mutually capture dynamics and water balances groundwater heads and spatial patterns similar results were obtained by mendiguren et al 2017 using the dk model and demirel et al 2018 using the mhm model related to this koch et al 2016 found limited sensitivity of temporal discharge performance to spatial patterns of soil moisture simulated by three different distributed hydrological models future modelling studies should consider a variety of water cycle components discharge evapotranspiration and groundwater heads in the model evaluation process reflecting both temporal and spatial model characteristics besides the model performance against observations it is interesting to evaluate the impact of the developed framework i e the regionalization calibration scheme on additional hydrological fluxes or variables which are not included in the calibration but simulated in the dk model an example of such a variable is the groundwater recharge from unsaturated zone uz to saturated zone sz as shown in fig 11 it can be observed that the spatial pattern of simulated recharge closely follows the distributions of precipitation which decreases smoothly from the western regions towards the east see fig 1c and the soil texture where the most sandy soils with less than 5 clay fraction are found in the western regions see fig 1e across denmark during the calibrations of cal01 fig 11a and cal03 fig 11b however according to the δrecharge map fig 11c the annual recharge to sz decreases the positive values in western jutland and north of sealand see fig 1b for the locations while it increased negative values in most of eastern denmark when moving from cal01 to cal03 this signifies a spatial redistribution in the water balance originating from the corresponding changes in aet fig 7 which also had a generally positive impact on the larger scale water balances compared to streamflow fig 6d in relation to the model performance evaluation the non parametric empirical copula based approach applied herein was appropriately capable of capturing the underlying dependence structures between the spatial evapotranspiration patterns simulated by the model and derived from the remote sensing observations and also amongst other hydrometeorological variables e g bárdossy 2006 laux et al 2011 soltani et al 2018 therefore in addition to the traditional linear based statistical metrics e g correlation coefficient r values copula approach is highly recommended to be considered in other regions with more complex environments for estimating the true relationships amongst water balance or energy balance components 5 conclusions the remote sensing data modis based ndvi and aet spatial patterns was integrated in the dk model to improve the simulations of the spatial patterns in actual evapotranspiration at the national scale of denmark this was achieved by both a spatial parameter regionalization scheme and a spatial pattern oriented optimization based on three model calibration strategies the key findings can be summarized as follows the spatial parameter regionalization using a combination of satellite vegetation data ndvi and soil data clay fraction can largely improve the predictive performance of the distributed hydrological model to accurately reproduce the spatial evapotranspiration patterns model calibration using only streamflow and groundwater heads does not necessarily contribute to improve the distributed aet maps as they convey a little information with regards to aet spatial patterns the proposed rs based parameter regionalization calibration scheme significantly improved the aet spatial patterns with a very limited trade off between the water cycle components of evapotranspiration streamflow and groundwater heads overall the results underline the benefits of using bias insensitive spatial pattern information derived from remote sensing satellite data which yields a better model spatial performance the aet spatial regionalization and optimization approach proposed in this study can be considered by the hydrological modelling community to apply in more complex environments with any hydrological models in particular it is recommended that the results from the developed framework are implemented in the national water resources model dk model to further improve the simulations in major water cycle components with a focus on the actual evapotranspiration patterns at the national scale of denmark credit authorship contribution statement mohsen soltani conceptualization methodology

4077,water temperature is an important indicator of the health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and influences numerous biological and chemical processes that affect water quality the health and productivity of biota and other ecosystem services in this study we improved the soil and water assessment tool swat model to explicitly consider the thermal processes influencing the temperature of various terrestrial water components i e surface runoff lateral flow and base flow and the heat balance of water in streams the improved swat model with an explicit heat balance description on both terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes swat hb was compared with previous versions of the swat model that employ only empirical relationships between air temperature and stream temperature swat er or combine empirical terrestrial water temperature estimates with the heat balance of stream water swat eh for the upper mississippi river basin umrb and greensboro watershed gw in the united states the results show that even though the swat hb better simulates terrestrial thermal processes all three models produce comparable simulations of long term stream temperatures indicating that stream temperature is mainly influenced by air temperature as water travels along large rivers nevertheless the swat hb and swat eh models achieved better performance than the swat er model in the winter and spring but exhibited mixed performance in the summer and fall the better model performance of the swat hb model than the swat eh model can be attributed to the improved estimation of terrestrial water temperature components although empirical methods e g swat er are suitable for providing estimation of stream temperature the coupled terrestrial and aquatic heat balance based methods e g swat hb allow for the consideration of land and water management practices e g crop irrigation land use change and water use for thermoelectric cooling effects on stream temperature keywords heat balance stream temperature watershed modeling upper mississippi river 1 introduction water temperature is an important thermal characteristic of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems poole and berman 2001 regier et al 1990 it influences numerous biological and chemical processes thereby affecting water quality the health and productivity of biota and other ecosystem services dallas 2008 jonsson 1991 verones et al 2010 wang et al 2020a in particular water temperature affects physical water properties such as water viscosity density conductivity infiltration rates and gas exchange between liquid gas interfaces constantz et al 1994 daniil and gulliver 1988 wang et al 2020b ward 1985 chemical properties such as ph dissolved oxygen concentration and compound toxicity abowei 2010 akiya and savage 2002 araoye 2009 biogeochemical reaction rates bethke 2007 and biological activity and habitats such as species distribution and juvenile survival baerlocher et al 2008 karvonen et al 2010 rivers moore et al 2013 also changes in water temperature can impact the health of aquatic ecosystems caissie et al 2007 for example increasing water temperature can elevate metabolic rates leading to faster microbial nutrient cycling and altered reproductive success and juvenile development of aquatic species blank et al 2007 stream water temperature is regulated by various energy exchanges including vertical fluxes at the water surface net radiation evaporation convection conduction and condensation streambed water heat exchange and advective fluxes groundwater and tributary inflows leach and moore 2014 channel characteristics morphology surface area and stream discharge and wind speeds at the water air interface are also important controlling variables beschta et al 1987 however changes in land cover and climate can alter the relative importance and magnitude of these energy exchange processes knouft and ficklin 2017 in addition changes in stream water temperature can occur as a result of different inputs such as power plant effluent industrial municipal wastewater removal of riparian canopy shade and changes in groundwater discharge madden et al 2013 aquatic water temperature regimes are also affected by changes in the terrestrial environments pal and ziaul 2017 land use changes such as deforestation and urbanization impact watershed hydrologic conditions which can lead to aquatic water temperature changes galbraith and burns 2007 leblanc et al 1997 sun et al 2015 any changes in water temperature may have an adverse impact on the habitat of aquatic species caissie et al 2007 for example high water temperature can be lethal to brown trout particularly during periods of low flow with concurrent low oxygen levels and high pollutant concentrations broadmeadow et al 2011 moreover the predicted rise in water temperature caused by global warming is expected to affect aquatic ecosystems directly via heat transfer at the water air interface and indirectly via hydrologic connections between terrestrial and aquatic environments gooseff et al 2005 komatsu et al 2007 morrison et al 2002 van vliet et al 2013 therefore it is important to model the thermal processes of both terrestrial and aquatic environments as illustrated in fig 1 in order to assess the potential impacts of changes in land use and climate gendaszek et al 2020 water temperature models for the aquatic environment can be classified as either mechanistic or statistical models benyahya et al 2007 statistical models generally use regression equations to estimate stream temperature based on meteorological or other physical variables in general widely used statistical models for aquatic water temperature often use air temperature as the only predictor morrill et al 2005 stefan and preud homme 1993 however other meteorological and hydraulic factors such as solar radiation wind speed and water depth also play important roles in regulating aquatic water temperature du et al 2018 additionally the impacts of watershed hydrologic conditions e g surface runoff lateral flow and base flow are normally not considered in these regression models therefore statistical models may not be reliable for predicting the impact of climate and land use change on stream temperatures conversely mechanistic or physically based models simulate change in stream temperature based on the heat flux and water mass balance in an ecosystem allen et al 2007 the most commonly used water quality models such as qual2k chapra et al 2008 and ce qual w2 cole and wells 2006 employ a heat balance approach to model the temperature of water in streams however these models require input boundary conditions such as flow rates and water temperatures from terrestrial ecosystems or upstream tributaries to model the downstream water temperature therefore a watershed modeling approach is required to link water thermal energy transfer from terrestrial to aquatic environments watershed scale hydrologic models are useful for assessing the potential impacts of land use and future climate changes on water quality a comparison between eleven hydrologic models indicated that the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 model is a robust model for simulating long term water quantity and quality in agricultural watersheds borah and bera 2003 the swat model uses empirical relationships to link air temperatures with stream water temperatures without explicitly representing terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes giles et al 2019 several studies have attempted to improve stream temperature simulation with the swat model ficklin et al 2012 developed a hydro climatological stream temperature module within the swat model that factors in the combined effects of watershed hydrologic conditions and air temperature on stream water temperature this module empirically estimates the temperatures of terrestrial flow components surface runoff lateral flow and base flow that drain into the stream network based on air temperature and calculates the temperature of the streamflow by considering stream water air heat transfer this hydro climatological module explicitly describes the effects of hydrologic inputs local runoff components and upstream inflow on stream temperature to evaluate the impact of hydrologic changes caused by climate change on stream water temperature barnhart et al 2014 further applied the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to automatically calibrate the modified model for complex basins with large spatial variability of topography land use and soil type in addition mustafa et al 2018 pointed out that the hydro climatological stream temperature module did not explicitly account for the different types of radiation that affect thermal energy of water systems and they incorporated multiple thermal radiation components to account for radiative heat exchange however they also indicated that bias was generated in the radiative model due to the inclusion of highly variable radiative forcing components which required additional observations and suggested alternative formulations of the radiative components should be considered recently du et al 2018 incorporated an equilibrium water temperature approach into the hydro climatological module to improve the simulation of the heat transfer process at the stream water air interface without requiring additional measured input data the new method was tested and proved to be robust within the framework of swat however thermal energy contributions from terrestrial environment flows are still estimated using an empirical lumped method for each subbasin within a watershed as the lumped method does not explicitly simulate the thermal processes regulating the temperatures of terrestrial flows from various land uses and soil types it has a limited ability to track water thermal energy from different point and non point sources for the accurate assessment of land use change and climate change impacts water thermal energy in the terrestrial environment is closely associated with soil temperature when subsurface flows enter a channel their temperatures generally reflect the subsoil environment from which they originated beschta et al 1987 thus it is necessary to estimate water temperatures based on a terrestrial heat balance however the swat model employs an empirically based module to estimate soil temperature although this empirical module works well in temperate and tropical environments in cold regions with seasonal snow cover predictions of soil temperature does not match with field measurements to address this issue a physically based soil temperature module has been developed to consider the insulation effects of snow qi et al 2016a qi et al 2016b in addition the physically based module is able to estimate snow or soil surface temperature based on an energy balance update thermal properties of snow and soil layers according to changes in snow density and soil moisture and simulate freeze thaw cycles in the soil profile the physically based module has been successfully tested to simulate soil temperature soil thermal status and the freeze thaw cycle in both small and large watersheds in north america qi et al 2019a qi et al 2019c qi et al 2020b wang et al 2020a wang et al 2021 wang et al 2020b in this study we aim to 1 estimate terrestrial water temperatures based on soil thermal status 2 couple the physical processes influencing the heat balance of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and 3 examine the extent to which our new approach outperforms existing stream temperature simulation methods within the swat model under ungauged conditions the new version of the swat model herein couples terrestrial heat balance algorithms developed by qi et al 2016b with heat balance based equilibrium water temperature approach developed by du et al 2018 the new version of the swat model with the explicit heat balance description on both terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes was named swat hb herein we compared the swat hb model with two previous versions of the swat model which use only empirical relationships between air temperature and stream temperature swat er neitsch et al 2011 or combine empirical terrestrial water temperature estimates with the heat balance of stream water swat eh du et al 2018 ficklin et al 2012 evaluations and comparisons were conducted in the upper mississippi river basin umrb in the north central united states and greensboro watershed gw in the mid atlantic united states we anticipate that the results of this research will optimize the strengths and weaknesses of using physically based and empirically based approaches to accurately simulate stream temperature thereby providing guidance for selecting the best models for understanding and quantifying the effects of land use and climate change on stream temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the swat model the swat model is an ecohydrological model developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars to predict the impact of land use and climate change on water energy and nutrient cycles in watersheds arnold et al 1998 the swat model divides a watershed into subbasins connected by a stream network and further delineates hydrologic response units hrus using unique combinations of land use and soil types in each subbasin the major hydrologic routines within the swat model account for snowfall and snowmelt surface runoff vadose zone processes i e infiltration evaporation plant uptake lateral flows and percolation groundwater flows and river routing the swat model has been widely used to predict the hydrologic conditions heat transfer and exchange and nutrient cycles of terrestrial and aquatic environments in numerous watersheds around the world ficklin et al 2009 gassman et al 2007 li et al 2014 liang et al 2019 shi et al 2011 srinivasan et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 2 2 water temperature simulation in previous studies 2 2 1 simulation of terrestrial thermal processes the swat er model i e the conventional swat model uses a temperature index module stefan and preud homme 1993 to estimate the temperature of total water generated from a subbasin which is expressed as 1 t w 5 0 0 75 t a where t w is the water temperature and t a is the air temperature because the swat er model does not differentiate between the different temperatures of different flow components e g surface runoff lateral flow and base flow ficklin et al 2012 developed a subbasin level lumped module to calculate the temperatures t w s u b of well mixed surface runoff lateral flow and base flow for each subbasin which is expressed as 2 t w s u b t s n o w s u b q s n o w s u b t b f s u b q b f s u b λ t a i r l a g q s f s u b q l f s u b q t o a l s u b where qsnow sub is the snowmelt runoff contribution to streamflow within the subbasin m3 d 1 qbf sub is the groundwater flow contribution to the streamflow within the subbasin m3 d 1 qsf sub is the surface runoff contribution to the streamflow within the subbasin m3 d 1 qlf sub is the soil lateral flow contribution to the streamflow within the subbasin m3 d 1 qtotal sub is the total water yield contribution to streamflow within the subbasin m3 d 1 tsnow is the temperature of the snowmelt runoff assumed to be 0 1 tbf is the base flow temperature tair lag is the average daily air temperature with a lag to account for the effects of delayed surface runoff and soil water flow into the stream and λ is a calibration coefficient relating tair lag and surface runoff lateral flow there were some shortcomings for the lumped method first there were several calibration parameters introduced by the lumped method eq 2 including tbf lag and λ while λ could be calibrated relatively easily calibrating lag required examining the day to day variations in observed stream temperature data which were often not available further use of eq 2 was even more challenging when calibrating multiple stations in a watershed in addition tbf was an annual time series that must be provided by the user ficklin et al 2012 recommended using climatic input data to estimate subbasin tbf according to a finding of todd and mays 1980 that groundwater temperature was often 1 2 higher than mean annual air temperature of a region in addition the lumped method did not explicitly simulate the temperatures of different flow components nor did it differentiate between various land use and soil types this limited the ability of the lumped method to track water thermal energy contributions from different point and non point sources within a subbasin in order to assess land use change and water management impacts 2 2 2 simulation of aquatic thermal processes the swat er model used eq 1 to estimate water temperature in streams the disconnection between terrestrial and aquatic water thermal energy transfer limited this simple empirical method as it ignored the influence of land use and water use e g thermoelectric cooling on stream temperature in addition climatic factors such as solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and hydrologic conditions e g water depth and groundwater inflow were not considered by this temperature index method du et al 2018 ficklin et al 2012 to overcome the limitations of this empirical module ficklin et al 2012 developed a new hydro climatological temperature module to calculate stream water temperature this was further improved by du et al 2018 who included an equilibrium temperature approach to depict heat transfer processes at the water air interface that reflected the influences of air temperature solar radiation wind speed and streamflow on stream temperature step 4 in fig 2 du et al 2018 3 ρ w c w t w t k t t e t w h where ρw is the density of water kg m 3 cw is the specific heat capacity of water j kg 1 1 kt is the overall heat exchange coefficient w m 2 1 h is the water depth m and te is the equilibrium temperature c which is calculated using 4 t e t a η slr k t where η is the additive parameter influencing the water air heat transfer c and slr is the solar radiation w m 2 the overall heat exchange coefficient kt was based on the wind velocity dew point temperature and initial stream temperature edinger et al 1974 furthermore ficklin et al 2012 also proposed an algorithm to link terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes at the watershed scale step 2 3 and 4 in fig 2 2 3 modeling framework of swat hb building on the above mentioned modules in this study we developed the swat hb model which explicitly represented the terrestrial water thermal energy contributions at the hru level and the heat balance of stream water fig 2 first soil temperatures and various terrestrial water flow temperatures were coupled by assuming that the water temperature e g surface runoff lateral flow and base flow was the same as the source environments from which they originated step 1 in fig 2 as given in eq 5 5 t sf t a n o s n o w o r t sf 0 1 c s n o w m e l t t l f i t s o i l i t bf t bot where tsf tlf and tbf are the temperature for surface runoff lateral flow and base flow generated from the hrus tsoil and tbot are the temperature for soil layers and the damping depth and i indicates soil layer numbers as defined by the swat model the temperature of the surface runoff was assumed to be equal to the current day s air temperature this assumption was based on the equilibrium energy balance between surface water and air temperatures during the surface runoff concentration time when there was snow cover on the land surface the surface runoff temperature was set to 0 1 regardless of snowmelt or rain on snow events ficklin et al 2012 further the base flow temperature was assumed to be equal to the temperature at the damping depth where the soil temperature equal average annual air temperature the temperatures of lateral flows were equal to the temperature of each soil layer assuming sufficient mixing the swat hb model employed a physically based soil temperature module to calculate the soil temperature in each soil layer and at the damping depth see method 1 in the supplementary information si for more details qi et al 2016a qi et al 2016b qi et al 2019a qi et al 2019c then the temperatures of the surface runoff lateral flow and base flow from the hrus were weighted by hru areas in a subbasin to calculate the water temperature at the subbasin scale step 1 in fig 2 next the temperature of the total water contribution to the stream network from a subbasin was calculated using the mixing model of volumes and the surface runoff lateral flow and base flow temperatures step 2 in fig 2 given as 6 t w s u b t s f s u b q s f s u b t l f s u b q l f s u b t b f s u b q b f s u b q t o t a l s u b the initial stream water temperature at a time step was calculated as the weighted average of the contribution in the subbasin and the contribution from upstream step 3 in fig 2 ficklin et al 2012 finally we integrated the newly developed terrestrial heat balance processes step 1 and 2 in fig 2 with the stream water temperature algorithms step 3 and 4 in fig 2 developed from previous studies du et al 2018 ficklin et al 2012 to enable the swat hb model to explicitly trace water thermal energy from terrestrial to aquatic environments fig 2 2 4 study region and data description the umrb has a drainage area of 431 000 km2 fig 3 and includes large parts of the states of illinois iowa minnesota missouri and wisconsin and smaller portions of indiana michigan and south dakota arnold et al 2000 qi et al 2020b the regional land cover includes agricultural lands forests wetlands lakes prairies and urban areas but nearly 69 of the total land is used for agriculture and pasture wu and tanaka 2005 the umrb is recognized as a major contributor more than 50 of nitrogen that is transported to the gulf of mexico from intensive agricultural activities landscape management and widespread use of chemical fertilizers jha et al 2004 wu and tanaka 2005 the climate of the umrb is sub humid continental with average annual precipitation ranging from 575 mm in the western part of minnesota to 981 mm in the central part of illinois wu and tanaka 2005 average daily temperatures in the region range from 4 0 to 5 5 c in the north to 11 5 to 13 0 c in the south chen et al 2020 soil types in the basin vary from heavy poorly drained clay soil to light well drained sands qi et al 2019c for the purposes of this study we compiled daily streamflow and water temperature data from 10 usgs monitoring stations fig 3 the drainage area and data availability of the usgs stations are listed in table 1 the measured daily soil temperature at the surface and 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm depths were available from six u s climate reference network uscrn stations distributed across the umrb fig 3 we used a watershed defined by the usgs station in the choptank river near greensboro md usgs 01491000 which is referred to as the greensboro watershed gw 290 1 km2 fig 3 the gw is in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed in the mid atlantic united states fig 3 forests occupy 48 of the gw while croplands occupy 36 approximately 75 of soils in the gw are poorly drained in which 67 of the land is cropland ator and denver 2015 qi et al 2020a the major cropland soil types are typified by othello soils which are poorly drained and mattapex soils which are moderately well drained hively et al 2009 in general the landscape is nearly flat most slopes 2 the area is characterized by a temperate humid climate with an average annual temperature of 15 4 c and precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year with an average value of 1200 mm year 1 ator et al 2005 qi et al 2019b yeo et al 2014 the usgs station 01 491 000 is located at the outlet of the gw and monitors daily streamflow and water temperature data as listed in table 1 the measured daily soil temperatures at 5 10 20 and 50 cm soil depths from monitoring station 10 of the usda long term agricultural research ltar program were used to evaluate soil temperatures in the gw table 2 2 5 model set up and performance assessment the swat hb swat er and swat eh models were developed based on the same version of the swat model code with the only difference between them being treatments of terrestrial and aquatic water temperatures as described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 we set up the swat hb swat er and swat eh table 3 models for the umrb and gw and compared their performance without calibrating water temperature associated parameters as recent publications showed that parameter calibration might introduce additional uncertainty and could not guarantee correct representation of physical processes arnold et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 another reason for the ungauged treatment of water temperature prediction was because most applications of the swat model did not have observations to calibrate stream temperature it is necessary to understand how models will perform with default parameters based on previous literature we adopted the default calibration parameters of du et al 2018 for the equilibrium stream water temperature module used for both the swat eh and swat hb models and parameters of ficklin et al 2012 for the subbasin level lumped module used for the swat eh model table 4 in addition we calculated the average annual air temperature for the umrb and gw during the simulation period equal to 9 5 and 13 6 respectively to estimate the groundwater temperature for the subbasin level lumped module the final groundwater temperature estimated according to todd and mays 1980 was 10 5 and 14 6 for the umrb and gw respectively we compared model performance with regards to daily streamflow and stream temperatures model performance for streamflow was assessed using four statistics percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which are calculated as 7 p bias 100 p avg o avg o avg 8 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o avg 2 9 r 2 i 1 n o i o avg p i p avg i 1 n

standard deviation of predicted and observed data oi and pi are the observed and predicted data respectively on day i and oavg and pavg are the average of the observed and predicted data respectively these coefficients are the most used statistics to evaluate swat model performance for water quantity and quality simulations in the literature arnold et al 2012 qi et al 2016a qi et al 2019a srinivasan et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 model performance with regards to stream temperature was assessed using nse r2 and kge and two additional statistics prediction bias bias and mean absolute error mae which are calculated as 11 bias p avg o avg 12 mae i 1 n p i o i n the bias can indicate model performance by measuring the average tendency of the simulated values to be larger or smaller than the observed data negative values indicate model underestimation bias and positive values indicate model overestimation bias gupta et al 1999 the mae expresses average model prediction error in units of the variable of interest without considering their direction and this metric can range from 0 to with lower values better legates and mccabe 1999 willmott and matsuura 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 streamflow simulation before evaluating the model performance with regards to stream temperature we considered the daily streamflow simulated by the swat model as derived from our previous studies lee et al 2017 qi et al 2020b wang et al 2020b the model performance metrics are listed in table 5 and more detailed evaluations of the simulated streamflow time series at the 11 stations are shown in figs s1 and s2 of the si for the 10 stations in the umrb the nse r2 and kge ranged from 0 24 to 0 65 from 0 40 to 0 72 and from 0 39 to 0 77 with an average of 0 49 0 54 and 0 63 respectively and most pbias values were within the range from 20 to 20 simulated flows at the usgs station 05 267 000 had the lowest nse value partially because it is in the northern part of the umrb fig 3 and is influenced by snowmelt associated parameters which were globally configured at the basin scale a localized parameter configuration would help improve the simulation results in general for the daily streamflow simulation the model performance was deemed satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 all three versions of the swat model i e swat hb swat er and swat eh shared the same hydrologic processes but use different equations to calculate the water temperatures in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems 3 2 improving soil temperature simulation the conventional swat model adopts an empirically based soil temperature module etm to estimate the daily soil temperature by considering the previous days soil temperature air temperature and snow and residue cover see method 1 in the si for more details herein we used observed daily temperatures at different soil depths at six uscrn stations in the umrb qi et al 2019c and one station in the gw qi et al 2019a to compare the physically based soil temperature module ptm used by the swat hb model and the original empirical soil temperature module employed by the conventional swat model figs s3 s5 in the si the daily results demonstrated the better performance of the swat hb model as discussed in our previous studies qi et al 2019c to illustrate the contrasting performance of the swat hb and conventional swat models the simulated vs observed seasonal soil temperature time series at depths of 5 50 and 100 cm are shown in figs 4 5 and 6 respectively the comparison shows that the swat hb model better reproduced the seasonal soil temperature pattern for example at a depth of 5 cm the conventional swat model noticeably underestimated winter soil temperature at the two uscrn sites in minnesota and wisconsin in which winter snow cover is a major factor controlling the surface temperature at a depth of 50 cm the conventional swat model underestimated both the winter and summer soil temperatures at most stations the results at a depth of 100 cm also demonstrated that the conventional swat model at nearly all stations underestimated the summer soil temperature overall the physically based heat balance method outperformed the empirical method when estimating terrestrial thermal energy 3 3 difference in simulated terrestrial water temperatures by the three models accurate estimation of terrestrial water temperature is important for assessment of land use and climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems because of a lack of terrestrial water temperature measurements in the study watersheds we compared the simulated terrestrial water temperatures by the three models to investigate model performance since the swat er and swat eh models did not simulate the temperatures of various water flows at the hru level see section 2 2 we developed algorithms based on eqs 1 and 2 for these two models respectively to estimate surface runoff lateral flow base flow and total terrestrial water yield temperatures generated from hrus instead of subbasins for each model we calculated the multi year average seasonal and annual surface runoff lateral flow base flow and total terrestrial water yield temperatures across the umrb and gw as shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively further details regarding the seasonal time series of terrestrial water temperature for the umrb are also shown in fig s6 in the si in both the umrb and gw the swat hb model more consistently simulated lower surface runoff and lateral flow temperatures than the other two models in the spring summer and fall and at the annual scale fig 7a 7b 8a and 8b also see figs s6a and s6b especially for the umrb which has a large portion of land subject to a cold climate fig 3 meanwhile the swat eh model had the largest seasonal variation in water temperatures of surface runoff and lateral flow the highest values in summer and the comparable values to those of the swat hb model in winter regarding the base flow temperature the swat er model produced large seasonal variations the highest values in summer and the lowest values in winter while the swat hb and swat eh models exhibited minimal seasonal variations on both watersheds fig 7c and 8c also see fig s6c the total terrestrial water temperature was the highest for the swat er and lowest for the swat hb models at the annual scale and in the spring summer and fall in both the umrb and gw fig 7d and 8d for example in the umrb the total terrestrial water temperature for the swat er model was 12 7 compared to the 11 4 of the swat eh model and 9 9 of the swat hb model at the annual scale while in the gw these values are 15 2 15 0 and 13 5 respectively the swat hb and swat eh models had close total terrestrial water temperatures in the winter and they were higher than that of the swat er model in both watersheds fig 7d and 8d this result also indicates that base flow water temperatures estimated by the method of todd and mays 1980 and our proposed method based on soil temperature at the damping depth eq 5 are very close for all seasons at the watershed scale conversely the swat er model s base flow temperature simulation distinctly deviated from the other model results indicating that the eq 1 cannot be used to estimate the base flow temperature lower surface runoff temperatures were simulated by the swat hb model relative to the other two models because the other two models used regression equations between the air temperature and surface flow temperature eqs 1 and 2 whereas the swat hb model assumed that surface temperature was equal to the air temperature eq 4 the difference between the eq 1 and eq 2 is that eq 2 used by the swat eh model has a lag effect on the surface runoff and lateral flow temperature which tends to amplify the water temperature with highest values in the summer and lowest in the winter the swat hb model had lower lateral flow temperatures because they were calculated based on soil temperatures eq 4 which normally are lower than the air temperature except during the winter the close winter temperatures of surface runoff and lateral flow simulated by the swat hb and swat eh models suggests that the swat er model is less accurate for estimation of winter surface runoff and lateral flow water temperatures than the swat hb and swat eh models this is not surprising as eq 1 was developed based on observations collected from non winter seasons the estimated higher surface and lateral flow temperatures by the swat er model relative to the swat hb model were not consistent with the simulated soil temperatures of the two models as shown in figs 4 6 wherein the swat er model i e the conventional swat model generally predicted lower soil temperatures this inconsistent simulation of soil temperature and terrestrial water temperature arose from the decoupled soil and water heat exchange processes of the swat er model i e water temperature is solely dependent on air temperature as indicated by eq 1 therefore the swat er model could not reflect the thermal status of terrestrial environments and accurately represented the impacts of changes in land surface processes such as land use change and management practices on estimating the thermal energy transferred from land to rivers via different terrestrial flow components even though there was a relatively large difference between simulated surface runoff and lateral flow temperatures determined by the swat eh and swat hb models the swat eh model in general had similar performance to the swat hb model for the total terrestrial water temperatures in the umrb and gw this indicated that the lumped method eq 2 used within the swat eh model was in general sufficiently robust for estimating terrestrial water temperatures over large regions note that the swat eh model relied on only climate records to estimate terrestrial water temperatures and thus could not represent the impacts of land use or soil conditions on terrestrial thermal energy transfer we also examined the spatial distribution of the terrestrial water temperatures simulated by the three models specifically we used the multi year average annual surface runoff lateral flow and base flow temperatures at the subbasin level for the umrb to identify differences between the models fig 9 as the swat er model used the same equation eq 1 to calculate each of these temperatures their spatial distribution was the same however differences between these temperatures could be detected by examination of the swat eh model results as it used different empirical equations to estimate the temperature of different flow components as the swat eh model also relied on climate records to estimate surface runoff and lateral flow temperatures their spatial distributions were like those derived from the swat er model notably the swat eh model assumed that base flow temperature was constant across the entire basin based on the methods recommended by todd and mays 1980 and ficklin et al 2012 the swat hb model predicted more spatial variability in water temperatures for all three flow components than the swat er and swat eh models particularly for lateral flow and base flow in general the swat hb model predicted lower temperatures for all three flow components in comparison to the swat er model across the umrb further the swat hb model simulated lower surface runoff and lateral flow temperatures than the swat eh model the swat hb model predicted lower temperatures for base flow in the northern subbasins and higher temperatures for base flow in the southern subbasins which was mainly because the swat eh model used spatially averaged climate records to estimate a constant temperature for the entire watershed in general the swat hb model considered more spatially variable conditions e g land use and soil conditions when estimating the terrestrial water temperature making it a better tool to reflect the spatial heterogeneity in the thermal energy of terrestrial water flows 3 4 comparable model performance for long term stream temperature simulation the three models reproduced similar observed daily stream temperatures at the 10 usgs stations in the umrb and the one usgs station in the gw as shown in the scatter plots of observed vs simulated daily stream water temperatures fig s7 of si examined for the three statistics i e nse r2 and kge the three models performed comparably for simulating long term stream temperature in both watersheds table 6 although all three models produced small prediction biases within the range of 1 5 to 1 5 for most stations in both the umrb and gw the swat er model had the smallest absolute value of prediction bias of 0 4 averaged over 10 station in the umrb compared with those of the swat eh and swat hb models both had an averaged bias of 1 1 whereas the swat hb and swat eh models had smaller prediction biases of 0 3 and 0 5 compared to the swat er model s bias of 1 2 for the one station in the gw table 6 however mae values quantified more similar model performance between the three models for which averaged mae values over the 10 stations ranged from 2 7 to 2 9 in the umrb and mae values ranged from 1 9 to 2 1 for the one station in the gw table 6 the relatively large discrepancy in evaluating model performance between bias and mae was caused by the fact that mae measures the average magnitude of the errors in predictions without considering their direction while bias could measure average model bias with positive and negative values in order to further investigate model performance for underestimation indicated by negative biases or overestimation indicated by positive biases of daily stream temperature we also performed seasonal analyses 3 5 seasonal stream temperature differences between the three models we estimated the multi year average seasonal stream temperatures for 10 usgs gauge stations in the umrb and one usgs gauge station in the gw as shown in fig 10 the results showed that the swat er model consistently overestimated the spring and winter stream temperatures in the two watersheds bias ranging from 0 5 to 4 1 in the spring and from 0 9 to 4 6 in the winter and the swat eh and swat hb models had a better performance bias ranging from 1 8 to 2 0 in the spring and from 1 1 to 0 8 in the winter than the swat er model during these two seasons all three models tended to underestimate the summer stream temperature in the umrb bias ranging from 3 6 to 0 4 fig 10a 10j while for the gw the three models had relatively small biases in the summer bias ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 fig 10 k in the fall the swat er model achieved smaller absolute values of biases bias ranging from 1 9 to 1 0 than the other models bias ranging from 0 6 to 3 1 for all stations in the umrb but it had the largest bias 1 4 in the gw compared with other models bias ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 as the swat eh and swat hb models used the same heat balance based stream temperature algorithms and simulated similar terrestrial water temperature patterns figs 7 and 8 they showed similar performance in estimating the seasonal patterns of stream temperature at most stations both the swat hb and swat eh models seem to have relatively larger bias values in the summer and fall than in the winter and spring despite these patterns no single model consistently outperformed the other two models over all seasons and across all stations we calculated the seasonal bias averaged across all 11 usgs stations as shown in fig 11 the swat er model overestimated stream temperature in the spring and winter with larger bias 1 2 and 1 7 respectively while both the swat eh and swat hb models slightly underestimated stream temperature bias ranging from 0 5 to 0 9 meanwhile both the swat eh and swat hb models underestimated stream temperature in the fall with large absolute values of bias 1 8 and 1 9 respectively compared to the swat er model bias 0 2 for the summer all the three models underestimated the stream temperature with similar biases ranging from 1 9 to 2 2 overall the swat hb and swat eh models outperformed the swat er model during the spring and fall were comparable to the swat er model in the summer but did not perform as well as the swat er model during the winter the comparable performance between the three models during the summer and the higher warmer performance of the swat er model during the fall suggests that stream water temperature was to a large extent influenced by local climatic factors e g air temperature at the water surface leach and moore 2014 therefore temperature indexed water temperature models have been widely applied and found reliable for stream temperature simulation in large rivers this is also the main reason that three models performed better in simulating stream temperature than streamflow table 5 vs table 6 results from the gw showed promising improvement in stream water temperature simulation for the swat hb model fig 8k probably because of its smaller watershed size and year round abundant precipitation wherein the upland water heat contributions exerted more influence on the stream temperature although the swat er swat eh and swat hb models achieved similar results the swat er and swat eh models relied on climate forcing to estimate the terrestrial water temperature and therefore they could not be used to examine changes in the terrestrial water temperature in response to land use change thus the advantage of the swat hb model was its ability to simulate the heat balance of terrestrial environments making it able to represent the impact of land use change in addition to climate change on stream temperature 3 6 limitations and caveats of the study previous studies have shown that the swat eh model distinctly outperformed the original empirical stream temperature module in the swat er model in seven watersheds in the western united states ficklin et al 2012 and five watersheds within the athabasca river basin in alberta canada du et al 2018 conversely our results showed that there was comparable performance exhibited by the swat eh and swat er models this could be attributed to the fact that in this study we did not calibrate the water temperature related parameters listed in table 4 whereas previous studies conducted model calibrations to further improve the performance of the swat eh model for example du et al 2018 indicated that ƞ was the most sensitive parameter in the equilibrium stream water temperature module in their work ƞ was calibrated from 0 to 3 2 in the athabasca river basin therefore parameter calibration could lead to different comparison results it is likely that experimentation with different parameter sets could also lead to different results due to the influence of the parameters on the performance of each model however because of the difficulty in robustly determining meaningful parameter ranges van griensven et al 2006 and using optimization algorithms to search for global optimal parameter solutions zhang et al 2009a zhang et al 2009b zhang et al 2009c we used the default values for the parameters in order to understand their performance under a no parameter calibration scheme in addition we adopted this no parameter calibration approach as the swat model was developed to operate in large scale ungauged watersheds with minimal calibration efforts and recent studies indicate that in many cases parameter calibration cannot guarantee an accurate representation of model processes arnold et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 although the swat er and swat eh models performed similarly to the swat hb model we demonstrated that the swat hb model was a better model for predicting the responses of stream water temperature to land use changes the swat er and swat eh models relied on only climate records to derive terrestrial water temperatures but ignored other factors such as changes in land use and land management practices which could impact stream temperature particularly in small watersheds galbraith and burns 2007 leblanc et al 1997 sun et al 2015 meanwhile the similar performance of the three models indicates that the heat balance methods used in this study need further improvement we recommend that additional improvements should be made for the heat balance depiction of stream networks for example riparian vegetation irrigation practices and thermal electric cooling water use can affect stream heat balance madden et al 2013 but these were not considered in our models because of a lack of representative data for these processes in addition the use of daily time steps for river routing may not be adequate for representing the residence time of water in streams and associated energy exchange at the air water interface we anticipate that the limitations identified in this study will benefit future watershed scale stream water temperature modeling and assessment efforts in large ungauged basins 4 conclusions this study aimed to couple terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes to estimate stream water temperatures at the watershed scale we improved the swat model to explicitly consider the thermal processes influencing the temperature of different terrestrial water components i e surface runoff lateral flow and base flow as well as the heat balance of water in streams then we compared the simulations from three versions of the swat models using different terrestrial water temperature treatments including the proposed swat hb swat er and swat eh models in the upper mississippi river basin umrb and greensboro watershed gw of the chesapeake bay basin the simulation results showed that the three models performed comparably when evaluated against long term daily stream temperature observations at 10 usgs stations in the umrb and one usgs station in the gw which suggests that stream temperature is to a large extent determined by air temperature as water travels along large rivers the seasonal comparison indicated that the swat hb model outperformed the swat er model during the spring and winter slightly during the summer and did not perform as well as the swat er model in the fall the better model performance for the swat hb model in comparison to the swat eh model could be attributed to the improved estimation of terrestrial water temperatures of the different flow components we also compared the temporal and spatial distribution of surface runoff lateral flow and base flow temperatures across the umrb at the subbasin level which clearly demonstrated the advantage of the swat hb model compared to swat er and swat eh models although empirical methods e g the swat er model were deemed suitable for providing reliable estimation of stream temperature the coupled terrestrial and aquatic heat balance based methods e g the swat hb model allow for the additional consideration of the effects of land and water management practices on stream temperature such as crop irrigation land use change and water use for thermoelectric cooling credit authorship contribution statement junyu qi

4077,water temperature is an important indicator of the health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and influences numerous biological and chemical processes that affect water quality the health and productivity of biota and other ecosystem services in this study we improved the soil and water assessment tool swat model to explicitly consider the thermal processes influencing the temperature of various terrestrial water components i e surface runoff lateral flow and base flow and the heat balance of water in streams the improved swat model with an explicit heat balance description on both terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes swat hb was compared with previous versions of the swat model that employ only empirical relationships between air temperature and stream temperature swat er or combine empirical terrestrial water temperature estimates with the heat balance of stream water swat eh for the upper mississippi river basin umrb and greensboro watershed gw in the united states the results show that even though the swat hb better simulates terrestrial thermal processes all three models produce comparable simulations of long term stream temperatures indicating that stream temperature is mainly influenced by air temperature as water travels along large rivers nevertheless the swat hb and swat eh models achieved better performance than the swat er model in the winter and spring but exhibited mixed performance in the summer and fall the better model performance of the swat hb model than the swat eh model can be attributed to the improved estimation of terrestrial water temperature components although empirical methods e g swat er are suitable for providing estimation of stream temperature the coupled terrestrial and aquatic heat balance based methods e g swat hb

stream temperature watershed modeling upper mississippi river 1 introduction water temperature is an important thermal characteristic of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems poole and berman 2001 regier et al 1990 it influences numerous biological and chemical processes thereby affecting water quality the health and productivity of biota and other ecosystem services dallas 2008 jonsson 1991 verones et al 2010 wang et al 2020a in particular water temperature affects physical water properties such as water viscosity density conductivity infiltration rates and gas exchange between liquid gas interfaces constantz et al 1994 daniil and gulliver 1988 wang et al 2020b ward 1985 chemical properties such as ph dissolved oxygen concentration and compound toxicity abowei 2010 akiya and savage 2002 araoye 2009 biogeochemical reaction rates bethke 2007 and biological activity and habitats such as species distribution and juvenile survival baerlocher et al 2008 karvonen et al 2010 rivers moore et al 2013 also changes in water temperature can impact the health of aquatic ecosystems caissie et al 2007 for example increasing water temperature can elevate metabolic rates leading to faster microbial nutrient cycling and altered reproductive success and juvenile development of aquatic species blank et al 2007 stream water temperature is regulated by various energy exchanges including vertical fluxes at the water surface net radiation evaporation convection conduction and condensation streambed water heat exchange and advective fluxes groundwater and tributary inflows leach and moore 2014 channel characteristics morphology surface area and stream discharge and wind speeds at the water air interface are also important controlling variables beschta et al 1987 however changes in land cover and climate can alter the relative importance and magnitude of these energy exchange processes knouft and ficklin 2017 in addition changes in stream water temperature can occur as a result of different inputs such as power plant effluent industrial municipal wastewater removal of riparian canopy shade and changes in groundwater discharge madden et al 2013 aquatic water temperature regimes are also affected by changes in the terrestrial environments pal and ziaul 2017 land use changes such as deforestation and urbanization impact watershed hydrologic conditions which can lead to aquatic water temperature changes galbraith and burns 2007 leblanc et al 1997 sun et al 2015 any changes in water temperature may have an adverse impact on the habitat of aquatic species caissie et al 2007 for example high water temperature can be lethal to brown trout particularly during periods of low flow with concurrent low oxygen levels and high pollutant concentrations broadmeadow et al 2011 moreover the predicted rise in water temperature caused by global warming is expected to affect aquatic ecosystems directly via heat transfer at the water air interface and indirectly via hydrologic connections between terrestrial and aquatic environments gooseff et al 2005 komatsu et al 2007 morrison et al 2002 van vliet et al 2013 therefore it is important to model the thermal processes of both terrestrial and aquatic environments as illustrated in fig 1 in order to assess the potential impacts of changes in land use and climate gendaszek et al 2020 water temperature models for the aquatic environment can be classified as either mechanistic or statistical models benyahya et al 2007 statistical models generally use regression equations to estimate stream temperature based on meteorological or other physical variables in general widely used statistical models for aquatic water temperature often use air temperature as the only predictor morrill et al 2005 stefan and preud homme 1993 however other meteorological and hydraulic factors such as solar radiation wind speed and water depth also play important roles in regulating aquatic water temperature du et al 2018 additionally the impacts of watershed hydrologic conditions e g surface runoff lateral flow and base flow are normally not considered in these regression models therefore statistical models may not be reliable for predicting the impact of climate and land use change on stream temperatures conversely mechanistic or physically based models simulate change in stream temperature based on the heat flux and water mass balance in an ecosystem allen et al 2007 the most commonly used water quality models such as qual2k chapra et al 2008 and ce qual w2 cole and wells 2006 employ a heat balance approach to model the temperature of water in streams however these models require input boundary conditions such as flow rates and water temperatures from terrestrial ecosystems or upstream tributaries to model the downstream water temperature therefore a watershed modeling approach is required to link water thermal energy transfer from terrestrial to aquatic environments watershed scale hydrologic models are useful for assessing the potential impacts of land use and future climate changes on water quality a comparison between eleven hydrologic models indicated that the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 model is a robust model for simulating long term water quantity and quality in agricultural watersheds borah and bera 2003 the swat model uses empirical relationships to link air temperatures with stream water temperatures without explicitly representing terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes giles et al 2019 several studies have attempted to improve stream temperature simulation with the swat model ficklin et al 2012 developed a hydro climatological stream temperature module within the swat model that factors in the combined effects of watershed hydrologic conditions and air temperature on stream water temperature this module empirically estimates the temperatures of terrestrial flow components surface runoff lateral flow and base flow that drain into the stream network based on air temperature and calculates the temperature of the streamflow by considering stream water air heat transfer this hydro climatological module explicitly describes the effects of hydrologic inputs local runoff components and upstream inflow on stream temperature to evaluate the impact of hydrologic changes caused by climate change on stream water temperature barnhart et al 2014 further applied the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to automatically calibrate the modified model for complex basins with large spatial variability of topography land use and soil type in addition mustafa et al 2018 pointed out that the hydro climatological stream temperature module did not explicitly account for the different types of radiation that affect thermal energy of water systems and they incorporated multiple thermal radiation components to account for radiative heat exchange however they also indicated that bias was generated in the radiative model due to the inclusion of highly variable radiative forcing components which required additional observations and suggested alternative formulations of the radiative components should be considered recently du et al 2018 incorporated an equilibrium water temperature approach into the hydro climatological module to improve the simulation of the heat transfer process at the stream water air interface without requiring additional measured input data the new method was tested and proved to be robust within the framework of swat however thermal energy contributions from terrestrial environment flows are still estimated using an empirical lumped method for each subbasin within a watershed as the lumped method does not explicitly simulate the thermal processes regulating the temperatures of terrestrial flows from various land uses and soil types it has a limited ability to track water thermal energy from different point and non point sources for the accurate assessment of land use change and climate change impacts water thermal energy in the terrestrial environment is closely associated with soil temperature when subsurface flows enter a channel their temperatures generally reflect the subsoil environment from which they originated beschta et al 1987 thus it is necessary to estimate water temperatures based on a terrestrial heat balance however the swat model employs an empirically based module to estimate soil temperature although this empirical module works well in temperate and tropical environments in cold regions with seasonal snow cover predictions of soil temperature does not match with field measurements to address this issue a physically based soil temperature module has been developed to consider the insulation effects of snow qi et al 2016a qi et al 2016b in addition the physically based module is able to estimate snow or soil surface temperature based on an energy balance update thermal properties of snow and soil layers according to changes in snow density and soil moisture and simulate freeze thaw cycles in the soil profile the physically based module has been successfully tested to simulate soil temperature soil thermal status and the freeze thaw cycle in both small and large watersheds in north america qi et al 2019a qi et al 2019c qi et al 2020b wang et al 2020a wang et al 2021 wang et al 2020b in this study we aim to 1 estimate terrestrial water temperatures based on soil thermal status 2 couple the physical processes influencing the heat balance of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and 3 examine the extent to which our new approach outperforms existing stream temperature simulation methods within the swat model under ungauged conditions the new version of the swat model herein couples terrestrial heat balance algorithms developed by qi et al 2016b with heat balance based equilibrium water temperature approach developed by du et al 2018 the new version of the swat model with the explicit heat balance description on both terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes was named swat hb herein we compared the swat hb model with two previous versions of the swat model which use only empirical relationships between air temperature and stream temperature swat er neitsch et al 2011 or combine empirical terrestrial water temperature estimates with the heat balance of stream water swat eh du et al 2018 ficklin et al 2012 evaluations and comparisons were conducted in the upper mississippi river basin umrb in the north central united states and greensboro watershed gw in the mid atlantic united states we anticipate that the results of this research will optimize the strengths and weaknesses of using physically based and empirically based approaches to accurately simulate stream temperature thereby providing guidance for selecting the best models for understanding and quantifying the effects of land use and climate change on stream temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the swat model the swat model is an ecohydrological model developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars to predict the impact of land use and climate change on water energy and nutrient cycles in watersheds arnold et al 1998 the swat model divides a watershed into subbasins connected by a stream network and further delineates hydrologic response units hrus using unique combinations of land use and soil types in each subbasin the major hydrologic routines within the swat model account for snowfall and snowmelt surface runoff vadose zone processes i e infiltration evaporation plant uptake lateral flows and percolation groundwater flows and river routing the swat model has been widely used to predict the hydrologic conditions heat transfer and exchange and nutrient cycles of terrestrial and aquatic environments in numerous watersheds around the world

terrestrial thermal processes the swat er model i e the conventional swat model uses a temperature index module stefan and preud homme 1993 to estimate the temperature of total water generated from a subbasin which is expressed as 1 t w 5 0 0 75 t a where t w is the water temperature and t a is the air temperature because the swat er model does not differentiate between the different temperatures of different flow components e g surface runoff lateral flow and base flow ficklin et al 2012 developed a subbasin level lumped module to calculate the temperatures t w s u b of well mixed surface runoff lateral flow and base flow for each subbasin which is expressed as 2 t w s u b t s n o w s u b q s n o w s u b t b f s u b q b f s u b λ t a i r l a g q s f s u b q l f s u b q t o a l s u b where qsnow sub is the snowmelt runoff contribution to streamflow within the subbasin m3 d 1 qbf sub is the groundwater flow contribution to the streamflow within the subbasin m3 d 1 qsf sub is the surface runoff contribution to the streamflow within the subbasin m3 d 1 qlf sub is the soil lateral flow contribution to the streamflow within the subbasin m3 d 1 qtotal sub is the total water yield contribution to streamflow within the subbasin m3 d 1 tsnow is the temperature of the snowmelt runoff assumed to be 0 1 tbf is the base flow temperature tair lag is the average daily air temperature with a lag to account for the effects of delayed surface runoff and soil water flow into the stream and λ is a calibration coefficient relating tair lag and surface runoff lateral flow there were some shortcomings for the lumped method first there were several calibration parameters introduced by the lumped method eq 2 including tbf lag and λ while λ could be calibrated relatively easily calibrating lag required examining the day to day variations in observed stream temperature data which were often not available further use of eq 2 was even more challenging when calibrating multiple stations in a watershed in addition tbf was an annual time series that must be provided by the user ficklin et al 2012 recommended using climatic input data to estimate subbasin tbf according to a finding of todd and mays 1980 that groundwater temperature was often 1 2 higher than mean annual air temperature of a region in addition the lumped method did not explicitly simulate the temperatures of different flow components nor did it differentiate between various land use and soil types this limited the ability of the lumped method to track water thermal energy contributions from different point and non point sources within a subbasin in order to assess land use change and water management impacts 2 2 2 simulation of aquatic thermal processes the swat er model used eq 1 to estimate water temperature in streams the disconnection between terrestrial and aquatic water thermal energy transfer limited this simple empirical method as it ignored the influence of land use and water use e g thermoelectric cooling on stream temperature in addition climatic factors such as solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and hydrologic conditions e g water depth and groundwater inflow were not considered by this temperature index method du et al 2018 ficklin et al 2012 to overcome the limitations of this empirical module ficklin et al 2012 developed a new hydro climatological temperature module to calculate stream water temperature this was further improved by du et al 2018 who included an equilibrium temperature approach to depict heat transfer processes at the water air interface that reflected the influences of air temperature solar radiation wind speed and streamflow on stream temperature step 4 in fig 2 du et al 2018 3 ρ w c w t w t k t t e t w h where ρw is the density of water kg m 3 cw is the specific heat capacity of water j kg 1 1 kt is the overall heat exchange coefficient w m 2 1 h is the water depth m and te is the equilibrium temperature c which is calculated using 4 t e t a η slr k t where η is the additive parameter influencing the water air heat transfer c and slr is the solar radiation w m 2 the overall heat exchange coefficient kt was based on the wind velocity dew point temperature and initial stream temperature edinger et al 1974 furthermore ficklin et al 2012 also proposed an algorithm to link terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes at the watershed scale step 2 3 and 4 in fig 2 2 3 modeling framework of swat hb building on the above mentioned modules in this study we developed the swat hb model which explicitly represented the terrestrial water thermal energy contributions at the hru level and the heat balance of stream water fig 2 first soil temperatures and various terrestrial water flow temperatures were coupled by assuming that the water temperature e g surface runoff lateral flow and base flow was the same as the source environments from which they originated step 1 in fig 2 as given in eq 5 5 t sf t a n o s n o w o r t sf 0 1 c s n o w m e l t t l f i t s o i l i t bf t bot where tsf tlf and tbf are the temperature for surface runoff lateral flow and base flow generated from the hrus tsoil and tbot are the temperature for soil layers and the damping depth and i indicates soil layer numbers as defined by the swat model the temperature of the surface runoff was assumed to be equal to the current day s air temperature this assumption was based on the equilibrium energy balance between surface water and air temperatures during the surface runoff concentration time when there was snow cover on the land surface the surface runoff temperature was set to 0 1 regardless of snowmelt or rain on snow events ficklin et al 2012 further the base flow temperature was assumed to be equal to the temperature at the damping depth where the soil temperature equal average annual air temperature the temperatures of lateral flows were equal to the temperature of each soil layer assuming sufficient mixing the swat hb model employed a physically based soil temperature module to calculate the soil temperature in each soil layer and at the damping depth see method 1 in the supplementary information si for more details qi et al 2016a qi et al 2016b qi et al 2019a qi et al 2019c then the temperatures of the surface runoff lateral flow and base flow from the hrus were weighted by hru areas in a subbasin to calculate the water temperature at the subbasin scale step 1 in fig 2 next the temperature of the total water contribution to the stream network from a subbasin was calculated using the mixing model

the initial stream water temperature at a time step was calculated as the weighted average of the contribution in the subbasin and the contribution from upstream step 3 in fig 2 ficklin et al 2012 finally we integrated the newly developed terrestrial heat balance processes step 1 and 2 in fig 2 with the stream water temperature algorithms step 3 and 4 in fig 2 developed from previous studies du et al 2018 ficklin et al 2012 to enable the swat hb model to explicitly trace water thermal energy from terrestrial to aquatic environments fig 2 2 4 study region and data description the umrb has a drainage area of 431 000 km2 fig 3 and includes large parts of the states of illinois iowa minnesota missouri and wisconsin and smaller portions of indiana michigan and south dakota arnold et al 2000 qi et al 2020b the regional land cover includes agricultural lands forests wetlands lakes prairies and urban areas but nearly 69 of the total land is used for agriculture and pasture wu and tanaka 2005 the umrb is recognized as a major contributor more than 50 of nitrogen that is transported to the gulf of mexico from intensive agricultural activities landscape management and widespread use of chemical fertilizers jha et al 2004 wu and tanaka 2005 the climate of the umrb is sub humid continental with average annual precipitation ranging from 575 mm in the western part of minnesota to 981 mm in the central part of illinois wu and tanaka 2005 average daily temperatures in the region range from 4 0 to 5 5 c in the north to 11 5 to 13 0 c in the south chen et al 2020 soil types in the basin vary from heavy poorly drained clay soil to light well drained sands qi et al 2019c for the purposes of this study we compiled daily streamflow and water temperature data from 10 usgs monitoring stations fig 3 the drainage area and data availability of the usgs stations are listed in table 1 the measured daily soil temperature at the surface and 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm depths were available from six u s climate reference network uscrn stations distributed across the umrb fig 3 we used a watershed defined by the usgs station in the choptank river near greensboro md usgs 01491000 which is referred to as the greensboro watershed gw 290 1 km2 fig 3 the gw is in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed in the mid atlantic united states fig 3 forests occupy 48 of the gw while croplands occupy 36 approximately 75 of soils in the gw are poorly drained in which 67 of the land is cropland ator and denver 2015 qi et al 2020a the major cropland soil types are typified by othello soils which are poorly drained and mattapex soils which are moderately well drained hively et al 2009 in general the landscape is nearly flat most slopes 2 the area is characterized by a temperate humid climate with an average annual temperature of 15 4 c and precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year with an average value of 1200 mm year 1 ator et al 2005 qi et al 2019b yeo et al 2014 the usgs station 01 491 000 is located at the outlet of the gw and monitors daily streamflow and water temperature data as listed in table 1 the measured daily soil temperatures at 5 10 20 and 50 cm soil depths from monitoring station 10 of the usda long term agricultural research ltar program were used to evaluate soil temperatures in the gw table 2 2 5 model set up and performance assessment the swat hb swat er and swat eh models were developed based on the same version of the swat model code with the only difference between them being treatments of terrestrial and aquatic water temperatures as described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 we set up the swat hb swat er and swat eh table 3 models for the umrb and gw and compared their performance without calibrating water temperature associated parameters as recent publications showed that parameter calibration might introduce additional uncertainty and could not guarantee correct representation of physical processes arnold et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 another reason for the ungauged treatment of water temperature prediction was because most applications of the swat model did not have observations to calibrate stream temperature it is necessary to understand how models will perform with default parameters based on previous literature we adopted the default calibration parameters of du et al 2018 for the equilibrium stream water temperature module used for both the swat eh and swat hb models and parameters of ficklin et al 2012 for the subbasin level lumped module used for the swat eh model table 4 in addition we calculated the average annual air temperature for the umrb and gw during the simulation period equal to 9 5 and 13 6 respectively to estimate the groundwater temperature for the subbasin level lumped module the final groundwater temperature estimated according to todd and mays 1980 was 10 5 and 14 6 for the umrb and gw respectively we compared model performance with regards to daily streamflow and stream temperatures model performance for streamflow was assessed using four statistics percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of

3 1 streamflow simulation before evaluating the model performance with regards to stream temperature we considered the daily streamflow simulated by the swat model as derived from our previous studies lee et al 2017 qi et al 2020b wang et al 2020b the model performance metrics are listed in table 5 and more detailed evaluations of the simulated streamflow time series at the 11 stations are shown in figs s1 and s2 of the si for the 10 stations in the umrb the nse r2 and kge ranged from 0 24 to 0 65 from 0 40 to 0 72 and from 0 39 to 0 77 with an average of 0 49 0 54 and 0 63 respectively and most pbias values were within the range from 20 to 20 simulated flows at the usgs station 05 267 000 had the lowest nse value partially because it is in the northern part of the umrb fig 3 and is influenced by snowmelt associated parameters which were globally configured at the basin scale a localized parameter configuration would help improve the simulation results in general for the daily streamflow simulation the model performance was deemed satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 all three versions of the swat model i e swat hb swat er and swat eh shared the same hydrologic processes but use different equations to calculate the water temperatures in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems 3 2 improving soil temperature simulation the conventional swat model adopts an empirically based soil temperature module etm to estimate the daily soil temperature by considering the previous days soil temperature air temperature and snow and residue cover see method 1 in the si for more details herein we used observed daily temperatures at different soil depths at six uscrn stations in the umrb qi et al 2019c and one station in the gw qi et al 2019a to compare the physically based soil temperature module ptm used by the swat hb model and the original empirical soil temperature module employed by the conventional swat model figs s3 s5 in the si the daily results demonstrated the better performance of the swat hb model as discussed in our previous studies qi et al 2019c to illustrate the contrasting performance of the swat hb and conventional swat models the simulated vs observed seasonal soil temperature time series at depths of 5 50 and 100 cm are shown in figs 4 5 and 6 respectively the comparison shows that the swat hb model better reproduced the seasonal soil temperature pattern for example at a depth of 5 cm the conventional swat model noticeably underestimated winter soil temperature at the two uscrn sites in minnesota and wisconsin in which winter snow cover is a major factor controlling the surface temperature at a depth of 50 cm the conventional swat model underestimated both the winter and summer soil temperatures at most stations the results at a depth of 100 cm also demonstrated that the conventional swat model at nearly all stations underestimated the summer soil temperature overall the physically based heat balance method outperformed the empirical method when estimating terrestrial thermal energy 3 3 difference in simulated terrestrial water temperatures by the three models accurate estimation of terrestrial water temperature is important for assessment of land use and climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems because of a lack of terrestrial water temperature measurements in the study watersheds we compared the simulated terrestrial water temperatures by the three models to investigate model performance since the swat er and swat eh models did not simulate the temperatures of various water flows at the hru level see section 2 2 we developed algorithms based on eqs 1 and 2 for these two models respectively to estimate surface runoff lateral flow base flow and total terrestrial water yield temperatures generated from hrus instead of subbasins for each model we calculated the multi year average seasonal and annual surface runoff lateral flow base flow and total terrestrial water yield temperatures across the umrb and gw as shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively further details regarding the seasonal time series of terrestrial water temperature for the umrb are also shown in fig s6 in the si in both the umrb and gw the swat hb model more consistently simulated lower surface runoff and lateral flow temperatures than the other two models in the spring summer and fall and at the annual scale fig 7a 7b 8a and 8b also see figs s6a and s6b especially for the umrb which has a large portion of land subject to a cold climate fig 3 meanwhile the swat eh model had the largest seasonal variation in water temperatures of surface runoff and lateral flow the highest values in summer and the comparable values to those of the swat hb model in winter regarding the base flow temperature the swat er model produced large seasonal variations the highest values in summer and the lowest values in winter while the swat hb and swat eh models exhibited minimal seasonal variations on both watersheds fig 7c and 8c also see fig s6c the total terrestrial water temperature was the highest for the swat er and lowest for the swat hb models at the annual scale and in the spring summer and fall in both the umrb and gw fig 7d and 8d for example in the umrb the total terrestrial water temperature for the swat er model was 12 7 compared to the 11 4 of the swat eh model and 9 9 of the swat hb model at the annual scale while in the gw these values are 15 2 15 0 and 13 5 respectively the swat hb and swat eh models had close total terrestrial water temperatures in the winter and they were higher than that of the swat er model in both watersheds fig 7d and 8d this result also indicates that base flow water temperatures estimated by the method of todd and mays 1980 and our proposed method based on soil temperature at the damping depth eq 5 are very close for all seasons at the watershed scale conversely the swat er model s base flow temperature simulation distinctly deviated from the other model results indicating that the eq 1 cannot be used to estimate the base flow temperature lower surface runoff temperatures were simulated by the swat hb model relative to the other two models because the other two models used regression equations between the air temperature and surface flow temperature eqs 1 and 2 whereas the swat hb model assumed that surface temperature was equal to the air temperature eq 4 the difference between the eq 1 and eq 2 is that eq 2 used by the swat eh model has a lag effect on the surface runoff and lateral flow temperature which tends to amplify the water temperature with highest values in the summer and lowest in the winter the swat hb model had lower lateral flow temperatures because they were calculated based on soil temperatures eq 4 which normally are lower than the air temperature except during the winter the close winter temperatures of surface runoff and lateral flow simulated by the swat hb and swat eh models suggests that the swat er model is less accurate for estimation of winter surface runoff and lateral flow water temperatures than the swat hb and swat eh models this is not surprising as eq 1 was developed based on observations collected from non winter seasons the estimated higher surface and lateral flow temperatures by the swat er model relative to the swat hb model were not consistent with the simulated soil temperatures of the two models as shown in figs 4 6 wherein the swat er model i e the conventional swat model generally predicted lower soil temperatures this inconsistent simulation of soil temperature and terrestrial water temperature arose from the decoupled soil and water heat exchange processes of the swat er model i e water temperature is solely dependent on air temperature as indicated by eq 1 therefore the swat er model could not reflect the thermal status of terrestrial environments and accurately represented the impacts of changes in land surface processes such as land use change and management practices on estimating the thermal energy transferred from land to rivers via different terrestrial flow components even though there was a relatively large difference between simulated surface runoff and lateral flow temperatures determined by the swat eh and swat hb models the swat eh model in general had similar performance to the swat hb model for the total terrestrial water temperatures in the umrb and gw this indicated that the lumped method eq 2 used within the swat eh model was in general sufficiently robust for estimating terrestrial water temperatures over large regions note that the swat eh model relied on only climate records to estimate terrestrial water temperatures and thus could not represent the impacts of land use or soil conditions on terrestrial thermal energy transfer we also examined the spatial distribution of the terrestrial water temperatures simulated by the three models specifically we used the multi year average annual surface runoff lateral flow and base flow temperatures at the subbasin level for the umrb to identify differences between the models fig 9 as the swat er model used the same equation eq 1 to calculate each of these temperatures their spatial distribution was the same however differences between these temperatures could be detected by examination of the swat eh model results as it used different empirical equations to estimate the temperature of different flow components as the swat eh model also relied on climate records to estimate surface runoff and lateral flow temperatures their spatial distributions were like those derived from the swat er model notably the swat eh model assumed that base flow temperature was constant across the entire basin based on the methods recommended by todd and mays 1980 and ficklin et al 2012 the swat hb model predicted more spatial variability in water temperatures for all three flow components than the swat er and swat eh models particularly for lateral flow and base flow in general the swat hb model predicted lower temperatures for all three flow components in comparison to the swat er model across the umrb further the swat hb model simulated lower surface runoff and lateral flow temperatures than the swat eh model the swat hb model predicted lower temperatures for base flow in the northern subbasins and higher temperatures for base flow in the southern subbasins which was mainly because the swat eh model used spatially averaged climate records to estimate a constant temperature for the entire watershed in general the swat hb model considered more spatially variable conditions e g land use and soil conditions when estimating the terrestrial water temperature making it a better tool to reflect the spatial heterogeneity in the thermal energy of terrestrial water flows 3 4 comparable model performance for long term stream temperature simulation the three models reproduced similar observed daily stream temperatures at the 10 usgs stations in the umrb and the one usgs station in the gw as shown in the scatter plots of observed vs simulated daily stream water temperatures fig s7 of si examined for the three statistics i e nse r2 and kge the three models performed comparably for simulating long term stream temperature in both watersheds table 6 although all three models produced small prediction biases within the range of 1 5 to 1 5 for most stations in both the umrb and gw the swat er model had the smallest absolute value of prediction bias of 0 4 averaged over 10 station in the umrb compared with those of the swat eh and swat hb models both had an averaged bias of 1 1 whereas the swat hb and swat eh models had smaller prediction biases of 0 3 and 0 5 compared to the swat er model s bias of 1 2 for the one station in the gw table 6 however mae values quantified more similar model performance between the three models for which averaged mae values over the 10 stations ranged from 2 7 to 2 9 in the umrb and mae values ranged from 1 9 to 2 1 for the one station in the gw table 6 the relatively large discrepancy in evaluating model performance between bias and mae was caused by the fact that mae measures the average magnitude of the errors in predictions without considering their direction while bias could measure average model bias with positive and negative values in order to further investigate model performance for underestimation indicated by negative biases or overestimation indicated by positive biases of daily stream temperature we also performed seasonal analyses 3 5 seasonal stream temperature differences between the three models we estimated the multi year average seasonal stream temperatures for 10 usgs gauge stations in the umrb and one usgs gauge station in the gw as shown in fig 10 the results showed that the swat er model consistently overestimated the spring and winter stream temperatures in the two watersheds bias ranging from 0 5 to 4 1 in the spring and from 0 9 to 4 6 in the winter and the swat eh and swat hb models had a better performance bias ranging from 1 8 to 2 0 in the spring and from 1 1 to 0 8 in the winter than the swat er model during these two seasons all three models tended to underestimate the summer stream temperature in the umrb bias ranging from 3 6 to 0 4 fig 10a 10j while for the gw the three models had relatively small biases in the summer bias ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 fig 10 k in the fall the swat er model achieved smaller absolute values of biases bias ranging from 1 9 to 1 0 than the other models bias ranging from 0 6 to 3 1 for all stations in the umrb but it had the largest bias 1 4 in the gw compared with other models bias ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 as the swat eh and swat hb models used the same heat balance based stream temperature algorithms and simulated similar terrestrial water temperature patterns figs 7 and 8 they showed similar performance in estimating the seasonal patterns of stream temperature at most stations both the swat hb and swat eh models seem to have relatively larger bias values in the summer and fall than in the winter and spring despite these patterns no single model consistently outperformed the other two models over all seasons and across all stations we calculated the seasonal bias averaged across all 11 usgs stations as shown in fig 11 the swat er model overestimated stream temperature in the spring and winter with larger bias 1 2 and 1 7 respectively while both the swat eh and swat hb models slightly underestimated stream temperature bias ranging from 0 5 to 0 9 meanwhile both the swat eh and swat hb models underestimated stream temperature in the fall with large absolute values of bias 1 8 and 1 9 respectively compared to the swat er model bias 0 2 for the summer all the three models underestimated the stream temperature with similar biases ranging from 1 9 to 2 2 overall the swat hb and swat eh models outperformed the swat er model during the spring and fall were comparable to the swat er model in the summer but did not perform as well as the swat er model during the winter the comparable performance between the three models during the summer and the higher warmer performance of the swat er model during the fall suggests that stream water temperature was to a large extent influenced by local climatic factors e g air temperature at the water surface leach and moore 2014 therefore temperature indexed water temperature models have been widely applied and found reliable for stream temperature simulation in large rivers this is also the main reason that three models performed better in simulating stream temperature than streamflow table 5 vs table 6 results from the gw showed promising improvement in stream water temperature simulation for the swat hb model fig 8k probably because of its smaller watershed size and year round abundant precipitation wherein the upland water heat contributions exerted more influence on the stream temperature although the swat er swat eh and swat hb models achieved similar results the swat er and swat eh models relied on climate forcing to estimate the terrestrial water temperature and therefore they could not be used to examine changes in the terrestrial water temperature in response to land use change thus the advantage of the swat hb model was its ability to simulate the heat balance of terrestrial environments making it able to represent the impact of land use change in addition to climate change on stream temperature 3 6 limitations and caveats of the study previous studies have shown that the swat eh model distinctly outperformed the original empirical stream temperature module in the swat er model in seven watersheds in the western united states ficklin et al 2012 and five watersheds within the athabasca river basin in alberta canada du et al 2018 conversely our results showed that there was comparable performance exhibited by the swat eh and swat er models this could be attributed to the fact that in this study we did not calibrate the water temperature related parameters listed in table 4 whereas previous studies conducted model calibrations to further improve the performance of the swat eh model for example du et al 2018 indicated that ƞ was the most sensitive parameter in the equilibrium stream water temperature module in their work ƞ was calibrated from 0 to 3 2 in the athabasca river basin therefore parameter calibration could lead to different comparison results it is likely that experimentation with different parameter sets could also lead to different results due to the influence of the parameters on the performance of each model however because of the difficulty in robustly determining meaningful parameter ranges van griensven et al 2006 and using optimization algorithms to search for global optimal parameter solutions zhang et al 2009a zhang et al 2009b zhang et al 2009c we used the default values for the parameters in order to understand their performance under a no parameter calibration scheme in addition we adopted this no parameter calibration approach as the swat model was developed to operate in large scale ungauged watersheds with minimal calibration efforts and recent studies indicate that in many cases parameter calibration cannot guarantee an accurate representation of model processes arnold et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 although the swat er and swat eh models performed similarly to the swat hb model we demonstrated that the swat hb model was a better model for predicting the responses of stream water temperature to land use changes the swat er and swat eh models relied on only climate records to derive terrestrial water temperatures but ignored other factors such as changes in land use and land management practices which could impact stream temperature particularly in small watersheds galbraith and burns 2007 leblanc et al 1997 sun et al 2015 meanwhile the similar performance of the three models indicates that the heat balance methods used in this study need further improvement we recommend that additional improvements should be made for the heat balance depiction of stream networks for example riparian vegetation irrigation practices and thermal electric cooling water use can affect stream heat balance madden et al 2013 but these were not considered in our models because of a lack of representative data for these processes in addition the use of daily time steps for river routing may not be adequate for representing the residence time of water in streams and associated energy exchange at the air water interface we anticipate that the limitations identified in this study will benefit future watershed scale stream water temperature modeling and assessment efforts in large ungauged basins 4 conclusions this study aimed to couple terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes to estimate stream water temperatures at the watershed scale we improved the swat model to explicitly consider the thermal processes influencing the temperature of different terrestrial water components i e surface runoff lateral flow and base flow as well as the heat balance of water in streams then we compared the simulations from three versions of the swat models using different terrestrial water temperature treatments including the proposed swat hb swat er and swat eh models in the upper mississippi river basin umrb and greensboro watershed gw of the chesapeake bay basin the simulation results showed that the three models performed comparably when evaluated against long term daily stream temperature observations at 10 usgs stations in the umrb and one usgs station in the gw which suggests that stream temperature is to a large extent determined by air temperature as water travels along large rivers the seasonal comparison indicated that the swat hb model outperformed the swat er model during the spring and winter slightly during the summer and did not perform as well as the swat er model in the fall the better model performance for the swat hb model in comparison to the swat eh model could be attributed to the improved estimation of terrestrial water temperatures of the different flow components we also compared the temporal and spatial distribution of surface runoff lateral flow and base flow temperatures across the umrb at the subbasin level which clearly demonstrated the advantage of the swat hb model compared to swat er and swat eh models although empirical methods e g the swat er model were deemed suitable for providing reliable estimation of stream temperature the coupled terrestrial and aquatic heat balance based methods e g the swat hb model allow for the additional consideration of the effects of land and water management practices on stream temperature such as crop irrigation land use change and water use for thermoelectric cooling credit authorship contribution statement junyu qi

4078,climate change effect analysis on the hydrologic cycle is essential for the assessment of water management strategies climate models can provide projections of precipitation changes in the future based on greenhouse gas emissions scenarios in this study the euro cordex european coordinated regional downscaling experiment climate models were first analyzed for the island of sardinia against observed precipitation for the historical period of 1976 2005 a multi model ensemble ens was built weighting different models based on their performance against observed precipitations future projections 2071 2100 were analyzed using the 8 5 rcp emissions scenario to evaluate changes in precipitations climate models were then used as climate forcing for the swat model soil and water assessment tool aiming to evaluate the effects of such changes on streamflow and runoff of two small catchments located in the south west sardinia a general decrease of mean precipitation values up to 25 at yearly scale in south west sardinia is expected for the future along with an increase of extreme precipitation events especially in the eastern and southern areas extreme events are projected to increase by 30 such changes reflect on the hydrologic cycle with a decrease of mean streamflow ranging from 18 to 25 and runoff ranging from 12 to 18 except in spring when runoff is projected to increase by 20 30 this study contributes to the analysis of climate change impacts in the mediterranean which is considered a hotspot of the global warming enhancing the use of modeling tools to

expected to decrease in southern europe and increase in northern europe changes are also expected in the seasonality of river flows with considerable differences over europe iglesias and garrote 2015 alongside an increasing flood risk caused by increasing precipitation extremes has been shown under a high emission scenario for mediterranean countries alfieri et al 2015 according to the clausius clapeyron equation the amount of water that can be stored in the atmosphere should increase by 7 per 1 c of global warming this will lead to an increase of available water vapor the increase in extreme precipitation exceeds this value due to latent heat feedbacks which enhances precipitation systems and moisture convergence in individual storms however the higher latitude subtropics are expected to become drier due to the poleward displacement of the extratropical storm tracks associated to the expansion of the subtropical high pressure systems thus an overall decrease in precipitation alongside a decrease in frequency of light to moderate precipitation is expected together with an increase in precipitation extremes trenberth 2011 moreover climate projections have confirmed a tendency for drier and warmer mediterranean climate in the next century piras et al 2014 mariotti et al 2015 giorgi 2006 identified the mediterranean sea region as one of the most prominent hot spots in the world due to its vulnerability to climate change sardinia is an island located in the west mediterranean sea and is particularly exposed to the scenarios described above thus assessing the effect of these projected changes at the local scale is central to plan better adaptation strategies evaluating the effects of climate change on the hydrologic balance is the crucial step to understand environmental evolution and conceive water plan management previous studies were conducted in sardinia testing euro cordex performances considering only historical

for its capabilities to reproduce water cycle for long term periods and under different conditions at the watershed scale swat simulates water cycle and quality is open source and well tested by a large community that constantly develops new features to improve its efficiency these are the main reasons which led to the choice of this model moreover swat was used in previous studies marras et al 2014 perra et al 2018 conducted to assess the water balance in sardinia with good results in terms of reliability of the model swat is commonly used offline or coupled with climate models to assess climate change impacts on future water resources and watershed management nerantzaki et al 2016 perra et al 2018 carvalho santos et al 2017 musie et al 2020 swat was combined with euro cordex simulations in recent studies such as senent aparicio et al 2017 where climate change impacts on streamflow were evaluated and in zarrineh et al 2020 that investigated the effects of climate change impacts on different ecosystems in switzerland furthermore euro cordex and swat were coupled in rocha et al 2020 to assess the impacts of climate change on two reservoirs in eestern europe and in kiesel et al 2019 to evaluate how climate change might cause freshwater ecological risks in three regions of europe in recent studies focused on sardinia swat was combined with ensembles climate models providing future climate forcing for water resources assessment and drought risk evaluation perra et al 2018 piras et al 2015 findings of these investigations project a future decrease of mean precipitations and the reduction of streamflow discharge with an increase of the extreme precipitation events in this study after an accurate evaluation of each single euro cordex model a multi model ensemble was built and a first attempt to predict future precipitation changes in sardinia using the most recent climate projections was made a further effort in this study was the analysis of the impact of the projected climate change on the hydrologic cycle of two small sardinian catchments coupling the multi model ensemble with the swat model this study gives a contribution to the study of the climate change impacts in the mediterranean area where such changes are going faster than in other regions lionello and scarascia 2018 highlighting the importance of using the described methodology which might be applied under different conditions to inform decision making 2 data and methods 2 1 area of study the study area is the sardinia island fig 1 which has a surface of around 24 000 km2 and is located in the west mediterranean sea the sardinian topography is mainly characterized by mountains interrupted by valleys and planes such as the campidano plain which are the result of structural horst graben features fig 1 in supplementary material the highest elevation is found the gennargentu mountains 1834 m a s l located in the center east of the island the gennargentu influence the local circulation and precipitation distribution of the island minor mountain ranges characterize the south west region the climate in sardinia is typically mediterranean with the occurrence of a wet period from september to may and a very dry summer from june to august mascaro et al 2018 in sardinia almost the 90 of the rivers are non perennial mulas et al 2009 major rivers such as tirso flumendosa and coghinas are barred by several dams in order to regulate water resources the predominant contribution to the flow of such rivers is the surface runoff montaldo and sarigu 2017 that mainly occurs in autumn and winter during the wet season as in most of the mediterranean regions runoff in sardinia decreased over the past three decades due to the decrease of precipitations montaldo and sarigu 2017 two watersheds located in the south west region namely rio san giorgio and rio mannu di fluminimaggiore were modeled using swat rio san giorgio rsg is a small river that originates nearby the town of iglesias and drains an area of around 3082 ha the river is affected by severe pollution due to the presence of several abandoned mines along with their residuals such as wastes and tails this study is a first attempt to predict changes in runoff and streamflow regime related to the climate change signal since the transport of the pollutants is mainly done by surface waters however in this study we did not analyze the pollutants dispersion in natural conditions rio san giorgio has an intermittent regime with flow strictly related to the occurrence of precipitations wastewaters from the urban area of iglesias are discharged in the watershed allowing a small continuous flow during the dry periods rio mannu di fluminimaggiore rmf from now on located few kilometers norther than rio san giorgio is a perennial river that drains an area of around 12 500 ha due to the presence of a streamflow measurement gauge this river was modeled along with rio san giorgio for the calibration of the swat model 2 2 observational data observed data used in this study include daily precipitation measured by 242 of the 441 rain gauges of the sardinian hydrological survey for the period 1979 2008 the 242 stations were chosen among the 441 after analyzing the missing values for the historical period as shown in fig 2 the stations red dots are evenly distributed throughout the island with approximately one station each 100 km2 covering a wide range of elevations up to 1467 m a s l 2 3 euro cordex simulations the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex project giorgi et al 2009 provides a set of rcm simulations driven by different gcm over europe as part of the euro cordex initiative kotlarski et al 2014 katragkou et al 2015 the euro cordex simulations used in this study cover the period 1976 2005 for the historical climate and 2071 2100 for future projections in agreement with the rcp8 5 scenario riahi et al 2011 for future greenhouse gas emissions rcp 8 5 scenario was used due to its usefulness in evaluating the widest possible range of climate changes for the future this scenario in fact uses emissions at the 90th percentile level of baseline scenarios available at the time and is the best match out to midcentury under current and stated policies with still highly plausible levels of co2 emissions in 2100 schwalm et al 2020 the model results daily precipitation at 0 11 resolution were retrieved from esgf portal earth system grid federation as shown in table 1 13 different model datasets at 0 11 resolution were available in the portal and were analyzed in this study the model acronyms will be kept in this text to simplify figures and tables see last column of table 1 2 4 models evaluation in this study similar error metrics to soares et al 2017 were used to evaluate the precipitation model s results the assessment of each precipitation model results is based on the comparison against observations measured by the 242 stations over sardinia for a historical reference period 1979 2008 relying on the nearest neighbor grid point with this purpose standard statistical errors are computed for the monthly seasonal and yearly scales the following statistics are calculated by pooling together time and space percentual bias bias eq 1 mean absolute percentage error mape eq 2 normalized standard deviation σ n eq 3 spatial correlation r eq 4 and willmott d score d eq 5 willmott et al 2012 the grid points of the euro cordex rcms correspond to the nearest neighbors to the

modelled values and o and p the mean of observed modelled values for the willmott d score a perfect skill is obtained when d 1 and no skill when d 1 the analysis around the mean values is done with the metrics in eq 1 5 and to measure the differences between distributions the s eq 6 and yule kendall yk eq 7 skill scores are used in agreement with perkins et al 2007 the probability density

score measures the overlap between observed and modelled pdfs whilst the yule kendall measure the difference between the two pdfs skewness 2 5 ensemble building to perform a robust characterization of the precipitation response to global warming in sardinia a euro cordex multi model ensemble was built taking into account the relative performance of each rcm christensen et al 2010 for describing the sardinian rainfall all above metrics were included in the ranking process for normalised standard deviation since the best result is 1 this metric was transformed as 8 ϑ n σ n i f σ n 1 1 σ n i f σ n 1 at the same way the yule kendall score became 9 yk new y k 1 i f y k 0 1 yk 1 i f y k 0 for each metric the individual model ranks were obtained by dividing each value by the sum of all model values in this sense the sum of the ranks for each metric is equal to 1 the model weights were constructed by multiplying the ranks of all the metrics finally each model weight is divided by the sum of the weights so that the sum of the weights is equal to 1 eq 10 10 pr i 1 n pr i w i i 1 n w i 2 6 swat model swat is a physically based semi distributed model that calculates daily and monthly hydrological balance parameters in a watershed arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 it is based on physical parameters that the user can modify to better represent the real conditions of the modeled watershed in the current study firstly swat was run using real precipitation time series and calibrated against streamflow data measured at the rmf gauge secondly swat was forced with the euro cordex climate model both for historical and future runs this allowed to quantify the effect of projected precipitation changes on the streamflow of rio san giorgio watershed input data for the model setup was retrieved from local government offices and is listed in table 1 of supplementary material swat divides the watershed in sub basins and calculates the water balance based on the hydrologic response units namely unique combinations of land use soils and slope class 160 sub basins and 2773 hrus were delineated slope was split into 3 classes 0 5 5 10 10 to reproduce the spatial variability of this feature in the watershed two point sources in which urban wastewater is discharged in rsg were also modeled fig 1c with an annual discharge of 90000 m3 year and 110000 m3 year respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed precipitation the mean yearly observed precipitation for the historical period 1976 2005 is 645 mm considerably lower than the 710 mm reported by mascaro et al 2018 for a wider period 1950 2005 with the lowest value of 365 mm and a maximum of 1040 mm in the gennargentu mountainous area almost 70 of the total rainfall is distributed between september and february around 25 in the spring months and only 6 of the precipitation falls in summer as shown in fig 2 of supplementary material revealing a strong seasonality the spatial variability of the precipitations is very high fig 3 especially in winter due to the orographic precipitation different seasonal spatial patterns can be highlighted in summer jja a decreasing rainfall pattern from north east to south west ranging from 75 to 100 mm in the north east to 0 10 mm of the south west area in winter djf a clear precipitation gradient from 350 to 400 mm in the east to 100 150 mm in the west with the exception of the mountain range of the south west area showing higher precipitation values if compared with the surrounding stations 3 2 evaluation of euro cordex simulations and the weighted multi model ensemble the performance of the models in the historical period is crucial to evaluate their reliability and determine their weights to build the multi model ensemble for climate change assessment fig 4 shows the percentual bias and the mean average percentage error of the models against the observed precipitation rcms show percentual biases in the range of 40 and 25 and mapes between 15 and 55 clm3 dmi knmi2 and mpi display rather low biases and mapes knmi2 shows a good representation of the seasonal and monthly scale rainfall while clm3 dmi and mpi are less reliable at these time scales knmi2 shows the lowest mape followed by the knmi1 and clm4 models clm3 and clm1 show good performance at yearly scale with a large detachment at monthly and seasonal scales the statistical errors and skill scores calculated for each model are summarized in table 2 the aim of this ranking process is not to assess the best performing model but to evaluate the weight of the different models and use them to build the ens the best three models that represent over 50 of the ens are knmi2 knmi1 and clm4 knmi2 and knmi1 are classified among the best performing models for precipitations also in peres et al 2020 and mascaro et al 2018 knmi2 shows the lowest mape 19 05 and the highest wilmott d score overall with a low bias 3 knmi1 has the best spatial correlation 0 61 and reproduces quite well the spatial distribution of the precipitation as further highlighted in fig 5 with a bias of 15 68 thus a tendence to overestimate precipitations clm4 has a low bias 5 39 but within the best performing models is the one with the lowest spatial correlation 0 39 and must be carefully considered when looking at spatial distribution of rainfall based on the rcm scores the weighted model ensemble was built and are shown in table 3 as the ens correspondent error measures ens has a bias of 12 and a relatively low mape that attains at 24 18 for seasonal resolution while at yearly and monthly scale the mape has a small respectively lower and higher variation around the seasonal value the fig 5a shows the yearly mean accumulated precipitation for each model and for the ens knmi1 knmi2 and clm4 reproduce rather well the spatial patterns that is also confirmed by fig 5b which shows the relative differences between the observed annual precipitation and the simulated by the rcms smhi5 underestimates precipitation in the east coast up to 80 90 of relative error and in the southern campidano area ranging from 60 to 70 of relative error smhi3 and smhi4 hugely overestimate values in the western stations with peaks of 100 of relative error mpi and dmi models do not reproduce the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation particularly the mpi model overestimates rainfall in most of the stations reaching relative errors 100 and underestimates it in all the eastern coast with 50 error the seasonal precipitation fig 6 highlights the complexity of the orography and its influence on the spatial distribution of the rainfall the seasonal precipitation ranges from values always above 200 mm in the gennargentu mountains to values below 100 mm in the southern area around the city of cagliari which is the driest zone even in winter despite a general overestimation of the precipitation the weighted multi model ensemble ens reproduces the spatial patterns of the seasonal cumulates fig 6 efficiently except in summer jja were there is a notable spatial and quantitative disagreement precipitation in south west area is overestimated in all the seasons while there is a good reproduction of the patterns in the south campidano region which is as mentioned above one of the driest areas generally precipitations in the mountain ranges all over the island are overestimated by ens by around 40 50 on average at yearly scale with peaks of 100 in the south west region suggesting that euro cordex rcms still does not capture the local conditions in mountainous areas sufficiently well this is in agreement with the results of mascaro et al 2018 which highlight a good reproduction of orographic effect but a high overestimation of its amplitude overestimation of precipitations over mountainous regions are also reported in other parts of the mediterranean by colmet daage et al 2018 which studied three basins in the gulf of lion despite the euro cordex models used in this study still show limited ability to reproduce precipitation properties no bias correction was applied to avoid overfitting of the results that could add more uncertainties to the model chain as reported by maraun 2016 any modifications of spatial temporal or multi variable aspects of the downscaled rcms may strongly break the consistency with the driving gcm model and affect other aspects than the desired ones moreover the quality of the available observations was not evaluated the analysis of the following projections is more focused on the relative changes between past and future scenarios rather than on the absolute values of the projected variables 3 3 precipitation future projections the precipitation projections are analyzed following the future rcp8 5 emissions scenario the relative changes for precipitation in the period 2071 2100 when compared with the historical period 1976 2005 of ens fig 7 show a general rainfall decrease at the yearly scale which is rather significant in the south west area 20 to 25 with a negative gradient from north east to south west the projected seasonal relative changes highlight different patterns djf is characterized by a general decrease of precipitation larger in the east and south west regions of sardinia amounting to values between 15 and 25 in mam a more considerable change is displayed especially in the south of the island with a reduction of precipitation ranging from 25 to 30 in jja a positive steep gradient has a south east to north west orientation going from positive small changes above 5 to a larger decrease up to 35 in the north west area another gradient of relative change is predicted for son from north east to south west with positive changes up to 5 in the north east down to 25 in the south west cape the ens reveals a striking future relative change in the number of wet days daily precipitation above 1 mm fig 8 that reaches values around 25 the decrease in percentage of wet days projected by the ens all over the island fig 8 has a north east to south west gradient with larger decreases in the campidano area south west in the gennargentu mountains center east and in the ottana plain center west these changes agree with others climate change analysis that were performed in the mediterranean region for the same future period in dubrovsky et al 2013 projected changes reach 30 of precipitations in zittis et al 2019 a reduction between 30 and 40 is expected using the same rcp8 5 emissions scenario 3 4 changes in extremes the projected relative change in wet days above 10 mm of precipitations fig 9 left shows a different pattern but adds to a wide distributed rainfall decrease with the south west area that still shows a decrease that could amount up to 25 subsequently dry periods might be longer in the future in agreement with previous similar investigations sillmann et al 2013 zollo et al 2016 ducić et al 2012 conducted in the mediterranean region although an increase of precipitations above 20 mm in some regions is projected such as in campidano and sassari provinces this points to the increase of intense rainfall events in those areas rainfall events above 20 mm fig 9 right are also expected to decrease large extensions of the other regions with higher negative values in the mountainous areas of gennargentu and in the south west range confirming an overall decrease of precipitations the future projections for the relative changes of high rank precipitation percentiles 95th and 99 9th percentiles are depicted in fig 10 showing an overall increase of both percentiles which have similar spatial patterns the higher percentages of change are projected for the east side with maxima increases above 30 in mountainous areas and southern island capes for the 99th percentile extremes in the southern and eastern areas are in some way in agreement with the zones historically impacted by extreme rainfalls bodini and cossu 2010 due to the presence of high and steep mountains near the coast which are exposed to hot and moist currents coming from africa the projected changes in number of wet days and high rank precipitation percentiles suggest that while mean precipitations seem to decrease significantly more intense precipitations distributed in few events are expected in literature many studies described this trend over mediterranean for the future even with different approaches giorgi et al 2019 zittis et al 2019 martel et al 2020 colmet daage et al 2018 alpert et al 2002 paxian et al 2015 3 5 hydrological swat simulations and the impact of climate change in two basins the swat model was calibrated and validated against daily streamflow observations 1985 1994 measured at the rmf station split in two independent series 1985 1992 for calibration and 1992 1994 for validation using the sufi 2 procedure abbaspour et al 2004 in sufi 2 the goodness of the model is evaluated accounting and measuring uncertainty while the fitting of the modeled and observed discharge is measured with nash sutcliffe index that is calculated as follows 11 ns 1 i q m q s 2 i q m i q m 2 where q is a variable e g discharge and m and s stand for measured and simulated respectively and the bar stands for average a perfect model would have a ns index of 1 while a ns below 0 corresponds to an unreliable model suggested values of ns are 0 5 daily calibration fig 11 a scored a ns index of 0 66 and 0 60 for the validation period the validation at monthly scale fig 11b was also performed for the period 1985 1992 obtaining a ns of 0 88 the model seems to better reproduce the monthly mean streamflow in agreement with the chosen scale for long term future simulations the swat model was firstly forced with euro cordex historical simulations 1976 2005 in order to compare the model s output with the observed streamflow future swat simulations were run from 2071 to 2100 according with the climate change analysis all the hydrological simulations were preceded by two years of warm up both for historical 1976 1978 and future period 2071 2073 swat model s weather generator needs continuous daily rainfall time series with standard gregorian calendar due to the use of 360 calendar days in the mohc hadgem2 es gcm simulations 3 rcms forced by this gcm have been excluded from the hydrological simulations based in the weights assigned to the climate models to build the ens the different swat model s outputs have been weighted normalizing the weights to 100 see table 2 in supplementary material in the following analysis for practical reasons each swat output resulting from a different forcing model will be mentioned as swat name of the model e g sw clm1 sw mpi while swat weighted output based on multi model ensemble weights will be named sw ens a first comparison of the rmf outflows fig 12 was analyzed for the period of observation 1985 1992 in order to compare the annual cycle of the different swat models against the observed streamflow at the measurement gauge swat models outputs show huge biases in some cases sw smhi4 sw smhi3 sw smhi1 and sw dmi while sw mpi shows the best agreement followed by sw clm1 sw clm3 sw clm4 and sw knm1 as the knm1 model has the highest weight in the ens 15 8 normalized to 28 8 the sw ens outflow has a similar monthly cycle as the sw knmi1 outflow with an overestimation of the discharge that in winter can reach large values above 200 the nash sutcliffe ns index was also calculated for the different swat rcms combinations table 3 the ns score of the best performing sw rcms sw clm1 sw clm3 and sw clm4 is around 0 meaning that models are performing only as well as the mean target value used for prediction according to existing literature abbaspour et al 2004 moussa 2010 a disagreement between best performing rcms for precipitations and the best performing sw rcms combinations for example the less performing rcm used within the ensemble mpi normalized weight 1 75 is one of the best performing rcms when coupled with swat sw mpi ns 0 3 the ns score of the sw ens model is 0 28 indicating a limited reliability for future hydrological projections due to the high number of uncertainty sources fig 13 a shows the comparison between historical 1976 2005 and future 2071 2100 model s monthly mean outflow at the control point of rmf for the sw ens model a general decrease of the monthly mean discharge is expected according with the future projections attaining to an average of around 25 the main loss is projected for spring months in particular for may in which the flow is reduced of around 40 1 02 m3 s for reference period against 0 62 m3 s in the future the comparison between historical sw ens hist and future sw ens fut periods from the analysis of rsg catchment fig 13b shows that outflow decreases of around 18 on average in the future run in particular from january to may ranging from 0 10 m3 s to 0 13 m3 s loss a future scenario sw ens fut nops that simulates the outflow after removing the two point sources from the catchment is also shown fig 13b the contribution the point sources is around 0 05 m3 s and in very dry periods it represents the only inflow in rsg analyzing the models which within the ens streamflow signal scored the best ns index sw mpi sw clm1 sw clm3 sw clm4 and sw knm1 is notable that all the models predict a significant decrease for winter and spring seasons fig 14 except sw clm1 that predicts a sensible increase for january and february as also found in perra et al 2018 summer and autumn are expected to be dryer except for sw mpi that projects an increase of the precipitation for october probably related to extreme events nevertheless it should be taken in account that mpi climate model was the less performing model within the ens while it showed a very good agreement in resulting outflow when coupled with swat model hence this model has to be carefully considered for future projections its tendence to overestimating the precipitation in the south west of the island should be taken into account as highlighted in fig 5 similar values of mean streamflow decrease were also obtained in di sante et al 2021 were a sensibly higher reduction between 25 and 30 is projected in the mediterranean region where euro cordex rcp8 5 scenarios were used as climate forcing for the hydrological simulations referred to the same future period runoff was calculated by swat over the rmf basin fig 15 a and rsg basin fig 15b as mm of water generated in each subbasin averaged on a monthly basis runoff in the rmf basin decreases on average of around 12 in the future projections particularly from april to october with the highest absolute loss of 42 mm in may 39 and the highest percent loss of 64 in june 32 mm a significant rise of 38 mm 29 is predicted for february and 30 mm 20 for march the increase of the mean runoff in february march together with a decrease of the mean outflow could be related to the extreme precipitation events analyzed at daily resolution in previous section 3 4 changes in extremes that cause a very rapid response of the basin that cannot be highlighted at monthly timestep in rsg basin projections of runoff budget highlight a mean decrease of 18 with the highest absolute loss of 137 mm 50 in may and the highest percentage loss of 56 in june 39 mm against the historical mean of 88 mm despite the small spatial difference between the two basins the increase of runoff that is predicted for rmf basin is not so pronounced in rsg basin where only a rise of 31 mm 10 is noticeable in february these projections agree with similar studies with slightly differences in percentages of loss in perra et al 2018 for instance an averaged loss of 30 in runoff is predicted while in koutroulis et al 2018 mean runoff projected decrease variates between 20 and 30 4 conclusions in this study a weighted multi model ensemble composed of different climate models of the euro cordex experiment rcp 8 5 emissions severe scenario was built and used as climate forcing for the swat hydrological model first a climate model analysis was performed through the comparison between modeled and observed rainfall for a historical reference period 1979 2008 using several statistical indexes bias mape normalized standard deviation wilmott d score spatial correlation s score and yule kendall index this analysis allowed to build a weighted multi model ensemble ens through models ranking based on their performances against observed rainfall the analysis of historical simulations revealed that the ability of rcm models to reproduce local precipitation such as the precipitation at small scales in regions with uneven orography is still somewhat limited as reported also by mascaro et al 2018 as found in the mentioned study focused on the same domain and also in studies focused on other mediterranean regions colmet daage et al 2018 in mountainous zones precipitations are overestimated the best models within the ens are knmi2 and knmi1 in accordance with peres et al 2020 and mascaro et al 2018 followed by clm4 and clm1 a first advancement of this study consisted in the evaluation of future euro cordex scenarios in the mediterranean island of sardinia future climate change signals of the ens project a general decrease of mean precipitation up to 20 to 25 in particular in the south west area while in summer and autumn a small increase of precipitation 5 10 is projected for the east and south east regions the analysis of the number of days with precipitations above 10 and 20 mm confirm the diminution trend for the future precipitations with a subsequent prolongation of dry periods except for some areas in the west side where events above 20 mm are projected to slightly rise the extreme precipitation events exceeding the 90th and 95th percentiles show a widespread increase more pronounced in the east side and in the southern capes with rises of 30 this analysis suggests that while precipitations are projected to decrease in their mean values and in number of wet days more extreme events are expected as highlighted by the projections of high rank precipitations meaning more intense precipitations in less events the swat model was implemented in a sub domain of the sardinian island specifically in two catchments located in the south west region firstly swat was run using observed rainfall thus it was calibrated and validated against observed streamflow subsequently swat was forced by the euro cordex models for the analysis of future outflow and runoff a general disagreement between the performances of rcms and swat rcms couples was noticed the best performing rcm in terms of precipitations when coupled with swat do not properly simulate the observed outflow moreover some of the rcms such as sw mpi and sw clm3 despite their inefficiency in reproducing precipitation show the best ns indexes when coupled with swat for outflow simulation this also reflects the uncertainties related to low quality observations used for swat model implementation calibration and the still limited euro cordex capabilities when implemented in lands with complex orography such as sardinia future projections predict a general decrease of 20 of mean outflow in both rmf and rsg catchments the surface runoff which is the main contribution to the natural flow of the studied streams is predicted to decrease up to 60 in spring months according to the future projections in rmf a rise in runoff in february and march and december is predicted while a diminution is projected for the rest of the year 12 on average in rsg basin runoff mean decrease is 31 with a small increase for february this could drastically affect the rsg streamflow when in the future wastewaters will be addressed to a different basin but on the other hand it could have benefits on the weathering of the several mine dumps in the area findings from current study stress that future climate in the western mediterranean might be characterized by less precipitation which is more clustered into extreme events confirming that the mediterranean area is a hotspot of the climate change as mentioned in previous studies e g giorgi 2006 lionello and scarascia 2018 diffenbaugh et al 2007 this could imply severe consequences such as the reduction of water resources and the rise of the flood risk and should be considered to better plan water resources management and hazard mitigation in fact results show that the extreme rainfall events are projected to increase hence modeling floods is necessary to quantify and prevent such risk despite the uncertainties that propagate through the model chain these results have importance in terms of relative changes between past and future scenarios thus might not be considered in terms of absolute values of the assessed variables the described combination between euro cordex and swat can be applied in different conditions different regions with different climate different hydrologic regimes and for different kind of evaluations e g impact of land use changes impact of climate change on reservoirs enhancing the use of these tools can significantly improve their reliability by underling existing limitations and capabilities particularly in areas characterized by data scarcity moreover the study of such tools gains more importance in arid and semi arid zones like the mediterranean in which many water scarcity problems exist lionello and scarascia 2020 requiring immediate actions and policies however the reliability of these projections is still limited and more accurate projections can be performed reducing the incoming uncertainties in the hydro climate model chain furthermore also the different domains of the climate model analysis that was carried out for the whole island and the swat model simulations limited to 2 small catchments must be considered when evaluating the performances extending the analysis of hydro climate simulations to a wider area thus considering more catchments could improve future investigations the described model chain could hence become a very powerful tool for water and basin management decision making credit authorship contribution statement pier andrea

4078,climate change effect analysis on the hydrologic cycle is essential for the assessment of water management strategies climate models can provide projections of precipitation changes in the future based on greenhouse gas emissions scenarios in this study the euro cordex european coordinated regional downscaling experiment climate models were first analyzed for the island of sardinia against observed precipitation for the historical period of 1976 2005 a multi model ensemble ens was built weighting different models based on their performance against observed precipitations future projections 2071 2100 were analyzed using the 8 5 rcp emissions scenario to evaluate changes in precipitations climate models were then used as climate forcing for the swat model soil and water assessment tool aiming to evaluate the effects of such changes on streamflow and runoff of two small catchments located in the south west sardinia a general decrease of mean precipitation values up to 25 at yearly scale in south west sardinia is expected for the future along with an increase of extreme precipitation events especially in the eastern and southern areas extreme events are projected to increase by 30 such changes reflect on the hydrologic cycle with a decrease of mean streamflow ranging from 18 to 25 and runoff ranging from 12 to 18 except in spring when runoff is projected to increase by 20 30 this study contributes to the analysis of climate change impacts in the mediterranean which is considered a hotspot of the global warming enhancing the use of modeling tools to investigate possible future scenarios keywords euro cordex climate change hydrology swat model sardinia multi model ensemble 1 introduction in the mediterranean basin the future reduction of mean precipitation along with the increased temperatures due to global warming may further exacerbate droughts heat waves and water shortages as well as more frequent floods and may be critical for many human activities soares et al 2017 zappa et al 2015 giorgi and lionello 2008 this is particularly true for the mediterranean water sector where pressures and impacts on water scarcity are projected to multiply under climate change iglesias et al 2011 in the last decades the potential impact of climatic change on hydrology has gained considerable attention in the hydrologic research community abbaspour et al 2009 akhtar et al 2008 angelina et al 2015 gardner 2009 nowadays the evaluation of such impacts cannot be disregarded in watershed management plans watershed scale models can provide a primary support for the assessment of environmental issues yan et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 giang et al 2017 helping decision makers in watershed management and water resources protection for well planned adaptation measures which can include the use of impact models driven by regional climate models rcm decision makers demand more precise projections of how the future might look like von trentini et al 2019 a state of the art ensemble of regional climate models for europe was developed within the cordex consortium euro cordex european coordinated regional downscaling experiment jacob et al 2020 euro cordex models represent the largest ensemble of regional climate models ever produced focused on a common european domain this ensemble was used to project the european future climate jacob et al 2014 carvalho et al 2021 was extensively evaluated for a wide range of surface variables e g katragkou et al 2015 kotlarski et al 2014 knist et al 2017 peres et al 2020 vautard et al 2021 torma et al 2020 and enabled more detailed studies on the consequences of climate change in specific regions in particular related to precipitation temperature and wind soares et al 2017 cardoso et al 2019 nogueira et al 2019 frei et al 2018 rulfová et al 2017 for southern europe general circulation models gcm and rcm simulations predict a future decrease of mean precipitation with an intensification of extreme values sillmann et al 2013 casanueva et al 2016 alpert et al 2002 sánchez et al 2004 gao et al 2006 rajczak et al 2013 soares et al 2015 under climate change river flow is expected to decrease in southern europe and increase in northern europe changes are also expected in the seasonality of river flows with considerable differences over europe iglesias and garrote 2015 alongside an increasing flood risk caused by increasing precipitation extremes has been shown under a high emission scenario for mediterranean countries alfieri et al 2015 according to the clausius clapeyron equation the amount of water that can be stored in the atmosphere should increase by 7 per 1 c of global warming this will lead to an increase of available water vapor the increase in extreme precipitation exceeds this value due to latent heat feedbacks which enhances precipitation systems and moisture convergence in individual storms however the higher latitude subtropics are expected to become drier due to the poleward displacement of the extratropical storm tracks associated to the expansion of the subtropical high pressure systems thus an overall decrease in precipitation alongside a decrease in frequency of light to moderate precipitation is expected together with an increase in precipitation extremes trenberth 2011 moreover climate projections have confirmed a tendency for drier and warmer mediterranean climate in the next century piras et al 2014 mariotti et al 2015 giorgi 2006 identified the mediterranean sea region as one of the most prominent hot spots in the world due to its vulnerability to climate change sardinia is an island located in the west mediterranean sea and is particularly exposed to the scenarios described above thus assessing the effect of these projected changes at the local scale is central to plan better adaptation strategies evaluating the effects of climate change on the hydrologic balance is the crucial step to understand environmental evolution and conceive water plan management previous studies were conducted in sardinia testing euro cordex performances considering only historical simulations mascaro et al 2018 or in combination with hydrological models including sardinia as part of a wider study area koutroulis et al 2018 marx et al 2017 colmet daage et al 2018 di sante et al 2021 in which also future projections were carried out findings from these studies revealed that decreasing mean flow trends are expected for the future all over the mediterranean area depending on the warming scenario swat soil and water assessment tool is a physically based and parametric hydrological model in which all the processes may be simulated using specific equations that can be modified by users through several physical parameters swat was used for evaluating the impact of climate change and anthropogenic factors on stream flow agricultural chemical and sediment yields in large river basins arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2000 jha et al 2006 krysanova and white 2015 grusson et al 2015 francesconi et al 2016 swat is one of the most used hydrological models in the world for its capabilities to reproduce water cycle for long term periods and under different conditions at the watershed scale swat simulates water cycle and quality is open source and well tested by a large community that constantly develops new features to improve its efficiency these are the main reasons which led to the choice of this model moreover swat was used in previous studies marras et al 2014 perra et al 2018 conducted to assess the water balance in sardinia with good results in terms of reliability of the model swat is commonly used offline or coupled with climate models to assess climate change impacts on future water resources and watershed management nerantzaki et al 2016 perra et al 2018 carvalho santos et al 2017 musie et al 2020 swat was combined with euro cordex simulations in recent studies such as senent aparicio et al 2017 where climate change impacts on streamflow were evaluated and in zarrineh et al 2020 that investigated the effects of climate change impacts on different ecosystems in switzerland furthermore euro cordex and swat were coupled in rocha et al 2020 to assess the impacts of climate change on two reservoirs in eestern europe and in kiesel et al 2019 to evaluate how climate change might cause freshwater ecological risks in three regions of europe in recent studies focused on sardinia swat was combined with ensembles climate models providing future climate forcing for water resources assessment and drought risk evaluation perra et al 2018 piras et al 2015 findings of these investigations project a future decrease of mean precipitations and the reduction of streamflow discharge with an increase of the extreme precipitation events in this study after an accurate evaluation of each single euro cordex model a multi model ensemble was built and a first attempt to predict future precipitation changes in sardinia using the most recent climate projections was made a further effort in this study was the analysis of the impact of the projected climate change on the hydrologic cycle of two small sardinian catchments coupling the multi model ensemble with the swat model this study gives a contribution to the study of the climate change impacts in the mediterranean area where such changes are going faster than in other regions lionello and scarascia 2018 highlighting the importance of using the described methodology which might be applied under different conditions to inform decision making 2 data and methods 2 1 area of study the study area is the sardinia island fig 1 which has a surface of around 24 000 km2 and is located in the west mediterranean sea the sardinian topography is mainly characterized by mountains interrupted by valleys and planes such as the campidano plain which are the result of structural horst graben features fig 1 in supplementary material the highest elevation is found the gennargentu mountains 1834 m a s l located in the center east of the island the gennargentu influence the local circulation and precipitation distribution of the island minor mountain ranges characterize the south west region the climate in sardinia is typically mediterranean with the occurrence of a wet period from september to may and a very dry summer from june to august mascaro et al 2018 in sardinia almost the 90 of the rivers are non perennial mulas et al 2009 major rivers such as tirso flumendosa and coghinas are barred by several dams in order to regulate water resources the predominant contribution to the flow of such rivers is the surface runoff montaldo and sarigu 2017 that mainly occurs in autumn and winter during the wet season as in most of the mediterranean regions runoff in sardinia decreased over the past three decades due to the decrease of precipitations montaldo and sarigu 2017 two watersheds located in the south west region namely rio san giorgio and rio mannu di fluminimaggiore were modeled using swat rio san giorgio rsg is a small river that originates nearby the town of iglesias and drains an area of around 3082 ha the river is affected by severe pollution due to the presence of several abandoned mines along with their residuals such as wastes and tails this study is a first attempt to predict changes in runoff and streamflow regime related to the climate change signal since the transport of the pollutants is mainly done by surface waters however in this study we did not analyze the pollutants dispersion in natural conditions rio san giorgio has an intermittent regime with flow strictly related to the occurrence of precipitations wastewaters from the urban area of iglesias are discharged in the watershed allowing a small continuous flow during the dry periods rio mannu di fluminimaggiore rmf from now on located few kilometers norther than rio san giorgio is a perennial river that drains an area of around 12 500 ha due to the presence of a streamflow measurement gauge this river was modeled along with rio san giorgio for the calibration of the swat model 2 2 observational data observed data used in this study include daily precipitation measured by 242 of the 441 rain gauges of the sardinian hydrological survey for the period 1979 2008 the 242 stations were chosen among the 441 after analyzing the missing values for the historical period as shown in fig 2 the stations red dots are evenly distributed throughout the island with approximately one station each 100 km2 covering a wide range of elevations up to 1467 m a s l 2 3 euro cordex simulations the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex project giorgi et al 2009 provides a set of rcm simulations driven by different gcm over europe as part of the euro cordex initiative kotlarski et al 2014 katragkou et al 2015 the euro cordex simulations used in this study cover the period 1976 2005 for the historical climate and 2071 2100 for future projections in agreement with the rcp8 5 scenario riahi et al 2011 for future greenhouse gas emissions rcp 8 5 scenario was used due to its usefulness in evaluating the widest possible range of climate changes for the future this scenario in fact uses emissions at the 90th percentile level of baseline scenarios available at the time and is the best match out to midcentury under current and stated policies with still highly plausible levels of co2 emissions in 2100 schwalm et al 2020 the model results daily precipitation at 0 11 resolution were retrieved from esgf portal earth system grid federation as shown in table 1 13 different model datasets at 0 11 resolution were available in the portal and were analyzed in this study the model acronyms will be kept in this text to simplify figures and tables see last column of table 1 2 4 models evaluation in this study similar error metrics to soares et al 2017 were used to evaluate the precipitation model s results the assessment of each precipitation model results is based on the comparison against observations measured by the 242 stations over sardinia for a historical reference period 1979 2008 relying on the nearest neighbor grid point with this purpose standard statistical errors are computed for the monthly seasonal and yearly scales the following statistics are calculated by pooling together time and space percentual bias bias eq 1 mean absolute percentage error mape eq 2 normalized standard deviation σ n eq 3 spatial correlation r eq 4 and willmott d score d eq 5 willmott et al 2012 the grid points of the euro cordex rcms correspond to the nearest neighbors to the

modelled values and o and p the mean of observed modelled values for the willmott d score a perfect skill is obtained when d 1 and no skill when d 1 the analysis around the mean values is done with the metrics in eq 1 5 and to measure the differences between distributions the s eq 6 and yule kendall yk eq 7 skill scores are used in agreement with perkins et al 2007 the probability density

score measures the overlap between observed and modelled pdfs whilst the yule kendall measure the difference between the two pdfs skewness 2 5 ensemble building to perform a robust characterization of the precipitation response to global warming in sardinia a euro cordex multi model ensemble was built taking into account the relative performance of each rcm christensen et al 2010 for describing the sardinian rainfall all above metrics were included in the ranking process for normalised standard deviation since the best result is 1 this metric was transformed as 8 ϑ n σ n i f σ n 1 1 σ n i f σ n 1 at the same way the yule kendall score became 9 yk new y k 1 i f y k 0 1 yk 1 i f y k 0 for each metric the individual model ranks were obtained by dividing each value by the sum of all model values in this sense the sum of the ranks for each metric is equal to 1 the model weights were constructed by multiplying the ranks of all the metrics finally each model weight is divided by the sum of the weights so that the sum of the weights is equal to 1 eq 10 10 pr i 1 n pr i w i i 1 n w i 2 6 swat model swat is a physically based semi distributed model that calculates daily and monthly hydrological balance parameters in a watershed arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 it is based on physical parameters that the user can modify to better represent the real conditions of the modeled watershed in the current study firstly swat was run using real precipitation time series and calibrated against streamflow data measured at the rmf gauge secondly swat was forced with the euro cordex climate model both for historical and future runs this allowed to quantify the effect of projected precipitation changes on the streamflow of rio san giorgio watershed input data for the model setup was retrieved from local government offices and is listed in table 1 of supplementary material swat divides the watershed in sub basins and calculates the water balance based on the hydrologic response units namely unique combinations of land use soils and slope class 160 sub basins and 2773 hrus were delineated slope was split into 3 classes 0 5 5 10 10 to reproduce the spatial variability of this feature in the watershed two point sources in which urban wastewater is discharged in rsg were also modeled fig 1c with an annual discharge of 90000 m3 year and 110000 m3 year respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed precipitation the mean yearly observed precipitation for the historical period 1976 2005 is 645 mm considerably lower than the 710 mm reported by mascaro et al 2018 for a wider period 1950 2005 with the lowest value of 365 mm and a maximum of 1040 mm in the gennargentu mountainous area almost 70 of the total rainfall is distributed between september and february around 25 in the spring months and only 6 of the precipitation falls in summer as shown in fig 2 of supplementary material revealing a strong seasonality the spatial variability of the precipitations is very high fig 3 especially in winter due to the orographic precipitation different seasonal spatial patterns can be highlighted in summer jja a decreasing rainfall pattern from north east to south west ranging from 75 to 100 mm in the north east to 0 10 mm of the south west area in winter djf a clear precipitation gradient from 350 to 400 mm in the east to 100 150 mm in the west with the exception of the mountain range of the south west area showing higher precipitation values if compared with the surrounding stations 3 2 evaluation of euro cordex simulations and the weighted multi model ensemble the performance of the models in the historical period is crucial to evaluate their reliability and determine their weights to build the multi model ensemble for climate change assessment fig 4 shows the percentual bias and the mean average percentage error of the models against the observed precipitation rcms show percentual biases in the range of 40 and 25 and mapes between 15 and 55 clm3 dmi knmi2 and mpi display rather low biases and mapes knmi2 shows a good representation of the seasonal and monthly scale rainfall while clm3 dmi and mpi are less reliable at these time scales knmi2 shows the lowest mape followed by the knmi1 and clm4 models clm3 and clm1 show good performance at yearly scale with a large detachment at monthly and seasonal scales the statistical errors and skill scores calculated for each model are summarized in table 2 the aim of this ranking process is not to assess the best performing model but to evaluate the weight of the different models and use them to build the ens the best three models that represent over 50 of the ens are knmi2 knmi1 and clm4 knmi2 and knmi1 are classified among the best performing models for precipitations also in peres et al 2020 and mascaro et al 2018 knmi2 shows the lowest mape 19 05 and the highest wilmott d score overall with a low bias 3 knmi1 has the best spatial correlation 0 61 and reproduces quite well the spatial distribution of the precipitation as further highlighted in fig 5 with a bias of 15 68 thus a tendence to overestimate precipitations clm4 has a low bias 5 39 but within the best performing models is the one with the lowest spatial correlation 0 39 and must be carefully considered when looking at spatial distribution of rainfall based on the rcm scores the weighted model ensemble was built and are shown in table 3 as the ens correspondent error measures ens has a bias of 12 and a relatively low mape that attains at 24 18 for seasonal resolution while at yearly and monthly scale the mape has a small respectively lower and higher variation around the seasonal value the fig 5a shows the yearly mean accumulated precipitation for each model and for the ens knmi1 knmi2 and clm4 reproduce rather well the spatial patterns that is also confirmed by fig 5b which shows the relative differences between the observed annual precipitation and the simulated by the rcms smhi5 underestimates precipitation in the east coast up to 80 90 of relative error and in the southern campidano area ranging from 60 to 70 of relative error smhi3 and smhi4 hugely overestimate values in the western stations with peaks of 100 of relative error mpi and dmi models do not reproduce the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation particularly the mpi model overestimates rainfall in most of the stations reaching relative errors 100 and underestimates it in all the eastern coast with 50 error the seasonal precipitation fig 6 highlights the complexity of the orography and its influence on the spatial distribution of the rainfall the seasonal precipitation ranges from values always above 200 mm in the gennargentu mountains to values below 100 mm in the southern area around the city of cagliari which is the driest zone even in winter despite a general overestimation of the precipitation the weighted multi model ensemble ens reproduces the spatial patterns of the seasonal cumulates fig 6 efficiently except in summer jja were there is a notable spatial and quantitative disagreement precipitation in south west area is overestimated in all the seasons while there is a good reproduction of the patterns in the south campidano region which is as mentioned above one of the driest areas generally precipitations in the mountain ranges all over the island are overestimated by ens by around 40 50 on average at yearly scale with peaks of 100 in the south west region suggesting that euro cordex rcms still does not capture the local conditions in mountainous areas sufficiently well this is in agreement with the results of mascaro et al 2018 which highlight a good reproduction of orographic effect but a high overestimation of its amplitude overestimation of precipitations over mountainous regions are also reported in other parts of the mediterranean by colmet daage et al 2018 which studied three basins in the gulf of lion despite the euro cordex models used in this study still show limited ability to reproduce precipitation properties no bias correction was applied to avoid overfitting of the results that could add more uncertainties to the model chain as reported by maraun 2016 any modifications of spatial temporal or multi variable aspects of the downscaled rcms may strongly break the consistency with the driving gcm model and affect other aspects than the desired ones moreover the quality of the available observations was not evaluated the analysis of the following projections is more focused on the relative changes between past and future scenarios rather than on the absolute values of the projected variables 3 3 precipitation future projections the precipitation projections are analyzed following the future rcp8 5 emissions scenario the relative changes for precipitation in the period 2071 2100 when compared with the historical period 1976 2005 of ens fig 7 show a general rainfall decrease at the yearly scale which is rather significant in the south west area 20 to 25 with a negative gradient from north east to south west the projected seasonal relative changes highlight different patterns djf is characterized by a general decrease of precipitation larger in the east and south west regions of sardinia amounting to values between 15 and 25 in mam a more considerable change is displayed especially in the south of the island with a reduction of precipitation ranging from 25 to 30 in jja a positive steep gradient has a south east to north west orientation going from positive small changes above 5 to a larger decrease up to 35 in the north west area another gradient of relative change is predicted for son from north east to south west with positive changes up to 5 in the north east down to 25 in the south west cape the ens reveals a striking future relative change in the number of wet days daily precipitation above 1 mm fig 8 that reaches values around 25 the decrease in percentage of wet days projected by the ens all over the island fig 8 has a north east to south west gradient with larger decreases in the campidano area south west in the gennargentu mountains center east and in the ottana plain center west these changes agree with others climate change analysis that were performed in the mediterranean region for the same future period in dubrovsky et al 2013 projected changes reach 30 of precipitations in zittis et al 2019 a reduction between 30 and 40 is expected using the same rcp8 5 emissions scenario 3 4 changes in extremes the projected relative change in wet days above 10 mm of precipitations fig 9 left shows a different pattern but adds to a wide distributed rainfall decrease with the south west area that still shows a decrease that could amount up to 25 subsequently dry periods might be longer in the future in agreement with previous similar investigations sillmann et al 2013 zollo et al 2016 ducić et al 2012 conducted in the mediterranean region although an increase of precipitations above 20 mm in some regions is projected such as in campidano and sassari provinces this points to the increase of intense rainfall events in those areas rainfall events above 20 mm fig 9 right are also expected to decrease large extensions of the other regions with higher negative values in the mountainous areas of gennargentu and in the south west range confirming an overall decrease of precipitations the future projections for the relative changes of high rank precipitation percentiles 95th and 99 9th percentiles are depicted in fig 10 showing an overall increase of both percentiles which have similar spatial patterns the higher percentages of change are projected for the east side with maxima increases above 30 in mountainous areas and southern island capes for the 99th percentile extremes in the southern and eastern areas are in some way in agreement with the zones historically impacted by extreme rainfalls bodini and cossu 2010 due to the presence of high and steep mountains near the coast which are exposed to hot and moist currents coming from africa the projected changes in number of wet days and high rank precipitation percentiles suggest that while mean precipitations seem to decrease significantly more intense precipitations distributed in few events are expected in literature many studies described this trend over mediterranean for the future even with different approaches giorgi et al 2019 zittis et al 2019 martel et al 2020 colmet daage et al 2018 alpert et al 2002 paxian et al 2015 3 5 hydrological swat simulations and the impact of climate change in two basins the swat model was calibrated and validated against daily streamflow observations 1985 1994 measured at the rmf station split in two independent series 1985 1992 for calibration and 1992 1994 for validation using the sufi 2 procedure abbaspour et al 2004 in sufi 2 the goodness of the model is evaluated accounting and measuring uncertainty while the fitting of the modeled and observed discharge is measured with nash sutcliffe index that is calculated as follows 11 ns 1 i q m q s 2 i q m i q m 2 where q is a variable e g discharge and m and s stand for measured and simulated respectively and the bar stands for average a perfect model would have a ns index of 1 while a ns below 0 corresponds to an unreliable model suggested values of ns are 0 5 daily calibration fig 11 a scored a ns index of 0 66 and 0 60 for the validation period the validation at monthly scale fig 11b was also performed for the period 1985 1992 obtaining a ns of 0 88 the model seems to better reproduce the monthly mean streamflow in agreement with the chosen scale for long term future simulations the swat model was firstly forced with euro cordex historical simulations 1976 2005 in order to compare the model s output with the observed streamflow future swat simulations were run from 2071 to 2100 according with the climate change analysis all the hydrological simulations were preceded by two years of warm up both for historical 1976 1978 and future period 2071 2073 swat model s weather generator needs continuous daily rainfall time series with standard gregorian calendar due to the use of 360 calendar days in the mohc hadgem2 es gcm simulations 3 rcms forced by this gcm have been excluded from the hydrological simulations based in the weights assigned to the climate models to build the ens the different swat model s outputs have been weighted normalizing the weights to 100 see table 2 in supplementary material in the following analysis for practical reasons each swat output resulting from a different forcing model will be mentioned as swat name of the model e g sw clm1 sw mpi while swat weighted output based on multi model ensemble weights will be named sw ens a first comparison of the rmf outflows fig 12 was analyzed for the period of observation 1985 1992 in order to compare the annual cycle of the different swat models against the observed streamflow at the measurement gauge swat models outputs show huge biases in some cases sw smhi4 sw smhi3 sw smhi1 and sw dmi while sw mpi shows the best agreement followed by sw clm1 sw clm3 sw clm4 and sw knm1 as the knm1 model has the highest weight in the ens 15 8 normalized to 28 8 the sw ens outflow has a similar monthly cycle as the sw knmi1 outflow with an overestimation of the discharge that in winter can reach large values above 200 the nash sutcliffe ns index was also calculated for the different swat rcms combinations table 3 the ns score of the best performing sw rcms sw clm1 sw clm3 and sw clm4 is around 0 meaning that models are performing only as well as the mean target value used for prediction according to existing literature abbaspour et al 2004 moussa 2010 a disagreement between best performing rcms for precipitations and the best performing sw rcms combinations for example the less performing rcm used within the ensemble mpi normalized weight 1 75 is one of the best performing rcms when coupled with swat sw mpi ns 0 3 the ns score of the sw ens model is 0 28 indicating a limited reliability for future hydrological projections due to the high number of uncertainty sources fig 13 a shows the comparison between historical 1976 2005 and future 2071 2100 model s monthly mean outflow at the control point of rmf for the sw ens model a general decrease of the monthly mean discharge is expected according with the future projections attaining to an average of around 25 the main loss is projected for spring months in particular for may in which the flow is reduced of around 40 1 02 m3 s for reference period against 0 62 m3 s in the future the comparison between historical sw ens hist and future sw ens fut periods from the analysis of rsg catchment fig 13b shows that outflow decreases of around 18 on average in the future run in particular from january to may ranging from 0 10 m3 s to 0 13 m3 s loss a future scenario sw ens fut nops that simulates the outflow after removing the two point sources from the catchment is also shown fig 13b the contribution the point sources is around 0 05 m3 s and in very dry periods it represents the only inflow in rsg analyzing the models which within the ens streamflow signal scored the best ns index sw mpi sw clm1 sw clm3 sw clm4 and sw knm1 is notable that all the models predict a significant decrease for winter and spring seasons fig 14 except sw clm1 that predicts a sensible increase for january and february as also found in perra et al 2018 summer and autumn are expected to be dryer except for sw mpi that projects an increase of the precipitation for october probably related to extreme events nevertheless it should be taken in account that mpi climate model was the less performing model within the ens while it showed a very good agreement in resulting outflow when coupled with swat model hence this model has to be carefully considered for future projections its tendence to overestimating the precipitation in the south west of the island should be taken into account as highlighted in fig 5 similar values of mean streamflow decrease were also obtained in di sante et al 2021 were a sensibly higher reduction between 25 and 30 is projected in the mediterranean region where euro cordex rcp8 5 scenarios were used as climate forcing for the hydrological simulations referred to the same future period runoff was calculated by swat over the rmf basin fig 15 a and rsg basin fig 15b as mm of water generated in each subbasin averaged on a monthly basis runoff in the rmf basin decreases on average of around 12 in the future projections particularly from april to october with the highest absolute loss of 42 mm in may 39 and the highest percent loss of 64 in june 32 mm a significant rise of 38 mm 29 is predicted for february and 30 mm 20 for march the increase of the mean runoff in february march together with a decrease of the mean outflow could be related to the extreme precipitation events analyzed at daily resolution in previous section 3 4 changes in extremes that cause a very rapid response of the basin that cannot be highlighted at monthly timestep in rsg basin projections of runoff budget highlight a mean decrease of 18 with the highest absolute loss of 137 mm 50 in may and the highest percentage loss of 56 in june 39 mm against the historical mean of 88 mm despite the small spatial difference between the two basins the increase of runoff that is predicted for rmf basin is not so pronounced in rsg basin where only a rise of 31 mm 10 is noticeable in february these projections agree with similar studies with slightly differences in percentages of loss in perra et al 2018 for instance an averaged loss of 30 in runoff is predicted while in koutroulis et al 2018 mean runoff projected decrease variates between 20 and 30 4 conclusions in this study a weighted multi model ensemble composed of different climate models of the euro cordex experiment rcp 8 5 emissions severe scenario was built and used as climate forcing for the swat hydrological model first a climate model analysis was performed through the comparison between modeled and observed rainfall for a historical reference period 1979 2008 using several statistical indexes bias mape normalized standard deviation wilmott d score spatial correlation s score and yule kendall index this analysis allowed to build a weighted multi model ensemble ens through models ranking based on their performances against observed rainfall the analysis of historical simulations revealed that the ability of rcm models to reproduce local precipitation such as the precipitation at small scales in regions with uneven orography is still somewhat limited as reported also by mascaro et al 2018 as found in the mentioned study focused on the same domain and also in studies focused on other mediterranean regions colmet daage et al 2018 in mountainous zones precipitations are overestimated the best models within the ens are knmi2 and knmi1 in accordance with peres et al 2020 and mascaro et al 2018 followed by clm4 and clm1 a first advancement of this study consisted in the evaluation of future euro cordex scenarios in the mediterranean island of sardinia future climate change signals of the ens project a general decrease of mean precipitation up to 20 to 25 in particular in the south west area while in summer and autumn a small increase of precipitation 5 10 is projected for the east and south east regions the analysis of the number of days with precipitations above 10 and 20 mm confirm the diminution trend for the future precipitations with a subsequent prolongation of dry periods except for some areas in the west side where events above 20 mm are projected to slightly rise the extreme precipitation events exceeding the 90th and 95th percentiles show a widespread increase more pronounced in the east side and in the southern capes with rises of 30 this analysis suggests that while precipitations are projected to decrease in their mean values and in number of wet days more extreme events are expected as highlighted by the projections of high rank precipitations meaning more intense precipitations in less events the swat model was implemented in a sub domain of the sardinian island specifically in two catchments located in the south west region firstly swat was run using observed rainfall thus it was calibrated and validated against observed streamflow subsequently swat was forced by the euro cordex models for the analysis of future outflow and runoff a general disagreement between the performances of rcms and swat rcms couples was noticed the best performing rcm in terms of precipitations when coupled with swat do not properly simulate the observed outflow moreover some of the rcms such as sw mpi and sw clm3 despite their inefficiency in reproducing precipitation show the best ns indexes when coupled with swat for outflow simulation this also reflects the uncertainties related to low quality observations used for swat model implementation calibration and the still limited euro cordex capabilities when implemented in lands with complex orography such as sardinia future projections predict a general decrease of 20 of mean outflow in both rmf and rsg catchments the surface runoff which is the main contribution to the natural flow of the studied streams is predicted to decrease up to 60 in spring months according to the future projections in rmf a rise in runoff in february and march and december is predicted while a diminution is projected for the rest of the year 12 on average in rsg basin runoff mean decrease is 31 with a small increase for february this could drastically affect the rsg streamflow when in the future wastewaters will be addressed to a different basin but on the other hand it could have benefits on the weathering of the several mine dumps in the area findings from current study stress that future climate in the western mediterranean might be characterized by less precipitation which is more clustered into extreme events confirming that the mediterranean area is a hotspot of the climate change as mentioned in previous studies e g giorgi 2006 lionello and scarascia 2018 diffenbaugh et al 2007 this could imply severe consequences such as the reduction of water resources and the rise of the flood risk and should be considered to better plan water resources management and hazard mitigation in fact results show that the extreme rainfall events are projected to increase hence modeling floods is necessary to quantify and prevent such risk despite the uncertainties that propagate through the model chain these results have importance in terms of relative changes between past and future scenarios thus might not be considered in terms of absolute values of the assessed variables the described combination between euro cordex and swat can be applied in different conditions different regions with different climate different hydrologic regimes and for different kind of evaluations e g impact of land use changes impact of climate change on reservoirs enhancing the use of these tools can significantly improve their reliability by underling existing limitations and capabilities particularly in areas characterized by data scarcity moreover the study of such tools gains more importance in arid and semi arid zones like the mediterranean in which many water scarcity problems exist lionello and scarascia 2020 requiring immediate actions and policies however the reliability of these projections is still limited and more accurate projections can be performed reducing the incoming uncertainties in the hydro climate model chain furthermore also the different domains of the climate model analysis that was carried out for the whole island and the swat model simulations limited to 2 small catchments must be considered when evaluating the performances extending the analysis of hydro climate simulations to a wider area thus considering more catchments could improve future investigations the described model chain could hence become a very powerful tool for water and basin management decision making credit authorship contribution statement pier andrea

4079,salinity and sodicity posing large risks to soil hydroecological functioning and agricultural production however a comprehensive investigating of the long term salinity and sodicity dynamics and how these contribute to soil degradation risk and plant response in intensive irrigated agro ecosystems is still scarce especially in cold arid agricultural regions to quantify long term soil degradation risk and plant response as driven by rainfall irrigation and groundwater in seasonally frozen arid regions taking into account the influence of capillary flux from shallow brackish groundwater and annual soil freezing thawing cycles and snowmelt infiltration to soil moisture s salinity cs and sodicity ex we coupled the salt of the earth sote model and the wavelet neural network wnn model i e sote wnn model as well as improved the crop response to the soil environment answer model the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex and therefore soil degradation risks and plant responses in irrigated agro ecosystems in three different hydrological regions i e adfo alluvial diluvial fan oasis apou alluvial plain oasis in the upper part and apol alluvial plain oasis in the lower part in the sangong river watershed srw of northwestern china were investigated the sote wnn model was calibrated and validated using field comprehensive observations during april 2018 april 2021 the simulated results of root zone s cs and ex resulted in a good agreement with the observed values in the srw results showed that the s in the three hydrological regions has a similar periodic steady state with sawtooth pattern the cs is the largest in the apol and corresponding the crop relative yield is the lowest in the apou the ex is the largest and corresponding the soil degradation risk is the highest carried out sensitivity analysis revealed that the increase in rainfall and snowfall can clearly alleviate soil degradation by reducing soil alkalization in the root zone the irrigation water quality is one of the primary controls on long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex and imposing adverse impact on soil hydraulic conductivity and agricultural crop productivity the shallow groundwater table and quality have non monotonic effects on the root zone s cs and ex dynamics the 2 3 m is the critical water table interval that limits soil salinization and alkalization hazards in the srw the results highlight that the trade offs between irrigation water quality and water table need to be emphasized at appropriate spatial and temporal scales when promoting intensive irrigation practices in arid cold climate regions keywords soil salinity soil sodicity sote wnn model soil degradation risk plant response sustainable land management 1 introduction saline and sodic soils amount to approximately 11 737 mkm2 worldwide and mostly lie across arid and semiarid climates hassani et al 2020 of these approximately 23 of all cultivated lands are considered saline and 37 sodic zaman et al 2018 salinity stress affects the vegetation growth directly by reducing the plant water uptake osmotic stress and by the accumulation of specific ions in plants toxic effect maas and hoffman 1977 perri et al 2018 sodicity adversely influences the physical properties of the soil resulting in surface crusting limiting the movement of air and water within the soil and indirectly affecting plant yields agassi et al 1981 van der zee et al 2014 soil salinity and sodicity have therefore been considered as major factors threatening the productivity of crops and main reasons of the abandonment of lands for agricultural purposes rahav et al 2017 minhas et al 2020 recent mounting global studies highlight the projected expansion and intensification of irrigated agriculture could invariably increase the risk of soil salinization and alkalization due to the increasing reliance on marginal quality water and lands to relieve some of the expected pressure on water resources and food supplies ben gal et al 2008 assouline et al 2015 rahav et al 2017 kramer and mau 2020 additionally the climate change land use cover changes erroneous irrigation practices and groundwater over pumping are expected to further exacerbate this risk in the future especially in arid and semiarid regions van der zee et al 2014 perri et al 2018 therefore a comprehensive investigating regarding the dynamics of soil moisture salinity and sodicity is crucial to maximize the use of marginal water and lands while simultaneously creating sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation the primary challenges to the sustainability of irrigated agro ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions are the direct hazards of salinization and alkalization and the unintended consequences of soil hydroecological functioning assouline et al 2015 porporato et al 2015 an accessible model that can simulate the complex interactions between water salinity and sodicity taking place in the soil for variable climates soils groundwater regimes and management options is a necessary tool for addressing the challenges which would enable hypothesis and scenario testing to provide reliable predictions of outcomes gonçalves et al 2006 shani et al 2007 van der zee et al 2014 during the past several decades a large number of analytical and numerical models have been developed to simulate the transfer processes and the long term variations of water and solute within the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum e g hydrus gonçalves et al 2006 minhas et al 2020 and to investigate how multiple environmental variables and their combined affect soil degradation risks and plant responses e g answer shani et al 2007 perri et al 2018 these models have greatly improved the ability to sustainably manage irrigated agro ecosystems particularly kramer and mau 2020 introduced the sote model in the mediterranean climate zones which not only overcomes the shortcomings e g suitable for short term and local simulations require precise soil characterization and are computationally demanding of existing models to simulate the long term salinity and sodicity dynamics but also allowing planners to assess the long term soil degradation risks related to salinization and alkalization further this model taking into account the feedback of salinity and sodicity on the saturated hydraulic conductivity and is suitable for large ensemble simulations of stochastic climatic conditions nevertheless the effectiveness of the sote model is limited in arid seasonally cold regions due to the influence of annual soil freezing and thawing cycles and snowmelt infiltration iwata et al 2010 qin et al 2021 and therefore it needs to be further improved furthermore a synthetically compare the effects of different parameter scenarios related to salinity and sodicity on soil degradation risk and plant response from the sote simulations is still inadequate particularly in different hydrological regions over the long term soil salinity and sodicity levels and their induced soil degradation risks and vegetation responses are substantially affected by governing environmental conditions and anthropogenic activities shani et al 2007 porporato et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 hassani et al 2020 rainfall patterns e g seasonal rainfall significantly control the occurrence of leaching and the balance of root zone salinity and sodicity gonçalves et al 2006 van der zee et al 2014 moreover soil freezing thawing processes and snow cover have clear influence on soil water and solute migrations in cold and arid regions iwata et al 2010 qin et al 2021 irrigation practices e g irrigation scheme schedule and water quality play an important role in the salinity buildup and the degradation of soil hydroecological functioning induced by increasing sodicity scanlon et al 2010 assouline et al 2015 further capillary flux from shallow brackish groundwater could cause root zone salinization and alkalization in arid semiarid areas akter et al 2021 van de craats et al 2020 also soil properties and vegetation types are important aspects of salt accumulation and long term root zone sodicity and thereby controlling soil degradation and plant response perri et al 2018 kramer and mau 2020 the sangong river watershed srw is an arid inland river watershed in northwestern china having low precipitation high evapotranspiration and long snow cover duration and characterized by typical oasis desert landscapes with four different hydrological regions i e adfo apou apol and desert zhou et al 2012 wang et al 2018b regionally the watershed has a long history of irrigated agricultural practices the irrigated area covers 95 of cultivated land in 2012 and water saving irrigation area accounted for more than 85 of the total irrigation area with mulched drip irrigation being the most extensive yin et al 2021a further the agricultural water use accounting for more than 90 of total water use which relies greatly on groundwater pumping yin et al 2021b similar to other arid inland regions e g central asia shortages in water resources and eco environmental issues e g soil salinization and alkalization groundwater deterioration and vegetation degradation are becoming increasingly prominent due to anthropogenic overdevelopment and environmental changes zhang et al 2017 yin et al 2021a the srw therefore provides an excellent case region for investigating the long term soil degradation risks and plant responses related to salinization and alkalization in intensive irrigated agro ecosystems in arid cold regions in this study two representative cropland sampling transects in the defined hydrological regions in the srw were selected soil related water salinity and sodicity groundwater and plant indicators were comprehensively measured during 2018 2021 the main objectives were to 1 establish the sote wnn model by coupling the refined sote model and the wnn model for investigating the long term dynamics of root zone moisture salinity and sodicity in seasonally frozen arid regions 2 quantify the long term dynamics of root zone soil salinization and alkalization and how these contribute to the risk of soil degradation and plant response in different hydrological regions and 3 evaluate the long term soil degradation risks and plant responses resulting from changes in precipitation rainfall and snowfall regimes irrigation practices and groundwater dynamics in the srw capitalizing on these study objectives we will provide management directives for achieving sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation under future environmental changes in other similar endorheic watersheds of china and elsewhere in the world 2 materials

of northwestern china fig 1 a the watershed has been described in detail in yin et al 2021a the study area has a continental arid climate with a dry hot summer and a cold winter mean annual precipitation is 200 mm mean annual air temperature is 7 30 and mean annual pan evaporation 20 cm in diameter is 1533 2240 mm snow usually covers the land to a depth of 20 cm for about 100 160 d starting in late november and ending in late march of the next year zhou et al 2012 and snowfall is 45 mm in this study period the maximum depth of frost for cropland is approximately 100 cm predominant soils are grey desert soil and saline alkali soil in the study area specifically in both the adfo and apou silt dominated the soil 56 33 81 43 and clay content varied between 5 20 and 17 71 in the apol the content of clay and sand increased evidently and clay layer appeared zhao 2002 in addition the cations in soil are dominated by na and ca2 in the srw and the na ca2 accounts for 72

in the past 60 years zhang et al 2017 in particular the agricultural land increased by 74 55 whereas the saline desert decreased by approximately 494 42 km2 within the agricultural regions the dominant cash crop is cotton and other crops include wheat grapes and melons wang et al 2018b grows mainly by groundwater fed irrigation natural vegetation mainly includes a variety of xeromorphic species shows a dynamic and facultative reliance on groundwater according to rainfall variability xu and li 2006 the groundwater table depth gtd and total dissolved solids tds had changed substantially across the whole watershed from 2004 to 2018 the mean gtd tds in the srw ranged from 1 81 0 2 to 86 56 m 26 7 g l 1 in september 2020 and correspondingly in the adfo apou apol and desert

the over exploitation associated with intensive irrigated agriculture development in the srw wang et al 2018b yin et al 2021a yin et al 2021b 2 2 field experiments and index measurements to calibrate and validate the sote wnn model two representative soil sampling transects fig 1a i e 1 transect and 2 transect in the north south direction across the defined hydrological regions within the oasis area in the srw were established field experiments were conducted during the april october 2018 cgp crop growth period and the november 2020 april 2021 non cgp non crop growth period respectively the 1 transect consists of 8 transverse sections with 3 sampling points on each section a total of 24 sampling points these sections are numbered o1 o7 and o8 from south to north fig 1a the 2 transect consists of 8 sampling points and 5 different snow treatments applied to each point with three replicates per treatment fig 1b that is plot s1 0 snow transfer all of each snowfall to plot s5 plot s2

plot s1 each plot is a 1 m 1 m square and all on the same horizontal plane and the distance between adjacent square is 1 5 m to prevent lateral leakage of snowmelt fig 1b the sampling points of 2 transect are numbered p1 p7 and p8 from south to north fig 1a after each snowfall the snow depth measurement and the snow transfer between plots were completed timely each sampling point for both transects is located in the cropland and the irrigation method of each point is water saving irrigation by the groundwater fed according to the handheld gps receiver and remote sensing data transverse sections o1 o2 sampling points p1 p2 o3 o5 p3 p5 and o6 o8 p6 p8 are located in adfo apou and apol respectively the distance between transverse sections sampling points is 1 70 5 60 km in the 1 transect 2 transect and the distance between sampling points is 0 95 3 40 km on each section in the 1 transect along the 1 transect soil samples were collected using a 5 cm in diameter hand auger at depths of 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 140 140 180 and 180 220 cm at each soil sampling point with three replicate at the beginning of each month from april to september 2018 and correspondingly in each plot on november 2 2020 and april 1 2021 for the 2 transect note that no precipitation and irrigation events occurred during sampling periods the basic climate soil vegetation and groundwater regimes of each transect were shown in table 1 most of the physical chemical measurement methods used in this study are described in detail in previous studies yin et al 2021a yin et al 2021b the gravimetric soil water content swc was measured using the oven dry method 24 h at 105 c in the laboratory and the gravimetric swc w g g 1 was converted into volumetric swc θ cm3 cm 3 by multiplying it with soil bulk density the soil electrical conductivity sec was measured in the paste extracts with soil water ratio of 1 5 by a conductivity meter fe 30 mettler toledo switzerland exchangeable cations and cation exchange capacity cec were determined using standard methods of rayment and lyons 2011 the sodium adsorption ratio sar and the exchangeable sodium percentage esp were calculated after measurement of soluble and exchangeable cations of the original soil samples gonçalves et al 2006 the sar and esp of water including soil solutions can be written as mau and porporato

concentration c from ds m 1 to mmolc l 1 by using c mmolc l 1 10 ec ds m 1 mau and porporato 2015 the soil particle size distribution and soil bulk density were determined by the hydrometer method and gravimetric method respectively smith and mullins 2000 the gtd of 41 monitoring wells in the srw was measured three times a month using a portable groundwater level gauge model 101 solinst canada ltd ontario canada by the local government and the chinese academy of sciences cas the irrigation and groundwater water samples were collected in cleaned 100 ml polyethylene bottles tightly capped and refrigerated at 4 c in the laboratory analysis methods of quality of water samples followed is essentially the same as given by the sl78 94 1994 and han et al 2011 the amount of water applied in each irrigation event was measured with a flow meter the daily precipitation and other hydrometeorological data were obtained through a comprehensive weather station established at the fukang station of desert ecology cas fig 1a 2 3 background theory and model development the point of departure is the salt of the earth sote model which taking into account the feedback of salinity and sodicity on the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity to study the long term dynamics of soil water salinity and sodicity developed by kramer and mau 2020 this model including three state variables relative soil moisture s dimensionless i e the fraction of the soil s pore volume containing water i e θ n soil salinity cs mmolc l 1 i e the electrolyte concentration of salts in the soil water and soil sodicity ex dimensionless i e the concentration of sodium ions in soil and soil water i e esp as a tool for smarter decision making the sote model can be used to investigate the risk of long term soil degradation driven by environmental factors in mediterranean climate regions kramer and mau 2020 whereas we noticed that the sote model validation and application from kramer and mau 2020 does not include capillary flux from shallow groundwater and assumes free drainage more importantly although the sote model has good applicability in the mediterranean climate zones its effectiveness is not yet validated in the seasonally frozen arid regions due to the existence of annual soil freezing thawing cycles and snowmelt infiltration yi et al 2014 wu et al 2020 for these reason we considered the contributions of shallow groundwater in the sote model using the modelling technique presented by vervoort and van der zee 2008 simultaneously we proposed a bidirectionally coupled model by combining the refined sote model for the cgp and the wavelet neural network wnn zhang and benveniste 1992 for the non cgp that is sote wnn model to simulate the coupled dynamics of s cs and ex in arid seasonally cold regions specifically when running the sote wnn model we first take the end value simulated by the refined sote model as the initial value of the wnn model and then use the end value simulated by the wnn model as the initial value of the refined sote model and continue this coupled simulation and finally obtain the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex further the methods for assessing the soil degradation risk and plant response induced by salinity and sodicity are also introduced shani et al 2007 kramer and mau 2020 fig 2 presents the a schematic diagram and b basic structure of the sote wnn model 2 3 1 description of the refined sote model for the cgp following kramer and mau 2020 under their basic assumptions we further assume that the groundwater table and quality are constant which means that the temporal variability in the groundwater table and quality occur on a much larger time scale than climate drivers shah et al 2011 meanwhile we consider the soil solution and exchange complex to be in equilibrium due to this study focus on long term processes and we only focus on two cations i e na and ca2 we omit henceforth the charges in the notation mau and porporato 2015 due to the soil can be described as a spatially uniform reservoir characterized by vertically averaged soil porosity n and rooting zone depth zr rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 therefore the balance equations over the long term for the relative soil moisture s i e s θ n the total salt content per square meter qs i e q s c s n z r s and the total sodium mass qna i e esp can

content vico and porporato 2010 the q is generated through saturation excess and can be considered negligible mau and porporato 2015 for simplicity we do not consider the role of plant salt uptake in the simulations the et is modeled following laio et al 2001 the l is functionally dependent on the s and the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity by the effect of salinity and sodicity k s s c s e x when s is higher than the soil s field capacity sfc the power law can be used to model the leakage i e l s c s e x k s s c s e x s c where c is a soil specific constant laio et al 2001 moreover based on the disaggregation model introduced by ezlit et al 2013 the k s s c s e x can be simulated mcneal 1968 van der zee et al 2014 kramer and mau 2020 further we can get the differential equation of ex by substituting the sum of the sodium in the soil solution q s na into eq 5 and using the gapon equation mau and porporato 2015 in addition following vervoort and van der zee 2008 and the equation of leakage l from kramer and mau 2020 we can estimate the capillary upflow u and the specific formula see supporting information particularly a detailed description of formula derivation parameters meaning value range and unit for this sote model can be found in kramer and mau 2020 2 3 2 development of the wnn model for the non cgp neural networks are extensively developed techniques for nonlinear data driven models especially when physical processes are complex models have many uncertainties and there is extensive training data fausett 1994 seidou et al 2006 the wnn model proposed by zhang and benveniste 1992 not only maintains the advantage of good localization of wavelet transform nature but also overcomes the defect of insufficient accuracy of prediction of neural network in this study we adopted a three layer configuration i e an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer wnn model fig 1b to simulate the coupled dynamics i e stochastic and complex of root zone s cs and ex during the non cgp following alexandridis and zapranis 2013 given the input sample data vi i 1 2 k the hidden layer output layer and corrected weights can be expressed as 6 h j h j i 1 k w ij v i b j k a j k j 1 2 l 7 y k i 1 l w j k h j k 1 2 m 8 w j k i 1 w j k i η e p w j k i a j k i 1 a j k i η e p a j k i b j k i 1 b j k i η e p b j k i where h j is the output value of the j node in the hidden layer hj is the wavelet activation function wij is the linked weights between the input and hidden layers bj k is the shift factor of the hj aj k is the scaling factor of the hj and l is the number of nodes in the hidden layer y k is the output value of the k node in the input layer wj k is the weight between the hidden layer j and the output layer k and m is the number of nodes of the output layer the prediction error e p k 1 m y j k y k with y j k is the expected output value and η is the learning rate furthermore we selected the morlet mother wavelet f v cos 1 75 v e v 2 2 as the activation wavelet function and trained the wnn model using the standard gradient methods zhang and benveniste 1992 once these weights biases and other parameters are estimated the wnn can be used to predict unknown outputs from new datasets in addition the lower bound of the cost function and of the variations of the gradient were set to 10 5 specific variables for the input and output layers in this study are described in section 2 4 a detailed practical guide for the wnn can be found in alexandridis and zapranis 2013 2 3 3 assessment of soil degradation and plant response the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is commonly used to evaluate the degree of degradation of soil structure stability caused by sodicity and salinity ezlit et al 2013 in order to assess the specific risk of soil degradation in this study following kramer and mau 2020 by investigating the distribution of relative ks rks i e k sat k s s c s e x we refer to the probability of the rks being less than the kct i e critical threshold in rks as the critical soil degradation risk csdr which can be obtained by the following equation 9 csdr 0 1 k ct ρ r k s d r k s 0 r k s 1 where ρ rks is the probability density function for rks in general the greater the csdr the higher the risk of soil degradation and the more severe the soil flow limit for the kct we defined a 20 reduction in rks as a critical threshold according to kramer and mau 2020 further to characterize the impact of soil degradation on plant response in this study by substituting the values of water and salt fluxes and saturated hydraulic conductivity simulated by the sote wnn model into the improved answer model shani et al 2007 we quantified crop yield losses in the context of soil environmental degradation following ben gal et al 2003 and shani et al 2007 considering the capillary flux from shallow brackish groundwater the answer model can be modified as 10 y r min e t p ψ root ψ w i p u e t k s s c s e x 1 η i p u e

parameterization and testing of the sote wnn model involves two sub models i e refined sote model and wnn model two study stages i e cgp and non cgp two data sources i e 1 transect and 2 transect and three hydrological regions i e adfo apou and apol specifically the all data from 1 transect during the cgp were used as the validation data of the refined sote model whereas the data from 2 transect during the non cgp were divided into a training set 70 of the total and a testing set 30 of the total to optimize and evaluate the wnn model the rainfall parameters α and λ during the cgp were calculated from long term daily rainfall data the δ for cropland was assumed to be 0 05 cm day 1 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 the zr and n were obtained from the field measurements according to the main soil texture composition used in field experiments we estimated the values of parameters related to soil water loss i e et l and u based on the typical values included in laio et al 2001 zhao 2002 vervoort and van der zee 2008 and kramer and mau 2020 similarly based on the relative clay content of the soil in this study we used the parameter values reported by ezlit et al 2013 and mau and porporato 2015 to simulate the k s s c s e x following kramer and mau 2020 we assumed the irrigation is continuous during the cgp and applied at a rate proportional to the maximum evapotranspiration rate we also simulated the etmax using a sinusoidal curve over an annual period and the maximum value in the curve was made to coincide with the august the maximum etmax in the august was estimated using the priestly taylor equation dralle and thompson 2016 in addition since the clay content of the root zone in the adfo apou and apol are 15 37 0 83 12 61 0 67 and 16 66 0 54 respectively we used the soil class ii parameter values reported in laio et al 2001 ezlit et al 2013 and kramer and mau 2020 table 2 and table 3 summarize the detailed values of the sote wnn model and answer model parameters in the study area to more accurately simulate the dynamics of soil water and solute during the non cgp under the influence of the soil freezing thawing cycles and snowmelt infiltration we chose soil bulk density of the root zone 0 100 cm x1 average groundwater table x2 average groundwater salinity x3 average groundwater alkalinity x4 total snowfall x5 cold initial i e the early november s cs and ex of the root zone x6 x8 cold initial s cs and ex of the non root zone 100 220 cm x9 x11 and monthly mean soil temperature of root zone from november to april x12 x17 monthly mean air temperature from november to april x18 x23 as the input variables of the wnn model and the cold end i e the early april of the next year s cs and ex of the root zone y1 y3 as the output variables to avoid overfitting of the wnn model the number of hidden neurons nh takes the value of 4 and determined using the empirical formula presented in the sheela and deepa 2013 according to kramer and mau 2020 to examine how changes in precipitation regimes affect the dynamics of s cs ex and soil degradation risk and plant response induced by salinization and alkalization in different hydrological regions in the srw we conducted simulations with four rainfall patterns rainfall 87 3 178 3 360 2 and 542 1 mm with α 4 25 mm and with four depths of snowfall snowfall 22 5 45 67 5 and 90 mm moreover to examine how irrigation with low quality water affect the dynamics of s cs ex and therefore soil degradation risk and plant response in the srw we conducted simulations with four irrigation water qualities i e currently applied water table 2 fresh water ci 12 mmolc l 1 ei 0 36 brackish water ci 35 mmolc l 1 ei 6 93 and saline water ci 55 mmolc l 1 ei 11 31 furthermore to demonstrate how shallow groundwater regimes affect the dynamics of root zone s cs ex and induced soil degradation risk and plant response in the srw we conducted simulations with four types of gtd i e type i z 1 m type ii z 2 m type iii z 3 m and type iv z 10 m here these simulations are based on the sote wnn model csdr and improved answer model by 100 runs for 5 years furthermore to reduce the uncertainties caused by the parameters and structure of the sote wnn model we repeated the training and simulation processes 100 times for calculating the average output values it is noteworthy that the first simulated year was ignored as a warm up period in this study statistical analyses were conducted for calculating the goodness of fit between observed and simulated root zone s cs and ex respectively in the different hydrological regions in the srw the cm consistency measure mae mean absolute error nse nash sutcliffe model efficiency rmse root mean square error mape mean absolute percentage error and r2 coefficient of determination were selected as indicators to investigate models fitting performance zhu 1999 xu et al 2013 modelling and charting were processed using python 3 8 5 https www

compared to sote wnn model simulations in different hydrological regions i e adfo apou and apol in the srw as shown in fig 3a1 c1 a2 c2 and a3 c3 the estimated s cs and ex probability density functions with calibrated model parameters table 2 captured the main soil moisture salinity and sodicity distribution characteristics e g peak height and position span width with average cm were 0 896 0 879 and 0 951 respectively table 4 and the steady state average root zone s cs and ex all showed apol apou adfo suggesting that the model tests well against the measured data under the cgp in the srw as illustrated in fig 3d1 d2 and d3 the simulated root zone s cs and ex showed good agreement with the measured values in different hydrological regions during the calibration and validation periods the average mae nse rmse mape and r2 during the calibration and validation stages were all within the limited range and the model producing an acceptable degree of error and a high modelling efficiency table 4 indicating that the verification of the model is satisfactory and the validity is trustworthy under the non cgp in the srw overall the general agreement between the simulated and measured in different hydrological regions suggests that the calibration of the sote wnn model is reasonable and the performance is generally good for simulating the root zone s cs and ex further this model can easily conduct thousands of simulations with stochastic rainfall thus making it a unique tool for researching the long term processes of s cs and ex and therefore soil degradation risk and plant response in the srw 3 2 modelling the long term dynamics in this section before investigating the long term dynamics 20 years of root zone s cs and ex based on the sote wnn model and how these contribute to the long term soil degradation risk and vegetation response we first analyzed in fig s1 the daily dynamics i e a continuous combination of cgp and non cgp example for the s cs ex and et etp i e yr using model parameters table 2 with 100 runs in different hydrological regions in the srw during the cgp the cs both the s and yr appeared to decline increase slowly first in the early growth period then remained relatively stable from may to september and then rise decrease sharply in the late growth period fig s1a1 a3 b1 b3 and d1 d3 however the ex displayed a continuous upward trend fig s1c1 c3 during the non cgp both the s and cs showed an increasing trend whereas both the ex and yr presented an decreasing trend due to the presence of snowmelt infiltration and soil freezing thawing cycles in the srw 3 2 1 the long term dynamics of soil moisture salinity and sodicity fig 4 a1 d3 presents the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex in the srw based on the sote wnn model using model parameters table 2 by 100 runs for 20 years only the initial and last values are displayed during the non cgp of each year and similarly hereinafter for successive cycles the initial s cs and ex for the sote wnn model are time dependent fig s2 as fig 4a1 c3 reveals the general dynamics of s cs and ex are composed of two features the first feature is the alternation between replenishment and consumption of soil moisture between accumulation and leaching of both the soil salinity and sodicity and resulting in the sawtooth wave pattern the second feature is the longer more than annual term trend where the s is at periodic steady state whereas both the cs and ex changes over a series of years and eventually reached a cyclically stable state by contrast the interannual dynamics of both the cs and ex varied in different hydrological regions fig 4a2 c2 and a3 c3 in particular the amplitude of the sawtooth waveform of cs is clearly higher than that of ex due to the changes in cs occurring on much faster time scales than the changes in ex furthermore there were significant differences for both the cs and ex in the time to reach the periodic steady state in the three hydrological regions indicating that the system parameters e g climate soil vegetation irrigation and groundwater control the dynamic equilibrium state of cs and ex in the srw 3 2 2 the long term soil degradation risk and plant response soil salinity and sodicity are serious environmental hazards with the potential to cause soil structural degradation and limit agricultural production kramer and mau 2020 based on the sote wnn model and assuming that the degradation is reversible we investigated the effect of soil salinity and sodicity on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in different hydrological regions in the srw as fig 4a4 c4 reveals the general dynamics of the relative ks rks also capture two features i e sawtooth wave patterns and periodic steady states and as the cs and ex increase a decline in rks can be observed in each hydrological regions by contrast the interannual dynamics and the time to reach the periodic steady state of the rks were distinctly different in the three hydrological regions with the 20 years average rks showed adfo 0 97 0 001 apol 0 94 0 001 apou 0 88 0 001 suggesting that the apou had the highest risk of soil degradation followed by the apol and then the adfo further fig 4a5 d5 shows that the average risk of critical soil degradation were 0 0 04 and 0 in the adfo apou and apol respectively indicating that soil degradation has begun to emerge in agricultural lands and is threatening agricultural production in the srw furthermore we also characterized the effect of long term s cs ex dynamics and rks on relative crop yield yr based on the improved answer model and related parameters table 3 in different hydrological regions in the srw as illustrated in fig 4a5 c5 as cs ex and soil degradation risk increase the yr showed a significant decline for apol and eventually reach a stable state with value of 0 909 whereas the decline was not evident in the adfo and apol indicating that in contrast to the soil sodicity the salinity in the root zone greatly controls the crop stress response and land productivity 3 3 sensitivity analysis in this section we assessed the impact of precipitation i e rainfall and snowfall patterns irrigation practices i e irrigation water quality and groundwater i e water table and water quality regimes on the dynamics of s cs and ex and therefore soil degradation risk and plant response i e yr in the srw for brevity we only show the ensemble average of 100 runs by the model and do not consider the possibility of irreversible degradation in the simulations 3 3 1 effect of precipitation regimes on s cs ex dynamics soil degradation and yr by the end of this century the precipitation characteristics will change potentially in china wu et al 2019 in particular the amount of snowfall will increase in northwestern china qin et al 2020 the results shown in fig 5 indicate that the difference in rainfall pattern caused clear changes in root zone s cs ex over time in the three hydrological regions as the increase of λ not surprisingly the s showed an increasing trend but the cs and ex displayed a decreasing trend of interest is that when the rainfall is 540 mm leaching of soil salts is increased evidently and cs reaches a lower level in the periodic steady state whereas ex hardly decline during the shorter simulation period moreover the increase in rainfall slightly alleviate the process of soil degradation fig s3 and improves yields especially in apol note that when α increases λ fixed similar results are presented not shown this suggests that as the climate becomes strongly drier both cs and ex increase and subsequently the risk of soil degradation increases and the production of sensitive plants decreases the results of fig 6 that present the change in snowfall pattern has a clear effect on the long term dynamics of root zone rks in the three hydrological regions specifically the increase in snowfall can evidently increase relative ks and alleviate soil degradation and slightly improves crop yields moreover as the snowfall increases ex displayed a visible downward trend whereas cs showed a slight decreasing trend fig s4 this may be due to the fact that the changes in thickness of snow cover deposition can cause a dramatic reduction of frost depth as well as variation of soil water dynamics at the same time the interplays of seasonal freezing thawing cycles snowmelt infiltration and soil evaporation significantly controls the redistribution of salt and alkali in the root zone additionally the groundwater table decline during freezing and rise during thawing may induce soil both salinization and alkalization in the root zone and thereby accelerating soil degradation 3 3 2 effect of irrigation practices on s cs ex dynamics soil degradation and yr in the face of growing water scarcity irrigation with marginal quality water and lands is common practice in arid and semi arid regions rahav et al 2017 however the long term use of marginal water poses risks to the environment at least in part to the degradation of soil hydroecological functioning assouline and narkis 2013 as shown in fig 7 the different irrigation water quality led to significant differences in root zone s cs and ex dynamics during the simulation period in the three hydrological regions not surprisingly as the irrigation water quality becomes strongly saline and sodic cs and ex increase dramatically remarkably with the deterioration of irrigation water quality soil moisture increases sharply a possible explanation for this result is that soil sodicity and salinity can contribute to the deterioration of soil physical properties e g surface crusting infiltration and aeration decline the uncoupling of root zone and groundwater and indirectly limit plant water absorption thus irrigation water will be stored in root zone with a lower leaching rate resulting in a notable increase in soil moisture and further aggravating soil salinization and alkalization furthermore as fig s5 reveals as the increase of saline and sodic in the irrigation water the rks exhibited a dramatic decline with sawtooth pattern in the three hydrological regions simulations revealed that the csdr in the soil irrigated with currently applied water fresh water brackish water and saline water is 0 0 0 52 and 0 58 for adfo respectively and is 0 0 0 69 and 0 69 for apou respectively and is 0 0 0 64 and 0 64 for apol respectively fig 7a4 c4 noticeably as the deterioration of irrigation water quality and the degradation of soil structure crop yields declined sharply and even no yield particularly for the saline water irrigation scenario fig 7a5 c5 these results emphasize the need to carefully consider how a particular irrigation water quality will affect the specific soil and crop in the srw 3 3 3 effect of groundwater dynamics on s cs ex dynamics soil degradation and yr in arid and semi arid regions the surface water transfer for irrigation will lead to the gtd rise and groundwater quality deteriorate han et al 2011 also the over pumping of groundwater for irrigation will result in the gtd decline and groundwater quality degradation yin et al 2021a as presented in fig 8 the salinity and sodicity of groundwater are converted from empirical formulas related to gtd in fig s6 with z increases the root zone s cs and ex all decrease sharply first i e gtd ranges from 1 m to 2 m and then remain relatively stable in the three hydrological regions notably when z 1 m the root zone s cs and ex all reach the highest and are significantly higher than in other gtd scenarios this may be attributed to shallow saline groundwater induced soil structural degradation and water logging situation further a critical gtd intervals may exist in the range of 2 to 3 m where the root zone cs and ex are clearly affected by capillary flux et leaching and dilution processes in addition the time series shows clear differences in rks dynamics between the 3 groundwater regimes and the rks is the smallest when z 1 m fig s7 fig 8 also reveals that the soil degradation risk increases as the groundwater becomes shallower specifically the risk of critical degradation in the gtd type i type ii type iii and type iv is 0 97 0 51 0 and 0 for adfo respectively and is 0 98 0 63 0 and 0 for apou respectively and is 0 95 0 56 0 and 0 for apol respectively the results indicate that within a certain gtd range the shallower gtd with the smaller rks lead to the higher risk of soil degradation i e the larger s cs and ex due to inefficient drainage leaching and dilution thereby triggering the crop yields drop sharply fig 8a5 c5 these results underscore the need to identify and maintain gtd threshold intervals in different hydrological regions to avoid further soil degradation and maintain sustainable development in the srw 3 4 sustainable management implications as noted above section these simulations highlight an important point for sustainable management practices in arid and semiarid regions namely that the development of modern water saving irrigation agriculture requires an optimal combination between irrigation water quality and groundwater table to minimize soil degradation risks and maximize crop yields to determine this best combination we ignore the effects of climate change and other factors e g osmotic stress and assuming that soil degradation is reversible based on sote wnn model by coupling the curve of critical soil degradation risk 0 kct 20 and the curve of critical relative crop yield yr 100 90 75 50 respectively over the long term 20 years under the interactions of groundwater dynamics i e gtd cu and eu and irrigation practices i e ci and ei a simplified conceptual model and threshold intervals of sustainable management for the intensive irrigated agro ecosystems were proposed fig 9 a within the srw take cotton as an example using the parameters as listed in tables 2 and 3 we obtained the threshold intervals of sustainable irrigation management in the adfo fig 9b apou fig 9c and apol fig 9d as shown under the current gtd scenario i e adfo 38 7 m apou 5 53 m apol 3 89 m the sustainable threshold intervals are 0 22 62 0 17 58 and 0 8 79 for ci with mmolc l 1 and are 0 1 56 0 1 49 and 0 1 30 for ei by esp in the adfo apou and apol respectively compared to the currently used irrigation water quality table 2 we noted that the ci of apol has exceeded the upper limit of the threshold interval indicating that optimizing irrigation water quality and adjusting gtd are urgently needed in the apol to avoid further soil degradation and crop losses in combination to achieve sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation in arid and semiarid regions the gtd should be maintained at a reasonable depth to weaken the capillary flux from shallow saline groundwater in agricultural lands by conversion from flood irrigation to microirrigation also from a water quality perspective it would be advisable to either switch between or combine brackish water e g marginal groundwater with fresh water e g channel water to reduce the salt and alkali input to the soil via irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 model effectiveness and error analysis in current study the sote wnn model integrates four major processes related to the dynamics of root zone s cs and ex in the srw first the interplay between cations in the soil complex and the solution and their nonlinear dynamics mau and porporato 2015 second the feedback of soil salinity and sodicity on the saturated hydraulic conductivity van der zee et al 2013 third the contribution of capillary flux from shallow brackish groundwater to root zone salt accumulation and soil alkalization shah et al 2011 fourth the influence of annual soil freezing and thawing cycles and snowmelt infiltration on soil salinity and sodicity dynamics qin et al 2021 as indicated in fig 3 and table 4 the sote wnn model successfully described field measurements of root zone s cs and ex in the srw during the study period suggesting that these four processes can largely characterize the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex in the study area furthermore this integration makes the sote wnn model a novel tool for investigating the long term soil degradation risks and plant responses associated with salinization and alkalization in irrigated agro ecosystems according to the results obtained in figs 4 and s2 the sote wnn model is suitable for studying large ensemble simulations i e s cs ex and rks under stochastic climatic conditions due to it can cover long periods of time with thousands of simulations and high computational efficiency kramer and mau 2020 although this model performed well in assessing long term soil degradation risks and plant responses in different hydrological regions this study did not remove all the uncertainties in the simulation of s cs ex and rks e g the uncertainty of model parameterization due to the lack of a large amount of continuous time series data to calibrate the refined sote model parameters and train the wnn model it is important to note that the propagation and superposition of errors caused by the coupling and circulation of the two sub models may be the largest error source of this model which needs to be improved in future research furthermore as the findings of kramer and mau 2020 when irreversible conditions are considered the increased risk of soil degradation is even larger therefore the reversibility of ks must be better developed and incorporated into this model to accurately assess the long term soil degradation risks and plant responses in addition the wnn model cannot simulate day scale s cs ex during the non cgp thus it is necessary to development the mechanism model of non cgp e g coupmodel and couple the field lysimeter monitoring data to simulate the long term salinity and sodicity dynamics 4 2 soil degradation risks and plant responses looking at the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex in different hydrological regions in fig 4 where the s is at periodic steady state whereas the rate of change of ex for short term fluctuations as well as for the longer term trend is slower than for cs this pattern may be attributed to the cation exchange buffering under the mutual control of climate and irrigation van der zee et al 2014 from the 20 year average cs is the largest in apol and the corresponding yr is the lowest yet ex is the largest in apou and the corresponding rks is the smallest and soil degradation risk is the highest fig 4 this result confirms the fact that soil salinity affects crop water absorption and yield while soil sodicity may additionally lead to soil structural degradation and reduced hydraulic conductivity van de craats et al 2020 many factors control the long term dynamics of s cs and ex shah et al 2011 wang et al 2018a hassani et al 2020 the sensitivity analysis showed that the changes in rainfall patterns i e α and λ have a notable impact on root zone s cs and ex dynamics and the increase in total rainfall can clearly alleviate soil degradation and slightly increase crop yields fig 5 this is in accordance with the findings of shah etal 2011 an interesting angle linked to this climate change is the predicted increase in extreme events that could play a significant role in management of irrigated agroecosystems assouline et al 2015 furthermore as fig 6 reveals the increase in snowfall can clearly reduce the risk of soil degradation by reducing soil alkalization in the root zone this may be explained by the findings of iwata et al 2010 and qin et al 2020 who demonstrated that the changes in the timing and thickness of snow cover deposition can cause a dramatic reduction of frost depth and change in the moisture and solute dynamics in fig 7 we have identified the irrigation water quality is one of the primary controls on variations of root zone s cs and ex in different hydrological regions which has devastating effect on soil degradation and crop yields this is consistent with the findings of kramer and mau 2020 note that the sensitivity of irrigation frequency and quotas should be considered in future studies to devise optimal irrigation schedules further changes in shallow groundwater table and quality have non monotonic effects on the dynamics of root zone s cs and ex the 2 3 m is the critical gtd interval that limits capillary fluxes in the srw fig 8 and as gtd becomes shallower the temporary waterlogging during irrigation can aggravate soil salinization and alkalization these results agree with the findings of abliz et al 2016 and van de craats et al 2020 generally the mechanism through which salinity affects crop growth mainly includes two distinct pathways i e a fast acting osmotic stress in the root zone and an ionic stress within the plant munns and tester 2008 however soil sodicity does not elicit strictly osmotic effects but can affect soil physical properties resulting in crusting reduced infiltration and limited aeration which can also adversely affect plants by exacerbating two of the effects related to salinity van der zee et al 2014 in addition osmotic stress plant salt tolerance and clay content of the soil also have clear effects on soil degradation risks and plant responses in irrigated agro ecosystems scanlon et al 2010 4 3 implications for intensive irrigated agriculture in agricultural lands trade offs between irrigation water quality and groundwater table quality need to be understood when promoting water saving irrigation practices on the one hand the high irrigation efficiency under intensive irrigation means that high water consumption through et and reduce leaching and dilution processes of solute and therefore aggravate soil salinization and alkalization zhang et al 2014 further if shallow groundwater is saline or brackish the upward capillary fluxes carry along salt and alkali that may accumulate in the root zone and can cause a severely decreased hydraulic conductivity and crop losses shah et al 2011 specifically implications from fig 9 devise optimal water saving irrigation schedules conjunctive use of good quality and poor quality water maintain the threshold groundwater table for the coexistence of oasis desert ecosystems and adoption of special crop soil water management practices are all effective management means to create sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation additionally the large economic investment associated with irrigation systems generally requires reasonable budgets and optimized configurations to ensure a return on their investment 5 conclusions in this study the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex and how these contribute to the soil degradation risks and plant responses in intensive irrigated agro ecosystems in the srw were investigated based on the sote wnn model and improved answer model the calibration and verification results show that the sote wnn model successfully described the field measurements of root zone s cs and ex dynamics and the model effectiveness is feasible long term dynamic simulations indicate that the general dynamics of s cs and ex are composed of two features i e sawtooth wave patterns and periodic steady states and the cs is the largest in apol and corresponding yr is the lowest the ex is the largest in apou and corresponding rks is the smallest and soil degradation risk is the highest alarmingly soil degradation has begun to emerge in agricultural lands and is threatening agricultural production in the srw carried out sensitivity analysis revealed that the feedback of decreasing soil hydraulic conductivity together with climate forcing erroneous irrigation practices and excessive groundwater interference have an important role in identifying future soil degradation and plant response associated with salinization and alkalization trade offs between irrigation water quality and water table need to be emphasized at appropriate spatial and temporal scales when promoting water

4079,salinity and sodicity posing large risks to soil hydroecological functioning and agricultural production however a comprehensive investigating of the long term salinity and sodicity dynamics and how these contribute to soil degradation risk and plant response in intensive irrigated agro ecosystems is still scarce especially in cold arid agricultural regions to quantify long term soil

responses in irrigated agro ecosystems in three different hydrological regions i e adfo alluvial diluvial fan oasis apou alluvial plain oasis in the upper part and apol alluvial plain oasis in the lower part in the sangong river watershed srw of northwestern china were investigated the sote wnn model was calibrated and validated using field comprehensive observations during april 2018 april 2021 the simulated results of root zone s cs and ex resulted in a good agreement with the observed values in the srw results showed that the s in the three hydrological regions has a similar periodic steady state with sawtooth pattern the cs is the largest in the apol and corresponding the crop relative yield is the lowest in the apou the ex is the largest and corresponding the soil degradation risk is the highest carried out sensitivity analysis revealed that the increase in rainfall and snowfall can clearly alleviate soil degradation by reducing soil alkalization in the root zone the irrigation water quality is one of the primary controls on long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex and imposing adverse impact on soil hydraulic conductivity and agricultural crop productivity the shallow groundwater table and quality have non monotonic effects on the root zone s cs and ex dynamics the 2 3 m is the critical water table interval that limits soil salinization and alkalization

abandonment of lands for agricultural purposes rahav et al 2017 minhas et al 2020 recent mounting global studies highlight the projected expansion and intensification of irrigated agriculture could

pumping are expected to further exacerbate this risk in the future especially in arid and semiarid regions van der zee et al 2014 perri et al 2018 therefore a comprehensive investigating regarding the dynamics of soil moisture salinity and sodicity is crucial to maximize the use of marginal water and lands while simultaneously creating sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation the primary challenges to the sustainability of irrigated agro ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions are the direct hazards of salinization and alkalization and the unintended consequences of soil hydroecological functioning assouline et al 2015 porporato et al 2015 an accessible model that can simulate the complex interactions between water salinity and sodicity taking place in the soil for variable climates soils groundwater regimes and management options is a necessary tool for addressing the challenges which would enable hypothesis and scenario testing to provide reliable predictions of outcomes gonçalves et al 2006 shani et al 2007 van der zee et al 2014 during the past several decades a large number of analytical and numerical models have been developed to simulate the transfer processes and the long term variations of water and solute within the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum e g hydrus gonçalves et al 2006 minhas et al 2020 and to investigate how multiple environmental variables and their combined affect soil degradation risks and plant responses e g answer shani et al 2007 perri et al 2018 these models have greatly improved the ability to sustainably manage irrigated agro ecosystems particularly kramer and mau 2020 introduced the sote model in the mediterranean climate zones which not only overcomes the shortcomings e g suitable for short term and local simulations require precise soil characterization and are computationally demanding of existing models to simulate the long term salinity and sodicity dynamics but also allowing planners to assess the long term soil degradation risks related to salinization and alkalization further this model taking into account the feedback of salinity and sodicity on the saturated hydraulic conductivity and is suitable for large ensemble simulations of stochastic climatic conditions nevertheless the effectiveness of the sote model is limited in arid seasonally cold regions due to the influence of annual soil freezing and thawing cycles and snowmelt infiltration iwata et al 2010 qin et al 2021 and therefore it needs to be further improved furthermore a synthetically compare the effects of different parameter scenarios related to salinity and sodicity on soil degradation risk and plant response from the sote simulations is still inadequate particularly in different hydrological regions over the long term soil salinity and sodicity levels and their induced soil degradation risks and vegetation responses are substantially affected by governing environmental conditions and anthropogenic activities shani et al 2007 porporato et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 hassani et al 2020 rainfall patterns e g seasonal rainfall significantly control the occurrence of leaching and the balance of root zone salinity and sodicity gonçalves et al 2006 van der zee et al 2014 moreover soil freezing thawing processes and snow cover have clear influence on soil water and solute migrations in cold and arid regions iwata et al 2010 qin et al 2021 irrigation practices e g irrigation scheme schedule and water quality play an important role in the salinity buildup and the degradation of soil hydroecological functioning induced by increasing sodicity scanlon et al 2010 assouline et al 2015 further capillary flux from shallow brackish groundwater could cause root zone salinization and alkalization in arid semiarid areas akter et al 2021 van de craats et al 2020 also soil properties and vegetation types are important aspects of salt accumulation and long term root zone sodicity and thereby controlling soil degradation and plant response perri et al 2018 kramer and mau 2020 the sangong river watershed srw is an arid inland river watershed in northwestern china having low precipitation high evapotranspiration and long snow cover duration and characterized by typical oasis desert landscapes with four different hydrological regions i e adfo apou apol and desert zhou et al 2012 wang et al 2018b regionally the watershed has a long history of irrigated agricultural practices the irrigated area covers 95 of cultivated land in 2012 and water saving irrigation area accounted for more than 85 of the total irrigation area with mulched drip irrigation being the most extensive yin et al 2021a further the agricultural water use accounting for more than 90 of total water use which relies greatly on groundwater pumping yin et al 2021b similar to other arid inland regions e g central asia shortages in water resources and eco environmental issues e g soil salinization and alkalization groundwater deterioration and vegetation degradation are becoming increasingly prominent due to anthropogenic overdevelopment and environmental changes zhang et al 2017 yin et al 2021a the srw therefore provides an excellent case region for investigating the long term soil degradation risks and plant responses related to salinization and alkalization in intensive irrigated agro ecosystems in arid cold regions in this study two representative cropland sampling transects in the defined hydrological regions in the srw were selected soil related water salinity and sodicity groundwater and plant indicators were comprehensively measured during 2018 2021 the main objectives were to 1 establish the sote wnn model by coupling the refined sote model and the wnn model for investigating the long term dynamics of root zone moisture salinity and sodicity in seasonally frozen arid regions 2 quantify the long term dynamics of root zone soil salinization and alkalization and how these contribute to the risk of soil degradation and plant response in different hydrological regions and 3 evaluate the long term soil degradation risks and plant responses resulting from changes in precipitation rainfall and snowfall regimes irrigation practices and groundwater dynamics in the srw capitalizing on these study objectives we will provide management directives for achieving sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation under future environmental changes in other similar endorheic watersheds of china and elsewhere in the world 2 materials

starting in late november and ending in late march of the next year zhou et al 2012 and snowfall is 45 mm in this study period the maximum depth of frost for cropland is approximately 100 cm predominant soils are grey desert soil and saline alkali soil in the study area specifically in both the adfo and apou silt dominated the soil 56 33 81 43 and clay content varied between 5 20 and 17 71 in the apol the content of clay and sand increased evidently and clay layer appeared zhao 2002 in addition the cations in soil are dominated by na and ca2 in the srw and the na ca2 accounts for 72

in the past 60 years zhang et al 2017 in particular the agricultural land increased by 74 55 whereas the saline desert decreased by approximately 494 42 km2 within the agricultural regions the dominant cash crop is cotton and other crops include wheat grapes and melons wang et al 2018b grows mainly by groundwater fed irrigation natural vegetation mainly includes a variety of xeromorphic species shows a dynamic and facultative reliance on groundwater according to rainfall variability xu and li 2006 the groundwater table depth gtd and total dissolved solids tds had changed substantially across the whole watershed from 2004 to 2018 the mean gtd tds in the srw ranged from 1 81 0 2 to 86 56 m 26 7 g l 1 in september 2020 and correspondingly in the adfo apou apol and desert

the over exploitation associated with intensive irrigated agriculture development in the srw wang et al 2018b yin et al 2021a yin et al 2021b 2 2 field experiments and index measurements to calibrate and validate the sote wnn model two representative soil sampling transects fig 1a i e 1 transect and 2 transect in the north south direction across the defined hydrological regions within the oasis area in the srw were established field experiments were conducted during the april october 2018 cgp crop growth period and the november 2020 april 2021 non cgp non crop growth period respectively the 1 transect consists of 8 transverse sections with 3 sampling points on each section a total of 24 sampling points these sections are numbered o1 o7 and o8 from south to north fig 1a the 2 transect

plot s1 each plot is a 1 m 1 m square and all on the same horizontal plane and the distance between adjacent square is 1 5 m to prevent lateral leakage of snowmelt fig 1b the sampling points of 2 transect are numbered p1 p7 and p8 from south to north fig 1a after each snowfall the snow depth measurement and the snow transfer between plots were completed timely each sampling point for both transects is located in the cropland and the irrigation method of each point is water saving irrigation by the groundwater fed according to the handheld gps receiver and remote sensing data transverse sections o1 o2 sampling points p1 p2 o3 o5 p3 p5 and o6 o8 p6 p8 are located in adfo apou and apol respectively the distance between transverse sections sampling points is 1 70 5 60 km in the 1 transect 2 transect and the distance between sampling points is 0 95 3 40 km on each section in the 1 transect along the 1 transect soil samples were collected using a 5 cm in diameter hand auger at depths of 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 140 140 180 and 180 220 cm at each soil sampling point with three replicate at the beginning of each month from april to september 2018 and correspondingly in each plot on november 2 2020 and april 1 2021 for the 2 transect note that no precipitation and irrigation events occurred during sampling periods the basic climate soil vegetation and groundwater regimes of each transect were shown in table 1 most of the physical chemical measurement methods used in this study are described in detail in previous studies yin et al 2021a yin et al 2021b the gravimetric soil water content swc was measured using the oven dry method 24 h at 105 c in the laboratory and the gravimetric swc w g g 1 was converted into volumetric swc θ cm3 cm 3 by multiplying it with soil bulk density the soil electrical conductivity sec was measured in the paste extracts with soil water ratio of 1 5 by a conductivity meter fe 30 mettler toledo switzerland exchangeable cations and cation exchange capacity cec were determined using standard methods of rayment and lyons 2011 the sodium adsorption ratio sar and the exchangeable sodium percentage esp were calculated after measurement of soluble and exchangeable cations of the original soil samples gonçalves et al 2006 the sar and esp of water including soil solutions can be written as mau and porporato

concentration c from ds m 1 to mmolc l 1 by using c mmolc l 1 10 ec ds m 1 mau and porporato 2015 the soil particle size distribution and soil bulk density were determined by the hydrometer method and gravimetric method respectively smith and mullins 2000 the gtd of 41 monitoring wells in the srw was measured three times a month using a portable groundwater level gauge model 101 solinst canada ltd ontario canada by the local government and the chinese academy of sciences cas the irrigation and groundwater water samples were collected in cleaned 100 ml polyethylene bottles tightly capped and refrigerated at 4 c in the laboratory analysis methods of quality of water samples followed is essentially the same as given by the sl78 94 1994 and han et al 2011 the amount of water applied in each irrigation event was measured with a flow meter the daily precipitation and other hydrometeorological data were obtained through a comprehensive weather station established at the fukang station of desert ecology cas fig 1a 2 3 background theory and model development the point of departure is the salt of the earth sote model which taking into account the feedback of salinity and sodicity on the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity to study the long term dynamics of soil water salinity and sodicity developed by kramer and mau 2020 this model including three state variables relative soil moisture s dimensionless i e the fraction of the soil s pore volume containing water i e θ n soil salinity cs mmolc l 1 i e the electrolyte concentration of salts in the soil water and soil sodicity ex dimensionless i e the concentration of sodium ions in soil and soil water i e esp as a tool for smarter decision making the sote model can be used to investigate the risk of long term soil degradation driven by environmental factors in mediterranean climate regions kramer and mau 2020 whereas we noticed that the sote model validation and application from kramer and mau 2020 does not include capillary flux from shallow groundwater and assumes free drainage more importantly although the sote model has good applicability in the mediterranean climate zones its effectiveness is not yet validated in the seasonally frozen arid regions due to the existence of annual soil freezing thawing cycles and snowmelt infiltration yi et al 2014 wu et al 2020 for these reason we considered the contributions of shallow groundwater in the sote model using the modelling technique presented by vervoort and van der zee 2008 simultaneously we proposed a bidirectionally coupled model by combining the refined sote model for the cgp and the wavelet neural network wnn zhang and benveniste 1992 for the non cgp that is sote wnn model to simulate the coupled dynamics of s cs and ex in arid seasonally cold regions specifically when running the sote wnn model we first take the end value simulated by the refined sote model as the initial value of the wnn model and then use the end value simulated by the wnn model as the initial value of the refined sote model and continue this coupled simulation and finally obtain the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex further the methods for assessing the soil degradation risk and plant response induced by salinity and sodicity are also introduced shani et al 2007 kramer and mau 2020 fig 2 presents the a schematic diagram and b basic structure of the sote wnn model 2 3 1 description of the refined sote model for the cgp following kramer and mau 2020 under their basic assumptions we further assume that the groundwater table and quality are constant which means that the temporal variability in the groundwater table and quality occur on a much larger time scale than climate drivers shah et al 2011 meanwhile we consider the soil solution and exchange complex to be in equilibrium due to this study focus on long term processes and we only focus on two cations i e na and ca2 we omit henceforth the charges in the notation mau and porporato 2015 due to the soil can be described as a spatially uniform reservoir characterized by vertically averaged soil porosity n and rooting zone depth zr rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 therefore the balance equations over the long term for the relative soil moisture s i e s θ n the total salt content per square meter qs i e q s c s n z r s and the total sodium mass qna i e esp can be written as laio et al 2001 kramer and mau 2020 3 n z r ds dt p t i t u s e t s l s q s 4 d q s dt n z r d s c s dt i c i p c p u s c u l s c s β t s c s 5 d q na dt i c i e i na p c p e p na u s s

losses through leaching or drainage and plant uptake mmolc l 1 β is a parameter related to soil water properties and plant uptake e i na e p na e u na and e s na are the fraction of sodium cations in irrigation precipitation groundwater and soil solution respectively in the model random precipitation events are modeled as a marked poisson process with frequency of occurrence λ interception depth δ and exponentially distributed precipitation depth of mean α rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 irrigation events are considered to be a constant rate triggered by soil water content vico and porporato 2010 the q is generated through saturation excess and can be considered negligible mau and porporato 2015 for simplicity we do not consider the role of plant salt uptake in the simulations the et is modeled following laio et al 2001 the l is functionally dependent on the s and the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity by the effect of salinity and sodicity k s s c s e x when s is higher than the soil s field capacity sfc the power law can be used to model the leakage i e l s c s e x k s s c s e x s c where c is a soil specific constant laio et al 2001 moreover based on the disaggregation model introduced by ezlit et al 2013 the k s s c s e x can be simulated mcneal 1968 van der zee et al 2014 kramer and mau 2020 further we can get the differential equation of ex by substituting the sum of the sodium in the soil solution q s na into eq 5 and using the gapon equation mau and porporato 2015 in addition following vervoort and van der zee 2008 and the equation of leakage l from kramer and mau 2020 we can estimate the capillary upflow u and the specific formula see supporting information particularly a detailed description of formula derivation parameters meaning value range and unit for this sote model can be found in kramer and mau 2020 2 3 2 development of the wnn model for the non cgp neural networks are extensively developed techniques for nonlinear data driven models especially when physical processes are complex models have many uncertainties and there is extensive training data fausett 1994 seidou et al 2006 the wnn model proposed by zhang and benveniste 1992 not only maintains the advantage of good localization of wavelet transform nature but also overcomes the defect of insufficient accuracy of prediction of neural network in this study we adopted a three layer configuration i e an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer wnn model fig 1b to simulate the coupled dynamics i e stochastic and complex of root zone s cs and ex during the non cgp following alexandridis and zapranis 2013 given the input sample data vi i 1 2 k the hidden layer output layer and corrected weights can be expressed as 6 h j h j i 1 k w ij v i b j k a j k j 1 2 l 7 y k i 1 l w j k h j k 1 2 m 8 w j k i 1 w j k i η e p w j k i a j k i 1 a j k i η e p a j k i b j k i 1 b j k i η e p b j k i where h j is the output value of the j node in the hidden layer hj is the wavelet activation function wij is the linked weights between the input and hidden layers bj k is the shift factor of the hj aj k is the scaling factor of the hj and l is the number of nodes in the hidden layer y k is the output value of the k node in the input layer wj k is the weight between the hidden layer j and the output layer k and m is the number of nodes of the output layer the prediction error e p k 1 m y j k y k with y j k is the expected output value and η is the learning rate furthermore we selected the morlet mother wavelet f v cos 1 75 v e v 2 2 as the activation wavelet function and trained the wnn model using the standard gradient methods zhang and benveniste 1992 once these weights biases and other parameters are estimated the wnn can be used to predict unknown outputs from new datasets in addition the lower bound of the cost function and of the variations of the gradient were set to 10 5 specific variables for the input and output layers in this study are described in section 2 4 a detailed practical guide for the wnn can be found in alexandridis and zapranis 2013 2 3 3 assessment of soil degradation and plant response the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is commonly used to evaluate the degree of degradation of soil structure stability caused by sodicity and salinity ezlit et al 2013 in order to assess the specific risk of soil degradation in this study following kramer and mau 2020 by investigating the distribution of relative ks rks i e k sat k s s c s e x we refer to the probability of the rks being less than the kct i e critical threshold in rks as the critical soil degradation risk csdr which can be obtained by the following equation 9 csdr 0 1 k ct ρ r k s d r k s 0 r k s 1 where ρ rks is the probability density function for rks in general the greater the csdr the higher the risk of soil degradation and the more severe the soil flow limit for the kct we defined a 20 reduction in rks as a critical threshold according to kramer and mau 2020 further to characterize the impact of soil degradation on plant response in this study by substituting the values of water and salt fluxes and saturated hydraulic conductivity simulated by the sote wnn model into the improved answer model shani et al 2007 we quantified crop yield losses in the context of soil environmental degradation following ben gal et al 2003 and shani et al 2007 considering the capillary flux from shallow brackish groundwater the answer model can be modified as 10 y r min e t p ψ root ψ w i p u e t k s s c s e x 1 η i p u e

represents the ece of the soil saturated paste where yr 0 5 θr and θs are the residual and saturated soil water respectively 2 4 parameterization and validation procedures in the present study the parameterization and testing of the sote wnn model involves two sub models i e refined sote model and wnn model two study stages i e cgp and non cgp two data sources i e 1 transect and 2 transect and three hydrological regions i e adfo apou and apol specifically the all data from 1 transect during the cgp were used as the validation data of the refined sote model whereas the data from 2 transect during the non cgp were divided into a training set 70 of the total and a testing set 30 of the total to optimize and evaluate the wnn model the rainfall parameters α and λ during the cgp were calculated from long term daily rainfall data the δ for cropland was assumed to be 0 05 cm day 1 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 the zr and n were obtained from the field measurements according to the main soil texture composition used in field experiments we estimated the values of parameters related to soil water loss i e et l and u based on the typical values included in laio et al 2001 zhao 2002 vervoort and van der zee 2008 and kramer and mau 2020 similarly based on the relative clay content of the soil in this study we used the parameter values reported by ezlit et al 2013 and mau and porporato 2015 to simulate the k s s c s e x following kramer and mau 2020 we assumed the irrigation is continuous during the cgp and applied at a rate proportional to the maximum evapotranspiration rate we also simulated the etmax using a sinusoidal curve over an annual period and the maximum value in the curve was made to coincide with the august the maximum etmax in the august was estimated using the priestly taylor equation dralle and thompson 2016 in addition since the clay content of the root zone in the adfo apou and apol are 15 37 0 83 12 61 0 67 and 16 66 0 54 respectively we used the soil class ii parameter values reported in laio et al 2001 ezlit et al 2013 and kramer and mau 2020 table 2 and table 3 summarize the detailed values of the sote wnn model and answer model parameters in the study area to more accurately simulate the dynamics of soil water and solute during the non cgp under the influence of the soil freezing thawing cycles and snowmelt infiltration we chose soil bulk density of the root zone 0 100 cm x1 average groundwater table x2 average groundwater salinity x3 average groundwater alkalinity x4 total snowfall x5 cold initial i e the early november s cs and ex of the root zone x6 x8 cold initial s cs and ex of the non root zone 100 220 cm x9 x11 and monthly mean soil temperature of root zone from november to april x12 x17 monthly mean air temperature from november to april x18 x23 as the input variables of the wnn model and the cold end i e the early april of the next year s cs and ex of the root zone y1 y3 as the output variables to avoid overfitting of the wnn model the number of hidden neurons nh takes the value of 4 and determined using the empirical formula presented in the sheela and deepa 2013 according to kramer and mau 2020 to examine how changes in precipitation regimes affect the dynamics of s cs ex and soil degradation risk and plant response induced by salinization and alkalization in different hydrological regions in the srw we conducted simulations with four rainfall patterns rainfall 87 3 178 3 360 2 and 542 1 mm with α 4 25 mm and with four depths of snowfall snowfall 22 5 45 67 5 and 90 mm moreover to examine how irrigation with low quality water affect the dynamics of s cs ex and therefore soil degradation risk and plant response in the srw we conducted simulations with four irrigation water qualities i e currently applied water table 2 fresh water ci 12 mmolc l 1 ei 0 36 brackish water ci 35 mmolc l 1 ei 6 93 and saline water ci 55 mmolc l 1 ei 11 31 furthermore to demonstrate how shallow groundwater regimes affect the dynamics of root zone s cs ex and induced soil degradation risk and plant response in the srw we conducted simulations with four types of gtd i e type i z 1 m type ii z 2 m type iii z 3 m and type iv z 10 m here these simulations are based on the sote wnn model csdr and improved answer model by 100 runs for 5 years furthermore to reduce the uncertainties caused by the parameters and structure of the sote wnn model we repeated the training and simulation processes 100 times for calculating the average output values it is noteworthy that the first simulated year was ignored as a warm up period in this study statistical analyses were conducted for calculating the goodness of fit between observed and simulated root zone s cs and ex respectively in the different hydrological regions in the srw the cm consistency measure mae mean absolute error nse nash sutcliffe model efficiency rmse root mean square error mape mean absolute percentage error and r2 coefficient of determination were selected as indicators to investigate models fitting performance zhu 1999 xu et al 2013 modelling and charting were processed using python 3 8 5 https www

compared to sote wnn model simulations in different hydrological regions i e adfo apou and apol in the srw as shown in fig 3a1 c1 a2 c2 and a3 c3 the estimated s cs and ex probability density functions with calibrated model parameters table 2 captured the main soil moisture salinity and sodicity distribution characteristics e g peak height and position span width with average cm were 0 896 0 879 and 0 951 respectively table 4 and the steady state average root zone s cs and ex all showed apol apou adfo suggesting that the model tests well against the measured data under the cgp in the srw as illustrated in fig 3d1 d2 and d3 the simulated root zone s cs and ex showed good agreement with the measured values in different hydrological regions during the calibration and validation periods the average mae nse rmse mape and r2 during the calibration and validation stages were all within the limited range and the model producing an acceptable degree of error and a high modelling efficiency table 4 indicating that the verification of the model is satisfactory and the validity is trustworthy under the non cgp in the srw overall the general agreement between the simulated and measured in different hydrological regions suggests that the calibration of the sote wnn model is reasonable and the performance is generally good for simulating the root zone s cs and ex further this model can easily conduct thousands of simulations with stochastic rainfall thus making it a unique tool for researching the long term processes of s cs and ex and therefore soil degradation risk and plant response in the srw 3 2 modelling the long term dynamics in this section before investigating the long term dynamics 20 years of root zone s cs and ex based on the sote wnn model and how these contribute to the long term soil degradation risk and vegetation response we first analyzed in fig s1 the daily dynamics i e a continuous combination of cgp and non cgp example for the s cs ex and et etp i e yr using model parameters table 2 with 100 runs in different hydrological regions in the srw during the cgp the cs both the s and yr appeared to decline increase slowly first in the early growth period then remained relatively stable from may to september and then rise decrease sharply in the late growth period fig s1a1 a3 b1 b3 and d1 d3 however the ex displayed a continuous upward trend fig s1c1 c3 during the non cgp both the s and cs showed an increasing trend whereas both the ex and yr presented an decreasing trend due to the presence of snowmelt infiltration and soil freezing thawing cycles in the srw 3 2 1 the long term dynamics of soil moisture salinity and sodicity fig 4 a1 d3 presents the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex in the srw based on the sote wnn model using model parameters table 2 by 100 runs for 20 years only the initial and last values are displayed during the non cgp of each year and similarly hereinafter for successive cycles the initial s cs and ex for the sote wnn model are time dependent fig s2 as fig 4a1 c3 reveals the general dynamics of s cs and ex are composed of two features the first feature is the alternation between replenishment and consumption of soil moisture between accumulation and leaching of both the soil salinity and sodicity and resulting in the sawtooth wave pattern the second feature is the longer more than annual term trend where the s is at periodic steady state whereas both the cs and ex changes over a series of years and eventually reached a cyclically stable state by contrast the interannual dynamics of both the cs and ex varied in different hydrological regions fig 4a2 c2 and a3 c3 in particular the amplitude of the sawtooth waveform of cs is clearly higher than that of ex due to the changes in cs occurring on much faster time scales than the changes in ex furthermore there were significant differences for both the cs and ex in the time to reach the periodic steady state in the three hydrological regions indicating that the system parameters e g climate soil vegetation irrigation and groundwater control the dynamic equilibrium state of cs and ex in the srw 3 2 2 the long term soil degradation risk and plant response soil salinity and sodicity are serious environmental hazards with the potential to cause soil structural degradation and limit agricultural production kramer and mau 2020 based on the sote wnn model and assuming that the degradation is reversible we investigated the effect of soil salinity and sodicity on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in different hydrological regions in the srw as fig 4a4 c4 reveals the general dynamics of the relative ks rks also capture two features i e sawtooth wave patterns and periodic steady states and as the cs and ex increase a decline in rks can be observed in each hydrological regions by contrast the interannual dynamics and the time to reach the periodic steady state of the rks were distinctly different in the three hydrological regions with the 20 years average rks showed adfo 0 97 0 001 apol 0 94 0 001 apou 0 88 0 001 suggesting that the apou had the highest risk of soil degradation followed by the apol and then the adfo further fig 4a5 d5 shows that the average risk of critical soil degradation were 0 0 04 and 0 in the adfo apou and apol respectively indicating that soil degradation has begun to emerge in agricultural lands and is threatening agricultural production in the srw furthermore we also characterized the effect of long term s cs ex dynamics and rks on relative crop yield yr based on the improved answer model and related parameters table 3 in different hydrological regions in the srw as illustrated in fig 4a5 c5 as cs ex and soil degradation risk increase the yr showed a significant decline for apol and eventually reach a stable state with value of 0 909 whereas the decline was not evident in the adfo and apol indicating that in contrast to the soil sodicity the salinity in the root zone greatly controls the crop stress response and land productivity 3 3 sensitivity analysis in this section we assessed the impact of precipitation i e rainfall and snowfall patterns irrigation practices i e irrigation water quality and groundwater i e water table and water quality regimes on the dynamics of s cs and ex and therefore soil degradation risk and plant response i e yr in the srw for brevity we only show the ensemble average of 100 runs by the model and do not consider the possibility of irreversible degradation in the simulations 3 3 1 effect of precipitation regimes on s cs ex dynamics soil degradation and yr by the end of this century the precipitation characteristics will change potentially in china wu et al 2019 in particular the amount of snowfall will increase in northwestern china qin et al 2020 the results shown in fig 5 indicate that the difference in rainfall pattern caused clear changes in root zone s cs ex over time in the three hydrological regions as the increase of λ not surprisingly the s showed an increasing trend but the cs and ex displayed a decreasing trend of interest is that when the rainfall is 540 mm leaching of soil salts is increased evidently and cs reaches a lower level in the periodic steady state whereas ex hardly decline during the shorter simulation period moreover the increase in rainfall slightly alleviate the process of soil degradation fig s3 and improves yields especially in apol note that when α increases λ fixed similar results are presented not shown this suggests that as the climate becomes strongly drier both cs and ex increase and subsequently the risk of soil degradation increases and the production of sensitive plants decreases the results of fig 6 that present the change in snowfall pattern has a clear effect on the long term dynamics of root zone rks in the three hydrological regions specifically the increase in snowfall can evidently increase relative ks and alleviate soil degradation and slightly improves crop yields moreover as the snowfall increases ex displayed a visible downward trend whereas cs showed a slight decreasing trend fig s4 this may be due to the fact that the changes in thickness of snow cover deposition can cause a dramatic reduction of frost depth as well as variation of soil water dynamics at the same time the interplays of seasonal freezing thawing cycles snowmelt infiltration and soil evaporation significantly controls the redistribution of salt and alkali in the root zone additionally the groundwater table decline during freezing and rise during thawing may induce soil both salinization and alkalization in the root zone and thereby accelerating soil degradation 3 3 2 effect of irrigation practices on s cs ex dynamics soil degradation and yr in the face of growing water scarcity irrigation with marginal quality water and lands is common practice in arid and semi arid regions rahav et al 2017 however the long term use of marginal water poses risks to the environment at least in part to the degradation of soil hydroecological functioning assouline and narkis 2013 as shown in fig 7 the different irrigation water quality led to significant differences in root zone s cs and ex dynamics during the simulation period in the three hydrological regions not surprisingly as the irrigation water quality becomes strongly saline and sodic cs and ex increase dramatically remarkably with the deterioration of irrigation water quality soil moisture increases sharply a possible explanation for this result is that soil sodicity and salinity can contribute to the deterioration of soil physical properties e g surface crusting infiltration and aeration decline the uncoupling of root zone and groundwater and indirectly limit plant water absorption thus irrigation water will be stored in root zone with a lower leaching rate resulting in a notable increase in soil moisture and further aggravating soil salinization and alkalization furthermore as fig s5 reveals as the increase of saline and sodic in the irrigation water the rks exhibited a dramatic decline with sawtooth pattern in the three hydrological regions simulations revealed that the csdr in the soil irrigated with currently applied water fresh water brackish water and saline water is 0 0 0 52 and 0 58 for adfo respectively and is 0 0 0 69 and 0 69 for apou respectively and is 0 0 0 64 and 0 64 for apol respectively fig 7a4 c4 noticeably as the deterioration of irrigation water quality and the degradation of soil structure crop yields declined sharply and even no yield particularly for the saline water irrigation scenario fig 7a5 c5 these results emphasize the need to carefully consider how a particular irrigation water quality will affect the specific soil and crop in the srw 3 3 3 effect of groundwater dynamics on s cs ex dynamics soil degradation and yr in arid and semi arid regions the surface water transfer for irrigation will lead to the gtd rise and groundwater quality deteriorate han et al 2011 also the over pumping of groundwater for irrigation will result in the gtd decline and groundwater quality degradation yin et al 2021a as presented in fig 8 the salinity and sodicity of groundwater are converted from empirical formulas related to gtd in fig s6 with z increases the root zone s cs and ex all decrease sharply first i e gtd ranges from 1 m to 2 m and then remain relatively stable in the three hydrological regions notably when z 1 m the root zone s cs and ex all reach the highest and are significantly higher than in other gtd scenarios this may be attributed to shallow saline groundwater induced soil structural degradation and water logging situation further a critical gtd intervals may exist in the range of 2 to 3 m where the root zone cs and ex are clearly affected by capillary flux et leaching and dilution processes in addition the time series shows clear differences in rks dynamics between the 3 groundwater regimes and the rks is the smallest when z 1 m fig s7 fig 8 also reveals that the soil degradation risk increases as the groundwater becomes shallower specifically the risk of critical degradation in the gtd type i type ii type iii and type iv is 0 97 0 51 0 and 0 for adfo respectively and is 0 98 0 63 0 and 0 for apou respectively and is 0 95 0 56 0 and 0 for apol respectively the results indicate that within a certain gtd range the shallower gtd with the smaller rks lead to the higher risk of soil degradation i e the larger s cs and ex due to inefficient drainage leaching and dilution thereby triggering the crop yields drop sharply fig 8a5 c5 these results underscore the need to identify and maintain gtd threshold intervals in different hydrological regions to avoid further soil degradation and maintain sustainable development in the srw 3 4 sustainable management implications as noted above section these simulations highlight an important point for sustainable management practices in arid and semiarid regions namely that the development of modern water saving irrigation agriculture requires an optimal combination between irrigation water quality and groundwater table to minimize soil degradation risks and maximize crop yields to determine this best combination we ignore the effects of climate change and other factors e g osmotic stress and assuming that soil degradation is reversible based on sote wnn model by coupling the curve of critical soil degradation risk 0 kct 20 and the curve of critical relative crop yield yr 100 90 75 50 respectively over the long term 20 years under the interactions of groundwater dynamics i e gtd cu and eu and irrigation practices i e ci and ei a simplified conceptual model and threshold intervals of sustainable management for the intensive irrigated agro ecosystems were proposed fig 9 a within the srw take cotton as an example using the parameters as listed in tables 2 and 3 we obtained the threshold intervals of sustainable irrigation management in the adfo fig 9b apou fig 9c and apol fig 9d as shown under the current gtd scenario i e adfo 38 7 m apou 5 53 m apol 3 89 m the sustainable threshold intervals are 0 22 62 0 17 58 and 0 8 79 for ci with mmolc l 1 and are 0 1 56 0 1 49 and 0 1 30 for ei by esp in the adfo apou and apol respectively compared to the currently used irrigation water quality table 2 we noted that the ci of apol has exceeded the upper limit of the threshold interval indicating that optimizing irrigation water quality and adjusting gtd are urgently needed in the apol to avoid further soil degradation and crop losses in combination to achieve sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation in arid and semiarid regions the gtd should be maintained at a reasonable depth to weaken the capillary flux from shallow saline groundwater in agricultural lands by conversion from flood irrigation to microirrigation also from a water quality perspective it would be advisable to either switch between or combine brackish water e g marginal groundwater with fresh water e g channel water to reduce the salt and alkali input to the soil via irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 model effectiveness and error analysis in current study the sote wnn model integrates four major processes related to the dynamics of root zone s cs and ex in the srw first the interplay between cations in the soil complex and the solution and their nonlinear dynamics mau and porporato 2015 second the feedback of soil salinity and sodicity on the saturated hydraulic conductivity van der zee et al 2013 third the contribution of capillary flux from shallow brackish groundwater to root zone salt accumulation and soil alkalization shah et al 2011 fourth the influence of annual soil freezing and thawing cycles and snowmelt infiltration on soil salinity and sodicity dynamics qin et al 2021 as indicated in fig 3 and table 4 the sote wnn model successfully described field measurements of root zone s cs and ex in the srw during the study period suggesting that these four processes can largely characterize the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex in the study area furthermore this integration makes the sote wnn model a novel tool for investigating the long term soil degradation risks and plant responses associated with salinization and alkalization in irrigated agro ecosystems according to the results obtained in figs 4 and s2 the sote wnn model is suitable for studying large ensemble simulations i e s cs ex and rks under stochastic climatic conditions due to it can cover long periods of time with thousands of simulations and high computational efficiency kramer and mau 2020 although this model performed well in assessing long term soil degradation risks and plant responses in different hydrological regions this study did not remove all the uncertainties in the simulation of s cs ex and rks e g the uncertainty of model parameterization due to the lack of a large amount of continuous time series data to calibrate the refined sote model parameters and train the wnn model it is important to note that the propagation and superposition of errors caused by the coupling and circulation of the two sub models may be the largest error source of this model which needs to be improved in future research furthermore as the findings of kramer and mau 2020 when irreversible conditions are considered the increased risk of soil degradation is even larger therefore the reversibility of ks must be better developed and incorporated into this model to accurately assess the long term soil degradation risks and plant responses in addition the wnn model cannot simulate day scale s cs ex during the non cgp thus it is necessary to development the mechanism model of non cgp e g coupmodel and couple the field lysimeter monitoring data to simulate the long term salinity and sodicity dynamics 4 2 soil degradation risks and plant responses looking at the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex in different hydrological regions in fig 4 where the s is at periodic steady state whereas the rate of change of ex for short term fluctuations as well as for the longer term trend is slower than for cs this pattern may be attributed to the cation exchange buffering under the mutual control of climate and irrigation van der zee et al 2014 from the 20 year average cs is the largest in apol and the corresponding yr is the lowest yet ex is the largest in apou and the corresponding rks is the smallest and soil degradation risk is the highest fig 4 this result confirms the fact that soil salinity affects crop water absorption and yield while soil sodicity may additionally lead to soil structural degradation and reduced hydraulic conductivity van de craats et al 2020 many factors control the long term dynamics of s cs and ex shah et al 2011 wang et al 2018a hassani et al 2020 the sensitivity analysis showed that the changes in rainfall patterns i e α and λ have a notable impact on root zone s cs and ex dynamics and the increase in total rainfall can clearly alleviate soil degradation and slightly increase crop yields fig 5 this is in accordance with the findings of shah etal 2011 an interesting angle linked to this climate change is the predicted increase in extreme events that could play a significant role in management of irrigated agroecosystems assouline et al 2015 furthermore as fig 6 reveals the increase in snowfall can clearly reduce the risk of soil degradation by reducing soil alkalization in the root zone this may be explained by the findings of iwata et al 2010 and qin et al 2020 who demonstrated that the changes in the timing and thickness of snow cover deposition can cause a dramatic reduction of frost depth and change in the moisture and solute dynamics in fig 7 we have identified the irrigation water quality is one of the primary controls on variations of root zone s cs and ex in different hydrological regions which has devastating effect on soil degradation and crop yields this is consistent with the findings of kramer and mau 2020 note that the sensitivity of irrigation frequency and quotas should be considered in future studies to devise optimal irrigation schedules further changes in shallow groundwater table and quality have non monotonic effects on the dynamics of root zone s cs and ex the 2 3 m is the critical gtd interval that limits capillary fluxes in the srw fig 8 and as gtd becomes shallower the temporary waterlogging during irrigation can aggravate soil salinization and alkalization these results agree with the findings of abliz et al 2016 and van de craats et al 2020 generally the mechanism through which salinity affects crop growth mainly includes two distinct pathways i e a fast acting osmotic stress in the root zone and an ionic stress within the plant munns and tester 2008 however soil sodicity does not elicit strictly osmotic effects but can affect soil physical properties resulting in crusting reduced infiltration and limited aeration which can also adversely affect plants by exacerbating two of the effects related to salinity van der zee et al 2014 in addition osmotic stress plant salt tolerance and clay content of the soil also have clear effects on soil degradation risks and plant responses in irrigated agro ecosystems scanlon et al 2010 4 3 implications for intensive irrigated agriculture in agricultural lands trade offs between irrigation water quality and groundwater table quality need to be understood when promoting water saving irrigation practices on the one hand the high irrigation efficiency under intensive irrigation means that high water consumption through et and reduce leaching and dilution processes of solute and therefore aggravate soil salinization and alkalization zhang et al 2014 further if shallow groundwater is saline or brackish the upward capillary fluxes carry along salt and alkali that may accumulate in the root zone and can cause a severely decreased hydraulic conductivity and crop losses shah et al 2011 specifically implications from fig 9 devise optimal water saving irrigation schedules conjunctive use of good quality and poor quality water maintain the threshold groundwater table for the coexistence of oasis desert ecosystems and adoption of special crop soil water management practices are all effective management means to create sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation additionally the large economic investment associated with irrigation systems generally requires reasonable budgets and optimized configurations to ensure a return on their investment 5 conclusions in this study the long term dynamics of root zone s cs and ex and how these contribute to the soil degradation risks and plant responses in intensive irrigated agro ecosystems in the srw were investigated based on the sote wnn model and improved answer model the calibration and verification results show that the sote wnn model successfully described the field measurements of root zone s cs and ex dynamics and the model effectiveness is feasible long term dynamic simulations indicate that the general dynamics of s cs and ex are composed of two features i e sawtooth wave patterns and periodic steady states and the cs is the largest in apol and corresponding yr is the lowest the ex is the largest in apou and corresponding rks is the smallest and soil degradation risk is the highest alarmingly soil degradation has begun to emerge in agricultural lands and is threatening agricultural production in the srw carried out sensitivity analysis revealed that the feedback of decreasing soil hydraulic conductivity together with climate forcing erroneous irrigation practices and excessive groundwater interference have an important role in identifying future soil degradation and plant response associated with salinization and alkalization trade offs between irrigation water quality and water table need to be emphasized at appropriate spatial and temporal scales when promoting water saving irrigation practices to achieve sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation in cold arid agricultural regions credit authorship contribution statement xinwei yin conceptualization
