4530,freshwater resources on small island nations are already at risk from sea level rise and groundwater pumping however increasing aridity due to climate change further stresses water availability the amount of freshwater availability on small island nations is delicately balanced by incoming precipitation p and outgoing evapotranspiration et as climate changes some island nations may see increasing aridity et p which can have implications for long term freshwater sustainability understanding how p and et are changing allows small island nations to make more informed planning decisions regarding sustainable management and to adapt contemporary strategies to accommodate future change the bahamas is one such nation made up of over 700 small islands many of which rely on freshwater lenses for potable water and irrigation we use precipitation obtained from the terraclimate reanalysis dataset and satellite derived actual evapotranspiration eta to analyze how seasonal and yearly water budgets have changed over the last 16 years we show that eta is increasing across the bahamas at a higher rate than global averages the cause of eta increases is driven by both increases in temperature and water availability form shifting precipitation patterns ultimately driving decreases in the amount of available water to recharge the freshwater lens keywords carbonate island hydrology freshwater lens remote sensing water budgets reanalysis data 1 introduction the availability of freshwater resources on many small islands 2000 km2 is an increasing concern as climate changes and sea levels rise falkland and custodio 1991 ipcc 2014 climate fluctuations such as shifting precipitation patterns and magnitudes coupled with increasing temperature and subsequent changes in evapotranspiration et will impact the overall available water that can recharge freshwater lenses a common source of potable water and irrigation for many islands small islands particularly low lying ones are some of the most sensitive due to size and aquifer permeability thus accurate water budgets are necessary to inform water management planning strategies now and in the future the amount of recharge to a small island freshwater lens is primarily controlled by precipitation and et while geology and geometry are secondary controls on overall available storage volumes budd and vacher 1991 vacher and wallis 1992 schneider and kruse 2003 van der velde et al 2006 bailey et al 2010 holding and allen 2014 freshwater for many small islands exists as a lens that sits atop and interacts with the underlying seawater budd and vacher 1991 the volume of freshwater availablity is dependent upon the available aquifer storage which exponentially decreases with island size and elevation above sea level vacher 1988 white and falkland 2009 recharge to the freshwater lens is primarily governed by the balance between precipitation and et as carbonate landscapes e g islands with little relief and porous substrate do not typically support surface drainage ford and williams 2013 worthington 2001 whitaker and smart 2007 gulley et al 2016 and soil storage is typically minimal compared to overall precipitation and et 10 cm crump and gamble 2002 for small islands the volume of potential storage for freshwater is already low so when the primary controls p and et change the amount of water available in the lens can drastically change as well precipitation reduction because of el nino southern oscillation enso cycles has been shown to cause devastating droughts on pacific atolls causing significant freshwater lens depletion bailey et al 2009 bailey et al 2010 droughts are especially problematic as the freshwater lens is commonly pumped as rainwater from catchments is limited during these times presley 2005 furthermore freshwater lenses in small islands are typically contained within carbonate coralline and volcanic aquifer material which are highly permeable aquifer systems the high permeabilities allow for rapid infiltration but also rapid exfiltration which makes contemporary climate a dominating force controlling water availability vacher 1988 pumping further exacerbates water availability via up coning causing saltwater intrusion future climate projections show that precipitation and for et variability and magnitude will shift and thus small island freshwater stores remain some of the most vulnerable to climate change in the bahamas freshwater resources are already limited and stressed roebuck et al 2004 diamond and melesse 2016 therefore changes to the primary controls on freshwater availability further exacerbate local water shortages over 80 of residents in the bahamas rely on groundwater pumping from the local freshwater lens while some islands rely on water barged from islands with ample freshwater e g andros to new providence roebuck et al 2004 therefore reductions of freshwater stores would have far reaching consequences beyond a single island the bahamas is particularly vulnerable as most of the island chain is comprised of low lying carbonates where the freshwater lens is close to the surface making it susceptible to contamination westcoat white 2008 more persistent and permanent changes to the climate will only exacerbate any existing water resource shortages driving changes in hydrologic and economic sustainability herein we examine the spatial and temporal changes in freshwater availability across the bahamian archipelago using satellite derived precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration to analyze water budget changes and seasonal shifts in climate parameters for actual evapotranspiration eta changes are compared to global eta and land surface temperatures to characterize how key variables in bahamian water resources are changing with respect to the global averages 2 methods 2 1 site characteristics and selection the bahamian archipelago contains over 700 islands ranging in length from a few to over 100 km these islands comprise greater than 3000 km2 of low lying carbonate islands which are susceptible to abrupt declines in freshwater resources seasonally and from hydrological drought conditions bailey et al 2014 the bahamian archipelago was divided into three regions north central and south fig 1 the regional division is based on the established climate gradient differences in observed vegetation and each regional island s impact from continental fronts and ocean currents whitaker and smart 1997 the northern region including grand bahama and abaco historically received greater rainfall than the rest of the bahamas with averages of about 1300 1400 mm yr roebuck et al 2004 the higher rainfall can cause islands with traditionally negative water budgets to have positive annual water budgets when hurricanes and large storms pass over the islands the defined delineation between north and central bahamas is somewhat arbitrary due to lack of long term data for many out islands however a delineation was made based on historical approximations to water budgets throughout the island chain whitaker and smart 1997 along with vegetation and ocean current effects vegetation on new providence and andros are similar to that of grand bahama and abaco however rainfall is much closer to that of more southerly islands and potential et on new providence has been estimated to be up to 1500 mm yr these values make the water budget consistently more negative which we characterized as representing the central islands rainfall on islands in the central region average around 1100 mm yr the southern islands including great inagua mayaguana and crooked island have consistent negative water budgets with historically high potential et upwards of 1500 mm year and rainfall on average of around 750 mm yr ensuring these islands almost always have a negative water budget 3 data descriptions 3 1 precipitation and temperature monthly cumulative precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were obtained via google earth engine gee from the terraclimate dataset http www climatologylab org terraclimate html abatzoglou et al 2018 the terraclimate is an merged climate dataset compiled using worldclim version 2 v2 global monthly climate normals which is converted to a monthly timeseries using the japanese 55 year reanalysis product jra 55 and climate research unit 4 0 cru4 0 gridded data worldclim v2 data is a gridded climate dataset that uses remotely sensed moderate resolution infrared spectroradiometer modis land surface temperature max and min and cloud cover to spatially interpolate climate variables between ground based climate stations producing a 0 05 4 65 km spatial resolution grided dataset to produce time series climate products from the worldclim v2 monthly normals the jra 55 and cru4 0 gridded datasets are used to climatologically interpolate worldclim v2 climate normals to time series using monthly climate anomalies the use of two separate datasets for temporal expansion is done to gain complete global coverage as cru4 0 does not include island states or antarctica the resulting terraclimate dataset is a monthly time series of climate variables that includes cumulative precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures along with average solar radiation vapor pressure and wind speed the combination of data from these sources that make use of ground based climate stations and satellite products make the terraclimate dataset a robust time series that has been rigorously validated and shown to perform exceptionally well abatzoglou et al 2018 3 2 evapotranspiration monthly total actual et eta was retrieved via gee from the results of the penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 terrestrial et model the pml v2 et model generates a 500 m 8 day resolution product that partitions the different components of et including canopy interception transpiration from plants soil evaporation and direct evaporation of water the utility of the partitioning of eta allows hydrologists to analyze which parts of et are experiencing changes which can help determine causes of eta shifts i e land use changes soil storage changes water availability etc pml v2 estimates eta components globally using a combination of reanalysis data temperature wind speed vapor pressure solar radiation and relative humidity from the global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 1 and satellite products modis leaf area index lai shortwave albedo and emissivity these data are used to estimate the parameters of the penman monteith leuning et model which is a modified version of the penman monteith equation that includes an additional surface conductance model leuning et al 2015 the eta results of the pml v2 model have been validated using in situ eddy covariance flux tower measurements across a wide variety of landscapes including tropical forests which are common in the bahamas particularly south of abaco henry 1974 validation of the individual components of et involved checking the data to other satellite derived products and field experiments the pml v2 model is entirely driven by data that can be obtained via gee we therefore selected the pml v2 model because it was a more robust and rigorously validated eta dataset which was preferred further information about calibration and validation of the pml v2 model can be found in zhang et al 2019 terraclimate also provides an eta product however eta from terraclimate has not been as rigorously validated and where it was validated performance was poorer than other products abatzoglou et al 2018 therefore we sought to obtain eta from a different product pml v2 model with more robust validation and better performance 3 3 data acquisition the most recent terraclimate dataset contains monthly cumulative precipitation and monthly maximum and minimum temperatures available from 1960 to 2017 but eta from pml v2 was only available from 1 2002 1 2017 therefore all variables precipitation temperatures and eta were analyzed for water budget analyses from the timeframe between 1 2002 1 2017 n 16 full years 204 months however validation of precipitation and temperatures along with change point detection utilized the whole time period 1960 2017 available from terraclimate dataset which was compared to available ground based climate data see data validation hereafter data acquisition involved all variables monthly values of cumulative precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures eta averaged over each region using gee to produce the regional value averaging over each region north central south was done by outlining the regions within gee using polygons and taking the mathematical averages of the pixels in each region that contained land 3 4 data validation though the previous datasets terraclimate and pml v2 have been externally validated internal validation was performed to ensure that no unreasonable or extreme values were obtained which would affect analysis we evaluated the performance of the terrraclimate precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures by comparing it to observed data where available we obtained precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature data from a collection of sources table 1 including www climate data org for available islands literature sources whitaker and smart 1997 and bahamas meteorological ministry email for each region the observed precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature data were averaged over the islands that fell within each region and compared to the terraclimate variables all data were compared as annual averages as these were the easiest to obtain observed values for a larger set of islands data that was not retrieved as annual averages were aggregated to annual values validation of eta was not directly comparable as no direct estimates of eta have been made available on the islands only potential et has been estimated however upon comparisons of climate gradients of potential et established by previous researchers whitaker and smart 1997 martin et al 2012 the eta values obtained were less than potential et values reported which was the best validation that could currently be achieved 3 5 data analysis 3 5 1 detecting trends and underlying structure trends in time series were determined using locally weighted estimated scatterplot smoothing lowess which is a common local regression technique employed to smooth data and emphasize underlying structure in time series moran 1984 hirsch et al 1991 lowess involves fitting low order polynomials typically linear or quadratic to continuous windowed subsets of the data whereby at each point in time is estimated using robust weighted least squares regression equation 1 1 y i b 0 b 1 x i b 2 x i 2 parameter estimates b 0 b 1 b 2 are performed using weighted least squares fitting methods whereby the weighted w d sum of squared residuals y i y i 2 on the windowed data k k is minimized eq 2 2 k k n w d y i y i 2 the weighting function initially applied is tri cubic eq 3a however if there are any large residuals that would be considered outliers a bi cubic weighting function eq 3b is applied and the local fit is repeated 3a w d 1 d 3 3 f o r 0 d 1 0 o t h e r w i s e 3b w d 1 d 2 2 f o r 0 d 1 0 o t h e r w i s e 3c d x 0 x i m a x x 0 x i the degree of windowing allows for estimation of d eq 3c where a fraction of the dataset is contained within each window integer k αn 0 5 and used for local fitting the span α of the window is initially set through either a trial and error approach informed selection or simulation herein because of the small sample size 30 simulations were performed that used a robust akaike information criteria aic to determine the optimal weighted smoothing parameter α for each region sharma et al 2015 estimation of α involved simulating 500 realizations spanning an α range uniformly distributed from 0 01 to 1 and calculating the aic for each simulation the smallest aic was used to determine the appropriate α value for each of the three regions lowess trends are particularly useful in smaller sample sizes as they can emphasize structure and trends that ordinarily are not picked up within a statistical test that relies on variance for a small sample hirsch et al 1991 the drawback to lowess in small samples is it can highlight structure that may be well within the bounds of the natural variability of the dataset therefore careful weighting and interpretation is needed when assessing the significance of the result 3 5 2 detection of change points in seasonal values detection of seasonal shifts in et were done using seasonal precipitation and et sums and change point analysis of the mean for the developed time series monthly et was summed for the established contemporary wet june november and dry december may seasons cant and weech 1976 whitaker and smart 1997 van hengstrum et al 2016 to create a time series of wet and dry season values from 2002 to 2017 n 16 to determine when statistically significant changes in et occurred during each season change points where detected using sequential mann kendall seqmk trend test at the 5 significance level the seqmk test is specifically used to estimate abrupt changes in the mean of time series the seqmk is an extension of mann kendall trend test which is used to detect monotonic trends in data whereby the seqmk test extends those same methods determining the breakpoint when that monotonic trend occurs the analysis is done by using both a progressive u t and regressive u t analysis of the time series whereby when the progressive and regressive series cross each other and then diverge beyond a threshold a change point occurs each series u t and u t are standardized with a zero mean and unit standard deviation to set up the progressive and regressive series first the magnitudes of xj annual mean time series j 1 n are compared with xk k 1 j 1 the number of cases where xj xk is counted and denoted by nj at each comparison the test statistic is given in eq 4 and the mean and variance of the test statistic in eqs 5 and 6 respectively 4 t j 1 j n j 5 e t j j j 1 4 6 var t j j j 1 2 j 5 72 the sequential values of the progressive series are calculated using eq 7 7 u t t j e t j var t j the same methods are used to setup the regressive series u t and both are compared plotted and values that are equal at time t and subsequently diverge at a threshold exceeding the confidence level of 1 96 α 0 05 are significant change points because the seqmk does a sequencing of progressive forward and regressive backward series multiple change points may be detected and for the purposes herein the most significant change point in terms of magnitude of change was selected as the change point of interest using the years established as a change point in the et dataset the precipitation data were split at that change point and significant differences in the mean in precipitation before and after were tested using the welch s t test with unequal variances at α 0 05 significance level because the dataset for comparison of means would be small yearly sums for each season at n 15 the power of the test would be low indicating that the probability of finding a statistically significant result therefore to complement the results of the t test lowess trends were also performed on each data series to help validate the results 3 5 3 comparison to global temperature anomalies and et changes the changes in eta within each region and across the bahamas were compared to changes in global land surface temperatures glst s and global eta changes glst s are used to monitor changing land cover dynamics as well as overall water budget and ecological stresses glst s record how incoming solar radiation interacts with the land surface making it a reliable indicator of energy changes at the land surface atmosphere boundary and a key variable in eta estimation oliviera guerra et al 2017 glst s monitor overall changing global dynamics thus taking the pulse of global climate change and have been tracked for a much larger time frame than global eta we obtained glst anomalies from nasa s near earth observatory neo data repository https neo sci gsfc nasa gov the original glst s are recorded at 8 day 500 m spatial resolution from modis aboard nasa s terra satellite the climatology used to produce the glst anomalies is the baseline period from 2001 to 2010 because of a lack of long term record of eta eta across the bahamas was compared both to glst s and the global eta data that was available to estimate eta anomalies the baseline eta was taken to be the average for the dataset from 2002 to 2010 as it most directly compared to the timeframe of glst anomaly baseline the same smoothing technique using lowess was employed as in previous analyses the comparison of local eta to both global eta and glst s gives a comparative approximation of changes at local and regional scales 4 results 4 1 data validation and description climate variables for the available time periods matched well with observed historical data figs 2 and 3 estimated annual precipitation was 1339 mm yr from the terraclimate precipitation dataset which is slightly less than annual averages of 1500 mm yr for grand bahama and andros the discrepancy is likely due to a few factors first intense hurricane rainfall may not have been captured in the terraclimate data second the northern island delineation also consisted of the berry islands which is closer to new providence which receives about 1200 mm yr and thus the inclusion of these islands into the northern bahamas regional delineation could drive the annual average down years where hurricanes pass over the islands can significantly increase overall precipitation which drives up annual averages over 1500 mm yr for example in 2019 dorian passed over the northern bahamas andros and grand bahama and resulted in an additional 900 mm of rainfall in 4 days significantly driving up annual totals weather com average annual precipitation totals for the central bahamas were also well matched falling within the ranges of reported precipitation values for the islands included in the central delineation table 2 average annual precipitation was estimated to be 813 mm yr for the south islands which include inagua and mayaguana where average annual precipitation is reported to be roughly 750 800 mm yr the inclusion of some more northerly islands such as crooked island and cat island in the southern delineation could slightly increase the average annual totals maximum and minimum temperatures for the northern central southern and overall bahamas were relatively well matched to observed temperatures with some slight deviations due to the selected delineations 4 2 spatial and temporal water budget changes seasonal change point detection using the seqmk test showed significant upward change points in eta for most regions and across the bahamas in both wet and dry seasons except for the south in the wet season table 3 the change points occurred around 2008 2009 for the wet season and from 2009 to 2013 for the dry season all changes are amplified by the lowess lines which show a continuous increase in eta for the central bahamas in both wet and dry seasons fig 4 slight dips are observed in the beginning of the series in the lowess line likely as a function of the small sample size lowess lines and overall volumes of precipitation fig 4 indicate some upward and downward trends within each season it should be noted that the average annual calculations for the pre change point precipitation considered all years from 1960 up until the change point though no significant change occurred outside the range of variability for the data any decreasing or increasing trends within the dataset can make a significant difference in the amount of available water for the season and ultimately the water year significant trends mostly occur in the central and southern bahamas where in the wet season decreases in precipitation have been occurring while eta increases which is likely temperature driven this opposite trend is seen in the dry season where slight increases in precipitation are observed with coincident increases in eta which is likely driven by increases in water availability all eta increases were due to evaporation from water surfaces for all regions with some statistically significant increases in canopy evaporation for the wet and dry seasons for all regions except the south during the wet season fig 5 the largest increases were observed in water evaporation where with minimal increases in canopy evaporation no statistically significant changes were seen in evaporation from soil and transpiration in any region overall yearly water availability showed initial reductions but remained stable for the northern and southern bahamas but steady declines were observed for the central region fig 6 though annual water budgets can mask the timing of recharge see discussion they provide a good indication of overall water availability and thus are commonly used as indicators of overall island aridity vacher and wallis 1992 the annual p et values show a significant uptick in 2007 for the central and southern bahamas which came from a particularly devastating tropical system noel that passed slowly over this region of the archipelago noel likely added an additional 400 mm of rain for that year which may have influenced the lowess trend lines resulting in upticks followed by downward trends in the central bahamas however even removing the rainfall amount contributed by noel in 2007 the central portion of the bahamas would have still had a more positive water balance than in recent years 4 3 bahamian eta trends relative to global anomalies trends in eta across the bahamas match or exceed rates of global eta fig 7 eta across the whole bahamas specifically the northern and southern regions are similar to the rate of global increases in eta the central region however shows increasing eta higher than global rates global eta trends also show a breakpoint around 2009 which is coincident with dry season increases in eta for the bahamas which saw significant eta increases between 2008 and 2009 followed by increases in eta during the dry season around 2010 the comparison of eta changes with respect to glst s indicates that increases in eta is not entirely temperature driven but likely due to shifts in precipitation patterns which can drive higher or lower eta depending on water availability changes 5 discussion young carbonate platforms that form the bahamian archipelago are characterized by high matrix porosity and permeability because it has not yet undergone significant diagenetic processes ford and williams 2013 gulley et al 2013 the high permeability of the bahamian islands accelerates rainfall infiltration at the land surface causing a lack of surface water with the exception of blue holes or topographically low surface areas that are filled with water from raised water tables that are influenced by sea level fluctuations martin et al 2013 gulley et al 2012 the lakes that exist are typically brackish to hypersaline waters due to high potential et rates exceeding rainfall whitaker and smart 2007 vacher and wallis 1992 along with limited surface waters the lack of surface drainage and little to negligible runoff to depressional lakes supports using p et as an approximation of effective recharge in the water budget which has been assumed by other water resource studies in the region vacher and wallis 1992 gulley et al 2016 current and historical periods of increasing aridity in the bahamas have been noted and likely are a result of changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation one of the more intense historical hydrological droughts occurred in the holocene between 3300 and 2500 years b p the holocene drought was marked by significant changes in water budgets in the northern bahamas as evidenced from lake cores in abaco van hengstrum et al 2016 increases in marine tolerant ostracodes were observed which would have coincided with increases in salinity the drought was likely caused by decreasing precipitation due to a southward or westward expansion of the north atlantic subtropical high nash as a result of southern intertropical convergence zone itcz displacement modern analogues validate this claim as the yucatan experiences a climate gradient that has been definitively linked to displacement of the itcz on seasonal and decadal time scales furthermore recent caribbean dry period from 1979 to 1989 was preceded by intensification of the nash our contemporary analysis of increasing drought conditions mirrors results showing increasing aridity between 2013 and 2016 spanning over cuba and the antilles herrera et al 2016 our results confirm that a drought is indeed occurring though our changes to aridity were slightly earlier than 2013 as global warming intensifies changing atmospheric and subsequent ocean circulation will continue to change wattmeier and friarson 2018 amplified warming in the upper tropical troposphere can cause temperature gradients to increase from equator to pole resulting in hadley cell edge expansion the hadley cell expansion causes alterations to the itcz which may cause disruptions in water budgets across the bahamian archipelago a small shift in the itcz northward could cause an increase in precipitation and hurricane development within the bahamian archipelago however a large shift northward of the itcz can cause the zone of regional subsistence to change and cause a decrease in precipitation along the entire bahamian archipelago causing the area to trend towards an increasingly arid climate because the bahamas particularly the north are close to the contemporary edge of the hadley cell it is likely more sensitive to changes in hadley cell circulation then elsewhere along the caribbean with the warming of the subtropical landmasses seen in the early holocene and possibly in the future with anthropogenic forced warming the itcz could be drawn even more northward than seen in the recent past impacting the evaporation precipitation balance of the archipelago arbuszewski et al 2013 as continental fronts across north america increase in intensity and change in their frequency changes in water budgets may result that we cannot anticipate the bahamian archipelago being the closest of the caribbean islands to the subtropical jet stream are more impacted by the variation of the el niño southern oscillation enso moreso than the north atlantic oscillation nao which impact lower latitudes of the caribbean jury et al 2007 during el niño or warm phase of enso the subtropical jet stream strengthens and shifts south in the atlantic and overall atlantic hurricane activity is reduced gray 1984 during la niña or cold phases of enso along with neutral enso phases the opposite occurs and overall hurricane activity and precipitation will be increased in the atlantic o brien et al 1996 these hurricanes and precipitation patterns will be more impacted by the onset of a new enso phase in october than the decaying of a previous phase tartaglione et al 2003 the predictability of enso phases has improved substantially and the predictability of the precipitation in north america during the hemispherical winter will be linked to the current enso phase but the influences of different phases will be non linear and predicted patterns may not be precisely reflected in actual precipitation patterns li et al 2019 the impact of enso is often limited to locations found closer to the northern edge of the hadley cell and therefore the subtropical jet streams jury et al 2007 thus further analysis of other extremes and climatic shifts in other island settings would be warranted the seasonal shift in precipitation from wet to dry season and consistent increase in eta provide insight into how overall yearly water availability is changing and driving increasing aridity most recharge to the freshwater lens occurs during the wet season when intense and steady rainfalls drive infiltration after an island specific recharge threshold little et al 1973 budd 1984 jones and banner 2003 though rapid infiltration through roots and solution holes occur during most rainfall events mylroie and carew 1995 during the dry season rains are shorter and less intense which does not drive as much recharge into the freshwater lens leaving water to pond on the surface longer whereby much of the water can be evaporated eta is also lower than in dry season months primarily due to cooler temperatures the slight shift in precipitation seasonality coupled with an overall downward trend when accounting for hurricanes roebuck et al 2004 simultaneous with increasing eta suggest that water resource availability is on a negative trajectory the significance of increased evaporation directly from water also has implications for the freshwater lens dynamics and viability gulley et al 2016 lakes blue holes and wetlands on the bahamas are persistent features of the karst landscape segmenting the freshwater lens creating hydraulic lows that focus freshwater gradients martin et al 2012 as increases in water evaporation occur from these lakes further thinning and segmentation of the freshwater lens occurs driving more brackish aquifer conditions and depleting water resource faster than sea level rise the impacts of freshwater lens volume as a function of evapotranspiration have shown that the depletion of freshwater lens stores is a linear function of eta and thus increases in eta directly affect existing freshwater stores thus freshwater depletion is not only a function of reduced water availability but also from direct evaporation from the freshwater lens that occurs more readily gulley et al 2016 therefore increasing aridity not only reduces incoming available water but also more rapidly depletes existing freshwater though definitively linking the change in water budgets through the bahamas to anthropogenic causes is difficult given limited data to estimate long term eta from the islands analyzing both global eta and glst anomalies in comparison with local averages across the bahamas gives some insight into a potential link previous comparisons with contemporary episodes of aridity in the bahamas illustrate that the current trends may be more consequential as evidenced by increasing temperatures locally and globally fig 7 however in regions where shifting ocean currents and sea surface temperatures have a profound impact on climate from year to year such as the bahamas these areas may experience exacerbated effects as ocean currents temper variability in land surface and air temperatures resulting in compound heating effects the increasing eta trend in some areas of the bahamas particularly the central region observed in the last decade shows a rate that may be greater than global averages this indicates depletion of freshwater stores may occur more rapidly in small islands requiring more focus on changing water budget components though eta and precipitation generated using satellite data at the regional scale has been shown to be reliable analyzing island scale water budgets inherently produces greater uncertainty we aggregated regional data to produce regional analysis of water budgets based on climatic gradients and land surface dynamics however each island would be unique and have its own singular water management issues therefore further analyses on water budgets at the island scale should consider ground truthing eta and precipitation as necessary 6 conclusions we used satellite guided reanalysis precipitation and satellite derived eta to analyze trends in p et which is a fundamental control on island freshwater stores we found that increases in eta are a result of increases in temperature but also likely due to shifting precipitation which increases in water availability as climate change in the bahamas is historically been related to changes in hadley cell circulation patterns recent evidence suggests this could be a cause of aridity changes furthermore it was shown that eta throughout the bahamian archipelago chain is increasing at a rate higher than global average eta which may put the islands at a greater risk for water sustainability when compared to continental settings which are less influenced by ocean currents and marine conditions as tropical islands have a more tempered climate baseline land surface and water temperatures which affect eta rates are not as variable and could therefore be a cause of exacerbated eta in these island states key findings consistent with global trends et is increasing across the bahamas but at a higher rate particularly the central and southern regions cause of increasing et are likely driven by both increases in temperature and an increase in precipitation in the dry season and reduction of precipitation in the wet season reducing water available for recharge increasing overall water available for et majority of increases in et are due to direct water evaporation which has implications for freshwater lens thinning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
4530,freshwater resources on small island nations are already at risk from sea level rise and groundwater pumping however increasing aridity due to climate change further stresses water availability the amount of freshwater availability on small island nations is delicately balanced by incoming precipitation p and outgoing evapotranspiration et as climate changes some island nations may see increasing aridity et p which can have implications for long term freshwater sustainability understanding how p and et are changing allows small island nations to make more informed planning decisions regarding sustainable management and to adapt contemporary strategies to accommodate future change the bahamas is one such nation made up of over 700 small islands many of which rely on freshwater lenses for potable water and irrigation we use precipitation obtained from the terraclimate reanalysis dataset and satellite derived actual evapotranspiration eta to analyze how seasonal and yearly water budgets have changed over the last 16 years we show that eta is increasing across the bahamas at a higher rate than global averages the cause of eta increases is driven by both increases in temperature and water availability form shifting precipitation patterns ultimately driving decreases in the amount of available water to recharge the freshwater lens keywords carbonate island hydrology freshwater lens remote sensing water budgets reanalysis data 1 introduction the availability of freshwater resources on many small islands 2000 km2 is an increasing concern as climate changes and sea levels rise falkland and custodio 1991 ipcc 2014 climate fluctuations such as shifting precipitation patterns and magnitudes coupled with increasing temperature and subsequent changes in evapotranspiration et will impact the overall available water that can recharge freshwater lenses a common source of potable water and irrigation for many islands small islands particularly low lying ones are some of the most sensitive due to size and aquifer permeability thus accurate water budgets are necessary to inform water management planning strategies now and in the future the amount of recharge to a small island freshwater lens is primarily controlled by precipitation and et while geology and geometry are secondary controls on overall available storage volumes budd and vacher 1991 vacher and wallis 1992 schneider and kruse 2003 van der velde et al 2006 bailey et al 2010 holding and allen 2014 freshwater for many small islands exists as a lens that sits atop and interacts with the underlying seawater budd and vacher 1991 the volume of freshwater availablity is dependent upon the available aquifer storage which exponentially decreases with island size and elevation above sea level vacher 1988 white and falkland 2009 recharge to the freshwater lens is primarily governed by the balance between precipitation and et as carbonate landscapes e g islands with little relief and porous substrate do not typically support surface drainage ford and williams 2013 worthington 2001 whitaker and smart 2007 gulley et al 2016 and soil storage is typically minimal compared to overall precipitation and et 10 cm crump and gamble 2002 for small islands the volume of potential storage for freshwater is already low so when the primary controls p and et change the amount of water available in the lens can drastically change as well precipitation reduction because of el nino southern oscillation enso cycles has been shown to cause devastating droughts on pacific atolls causing significant freshwater lens depletion bailey et al 2009 bailey et al 2010 droughts are especially problematic as the freshwater lens is commonly pumped as rainwater from catchments is limited during these times presley 2005 furthermore freshwater lenses in small islands are typically contained within carbonate coralline and volcanic aquifer material which are highly permeable aquifer systems the high permeabilities allow for rapid infiltration but also rapid exfiltration which makes contemporary climate a dominating force controlling water availability vacher 1988 pumping further exacerbates water availability via up coning causing saltwater intrusion future climate projections show that precipitation and for et variability and magnitude will shift and thus small island freshwater stores remain some of the most vulnerable to climate change in the bahamas freshwater resources are already limited and stressed roebuck et al 2004 diamond and melesse 2016 therefore changes to the primary controls on freshwater availability further exacerbate local water shortages over 80 of residents in the bahamas rely on groundwater pumping from the local freshwater lens while some islands rely on water barged from islands with ample freshwater e g andros to new providence roebuck et al 2004 therefore reductions of freshwater stores would have far reaching consequences beyond a single island the bahamas is particularly vulnerable as most of the island chain is comprised of low lying carbonates where the freshwater lens is close to the surface making it susceptible to contamination westcoat white 2008 more persistent and permanent changes to the climate will only exacerbate any existing water resource shortages driving changes in hydrologic and economic sustainability herein we examine the spatial and temporal changes in freshwater availability across the bahamian archipelago using satellite derived precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration to analyze water budget changes and seasonal shifts in climate parameters for actual evapotranspiration eta changes are compared to global eta and land surface temperatures to characterize how key variables in bahamian water resources are changing with respect to the global averages 2 methods 2 1 site characteristics and selection the bahamian archipelago contains over 700 islands ranging in length from a few to over 100 km these islands comprise greater than 3000 km2 of low lying carbonate islands which are susceptible to abrupt declines in freshwater resources seasonally and from hydrological drought conditions bailey et al 2014 the bahamian archipelago was divided into three regions north central and south fig 1 the regional division is based on the established climate gradient differences in observed vegetation and each regional island s impact from continental fronts and ocean currents whitaker and smart 1997 the northern region including grand bahama and abaco historically received greater rainfall than the rest of the bahamas with averages of about 1300 1400 mm yr roebuck et al 2004 the higher rainfall can cause islands with traditionally negative water budgets to have positive annual water budgets when hurricanes and large storms pass over the islands the defined delineation between north and central bahamas is somewhat arbitrary due to lack of long term data for many out islands however a delineation was made based on historical approximations to water budgets throughout the island chain whitaker and smart 1997 along with vegetation and ocean current effects vegetation on new providence and andros are similar to that of grand bahama and abaco however rainfall is much closer to that of more southerly islands and potential et on new providence has been estimated to be up to 1500 mm yr these values make the water budget consistently more negative which we characterized as representing the central islands rainfall on islands in the central region average around 1100 mm yr the southern islands including great inagua mayaguana and crooked island have consistent negative water budgets with historically high potential et upwards of 1500 mm year and rainfall on average of around 750 mm yr ensuring these islands almost always have a negative water budget 3 data descriptions 3 1 precipitation and temperature monthly cumulative precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were obtained via google earth engine gee from the terraclimate dataset http www climatologylab org terraclimate html abatzoglou et al 2018 the terraclimate is an merged climate dataset compiled using worldclim version 2 v2 global monthly climate normals which is converted to a monthly timeseries using the japanese 55 year reanalysis product jra 55 and climate research unit 4 0 cru4 0 gridded data worldclim v2 data is a gridded climate dataset that uses remotely sensed moderate resolution infrared spectroradiometer modis land surface temperature max and min and cloud cover to spatially interpolate climate variables between ground based climate stations producing a 0 05 4 65 km spatial resolution grided dataset to produce time series climate products from the worldclim v2 monthly normals the jra 55 and cru4 0 gridded datasets are used to climatologically interpolate worldclim v2 climate normals to time series using monthly climate anomalies the use of two separate datasets for temporal expansion is done to gain complete global coverage as cru4 0 does not include island states or antarctica the resulting terraclimate dataset is a monthly time series of climate variables that includes cumulative precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures along with average solar radiation vapor pressure and wind speed the combination of data from these sources that make use of ground based climate stations and satellite products make the terraclimate dataset a robust time series that has been rigorously validated and shown to perform exceptionally well abatzoglou et al 2018 3 2 evapotranspiration monthly total actual et eta was retrieved via gee from the results of the penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 terrestrial et model the pml v2 et model generates a 500 m 8 day resolution product that partitions the different components of et including canopy interception transpiration from plants soil evaporation and direct evaporation of water the utility of the partitioning of eta allows hydrologists to analyze which parts of et are experiencing changes which can help determine causes of eta shifts i e land use changes soil storage changes water availability etc pml v2 estimates eta components globally using a combination of reanalysis data temperature wind speed vapor pressure solar radiation and relative humidity from the global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 1 and satellite products modis leaf area index lai shortwave albedo and emissivity these data are used to estimate the parameters of the penman monteith leuning et model which is a modified version of the penman monteith equation that includes an additional surface conductance model leuning et al 2015 the eta results of the pml v2 model have been validated using in situ eddy covariance flux tower measurements across a wide variety of landscapes including tropical forests which are common in the bahamas particularly south of abaco henry 1974 validation of the individual components of et involved checking the data to other satellite derived products and field experiments the pml v2 model is entirely driven by data that can be obtained via gee we therefore selected the pml v2 model because it was a more robust and rigorously validated eta dataset which was preferred further information about calibration and validation of the pml v2 model can be found in zhang et al 2019 terraclimate also provides an eta product however eta from terraclimate has not been as rigorously validated and where it was validated performance was poorer than other products abatzoglou et al 2018 therefore we sought to obtain eta from a different product pml v2 model with more robust validation and better performance 3 3 data acquisition the most recent terraclimate dataset contains monthly cumulative precipitation and monthly maximum and minimum temperatures available from 1960 to 2017 but eta from pml v2 was only available from 1 2002 1 2017 therefore all variables precipitation temperatures and eta were analyzed for water budget analyses from the timeframe between 1 2002 1 2017 n 16 full years 204 months however validation of precipitation and temperatures along with change point detection utilized the whole time period 1960 2017 available from terraclimate dataset which was compared to available ground based climate data see data validation hereafter data acquisition involved all variables monthly values of cumulative precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures eta averaged over each region using gee to produce the regional value averaging over each region north central south was done by outlining the regions within gee using polygons and taking the mathematical averages of the pixels in each region that contained land 3 4 data validation though the previous datasets terraclimate and pml v2 have been externally validated internal validation was performed to ensure that no unreasonable or extreme values were obtained which would affect analysis we evaluated the performance of the terrraclimate precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures by comparing it to observed data where available we obtained precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature data from a collection of sources table 1 including www climate data org for available islands literature sources whitaker and smart 1997 and bahamas meteorological ministry email for each region the observed precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature data were averaged over the islands that fell within each region and compared to the terraclimate variables all data were compared as annual averages as these were the easiest to obtain observed values for a larger set of islands data that was not retrieved as annual averages were aggregated to annual values validation of eta was not directly comparable as no direct estimates of eta have been made available on the islands only potential et has been estimated however upon comparisons of climate gradients of potential et established by previous researchers whitaker and smart 1997 martin et al 2012 the eta values obtained were less than potential et values reported which was the best validation that could currently be achieved 3 5 data analysis 3 5 1 detecting trends and underlying structure trends in time series were determined using locally weighted estimated scatterplot smoothing lowess which is a common local regression technique employed to smooth data and emphasize underlying structure in time series moran 1984 hirsch et al 1991 lowess involves fitting low order polynomials typically linear or quadratic to continuous windowed subsets of the data whereby at each point in time is estimated using robust weighted least squares regression equation 1 1 y i b 0 b 1 x i b 2 x i 2 parameter estimates b 0 b 1 b 2 are performed using weighted least squares fitting methods whereby the weighted w d sum of squared residuals y i y i 2 on the windowed data k k is minimized eq 2 2 k k n w d y i y i 2 the weighting function initially applied is tri cubic eq 3a however if there are any large residuals that would be considered outliers a bi cubic weighting function eq 3b is applied and the local fit is repeated 3a w d 1 d 3 3 f o r 0 d 1 0 o t h e r w i s e 3b w d 1 d 2 2 f o r 0 d 1 0 o t h e r w i s e 3c d x 0 x i m a x x 0 x i the degree of windowing allows for estimation of d eq 3c where a fraction of the dataset is contained within each window integer k αn 0 5 and used for local fitting the span α of the window is initially set through either a trial and error approach informed selection or simulation herein because of the small sample size 30 simulations were performed that used a robust akaike information criteria aic to determine the optimal weighted smoothing parameter α for each region sharma et al 2015 estimation of α involved simulating 500 realizations spanning an α range uniformly distributed from 0 01 to 1 and calculating the aic for each simulation the smallest aic was used to determine the appropriate α value for each of the three regions lowess trends are particularly useful in smaller sample sizes as they can emphasize structure and trends that ordinarily are not picked up within a statistical test that relies on variance for a small sample hirsch et al 1991 the drawback to lowess in small samples is it can highlight structure that may be well within the bounds of the natural variability of the dataset therefore careful weighting and interpretation is needed when assessing the significance of the result 3 5 2 detection of change points in seasonal values detection of seasonal shifts in et were done using seasonal precipitation and et sums and change point analysis of the mean for the developed time series monthly et was summed for the established contemporary wet june november and dry december may seasons cant and weech 1976 whitaker and smart 1997 van hengstrum et al 2016 to create a time series of wet and dry season values from 2002 to 2017 n 16 to determine when statistically significant changes in et occurred during each season change points where detected using sequential mann kendall seqmk trend test at the 5 significance level the seqmk test is specifically used to estimate abrupt changes in the mean of time series the seqmk is an extension of mann kendall trend test which is used to detect monotonic trends in data whereby the seqmk test extends those same methods determining the breakpoint when that monotonic trend occurs the analysis is done by using both a progressive u t and regressive u t analysis of the time series whereby when the progressive and regressive series cross each other and then diverge beyond a threshold a change point occurs each series u t and u t are standardized with a zero mean and unit standard deviation to set up the progressive and regressive series first the magnitudes of xj annual mean time series j 1 n are compared with xk k 1 j 1 the number of cases where xj xk is counted and denoted by nj at each comparison the test statistic is given in eq 4 and the mean and variance of the test statistic in eqs 5 and 6 respectively 4 t j 1 j n j 5 e t j j j 1 4 6 var t j j j 1 2 j 5 72 the sequential values of the progressive series are calculated using eq 7 7 u t t j e t j var t j the same methods are used to setup the regressive series u t and both are compared plotted and values that are equal at time t and subsequently diverge at a threshold exceeding the confidence level of 1 96 α 0 05 are significant change points because the seqmk does a sequencing of progressive forward and regressive backward series multiple change points may be detected and for the purposes herein the most significant change point in terms of magnitude of change was selected as the change point of interest using the years established as a change point in the et dataset the precipitation data were split at that change point and significant differences in the mean in precipitation before and after were tested using the welch s t test with unequal variances at α 0 05 significance level because the dataset for comparison of means would be small yearly sums for each season at n 15 the power of the test would be low indicating that the probability of finding a statistically significant result therefore to complement the results of the t test lowess trends were also performed on each data series to help validate the results 3 5 3 comparison to global temperature anomalies and et changes the changes in eta within each region and across the bahamas were compared to changes in global land surface temperatures glst s and global eta changes glst s are used to monitor changing land cover dynamics as well as overall water budget and ecological stresses glst s record how incoming solar radiation interacts with the land surface making it a reliable indicator of energy changes at the land surface atmosphere boundary and a key variable in eta estimation oliviera guerra et al 2017 glst s monitor overall changing global dynamics thus taking the pulse of global climate change and have been tracked for a much larger time frame than global eta we obtained glst anomalies from nasa s near earth observatory neo data repository https neo sci gsfc nasa gov the original glst s are recorded at 8 day 500 m spatial resolution from modis aboard nasa s terra satellite the climatology used to produce the glst anomalies is the baseline period from 2001 to 2010 because of a lack of long term record of eta eta across the bahamas was compared both to glst s and the global eta data that was available to estimate eta anomalies the baseline eta was taken to be the average for the dataset from 2002 to 2010 as it most directly compared to the timeframe of glst anomaly baseline the same smoothing technique using lowess was employed as in previous analyses the comparison of local eta to both global eta and glst s gives a comparative approximation of changes at local and regional scales 4 results 4 1 data validation and description climate variables for the available time periods matched well with observed historical data figs 2 and 3 estimated annual precipitation was 1339 mm yr from the terraclimate precipitation dataset which is slightly less than annual averages of 1500 mm yr for grand bahama and andros the discrepancy is likely due to a few factors first intense hurricane rainfall may not have been captured in the terraclimate data second the northern island delineation also consisted of the berry islands which is closer to new providence which receives about 1200 mm yr and thus the inclusion of these islands into the northern bahamas regional delineation could drive the annual average down years where hurricanes pass over the islands can significantly increase overall precipitation which drives up annual averages over 1500 mm yr for example in 2019 dorian passed over the northern bahamas andros and grand bahama and resulted in an additional 900 mm of rainfall in 4 days significantly driving up annual totals weather com average annual precipitation totals for the central bahamas were also well matched falling within the ranges of reported precipitation values for the islands included in the central delineation table 2 average annual precipitation was estimated to be 813 mm yr for the south islands which include inagua and mayaguana where average annual precipitation is reported to be roughly 750 800 mm yr the inclusion of some more northerly islands such as crooked island and cat island in the southern delineation could slightly increase the average annual totals maximum and minimum temperatures for the northern central southern and overall bahamas were relatively well matched to observed temperatures with some slight deviations due to the selected delineations 4 2 spatial and temporal water budget changes seasonal change point detection using the seqmk test showed significant upward change points in eta for most regions and across the bahamas in both wet and dry seasons except for the south in the wet season table 3 the change points occurred around 2008 2009 for the wet season and from 2009 to 2013 for the dry season all changes are amplified by the lowess lines which show a continuous increase in eta for the central bahamas in both wet and dry seasons fig 4 slight dips are observed in the beginning of the series in the lowess line likely as a function of the small sample size lowess lines and overall volumes of precipitation fig 4 indicate some upward and downward trends within each season it should be noted that the average annual calculations for the pre change point precipitation considered all years from 1960 up until the change point though no significant change occurred outside the range of variability for the data any decreasing or increasing trends within the dataset can make a significant difference in the amount of available water for the season and ultimately the water year significant trends mostly occur in the central and southern bahamas where in the wet season decreases in precipitation have been occurring while eta increases which is likely temperature driven this opposite trend is seen in the dry season where slight increases in precipitation are observed with coincident increases in eta which is likely driven by increases in water availability all eta increases were due to evaporation from water surfaces for all regions with some statistically significant increases in canopy evaporation for the wet and dry seasons for all regions except the south during the wet season fig 5 the largest increases were observed in water evaporation where with minimal increases in canopy evaporation no statistically significant changes were seen in evaporation from soil and transpiration in any region overall yearly water availability showed initial reductions but remained stable for the northern and southern bahamas but steady declines were observed for the central region fig 6 though annual water budgets can mask the timing of recharge see discussion they provide a good indication of overall water availability and thus are commonly used as indicators of overall island aridity vacher and wallis 1992 the annual p et values show a significant uptick in 2007 for the central and southern bahamas which came from a particularly devastating tropical system noel that passed slowly over this region of the archipelago noel likely added an additional 400 mm of rain for that year which may have influenced the lowess trend lines resulting in upticks followed by downward trends in the central bahamas however even removing the rainfall amount contributed by noel in 2007 the central portion of the bahamas would have still had a more positive water balance than in recent years 4 3 bahamian eta trends relative to global anomalies trends in eta across the bahamas match or exceed rates of global eta fig 7 eta across the whole bahamas specifically the northern and southern regions are similar to the rate of global increases in eta the central region however shows increasing eta higher than global rates global eta trends also show a breakpoint around 2009 which is coincident with dry season increases in eta for the bahamas which saw significant eta increases between 2008 and 2009 followed by increases in eta during the dry season around 2010 the comparison of eta changes with respect to glst s indicates that increases in eta is not entirely temperature driven but likely due to shifts in precipitation patterns which can drive higher or lower eta depending on water availability changes 5 discussion young carbonate platforms that form the bahamian archipelago are characterized by high matrix porosity and permeability because it has not yet undergone significant diagenetic processes ford and williams 2013 gulley et al 2013 the high permeability of the bahamian islands accelerates rainfall infiltration at the land surface causing a lack of surface water with the exception of blue holes or topographically low surface areas that are filled with water from raised water tables that are influenced by sea level fluctuations martin et al 2013 gulley et al 2012 the lakes that exist are typically brackish to hypersaline waters due to high potential et rates exceeding rainfall whitaker and smart 2007 vacher and wallis 1992 along with limited surface waters the lack of surface drainage and little to negligible runoff to depressional lakes supports using p et as an approximation of effective recharge in the water budget which has been assumed by other water resource studies in the region vacher and wallis 1992 gulley et al 2016 current and historical periods of increasing aridity in the bahamas have been noted and likely are a result of changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation one of the more intense historical hydrological droughts occurred in the holocene between 3300 and 2500 years b p the holocene drought was marked by significant changes in water budgets in the northern bahamas as evidenced from lake cores in abaco van hengstrum et al 2016 increases in marine tolerant ostracodes were observed which would have coincided with increases in salinity the drought was likely caused by decreasing precipitation due to a southward or westward expansion of the north atlantic subtropical high nash as a result of southern intertropical convergence zone itcz displacement modern analogues validate this claim as the yucatan experiences a climate gradient that has been definitively linked to displacement of the itcz on seasonal and decadal time scales furthermore recent caribbean dry period from 1979 to 1989 was preceded by intensification of the nash our contemporary analysis of increasing drought conditions mirrors results showing increasing aridity between 2013 and 2016 spanning over cuba and the antilles herrera et al 2016 our results confirm that a drought is indeed occurring though our changes to aridity were slightly earlier than 2013 as global warming intensifies changing atmospheric and subsequent ocean circulation will continue to change wattmeier and friarson 2018 amplified warming in the upper tropical troposphere can cause temperature gradients to increase from equator to pole resulting in hadley cell edge expansion the hadley cell expansion causes alterations to the itcz which may cause disruptions in water budgets across the bahamian archipelago a small shift in the itcz northward could cause an increase in precipitation and hurricane development within the bahamian archipelago however a large shift northward of the itcz can cause the zone of regional subsistence to change and cause a decrease in precipitation along the entire bahamian archipelago causing the area to trend towards an increasingly arid climate because the bahamas particularly the north are close to the contemporary edge of the hadley cell it is likely more sensitive to changes in hadley cell circulation then elsewhere along the caribbean with the warming of the subtropical landmasses seen in the early holocene and possibly in the future with anthropogenic forced warming the itcz could be drawn even more northward than seen in the recent past impacting the evaporation precipitation balance of the archipelago arbuszewski et al 2013 as continental fronts across north america increase in intensity and change in their frequency changes in water budgets may result that we cannot anticipate the bahamian archipelago being the closest of the caribbean islands to the subtropical jet stream are more impacted by the variation of the el niño southern oscillation enso moreso than the north atlantic oscillation nao which impact lower latitudes of the caribbean jury et al 2007 during el niño or warm phase of enso the subtropical jet stream strengthens and shifts south in the atlantic and overall atlantic hurricane activity is reduced gray 1984 during la niña or cold phases of enso along with neutral enso phases the opposite occurs and overall hurricane activity and precipitation will be increased in the atlantic o brien et al 1996 these hurricanes and precipitation patterns will be more impacted by the onset of a new enso phase in october than the decaying of a previous phase tartaglione et al 2003 the predictability of enso phases has improved substantially and the predictability of the precipitation in north america during the hemispherical winter will be linked to the current enso phase but the influences of different phases will be non linear and predicted patterns may not be precisely reflected in actual precipitation patterns li et al 2019 the impact of enso is often limited to locations found closer to the northern edge of the hadley cell and therefore the subtropical jet streams jury et al 2007 thus further analysis of other extremes and climatic shifts in other island settings would be warranted the seasonal shift in precipitation from wet to dry season and consistent increase in eta provide insight into how overall yearly water availability is changing and driving increasing aridity most recharge to the freshwater lens occurs during the wet season when intense and steady rainfalls drive infiltration after an island specific recharge threshold little et al 1973 budd 1984 jones and banner 2003 though rapid infiltration through roots and solution holes occur during most rainfall events mylroie and carew 1995 during the dry season rains are shorter and less intense which does not drive as much recharge into the freshwater lens leaving water to pond on the surface longer whereby much of the water can be evaporated eta is also lower than in dry season months primarily due to cooler temperatures the slight shift in precipitation seasonality coupled with an overall downward trend when accounting for hurricanes roebuck et al 2004 simultaneous with increasing eta suggest that water resource availability is on a negative trajectory the significance of increased evaporation directly from water also has implications for the freshwater lens dynamics and viability gulley et al 2016 lakes blue holes and wetlands on the bahamas are persistent features of the karst landscape segmenting the freshwater lens creating hydraulic lows that focus freshwater gradients martin et al 2012 as increases in water evaporation occur from these lakes further thinning and segmentation of the freshwater lens occurs driving more brackish aquifer conditions and depleting water resource faster than sea level rise the impacts of freshwater lens volume as a function of evapotranspiration have shown that the depletion of freshwater lens stores is a linear function of eta and thus increases in eta directly affect existing freshwater stores thus freshwater depletion is not only a function of reduced water availability but also from direct evaporation from the freshwater lens that occurs more readily gulley et al 2016 therefore increasing aridity not only reduces incoming available water but also more rapidly depletes existing freshwater though definitively linking the change in water budgets through the bahamas to anthropogenic causes is difficult given limited data to estimate long term eta from the islands analyzing both global eta and glst anomalies in comparison with local averages across the bahamas gives some insight into a potential link previous comparisons with contemporary episodes of aridity in the bahamas illustrate that the current trends may be more consequential as evidenced by increasing temperatures locally and globally fig 7 however in regions where shifting ocean currents and sea surface temperatures have a profound impact on climate from year to year such as the bahamas these areas may experience exacerbated effects as ocean currents temper variability in land surface and air temperatures resulting in compound heating effects the increasing eta trend in some areas of the bahamas particularly the central region observed in the last decade shows a rate that may be greater than global averages this indicates depletion of freshwater stores may occur more rapidly in small islands requiring more focus on changing water budget components though eta and precipitation generated using satellite data at the regional scale has been shown to be reliable analyzing island scale water budgets inherently produces greater uncertainty we aggregated regional data to produce regional analysis of water budgets based on climatic gradients and land surface dynamics however each island would be unique and have its own singular water management issues therefore further analyses on water budgets at the island scale should consider ground truthing eta and precipitation as necessary 6 conclusions we used satellite guided reanalysis precipitation and satellite derived eta to analyze trends in p et which is a fundamental control on island freshwater stores we found that increases in eta are a result of increases in temperature but also likely due to shifting precipitation which increases in water availability as climate change in the bahamas is historically been related to changes in hadley cell circulation patterns recent evidence suggests this could be a cause of aridity changes furthermore it was shown that eta throughout the bahamian archipelago chain is increasing at a rate higher than global average eta which may put the islands at a greater risk for water sustainability when compared to continental settings which are less influenced by ocean currents and marine conditions as tropical islands have a more tempered climate baseline land surface and water temperatures which affect eta rates are not as variable and could therefore be a cause of exacerbated eta in these island states key findings consistent with global trends et is increasing across the bahamas but at a higher rate particularly the central and southern regions cause of increasing et are likely driven by both increases in temperature and an increase in precipitation in the dry season and reduction of precipitation in the wet season reducing water available for recharge increasing overall water available for et majority of increases in et are due to direct water evaporation which has implications for freshwater lens thinning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
4531,agricultural water is of considerable interest to water managers and policymakers as irrigation particularly flood irrigation accounts for the largest portion of freshwater use however characterization of how and when flood applied water contributes to storage and adjacent surface water bodies via return flow remains limited particularly relative to the volume of studies addressing surface processes this study focuses on improving our understanding of return flow paths and explicitly quantifying subsurface return flow contributions using hydro geophysical observations coupled with a vadose zone transport flow model our approach which simulates return flow in agricultural fields in a small heavily instrumented field site in northern wyoming leverages daily measured values of evapotranspiration obtained from a large aperture scintillometer and atmospheric conditions and uses seismic data to characterize heterogeneous structure of the soil profiles at field scale we use these high resolution site specific datasets to parameterize a process based vadose zone flow model that quantifies hydrologic response to flood irrigation along the stream reach allowing us to identify return flow fluxes out of the fields using our approach we found that the majority of applied irrigation water 60 left the fields through subsurface flow paths while only 13 was consumed by vegetation subsurface runoff over less permeable soil layers governed by the subsurface structural characteristics was identified as the dominant subsurface flow process contributing to fluxes out of the fields importantly our findings about the importance of subsurface return flow paths nuance previous research which has emphasized surface flow paths by improving our understanding of return flow processes through a high resolution vadose zone model that leverages climatological geophysical and hydrological observations this study advances our understanding of return flow processes understanding how subsurface characteristics influence return flow generation in semi arid agriculturally productive regions will help managers and policy makers balance desires for improved

projected to double in the next 30 years siebert et al 2015 the predicted increase in agricultural demand is likely to increase stresses on freshwater availability in the near future jagermeyr et al 2015 currently crop irrigation constitutes 70 of global freshwater water extractions grafton et al 2018 though irrigated crops i e the plants themselves do not directly consume all of the water extracted for agriculture flood irrigation despite its lower efficiency is one of the most common irrigation methods used on a global scale fao 2014 because of its lower financial and energy costs in most flood irrigation applications water is diverted from local streams through ditches or pipes and water is applied on the fields using gravity driven overland flow however a portion of the water not consumed by the plants may eventually make it back to an adjacent stream or surface water body peck lovvorn 2001 jimenez martinez et al 2009 this water known as return flow plays an important role in the local water balance and in hydrologic budgets at a range of scales on a local scale the presence or absence of return flow can impact the ecological status of the riparian zone peck lovvorn

water management policies that reconcile increasing freshwater demands with finite freshwater resources quantification of return flows needs to be more universally incorporated into physical water budgets grafton et al 2018 although return flow has been the focus of a number of studies in the last 50 years e g thomas et al 1971 rao et al 1990 gosain et al 2005 incorporating this component in physical water balances remains challenging dewandel et al 2008 return flow is comprised of a surface and subsurface component the subsurface component is especially challenging to address as it requires information about soil structure and subsurface hydrologic processes classical methods to observe hydrologic processes at field scale and study the structure of the soil profile comprise of methods that use point scale methods such as soil moisture probes piezometers or tensiometers robinson et al 2008 mcnamara et al 2005 these methods are limited to observations in one point and require heavy instrumentation to be able to cover the study area other challenges associated with these methods are that the experiments themselves are invasive and could lead to disturbed field conditions and require spatial averaging between the point observations wetstein et al 1989 used a water budget analysis to quantify return flow in a finite difference model to incorporate flow in the saturated zone below the surface extensive field data were collected with monitoring wells stream and precipitation gages and lysimeters to quantify the local et component they found an annual average return flow of 72 with about 50 of the applied irrigation water returning before the end of the irrigation season and the remaining return flow re entering the system over the following 6 months other studies have represented return flow volumes in physical water balances by approximations based on sparse data assuming 20 40 of applied water returned back to adjacent surface water bodies mohan vijayalakshmi 2009 or used a combination of models and water balance results that lump subsurface processes kim et al 2009 lecina et al 2011 kim et al 2009 reported an average annual return flow of approximately 25 over four years in south korea s gicheon watershed about 56 of total return flow was attributed to quick return flow while the remaining 44 was delayed late season return flow lecina et al 2011 determined that 28 of applied water was not consumed by vegetation gordon et al 2020 measured key components of the water balance and identified 23 of the applied irrigation water to return to the adjacent stream and 43 of the water to be used by vegetation though they determined the return flow contribution they were not able to distinguish between surface and subsurface processes results from many of these studies were calculated on a seasonal and annual scale making it challenging to assess the temporal changes in surface and subsurface hydrologic processes that might happen over shorter time scales and affect return flow dynamics geophysical methods provide the opportunity to observe subsurface hydrologic processes and characterize subsurface structures they have been increasingly used during the last two decades to study near surface hydrologic processes the advantage of geophysical methods is that they are minimally invasive and can cover larger areas or profiles avoiding some complications that could arise when point measurements of soil characteristics or hydrological state variables are spatially upscaled kemna et al 2004 singha et al 2015 slater lesmes 2002 these methods can provide detailed information about subsurface structures that are necessary to accurately estimate return flow contributions to the local water balance previous studies did not incorporate spatially detailed information of the subsurface and focused on quantifying only surface return flow fluxes in detail and estimated subsurface return flow fluxes over larger time periods however this detailed information is necessary to quantify timing and volumes of the subsurface component which in some locations can be a significant contribution relative to total return flows wetstein et al 1989 claes et al 2019 2020 this detailed information about subsurface structure and processes combined in process based distributed hydrological models can be useful to assess hydrologic processes during flood irrigation and return flow fluxes from the fields to the local hydrologic cycle via subsurface flow paths voeller waren 1997 claes et al 2020 we are motivated by the small number of process based return flow studies to join measured hydrologic drivers in a process based vadose zone transport model process based hydrologic models have been used successfully to quantify the effectiveness of different irrigation strategies and their impact on local fluxes kandelous šimůnek 2010 abbasi et al 2004 gärdenäs et al 2006 claes et al 2020 successfully demonstrated that a vadose zone model coupled with detailed measurements can be used to represent return flow at the field scale and identify the governing hydrologic processes a question moving forward is how this detailed information about subsurface structure and subsurface hydrologic processes that are driven by flood irrigation can be used to quantify return flow fluxes at the reach scale and identify the dominant hydrologic drivers the objective of this study is 1 to assess the impact of flood irrigation on a local reach scale by quantifying both timing and volume of surface and subsurface return flow fluxes from the flood irrigated fields into the system and 2 to identify the drivers or processes that cause heterogeneity in return flow from these fields we present the results of this study modeling the local hydrological drivers and heterogeneous processes at field scale and link these results to observed local hydrological observations at the field and reach scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 location our study site is located about 15 km northeast of dubois wyoming usa in the foothills of the absaroka range 43 35 32 n 109 27 36 w the underlying local geology is identified as tertiary indian meadows formation a formation mostly consisting of claystone love 1939 love christiansen 1985 the four studied fields are adjacent to bear creek a tributary to the east fork of the wind river fig 1 a field 1a field 1b and field 2 are located on the right bank and field 3 on the opposite side of bear creek the primary vegetation on the four irrigated fields is timothy grass phleum pretense grown for winter fodder for wildlife by wyoming game and fish the irrigated fields have an average slope of 5 down towards the stream the riparian zone between the fields and bear creek extends in most of the reach between 5 and 25 m with vegetation composed of cottonwoods populus detoides willows salix and smaller shrubs flood irrigation of the fields is applied through gated irrigation pipe fig 1b irrigation water is diverted into an irrigation ditch upstream of our site north of stilling well 7 fig 1a which feeds into the irrigation pipes water is applied in a rotational system across all four fields water is applied for 24 h on each of field or field section on average two flooding events occur on each field before cutting and one event at the end of the irrigation season which extends into the middle of august depending on available water in bear creek under normal conditions only half of each field is irrigated at the time with the second half irrigated the following day field 1b field 2 and field 3 are irrigated by one irrigation pipe at the top of the field while field 1a is irrigated by 3 irrigation pipes that run parallel and are evenly distributed across the field perpendicular to the slope fig 1b the average length of irrigation pipe is approximately 140 m per 30 000 m2 of field for field 1a south and approximately 100 m per 30 000 m2 for the other fields table 1 this study builds on three previous studies at this site gordon et al 2020 developed an agricultural water balance they used surface nuclear magnetic resonance nmr measurements to define the increase in water content in the subsurface between the start and the end of the irrigation season this method is unique in that it is directly sensitive to the volume of water that is present in the subsurface the method applies an electromagnetic field that affects the spin magnetic moments of hydrogen atoms hertrich 2008 the signal strength is directly proportional to the volume of water in the subsurface these measurements allowed them to estimate that 18 of the applied irrigation water was stored in the soil profile over the course of an irrigation season claes et al 2019 studied wetting front movement during flood irrigation events they characterized the soil profile at this site based on borehole samples electrical resistivity and induced polarization measurements the profile consists of 3 layers with a top soil layer underlain by a loamy sand and a bottom layer of loam on top of the claystone they observed that under large pressure gradients during flooding boundaries between lithological zones in the soil profile controlled preferential flow pathways with subsurface run off occurring at these boundaries when saturation occurred claes et al 2020 studied how incorporation of the subsurface structural heterogeneity as derived from geophysical data and soil samples affect the ability of a vadose zone flow model to represent the subsurface hydrologic behavior as observed using time lapse geophysics they calibrated the vadose zone flow models for this site uphill part of field 1a north and field 2 and concluded that a 3 layer soil profile model with continuous layers provided overall the best representation of observed subsurface homogeneous and heterogeneous flow processes the study results indicated the claystone to be impermeable and no contribution from applied irrigation water was observed to impact changes in hydrologic status in this layer the study presented in this research article aims to combine this information in a process driven water balance for all the fields in this reach resulting in a quantification of the total return flow flux back to the system this is performed by upscaling and translating this information to the other fields based on other newly collected seismic data and combining the soil physical and structural information from claes et al 2019 and claes et al 2020 with measured hydro eco logical data 2 2 instrumentation precipitation was measured at the meteorological station on field 1a fig 1b along with other meteorological data this data was used to calculate the effective evapotranspiration et from scintillometer data measured over field 1a fig 2 a large aperture scintillometer kipp zonen 2015 was set up over field 1a with a path of 664 m fig 1b the scintillometer emits an electromagnetic wave at a wavelength of about 940 nm which is captured by a receiver on the other end of the field and measures changes in the refractive index of the atmosphere above the field the refractive index above the field was recorded as five minute averages detailed information about these measurements can be found in gordon et al 2020 and liu et al 2004 using measured meteorological structural parameters of temperature humidity air pressure and their relationship to the refractive index the effective et over the field was calculated from the energy balance and aggregated on a daily basis gordon et al 2020 wilson et al 2013 kipp zonen 2015 2 3 hydrogeophysical data 2 3 1 subsurface structural data a previous study at this site indicated that the combination of homogenous and heterogeneous flow processes in the subsurface during flood irrigation practices could be represented in vadose zone flow processes by a stratified model that included anisotropic flow claes et al 2020 seismic refraction data was therefore considered to be capable of capturing the necessary subsurface structural information particularly given the layered sedimentary structure at the site seismic refraction is based on the principle that acoustic p waves travel through different geological mediums with a different seismic velocity and is used to measure the first arrival of acoustic p waves traveling through the subsurface from a source to receivers placed at the surface schuck lange 2007 this method has been successfully used to characterize shallow subsurface structure leopold et al 2008 befus et al 2011 flinchum et al 2018 seismic refraction data were collected on seven representative transects throughout the study area fig 1a b the length of each refraction line was 142 5 m with a 1 5 m spacing between geophones and a 10 m hammer shot spacing first arrival energy and travel times were picked in dw tomo application in geogiga seismic pro 8 0 geogiga technology corp 2017 and inverted with the final images cropped based on the ray path coverage density two seismic lines each were collected for both hydrologic modeled profiles at field 1a two lines instead of one line were chosen to be able to cover the longer length of the profile sufficiently the first seismic line for each of these two profiles was located on the eastern side between the first and second irrigation pipe and the second line on the western side of the third irrigation pipe towards the stream these lines for field 1a north and south we did not cover the full length of the field with seismic data to fill this geological data gap we sampled from the layer thicknesses of the loamy sand layer on either side of this missing part of the profile as these were normal distributed these values were scaled to ensure that the gradient with which the loamy sand layer thins out towards downslope followed a similar behavior as on the other sections of the field and the surrounding fields the inverted data were visually interpreted to develop zoned structural profiles for the vadose zone at each field and used for input in the vadose zone transport model this interpretation was guided by previous work at this site that identified a layered soil subsurface structure on fields 1a and field 2 through borehole observations and electrical resistivity ert measurements claes et al 2020 the profiles at these fields consist of three layers a loamy sand layer underlies a sandy topsoil with a thickness of approximately 0 5 m this loamy sand layer has a varying thickness between 1 m and 3 m below the fields getting thinner towards the stream the bottom layer of the soil profile is a loam soil the seismic tomogram for field 1a north and field 2 were compared with more detailed structural information of the soil profile derived from electrical resistivity ert data collected by claes et al 2020 to align seismic velocities for each subsurface profile with layer boundaries comparing the seismic velocities of field 1a and field 2 with the profiles from claes et al 2020 suggested the boundary between the sandy loam and loam layer approximately corresponds to 350 m s detailed geophysical profiles for field 1a north and field 2 collected by claes et al 2019 indicated the bottom of the loam layer to be coinciding with a seismic velocity of 700 m s extracted direct push cores sampled by claes et al 2019 at this site reached a depth of refusal at the same level as the 700 m s velocity contour the same velocities were used to derive the boundaries between the different soil layers for each field because of the similarity in soil structure geological history of each field 2 3 2 hydrodynamic data along the northern profile in field 1a time lapse series of borehole nmr measurements were collected immediately before during and just after flooding of the field at the end of the irrigation season in 2016 and the start of 2017 claes et al 2019 this method is unique in that it is directly sensitive to the volume of water that is present in the subsurface without an external magnetic field spin magnetic moments are randomly oriented hertrich 2008 the method applies a secondary magnetic field that causes the spin magnetic moments of hydrogen atoms to align with a resulting small net magnetic moment along the field direction of the applied magnetic field when the signal is switched off the hydrogen atoms will return back to their original state generating a signal the strength of this signal is directly proportional to the volume of water in the subsurface more information about this method can be found in walsh et al 2013 although not all of these measurements were conducted in the same season as modeled in this study the measurements are still considered indicative of the subsurface hydrological behavior and can be compared with modeled hydrologic redistribution in the soil profile and storage of irrigation water in the subsurface 2 4 vadose zone flow model structure and transport processes hydrologic processes were simulated for each field using a 2d process based model approach the flow models use an unstructured grid for fields 1b field 2 and field 3 the grid sizes were 0 15 m near the surface increasing to 0 3 m near the bottom of the profile a larger grid size was used for both the southern and northern profile in field 1a due to the larger size of the profile and computational limitations for field 1a the overall grid size was 0 5 m tapering to 0 15 m near the interface between each soil layer for each field a layered subsurface structure to be used in the vadose zone transport model was developed from seismic profiles soil layer boundaries were directly copied between the seismic grid and the vadose zone flow model grid the soil layer type from the seismic velocity grid was translated to the closest vadose zone flow model grid the framework used to model the vadose zone transport processes included hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2012 which incorporates the following modified richards equation richards 1931 to describe flow in the vadose zone 1 θ t x i k k ij a h x j k iz a s where θ represents the volumetric water content s is a sink term h the pressure head and x and t are the spatial and temporal coordinates respectively k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and ka is the anisotropy tensor that accounts for directionality of the hydraulic conductivity in the soil profile both the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k and the soil volumetric water content θ are a function of the pressure head and the relationship between them can be described by the van genuchten mualem relationship van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 m 1 1 n w i t h n 1 3 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 4 s e h θ h θ r θ s θ r with θs and θr the saturated and residual water content respectively l is the pore connectivity parameter α and n are two fitting parameters ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and s is the relative saturation of the soil profile or layer the parameters for the 3 layered soil profiles were taken from claes et al 2020 they calibrated the saturated hydraulic conductivity values for each layer in field 1a together with the anisotropy factor to capture effectively the subsurface runoff processes subsurface above the less permeable loam layer for field 1a and field 2 the van genuchten mualem parameters for the 3 layers together with the anisotropy factor for hydraulic conductivity ka for the loamy sand middle layer are given in table 2 l was held constant at 0 5 for all layers 2 5 vadose zone flow model boundary conditions 2 5 1 irrigation irrigation water application through flood irrigation was simulated for all fields using an advancing constant head boundary at the top of the profile that moved downhill with a velocity of 2 5 m per 30 min for 24 h this method to emulate flood irrigation dynamics was based on the observations of claes et al 2019 with regards to surface runoff and subsequent ponding of irrigation water on top of the soil profile on field 1 and 2 the other fields showed similar vegetation patterns soil types and slopes towards the stream a rotational irrigation schedule similar to the applied irrigation strategy in the field was used fig 3 water application is rotated in 24 hour application periods between each field with two cycles application of irrigation water before cutting and one irrigation cycle at the end of the season field 1a north and field 1a south have 3 rows of gated pipe fig 1a this results in 3 irrigation events within 1 cycle distributed across the three lines of irrigation pipe first from the gated pipe at the top of the profile furthest away from the stream followed by the middle pipe and lastly from the pipe closest to the stream fig 3 the volume applied on each field was determined based on measured irrigation rates by claes et al 2019 water applied during 24 h of irrigation on field 1 was 124 m3 per m of irrigation pipe and 90 m3 per m length of pipe for field 2 as there were no measurements available for field 3 an average of both measurements was used as estimate of applied water on this field surface runoff was not directly simulated in the vadose zone transport model but rather was calculated as the difference between the simulated infiltrated volume of water under a constant head boundary of 1 cm on each field and the volume of water applied 2 5 2 evapotranspiration and precipitation hydrus 2d can incorporate time dependent boundary conditions such as et patterns and precipitation the measured daily values of precipitation and et were used as boundary conditions at the surface precipitation was not simulated on top of the profile in the locations when a constant head boundary was applied during irrigation water application the feddes 1978 root water uptake model embedded in hydrus 2d was used to simulate et processes by timothy grass as the objective of this study is to analyze the partitioning of applied irrigation water and subsurface return flow fluxes the modeled et fluxes needed to be close to the measured values the feddes model parameters associated with pasture vegetation were modified to represent the conditions under which the timothy grass was grown periodic flooding during the irrigation season conditions at which maximum transpiration was assumed to start were set to just below saturation values at 0 01 m h2o and the pressure at which transpiration started decreasing linearly was set to 6 m h2o with no transpiration to occur at 8 m h2o or below the roots were distributed in the top 1 2 1 4 m of the soil profile with the maximum root density at 0 2 m depth both the precipitation and evaporation boundary conditions were applied at the soil surface at all times except when irrigation occurred when water was ponding on top of the profile the boundary conditions changed from atmospheric boundary conditions which accommodates precipitation to a constant head boundary condition of 1 cm pressure 2 6 water balance for the field and site after a spin up period of 1 season applying a simulated irrigation schedule similar to the observed seasonal schedule hydrus 2d was used to simulate infiltration and flow and transport processes for each field irrigation cycles were simulated by applying the moving constant head boundary conditions as described earlier the atmospheric boundary conditions incorporated the measured et and precipitation data daily volumes of modeled et applied irrigation water and subsurface outflow were registered for each profile subsurface outflow was modeled through a seepage face on the downslope side of the profiles the storage component for each profile was calculated as the difference between the volume of water infiltrating into the profile and the volume simulated leaving the profile the water balance for each field was calculated by accumulating the fluxes modeled for each 2d profile over the season before the start of irrigation and after irrigation has ceased between may 15th and october 23rd to develop a water balance for each field and not just for the profile volumes per day fluxes were multiplied by the length of irrigation pipe that was used for irrigation water application to incorporate the logistic limitation of fields being irrigated half at a time over two days fluxes of each profile are twice multiplied by half of the length of irrigation pipe and aggregated with a one day shift 2 7 sensitivity and uncertainty uncertainty for the measured et values of 13 percent were based on uncertainty values reported by solignac et al 2009 infiltration is dependent on the volume of empty pore space in the soil layers below the ponding water claes et al 2020 found starting water contents at the beginning of the season in the subsurface to be normally distributed around a mean water content with a standard deviation of 0 05 volumetric water content rather than homogenous in the models to test the effect of this discrepancy on the total volume of water that infiltrates in the subsurface and the effect on the different components of the water balance 100 different starting models were constructed that varied in water contents before irrigation water was applied for each mesh element the starting water content was sampled from a normal distribution around the same starting water content as in the original hydrologic model with a standard deviation of 5 volumetric water content similar to the observed distribution by claes et al 2020 the change in water content for each mesh element during the simulated flood irrigation event was calculated and summed this was performed for each of the 100 models and a standard deviation was calculated to determine the effect of uncertainty on starting water contents and heterogeneity of the hydrologic starting conditions on the total volume of water that infiltrates during flood irrigation simulation the anisotropy factor which is the ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity was calibrated for the main conducting soil layer in the subsurface based on observed subsurface flow dynamics during flood irrigation events by claes et al 2020 the anisotropy factor was calibrated to a value of 45 however they also noted the low sensitivity to a change of this parameter for anisotropy values above a value of 25 only a marginal improvement of their objective function was obtained to test the effect of this insensitivity of the calibrated anisotropy factor between values of 25 45 on modeled fluxes over a complete field season a simulation of an irrigation season was conducted for field 1a south and field 2 where the anisotropy factor was changed from 45 to 25 3 results 3 1 model structure the seismic refraction p wave velocity contour lines were used to determine the interface between the loamy sand layer and the loam layer 350 m s and the interface between the loam and the tertiary confining layer 700 m s for each profile fig 4 at the top of the profile the vertical p wave velocity gradient was lower than below depths of 5 m where the gradient rapidly increases from 500 m s to 900 m s and higher the location of each seismic profile and coinciding hydrologic model profile is shown on fig 1a for field 1a south and north which are longer in length the profile structure in the hydrologic model was informed by the two seismic profiles for both the southern and northern profiles of field1a the loamy sand layer has a greater thickness upslope away from the stream left and thinned towards the bottom of the field right for the northern profile this loamy sand layer ended at 100 m before the bottom of the field x 60 from this location until the bottom of the field the profile only consists of the sandy topsoil of about 0 5 m directly on top of the loam layer field 1b and field 2 have both a similar structure of soil profile consisting of a 0 5 m thick sandy top soil above a loamy sand layer with a thickness of 4 5 m that thinned out to 2 3 m towards the bottom of the field the top of the loam layer in field 2 revealed terrace like features with a first terrace from 0 to 45 m a second from 45 m to 115 m and a third closer to the stream the topography of the loamy sand loam interface for both field 1b and field 2 slopes towards the stream for the first 50 m field 3 located on the other side of the stream has a similar soil profile structure as field 1a north both have a loamy sand layer that does not span the complete length of the profile but thins out and disappears towards the stream 3 2 water balance the modeled water balance varied among all fields table 3 the volume of water applied on field 1a south and field 1a north accounts for 55 of the total water applied on the site as it has also more irrigation pipe covering these fields this difference in applied water per field disappears if the volumes are normalized by area more water is applied per m2 on field 1a north than field 1a south as it had more irrigation pipe per surface area fig 1 table 1 subsurface flow leaving the fields was the largest component of the total water balance 60 3 while storage is the smallest 2 table 3 field 1a north and field 3 had the highest volume of water being stored in the soil profile with 4 and 6 respectively of the applied water on the field field 1b with 3 of applied water being stored meaning that the profile ended up slightly drier than at the start of the irrigation season between 73 and 82 of applied water infiltrated on all fields except field 1a north field 1a north only had 53 infiltrating while 47 leaving the field via direct runoff fields 2 and 3 had the highest et with 0 33 m and 0 34 m over the season this equates to 18 and 17 of applied water on each field compared with 10 12 for field 1a and field 1b table 3 the average et across the site is 0 27 m field 1a south had the lowest et 0 21 m field 1a north which had the lowest volume of water infiltrating in the profile and therefore most runoff 47 also had the lowest fraction of subsurface flow leaving the profile while runoff was 20 30 higher than the other fields subsurface flow leaving the system was 18 26 lower 3 2 1 direct surface runoff and subsurface flow paths the surface and subsurface responses differed in timing and amount over the irrigation season figs 5 and 6 direct surface runoff is the main hydrologic response during irrigation may 28 june 26 july 25 aug 4 after which the subsurface component takes over the subsurface became saturated during the irrigation events and gradually discharged water contributing to flow from the fields during harvest early july when no irrigation was applied and in the late season and fall after august 5th by the end of the last irrigation cycle the beginning of august the accumulated flow leaving the fields was approximately 40 subsurface flow and 30 direct runoff fig 6 the remaining 30 of applied irrigation water comprised et 10 and water that had infiltrated in the subsurface and was slowly moving via subsurface flow paths down slope or being stored from august until october 20 of the applied irrigation water left the fields via subsurface flow paths resulting in 60 of the total flow from the fields over the season being subsurface flow 3 2 2 storage the water balance for the site showed limited storage over the course of the season below field 1a north field 2 and field 3 with no storage occurring below the other two profiles table 3 in these three fields the storage within the profile was located at the interface between the loamy sand and loam layer fig 7 field 3 had the largest volume of storage 6 of total applied water 0 12 m over the irrigation season changes in water content in the profile of field 1b east of 100 m towards the stream and in the first 60 m of field 3 were considered to be numerical artifacts as these areas were only one mesh element thick at the interface between the loamy sand and loam layer 3 2 3 evapotranspiration the modeled et component of all fields followed the measured et until the last irrigation cycle fig 8 the low modeled et values at the start of the irrigation season increased rapidly once irrigation water was applied by the end of the first irrigation cycle the et values reached their maximum values of 7 mm day these values decreased towards the start of the 2nd irrigation period but increased again once irrigation water was applied up to 5 mm day fields 2 and field 3 had higher fractions of the applied irrigation water converted to et table 3 the difference between modeled and potential et was smaller for these two fields in the late season however during the second part of the season after irrigation had ceased modeled et was consistently lower than the observed fig 8 at this point in the simulation the dry soil moisture conditions in the root zone resulted in a decrease in modeled transpiration 3 2 4 ancillary hydrodynamic data borehole nmr measurements performed before during and after the application of flood irrigation at field 1a north at the end of the irrigation season in 2016 and the start of the irrigation season in 2017 claes et al 2019 demonstrated the flooding and redistribution dynamics around well 1 in field 1a north fig 9 a although these measurements were not made during the simulated irrigation season the starting conditions and following redistribution processes are considered being representative for the hydrodynamic behavior below field 1a north at the start of the season in 2017 fig 9b the soil profile was dry after having drained over the winter season during irrigation the wetting front reaches a depth of 7 m below the surface only after irrigation ceased and redistribution processes had occurred did the lower portion of the profile become saturated similar responses in redistribution were observed for both irrigation experiments the immediate redistribution after irrigation had ceased indicating that antecedent moisture conditions did not affect this response redistribution and drainage caused the boundary between the saturated and unsaturated zones to move to a depth of 3 2 3 5 m in the 2 days following irrigation hydrologic model results for the boundary between the saturated and unsaturated zones around the first fig 9b and last irrigation cycle fig 9a in the season compare well with those observed with the borehole nmr measurements the boundary position at the start of each experiments is similar for the observed and modeled profile and the model results after 1 day of infiltration showed a fully saturated profile for 2016 there is only 0 15 m difference in modeled and observed boundary position after 1 day of irrigation however modeled redistribution and drainage of the infiltrated water two days after irrigation showed that the boundary did not move as fast down in the profile as observed a difference of 0 25 m for the irrigation cycle at the start of the season in june 2017 fig 9b and 1 2 m at the end of the season in july 2016 fig 9a 3 3 sensitivity analysis of anisotropy factor for saturated hydraulic conductivity here we assess the effect of changing the anisotropy factor ka to 25 instead of 45 on each component of the water balance for field 1a south and field 2 table 4 the total volume of flow leaving the fields through subsurface pathways was slightly higher for both fields when the higher values for anisotropy were used in the model the effect on the change in subsurface return flow for field 1a south is approximately 1 of the total volume of applied water while the effect on field 2 was 10 table 4 the total volume of applied water that left the field by either subsurface processes or surface runoff was similar with both factors of anisotropy table 4 although the hydrologic parameters of the top layer were not changed infiltration was affected by the different anisotropy factor with a lower percentage of water infiltrating with the smaller the anisotropy factor a smaller volume of infiltrated irrigation water resulted in higher runoff volumes and lower volumes of water moving through the subsurface a higher anisotropy factor resulted in faster redistribution or draining of the profile towards the stream this faster redistribution caused a larger volume of empty pore space to be available at the start of the following irrigation cycle and less water to be diverted as surface runoff when using a smaller anisotropy factor the subsurface fluxes followed a smoother trend over time in comparison with the higher anisotropy factor fig 10 with a constant hydraulic conductivity value but a lower anisotropy factor the resistance to horizontal flow in the loamy sand layer is higher resulting in a slower hydrologic response i e lateral flow over the interface between the less permeable loam layer at the bottom of the loamy sand layer by the end of the simulation period on october 27th the total volume returned via subsurface processes for field 1a south was nearly similar for both anisotropy factors the difference in cumulative outflow for field 2 was larger we attribute this primarily to the difference in infiltrated volume relative to applied water which was higher for field 2 than field 1a south and changed from 79 to 73 table 4 resulting in less water contributing to subsurface hydrologic processes additionally field 2 had a nearly horizontal interface between the loam and loamy sand layer over which subsurface runoff occurs this difference resulted in a lower gradient driving force this lower topographic gradient in combination with the lower anisotropy factor resulted in slower subsurface outflow it takes longer time for the water to reach the end of the profile with a lower anisotropy factor potentially resulting in water leaving the profile after the simulation period 4 discussion 4 1 water balance 4 1 1 irrigation the total volume of applied water measured at this site over the 2015 irrigation season was 1 098 000 m3 gordon et al 2020 the uncertainty estimated on this measurement was 8 121 000 m3 the rotational scheme of irrigation water application used to model application of irrigation water led to a total volume of applied water of 983 002 m3 which is within the measurement uncertainty the exact rotation of each field may change each irrigation year though the application rates and durations remain similar however the irrigation season may end earlier in dry years resulting in a decrease in total volume applied to accurately quantify direct input from each field to flow into the riparian zones and the streams we recognize that an improved quantification of applied water and timing is required however as the soil profile structure and hydrologic drivers are informed by geophysical measurements lab analysis and hydrologic measurements we do consider the model predictions to be representative for an irrigation season at this site 4 1 2 return flow we found that by the end of the irrigation season the total accumulated modeled water from all the fields leaving by surface runoff and subsurface flow paths was approximately 89 of applied water the sum of the returned volumes via runoff and subsurface processes accounted for 29 and 60 respectively of the total applied irrigation water over the site due to differences in the soil profile structure we found differences in the partitioning of return flow pathways among fields approximately 50 of the applied water left the irrigated fields via subsurface flow paths and surface runoff by the middle of july fig 6 when harvesting occurred followed by 15 before the last harvest an additional 20 of the applied water flowed out of the fields after the last application of flood irrigation this estimate of late season return flow is similar to the late season return flow estimate for this similar site by gordon et al 2020 who based their estimate on an agricultural water balance however it is difficult to determine what portion of the water leaving the fields actually returned to the stream and what fraction remained in the riparian zone either as near surface storage or used as riparian et wetstein et al 1989 found that about 10 of return flow occurred in the late season in the new fork their modeling study did not incorporate a riparian zone component as it was negligible compared to the area of the irrigated fields peck lovvorn 2001 found that 65 from their studied wetlands received direct inflows from flood irrigated lands half of this inflow was from direct runoff that was rerouted via ditches to the wetlands while the other half occurred via subsurface pathways similar to the peck and lovvorn 2001 study a portion of the return flow in our site is routed through surface ditches to the riparian area in particular surface flow that leaves irrigated portions of field 1a north and field 1b and part of field 3 is collected in catch ditches at the bottom of the field and diverted to the riparian zone fig 1 comparing the daily values of total flow from the fields and surface runoff fig 5 with the measured values of return flow by gordon 2016 in the stream fig 11 shows that the timing of increased flows leaving the fields towards the stream is similar the measured values during irrigation periods are of the same order of magnitude as the modeled return flows out of the fields with values around 0 2 0 3 m3 s in the end of june and beginning of july and 0 15 m3 s during the last irrigation in august during these times of irrigation the contribution of surface runoff is important the peaks of 0 4 m3 s during a short period in the middle of june is attributed to snowmelt from areas higher in watershed at this time lower areas of the riparian zones were being flooded by stream water due to high river stage and water bypassed measurement stations not all of the irrigation water leaving the fields is return flow to the stream a large portion of this water will be routed through the riparian zone and may be lost to et in the riparian zone before making it to the stream temporal storage or et in the riparian zone lupon et al 2016 can reduce the contribution from these flows from the fields to the streams and result in only limited contribution to base flow after the irrigation season has ceased based on an agricultural water budget calculated by gordon et al 2020 23 11 of the applied irrigation water was used by et in the riparian zone applying this fraction on the total volume of water that flowed via surface or subsurface pathways from the modeled fields 89 under the assumption that all water passes first through the riparian zone before entering the stream would result in 66 of applied water returning back to the stream 4 1 3 evapotranspiration the modeled values for each field followed a similar trend at the start of the irrigation season fig 8 during the second part of the season when irrigation had ended and the near surface hydrologic conditions below the fields became drier the model results deviated from the observed et values at the start of the irrigation season when et rates were low with daily rates of 1 4 mm day the modeled rates followed measured rates fig 8 however after haying and before the last irrigation event when the soil moisture in the profile had decreased et rates in the model start fig 8 deviating from observed rates fig 2 modeled values of et for timothy grass in late season were lower for all fields than the observed values the observed values as reported by gordon et al 2020 could be affected by the vegetation in the riparian zones around the fields the footprint of the scintillometer meant that some interference could have been picked up from the riparian vegetation however it is important to note that the modeled et on any field would never exceed the measured et that is used to inform the et component in the flow model even under optimal hydrologic conditions in the model this is because the potential evapotranspiration that hydrus requires as input was informed by the effective evapotranspiration measured at the field 4 1 4 surface runoff while surface runoff on most of the fields was between 18 and 27 of the water applied field 1a north had a higher percentage of runoff with 47 of the applied irrigation water leaving the field via surface runoff this can be explained by the soil profile of field 1a north towards the downhill part of field 1a north the loamy sand layer thinned out and disappeared fig 4 resulting in the 0 5 m sandy top soil directly underlain by a low permeable loam layer water moved slower into this layer during irrigation and once irrigation ceased redistribution processes happened at a slower rate the absence of the loamy sand layer in the middle of the soil profile resulted in a slower draining process the effect of this is that at the start of the second and third irrigation cycle less pore space was drained and available for infiltrating water this resulted in more run off and less infiltration in the 24 h of flooding during the 2nd and 3rd irrigation cycle surface runoff was not directly simulated in the vadose zone transport model and is a source of uncertainty and error in the total modeled water balance of the site the approximation based on the difference between measured applied water and modeled infiltrated water disregards the possibility that runoff might infiltrate on other sections of the fields due to lateral heterogeneities in infiltration capacity or is lost out of the system as evaporation during the short time water is moving as overland flow other studies accounted for runoff dynamics by incorporation of saint venant equations e g köhne et al 2011 the continuous application of water running of over the profile with a moving wetting front and evaporation occurring would require an update to current available boundary conditions in hydrus which lies outside of the scope of this study we do not expect that changing the boundary conditions to represent the flooding process would improve estimates of the portion of infiltrated water and surface runoff as the boundary conditions as they were modeled now are based on measured wetting front movements and field observations and updating them would be based on approximate representations 4 2 subsurface structure and its implications for subsurface return flow processes to model the hydrological processes in the subsurface at field scale information about subsurface structural heterogeneity is necessary some of the processes such as subsurface run off over less permeable layers is driven by these structural heterogeneities claes et al 2019 the seismic refraction data collected along the hydrologic data allowed for upscaling of these structural characteristics from plot to field scale and incorporate them into the vadose zone transport model profiles for each field to delineate the layers layer boundaries based on resistivity profiles by claes et al 2020 were compared with measured seismic velocities the seismic velocities were similar to the ones reported by flinchum et al 2018 and befus et al 2011 which indicated the bottom of the soil profile to be located around the 700 900 m s contour although these delineations were determined in other geologic settings other studies and literature sources revealed similar values for glacial and sedimentary deposits odum et al 2004 reynolds 2011 the overall structure of the soil profiles in each field were similar with a 3 layer structure as expected in fields in close proximity and with the same geology and management however using the seismic data we were also able to discern differences in soil profile details and layer thicknesses below each field incorporation of these differences in subsurface structure in the hydrologic model gives us a means to evaluate their impact on the hydrological processes that occur during and after flood irrigation storage of irrigated water occurs on top of the interface between the loamy sand and loam layer and is directed by the topography of this interface comparing storage of irrigation water in the subsurface of field 1a north fig 7 and the profile structure fig 4 indicates that the stored irrigation water is located in topographical depressions at this interface gravity driven run off after irrigation has ceased is delayed by these depressions and cause temporary storage similar to how hillslope topography and subsurface structure can impact flow path development and storage ticehurst et al 2007 surface nmr measurements were collected before the start of the irrigation season and october at the end of the season at the surface of field 1a north fig 1a these measurements presented by gordon et al 2020 showed an increase in water content at a depth between 6 and 8 m below the surface of this profile at the interface between the loamy sand and loam layer model results for field 1a north as presented on fig 7 were for the same area as the surface nmr measurement converted to 1d results by spatial averaging these results indicated an increase in water content at a depth between 4 5 and 8 m below the surface fig 12 this area in the profile is located just below the interface between the loamy sand and loam layer surface nuclear magnetic resonance measurements showed no change in hydrologic status over the course of an irrigation season below the depths of the 700 m s seismic contour indicating that the mudstone layer is indeed a confining layer it is possible that the field scale resolution 0 75 m of these data as applied in the model can miss subsurface details that can potentially influence vadose zone transport processes at smaller scales such as macropores 0 020 mm 1 mm beven germann 1982 however claes et al 2020 found that inclusion of small scale structural characteristics was not necessary to model the governing hydrologic processes observed during flood irrigation in this setting the small difference between modeled and observed behavior of the wetting front as shown in fig 9 indicates that under flooding conditions when a large hydraulic pressure is present macropores and small scale heterogeneities do not affect the local hydrologic processes once redistribution started to occur the pressure gradient that was driving infiltration disappeared and small local differences in soil properties could play an important role in the redistribution process hillel 1980 because the representation of each soil layer in our model did not include heterogeneity of soil properties redistribution processes that may happen at smaller scale were not represented or accounted for in this model details of soil structure or variability of soil parameters at small scale which might impact local hydrologic behavior at shorter time intervals nielsen et al 1973 were potentially averaged out in this coarser hydrologic representation this could explain the discrepancy between the modeled and observed boundary between the unsaturated and saturated zone fig 9 the modeled draining of the profile at longer temporal scale compares well with the observations of the boundary between the unsaturated and saturated zone at the start of the last irrigation cycle in 2016 fig 9a 4 3 transferability of the method the limited body of return flow literature makes it challenging to compare this study to similar studies involving flood irrigation however flood irrigation on a hillslope underlain by a confining layer can be conceptualized as storm processes on a hillslope underlain by bedrock under these circumstances the subsurface run off processes are governed by bedrock topography troch et al 2003 freer et al 2002 the combination of structural geophysical data and detailed vadose zone flow models provides a way forward to being able to represent these topography driven processes in physical models and address the question about timing and delay of return flows at field and reach scale this study demonstrates that subsurface flow paths potentially facilitate the return of more than 60 of the applied irrigation water back to the system table 3 in areas with an undulating confining layer subsurface storage of irrigation water can happen in local topographic depressions in this layer this subsurface storage was located in the uphill parts of the profiles on the landscape the relatively small percent of storage of irrigation water 2 was in contrast with gordon et al 2020 who estimated 18 storage in the soil profile gordon et al 2020 used surface nmr measurements below field 1a north to calculate the volume of irrigation water stored below the surface fig 9a the advantage of this method is that it is directly sensitive to the volume of water below the surface hertrich 2008 behroozmand et al 2015 the disadvantage is that it provides only a laterally integrated 1d measurement of water content as a function of depth below the instruments location the vadose zone flow model developed in this study demonstrated that storage did occur at the location of the surface nmr measurements on field 1a north fig 7 however the model results indicated that storage was not continuous across the length of the field this shows the strength of using subsurface characteristics based on multiple geophysical observations in a distributed physical based vadose zone transport model to characterize subsurface transport processes for return flow studies 5 conclusion combining field observations of hydrologic changes in the subsurface with geophysical data of soil structure at field scale in a process based model enabled us to address the question of the timing and volume of hydrologic response of flood irrigated fields by including hydrogeophysical data in addition to the hydrologic observations we were able to reveal subsurface flow dynamics and identify preferential flow mechanisms as important contributors to fluxes out of the fields under flood irrigation management a loamy sand layer located below the top soil above a less permeable layer was identified as important factor determining the partitioning between direct run off and subsurface flows over this less permeable layer the majority of applied water was found to leave the fields by the end of the irrigation season at this site with 89 of applied water leaving the irrigated fields as surface runoff or via subsurface flow paths runoff and subsurface processes accounted for 29 and 60 respectively of the total applied irrigation water over the site with 20 of the applied irrigation water flowing from the fields after the last application of flood irrigation in addition this study also pointed out that hydrologic fluxes from agricultural fields under flood irrigation not only contribute to stream flow but also contribute to local riparian zones and wetlands credit authorship contribution statement n claes conceptualization methodology

4531,agricultural water is of considerable interest to water managers and policymakers as irrigation particularly flood irrigation accounts for the largest portion of freshwater use however characterization of how and when flood applied water contributes to storage and adjacent surface water bodies via return flow remains limited particularly relative to the volume of studies addressing surface processes this study focuses on improving our understanding of return flow paths and explicitly quantifying subsurface return flow contributions using hydro geophysical observations coupled with a vadose zone transport flow model our approach which simulates return flow in agricultural fields in a small heavily instrumented field site in northern wyoming leverages daily measured values of evapotranspiration obtained from a large aperture scintillometer and atmospheric conditions and uses seismic data to characterize heterogeneous structure of the soil profiles at field scale we use these high resolution site specific datasets to parameterize a process based vadose zone flow model that quantifies hydrologic response to flood irrigation along the stream reach allowing us to identify return flow fluxes out of the fields using our approach we found that the majority of applied irrigation water 60 left the fields through subsurface flow paths while only 13 was consumed by vegetation subsurface runoff over less permeable soil layers governed by the subsurface structural characteristics was identified as the dominant subsurface flow process contributing to fluxes out of the fields importantly our findings about the importance of subsurface return flow paths nuance previous research which has emphasized surface flow paths by improving our understanding of return flow processes through a high resolution vadose zone model that leverages climatological geophysical and hydrological observations this study advances our understanding of return flow processes understanding how subsurface characteristics influence return flow generation in semi arid agriculturally productive regions will help managers and policy makers balance desires for improved

projected to double in the next 30 years siebert et al 2015 the predicted increase in agricultural demand is likely to increase stresses on freshwater availability in the near future jagermeyr et al 2015 currently crop irrigation constitutes 70 of global freshwater water extractions grafton et al 2018 though irrigated crops i e the plants themselves do not directly consume all of the water extracted for agriculture flood irrigation despite its lower efficiency is one of the most common irrigation methods used on a global scale fao 2014 because of its lower financial and energy costs in most flood irrigation applications water is diverted from local streams through ditches or pipes and water is applied on the fields using gravity driven overland flow however a portion of the water not consumed by the plants may eventually make it back to an adjacent stream or surface water body peck lovvorn 2001 jimenez martinez et al 2009 this water known as return flow plays an important role in the local water balance and in hydrologic budgets at a range of scales on a local scale the presence or absence of return flow can impact the ecological status of the riparian zone peck lovvorn

budgets grafton et al 2018 although return flow has been the focus of a number of studies in the last 50 years e g thomas et al 1971 rao et al 1990 gosain et al 2005 incorporating this component in physical water balances remains challenging dewandel et al 2008 return flow is comprised of a surface and subsurface component the subsurface component is especially challenging to address as it requires information about soil structure and subsurface hydrologic processes classical methods to observe hydrologic processes at field scale and study the structure of the soil profile comprise of methods that use point scale methods such as soil moisture probes piezometers or tensiometers robinson et al 2008 mcnamara et al 2005 these methods are limited to observations in one point and require heavy instrumentation to be able to cover the study area other challenges associated with these methods are that the experiments themselves are invasive and could lead to disturbed field conditions and require spatial averaging between the point observations wetstein et al 1989 used a water budget analysis to quantify return flow in a finite difference model to incorporate flow in the saturated zone below the surface extensive field data were collected with monitoring wells stream and precipitation gages and lysimeters to quantify the local et component they found an annual average return flow of 72 with about 50 of the applied irrigation water returning before the end of the irrigation season and the remaining return flow re entering the system over the following 6 months other studies have represented return flow volumes in physical water balances by approximations based on sparse data assuming 20 40 of applied water returned back to adjacent surface water bodies mohan vijayalakshmi 2009 or used a combination of models and water balance results that lump subsurface processes kim et al 2009 lecina et al 2011 kim et al 2009 reported an average annual return flow of approximately 25 over four years in south korea s gicheon watershed about 56 of total return flow was attributed to quick return flow while the remaining 44 was delayed late season return flow lecina et al 2011 determined that 28 of applied water was not consumed by vegetation gordon et al 2020 measured key components of the water balance and identified 23 of the applied irrigation water to return to the adjacent stream and 43 of the water to be used by vegetation though they determined the return flow contribution they were not able to distinguish between surface and subsurface processes results from many of these studies were calculated on a seasonal and annual scale making it challenging to assess the temporal changes in surface and subsurface hydrologic processes that might happen over shorter time scales and affect return flow dynamics geophysical methods provide the opportunity to observe subsurface hydrologic processes and characterize subsurface structures they have been increasingly used during the last two decades to study near surface hydrologic processes the advantage of geophysical methods is that they are minimally invasive and can cover larger areas or profiles avoiding some complications that could arise when point measurements of soil characteristics or hydrological state variables are spatially upscaled kemna et al 2004 singha et al 2015 slater lesmes 2002 these methods can provide detailed information about subsurface structures that are necessary to accurately estimate return flow contributions to the local water balance previous studies did not incorporate spatially detailed information of the subsurface and focused on quantifying only surface return flow fluxes in detail and estimated subsurface return flow fluxes over larger time periods however this detailed information is necessary to quantify timing and volumes of the subsurface component which in some locations can be a significant contribution relative to total return flows wetstein et al 1989 claes et al 2019 2020 this detailed information about subsurface structure and processes combined in process based distributed hydrological models can be useful to assess hydrologic processes during flood irrigation and return flow fluxes from the fields to the local hydrologic cycle via subsurface flow paths voeller waren 1997 claes et al 2020 we are motivated by the small number of process based return flow studies to join measured hydrologic drivers in a process based vadose zone transport model process based hydrologic models have been used successfully to quantify the effectiveness of different irrigation strategies and their impact on local fluxes kandelous šimůnek 2010 abbasi et al 2004 gärdenäs et al 2006 claes et al 2020 successfully demonstrated that a vadose zone model coupled with detailed measurements can be used to represent return flow at the field scale and identify the governing hydrologic processes a question moving forward is how this detailed information about subsurface structure and subsurface hydrologic processes that are driven by flood irrigation can be used to quantify return flow fluxes at the reach scale and identify the dominant hydrologic drivers the objective of this study is 1 to assess the impact of flood irrigation on a local reach scale by quantifying both timing and volume of surface and subsurface return flow fluxes from the flood irrigated fields into the system and 2 to identify the drivers or processes that cause heterogeneity in return flow from these fields we present the results of this study modeling the local hydrological drivers and heterogeneous processes at field scale and link these results to observed local hydrological observations at the field and reach scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 location our study site is located about 15 km northeast of dubois wyoming usa in the foothills of the absaroka range 43 35 32 n 109 27 36 w the underlying local geology is identified as tertiary indian meadows formation a formation mostly consisting of claystone love 1939 love christiansen 1985 the four studied fields are adjacent to bear creek a tributary to the east fork of the wind river fig 1 a field 1a field 1b and field 2 are located on the right bank and field 3 on the opposite side of bear creek the primary vegetation on the four irrigated fields is timothy grass phleum pretense grown for winter fodder for wildlife by wyoming game and fish the irrigated fields have an average slope of 5 down towards the stream the riparian zone between the fields and bear creek extends in most of the reach between 5 and 25 m with vegetation composed of cottonwoods populus detoides willows salix and smaller shrubs flood irrigation of the fields is applied through gated irrigation pipe fig 1b irrigation water is diverted into an irrigation ditch upstream of our site north of stilling well 7 fig 1a which feeds into the irrigation pipes water is applied in a rotational system across all four fields water is applied for 24 h on each of field or field section on average two flooding events occur on each field before cutting and one event at the end of the irrigation season which extends into the middle of august depending on available water in bear creek under normal conditions only half of each field is irrigated at the time with the second half irrigated the following day field 1b field 2 and field 3 are irrigated by one irrigation pipe at the top of the field while field 1a is irrigated by 3 irrigation pipes that run parallel and are evenly distributed across the field perpendicular to the slope fig 1b the average length of irrigation pipe is approximately 140 m per 30 000 m2 of field for field 1a south and approximately 100 m per 30 000 m2 for the other fields table 1 this study builds on three previous studies at this site gordon et al 2020 developed an agricultural water balance they used surface nuclear magnetic resonance nmr measurements to define the increase in water content in the subsurface between the start and the end of the irrigation season this method is unique in that it is directly sensitive to the volume of water that is present in the subsurface the method applies an electromagnetic field that affects the spin magnetic moments of hydrogen atoms hertrich 2008 the signal strength is directly proportional to the volume of water in the subsurface these measurements allowed them to estimate that 18 of the applied irrigation water was stored in the soil profile over the course of an irrigation season claes et al 2019 studied wetting front movement during flood irrigation events they characterized the soil profile at this site based on borehole samples electrical resistivity and induced polarization measurements the profile consists of 3 layers with a top soil layer underlain by a loamy sand and a bottom layer of loam on top of the claystone they observed that under large pressure gradients during flooding boundaries between lithological zones in the soil profile controlled preferential flow pathways with subsurface run off occurring at these boundaries when saturation occurred claes et al 2020 studied how incorporation of the subsurface structural heterogeneity as derived from geophysical data and soil samples affect the ability of a vadose zone flow model to represent the subsurface hydrologic behavior as observed using time lapse geophysics they calibrated the vadose zone flow models for this site uphill part of field 1a north and field 2 and concluded that a 3 layer soil profile model with continuous layers provided overall the best representation of observed subsurface homogeneous and heterogeneous flow processes the study results indicated the claystone to be impermeable and no contribution from applied irrigation water was observed to impact changes in hydrologic status in this layer the study presented in this research article aims to combine this information in a process driven water balance for all the fields in this reach resulting in a quantification of the total return flow flux back to the system this is performed by upscaling and translating this information to the other fields based on other newly collected seismic data and combining the soil physical and structural information from claes et al 2019 and claes et al 2020 with measured hydro eco logical data 2 2 instrumentation precipitation was measured at the meteorological station on field 1a fig 1b along with other meteorological data this data was used to calculate the effective evapotranspiration et from scintillometer data measured over field 1a fig 2 a large aperture scintillometer kipp zonen 2015 was set up over field 1a with a path of 664 m fig 1b the scintillometer emits an electromagnetic wave at a wavelength of about 940 nm which is captured by a receiver on the other end of the field and measures changes in the refractive index of the atmosphere above the field the refractive index above the field was recorded as five minute averages detailed information about these measurements can be found in gordon et al 2020 and liu et al 2004 using measured meteorological structural parameters of temperature humidity air pressure and their relationship to the refractive index the effective et over the field was calculated from the energy balance and aggregated on a daily basis gordon et al 2020 wilson et al 2013 kipp zonen 2015 2 3 hydrogeophysical data 2 3 1 subsurface structural data a previous study at this site indicated that the combination of homogenous and heterogeneous flow processes in the subsurface during flood irrigation practices could be represented in vadose zone flow processes by a stratified model that included anisotropic flow claes et al 2020 seismic refraction data was therefore considered to be capable of capturing the necessary subsurface structural information particularly given the layered sedimentary structure at the site seismic refraction is based on the principle that acoustic p waves travel through different geological mediums with a different seismic velocity and is used to measure the first arrival of acoustic p waves traveling through the subsurface from a source to receivers placed at the surface schuck lange 2007 this method has been successfully used to characterize shallow subsurface structure leopold et al 2008 befus et al 2011 flinchum et al 2018 seismic refraction data were collected on seven representative transects throughout the study area fig 1a b the length of each refraction line was 142 5 m with a 1 5 m spacing between geophones and a 10 m hammer shot spacing first arrival energy and travel times were picked in dw tomo application in geogiga seismic pro 8 0 geogiga technology corp 2017 and inverted with the final images cropped based on the ray path coverage density two seismic lines each were collected for both hydrologic modeled profiles at field 1a two lines instead of one line were chosen to be able to cover the longer length of the profile sufficiently the first seismic line for each of these two profiles was located on the eastern side between the first and second irrigation pipe and the second line on the western side of the third irrigation pipe towards the stream these lines for field 1a north and south we did not cover the full length of the field with seismic data to fill this geological data gap we sampled from the layer thicknesses of the loamy sand layer on either side of this missing part of the profile as these were normal distributed these values were scaled to ensure that the gradient with which the loamy sand layer thins out towards downslope followed a similar behavior as on the other sections of the field and the surrounding fields the inverted data were visually interpreted to develop zoned structural profiles for the vadose zone at each field and used for input in the vadose zone transport model this interpretation was guided by previous work at this site that identified a layered soil subsurface structure on fields 1a and field 2 through borehole observations and electrical resistivity ert measurements claes et al 2020 the profiles at these fields consist of three layers a loamy sand layer underlies a sandy topsoil with a thickness of approximately 0 5 m this loamy sand layer has a varying thickness between 1 m and 3 m below the fields getting thinner towards the stream the bottom layer of the soil profile is a loam soil the seismic tomogram for field 1a north and field 2 were compared with more detailed structural information of the soil profile derived from electrical resistivity ert data collected by claes et al 2020 to align seismic velocities for each subsurface profile with layer boundaries comparing the seismic velocities of field 1a and field 2 with the profiles from claes et al 2020 suggested the boundary between the sandy loam and loam layer approximately corresponds to 350 m s detailed geophysical profiles for field 1a north and field 2 collected by claes et al 2019 indicated the bottom of the loam layer to be coinciding with a seismic velocity of 700 m s extracted direct push cores sampled by claes et al 2019 at this site reached a depth of refusal at the same level as the 700 m s velocity contour the same velocities were used to derive the boundaries between the different soil layers for each field because of the similarity in soil structure geological history of each field 2 3 2 hydrodynamic data along the northern profile in field 1a time lapse series of borehole nmr measurements were collected immediately before during and just after flooding of the field at the end of the irrigation season in 2016 and the start of 2017 claes et al 2019 this method is unique in that it is directly sensitive to the volume of water that is present in the subsurface without an external magnetic field spin magnetic moments are randomly oriented hertrich 2008 the method applies a secondary magnetic field that causes the spin magnetic moments of hydrogen atoms to align with a resulting small net magnetic moment along the field direction of the applied magnetic field when the signal is switched off the hydrogen atoms will return back to their original state generating a signal the strength of this signal is directly proportional to the volume of water in the subsurface more information about this method can be found in walsh et al 2013 although not all of these measurements were conducted in the same season as modeled in this study the measurements are still considered indicative of the subsurface hydrological behavior and can be compared with modeled hydrologic redistribution in the soil profile and storage of irrigation water in the subsurface 2 4 vadose zone flow model structure and transport processes hydrologic processes were simulated for each field using a 2d process based model approach the flow models use an unstructured grid for fields 1b field 2 and field 3 the grid sizes were 0 15 m near the surface increasing to 0 3 m near the bottom of the profile a larger grid size was used for both the southern and northern profile in field 1a due to the larger size of the profile and computational limitations for field 1a the overall grid size was 0 5 m tapering to 0 15 m near the interface between each soil layer for each field a layered subsurface structure to be used in the vadose zone transport model was developed from seismic profiles soil layer boundaries were directly copied between the seismic grid and the vadose zone flow model grid the soil layer type from the seismic velocity grid was translated to the closest vadose zone flow model grid the framework used to model the vadose zone transport processes included hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2012 which incorporates the following modified richards equation richards 1931 to describe flow in the vadose zone 1 θ t x i k k ij a h x j k iz a s where θ represents the volumetric water content s is a sink term h the pressure head and x and t are the spatial and temporal coordinates respectively k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and ka is the anisotropy tensor that accounts for directionality of the hydraulic conductivity in the soil profile both the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k and the soil volumetric water content θ are a function of the pressure head and the relationship between them can be described by the van genuchten mualem relationship van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 m 1 1 n w i t h n 1 3 k h k s s e l 1

hydraulic conductivity and s is the relative saturation of the soil profile or layer the parameters for the 3 layered soil profiles were taken from claes et al 2020 they calibrated the saturated hydraulic conductivity values for each layer in field 1a together with the anisotropy factor to capture effectively the subsurface runoff processes subsurface above the less permeable loam layer for field 1a and field 2 the van genuchten mualem parameters for the 3 layers together with the anisotropy factor for hydraulic conductivity ka for the loamy sand middle layer are given in table 2 l was held constant at 0 5 for all layers 2 5 vadose zone flow model boundary conditions 2 5 1 irrigation irrigation water application through flood irrigation was simulated for all fields using an advancing constant head boundary at the top of the profile that moved downhill with a velocity of 2 5 m per 30 min for 24 h this method to emulate flood irrigation dynamics was based on the observations of claes et al 2019 with regards to surface runoff and subsequent ponding of irrigation water on top of the soil profile on field 1 and 2 the other fields showed similar vegetation patterns soil types and slopes towards the stream a rotational irrigation schedule similar to the applied irrigation strategy in the field was used fig 3 water application is rotated in 24 hour application periods between each field with two cycles application of irrigation water before cutting and one irrigation cycle at the end of the season field 1a north and field 1a south have 3 rows of gated pipe fig 1a this results in 3 irrigation events within 1 cycle distributed across the three lines of irrigation pipe first from the gated pipe at the top of the profile furthest away from the stream followed by the middle pipe and lastly from the pipe closest to the stream fig 3 the volume applied on each field was determined based on measured irrigation rates by claes et al 2019 water applied during 24 h of irrigation on field 1 was 124 m3 per m of irrigation pipe and 90 m3 per m length of pipe for field 2 as there were no measurements available for field 3 an average of both measurements was used as estimate of applied water on this field surface runoff was not directly simulated in the vadose zone transport model but rather was calculated as the difference between the simulated infiltrated volume of water under a constant head boundary of 1 cm on each field and the volume of water applied 2 5 2 evapotranspiration and precipitation hydrus 2d can incorporate time dependent boundary conditions such as et patterns and precipitation the measured daily values of precipitation and et were used as boundary conditions at the surface precipitation was not simulated on top of the profile in the locations when a constant head boundary was applied during irrigation water application the feddes 1978 root water uptake model embedded in hydrus 2d was used to simulate et processes by timothy grass as the objective of this study is to analyze the partitioning of applied irrigation water and subsurface return flow fluxes the modeled et fluxes needed to be close to the measured values the feddes model parameters associated with pasture vegetation were modified to represent the conditions under which the timothy grass was grown periodic flooding during the irrigation season conditions at which maximum transpiration was assumed to start were set to just below saturation values at 0 01 m h2o and the pressure at which transpiration started decreasing linearly was set to 6 m h2o with no transpiration to occur at 8 m h2o or below the roots were distributed in the top 1 2 1 4 m of the soil profile with the maximum root density at 0 2 m depth both the precipitation and evaporation boundary conditions were applied at the soil surface at all times except when irrigation occurred when water was ponding on top of the profile the boundary conditions changed from atmospheric boundary conditions which accommodates precipitation to a constant head boundary condition of 1 cm pressure 2 6 water balance for the field and site after a spin up period of 1 season applying a simulated irrigation schedule similar to the observed seasonal schedule hydrus 2d was used to simulate infiltration and flow and transport processes for each field irrigation cycles were simulated by applying the moving constant head boundary conditions as described earlier the atmospheric boundary conditions incorporated the measured et and precipitation data daily volumes of modeled et applied irrigation water and subsurface outflow were registered for each profile subsurface outflow was modeled through a seepage face on the downslope side of the profiles the storage component for each profile was calculated as the difference between the volume of water infiltrating into the profile and the volume simulated leaving the profile the water balance for each field was calculated by accumulating the fluxes modeled for each 2d profile over the season before the start of irrigation and after irrigation has ceased between may 15th and october 23rd to develop a water balance for each field and not just for the profile volumes per day fluxes were multiplied by the length of irrigation pipe that was used for irrigation water application to incorporate the logistic limitation of fields being irrigated half at a time over two days fluxes of each profile are twice multiplied by half of the length of irrigation pipe and aggregated with a one day shift 2 7 sensitivity and uncertainty uncertainty for the measured et values of 13 percent were based on uncertainty values reported by solignac et al 2009 infiltration is dependent on the volume of empty pore space in the soil layers below the ponding water claes et al 2020 found starting water contents at the beginning of the season in the subsurface to be normally distributed around a mean water content with a standard deviation of 0 05 volumetric water content rather than homogenous in the models to test the effect of this discrepancy on the total volume of water that infiltrates in the subsurface and the effect on the different components of the water balance 100 different starting models were constructed that varied in water contents before irrigation water was applied for each mesh element the starting water content was sampled from a normal distribution around the same starting water content as in the original hydrologic model with a standard deviation of 5 volumetric water content similar to the observed distribution by claes et al 2020 the change in water content for each mesh element during the simulated flood irrigation event was calculated and summed this was performed for each of the 100 models and a standard deviation was calculated to determine the effect of uncertainty on starting water contents and heterogeneity of the hydrologic starting conditions on the total volume of water that infiltrates during flood irrigation simulation the anisotropy factor which is the ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity was calibrated for the main conducting soil layer in the subsurface based on observed subsurface flow dynamics during flood irrigation events by claes et al 2020 the anisotropy factor was calibrated to a value of 45 however they also noted the low sensitivity to a change of this parameter for anisotropy values above a value of 25 only a marginal improvement of their objective function was obtained to test the effect of this insensitivity of the calibrated anisotropy factor between values of 25 45 on modeled fluxes over a complete field season a simulation of an irrigation season was conducted for field 1a south and field 2 where the anisotropy factor was changed from 45 to 25 3 results 3 1 model structure the seismic refraction p wave velocity contour lines were used to determine the interface between the loamy sand layer and the loam layer 350 m s and the interface between the loam and the tertiary confining layer 700 m s for each profile fig 4 at the top of the profile the vertical p wave velocity gradient was lower than below depths of 5 m where the gradient rapidly increases from 500 m s to 900 m s and higher the location of each seismic profile and coinciding hydrologic model profile is shown on fig 1a for field 1a south and north which are longer in length the profile structure in the hydrologic model was informed by the two seismic profiles for both the southern and northern profiles of field1a the loamy sand layer has a greater thickness upslope away from the stream left and thinned towards the bottom of the field right for the northern profile this loamy sand layer ended at 100 m before the bottom of the field x 60 from this location until the bottom of the field the profile only consists of the sandy topsoil of about 0 5 m directly on top of the loam layer field 1b and field 2 have both a similar structure of soil profile consisting of a 0 5 m thick sandy top soil above a loamy sand layer with a thickness of 4 5 m that thinned out to 2 3 m towards the bottom of the field the top of the loam layer in field 2 revealed terrace like features with a first terrace from 0 to 45 m a second from 45 m to 115 m and a third closer to the stream the topography of the loamy sand loam interface for both field 1b and field 2 slopes towards the stream for the first 50 m field 3 located on the other side of the stream has a similar soil profile structure as field 1a north both have a loamy sand layer that does not span the complete length of the profile but thins out and disappears towards the stream 3 2 water balance the modeled water balance varied among all fields table 3 the volume of water applied on field 1a south and field 1a north accounts for 55 of the total water applied on the site as it has also more irrigation pipe covering these fields this difference in applied water per field disappears if the volumes are normalized by area more water is applied per m2 on field 1a north than field 1a south as it had more irrigation pipe per surface area fig 1 table 1 subsurface flow leaving the fields was the largest component of the total water balance 60 3 while storage is the smallest 2 table 3 field 1a north and field 3 had the highest volume of water being stored in the soil profile with 4 and 6 respectively of the applied water on the field field 1b with 3 of applied water being stored meaning that the profile ended up slightly drier than at the start of the irrigation season between 73 and 82 of applied water infiltrated on all fields except field 1a north field 1a north only had 53 infiltrating while 47 leaving the field via direct runoff fields 2 and 3 had the highest et with 0 33 m and 0 34 m over the season this equates to 18 and 17 of applied water on each field compared with 10 12 for field 1a and field 1b table 3 the average et across the site is 0 27 m field 1a south had the lowest et 0 21 m field 1a north which had the lowest volume of water infiltrating in the profile and therefore most runoff 47 also had the lowest fraction of subsurface flow leaving the profile while runoff was 20 30 higher than the other fields subsurface flow leaving the system was 18 26 lower 3 2 1 direct surface runoff and subsurface flow paths the surface and subsurface responses differed in timing and amount over the irrigation season figs 5 and 6 direct surface runoff is the main hydrologic response during irrigation may 28 june 26 july 25 aug 4 after which the subsurface component takes over the subsurface became saturated during the irrigation events and gradually discharged water contributing to flow from the fields during harvest early july when no irrigation was applied and in the late season and fall after august 5th by the end of the last irrigation cycle the beginning of august the accumulated flow leaving the fields was approximately 40 subsurface flow and 30 direct runoff fig 6 the remaining 30 of applied irrigation water comprised et 10 and water that had infiltrated in the subsurface and was slowly moving via subsurface flow paths down slope or being stored from august until october 20 of the applied irrigation water left the fields via subsurface flow paths resulting in 60 of the total flow from the fields over the season being subsurface flow 3 2 2 storage the water balance for the site showed limited storage over the course of the season below field 1a north field 2 and field 3 with no storage occurring below the other two profiles table 3 in these three fields the storage within the profile was located at the interface between the loamy sand and loam layer fig 7 field 3 had the largest volume of storage 6 of total applied water 0 12 m over the irrigation season changes in water content in the profile of field 1b east of 100 m towards the stream and in the first 60 m of field 3 were considered to be numerical artifacts as these areas were only one mesh element thick at the interface between the loamy sand and loam layer 3 2 3 evapotranspiration the modeled et component of all fields followed the measured et until the last irrigation cycle fig 8 the low modeled et values at the start of the irrigation season increased rapidly once irrigation water was applied by the end of the first irrigation cycle the et values reached their maximum values of 7 mm day these values decreased towards the start of the 2nd irrigation period but increased again once irrigation water was applied up to 5 mm day fields 2 and field 3 had higher fractions of the applied irrigation water converted to et table 3 the difference between modeled and potential et was smaller for these two fields in the late season however during the second part of the season after irrigation had ceased modeled et was consistently lower than the observed fig 8 at this point in the simulation the dry soil moisture conditions in the root zone resulted in a decrease in modeled transpiration 3 2 4 ancillary hydrodynamic data borehole nmr measurements performed before during and after the application of flood irrigation at field 1a north at the end of the irrigation season in 2016 and the start of the irrigation season in 2017 claes et al 2019 demonstrated the flooding and redistribution dynamics around well 1 in field 1a north fig 9 a although these measurements were not made during the simulated irrigation season the starting conditions and following redistribution processes are considered being representative for the hydrodynamic behavior below field 1a north at the start of the season in 2017 fig 9b the soil profile was dry after having drained over the winter season during irrigation the wetting front reaches a depth of 7 m below the surface only after irrigation ceased and redistribution processes had occurred did the lower portion of the profile become saturated similar responses in redistribution were observed for both irrigation experiments the immediate redistribution after irrigation had ceased indicating that antecedent moisture conditions did not affect this response redistribution and drainage caused the boundary between the saturated and unsaturated zones to move to a depth of 3 2 3 5 m in the 2 days following irrigation hydrologic model results for the boundary between the saturated and unsaturated zones around the first fig 9b and last irrigation cycle fig 9a in the season compare well with those observed with the borehole nmr measurements the boundary position at the start of each experiments is similar for the observed and modeled profile and the model results after 1 day of infiltration showed a fully saturated profile for 2016 there is only 0 15 m difference in modeled and observed boundary position after 1 day of irrigation however modeled redistribution and drainage of the infiltrated water two days after irrigation showed that the boundary did not move as fast down in the profile as observed a difference of 0 25 m for the irrigation cycle at the start of the season in june 2017 fig 9b and 1 2 m at the end of the season in july 2016 fig 9a 3 3 sensitivity analysis of anisotropy factor for saturated hydraulic conductivity here we assess the effect of changing the anisotropy factor ka to 25 instead of 45 on each component of the water balance for field 1a south and field 2 table 4 the total volume of flow leaving the fields through subsurface pathways was slightly higher for both fields when the higher values for anisotropy were used in the model the effect on the change in subsurface return flow for field 1a south is approximately 1 of the total volume of applied water while the effect on field 2 was 10 table 4 the total volume of applied water that left the field by either subsurface processes or surface runoff was similar with both factors of anisotropy table 4 although the hydrologic parameters of the top layer were not changed infiltration was affected by the different anisotropy factor with a lower percentage of water infiltrating with the smaller the anisotropy factor a smaller volume of infiltrated irrigation water resulted in higher runoff volumes and lower volumes of water moving through the subsurface a higher anisotropy factor resulted in faster redistribution or draining of the profile towards the stream this faster redistribution caused a larger volume of empty pore space to be available at the start of the following irrigation cycle and less water to be diverted as surface runoff when using a smaller anisotropy factor the subsurface fluxes followed a smoother trend over time in comparison with the higher anisotropy factor fig 10 with a constant hydraulic conductivity value but a lower anisotropy factor the resistance to horizontal flow in the loamy sand layer is higher resulting in a slower hydrologic response i e lateral flow over the interface between the less permeable loam layer at the bottom of the loamy sand layer by the end of the simulation period on october 27th the total volume returned via subsurface processes for field 1a south was nearly similar for both anisotropy factors the difference in cumulative outflow for field 2 was larger we attribute this primarily to the difference in infiltrated volume relative to applied water which was higher for field 2 than field 1a south and changed from 79 to 73 table 4 resulting in less water contributing to subsurface hydrologic processes additionally field 2 had a nearly horizontal interface between the loam and loamy sand layer over which subsurface runoff occurs this difference resulted in a lower gradient driving force this lower topographic gradient in combination with the lower anisotropy factor resulted in slower subsurface outflow it takes longer time for the water to reach the end of the profile with a lower anisotropy factor potentially resulting in water leaving the profile after the simulation period 4 discussion 4 1 water balance 4 1 1 irrigation the total volume of applied water measured at this site over the 2015 irrigation season was 1 098 000 m3 gordon et al 2020 the uncertainty estimated on this measurement was 8 121 000 m3 the rotational scheme of irrigation water application used to model application of irrigation water led to a total volume of applied water of 983 002 m3 which is within the measurement uncertainty the exact rotation of each field may change each irrigation year though the application rates and durations remain similar however the irrigation season may end earlier in dry years resulting in a decrease in total volume applied to accurately quantify direct input from each field to flow into the riparian zones and the streams we recognize that an improved quantification of applied water and timing is required however as the soil profile structure and hydrologic drivers are informed by geophysical measurements lab analysis and hydrologic measurements we do consider the model predictions to be representative for an irrigation season at this site 4 1 2 return flow we found that by the end of the irrigation season the total accumulated modeled water from all the fields leaving by surface runoff and subsurface flow paths was approximately 89 of applied water the sum of the returned volumes via runoff and subsurface processes accounted for 29 and 60 respectively of the total applied irrigation water over the site due to differences in the soil profile structure we found differences in the partitioning of return flow pathways among fields approximately 50 of the applied water left the irrigated fields via subsurface flow paths and surface runoff by the middle of july fig 6 when harvesting occurred followed by 15 before the last harvest an additional 20 of the applied water flowed out of the fields after the last application of flood irrigation this estimate of late season return flow is similar to the late season return flow estimate for this similar site by gordon et al 2020 who based their estimate on an agricultural water balance however it is difficult to determine what portion of the water leaving the fields actually returned to the stream and what fraction remained in the riparian zone either as near surface storage or used as riparian et wetstein et al 1989 found that about 10 of return flow occurred in the late season in the new fork their modeling study did not incorporate a riparian zone component as it was negligible compared to the area of the irrigated fields peck lovvorn 2001 found that 65 from their studied wetlands received direct inflows from flood irrigated lands half of this inflow was from direct runoff that was rerouted via ditches to the wetlands while the other half occurred via subsurface pathways similar to the peck and lovvorn 2001 study a portion of the return flow in our site is routed through surface ditches to the riparian area in particular surface flow that leaves irrigated portions of field 1a north and field 1b and part of field 3 is collected in catch ditches at the bottom of the field and diverted to the riparian zone fig 1 comparing the daily values of total flow from the fields and surface runoff fig 5 with the measured values of return flow by gordon 2016 in the stream fig 11 shows that the timing of increased flows leaving the fields towards the stream is similar the measured values during irrigation periods are of the same order of magnitude as the modeled return flows out of the fields with values around 0 2 0 3 m3 s in the end of june and beginning of july and 0 15 m3 s during the last irrigation in august during these times of irrigation the contribution of surface runoff is important the peaks of 0 4 m3 s during a short period in the middle of june is attributed to snowmelt from areas higher in watershed at this time lower areas of the riparian zones were being flooded by stream water due to high river stage and water bypassed measurement stations not all of the irrigation water leaving the fields is return flow to the stream a large portion of this water will be routed through the riparian zone and may be lost to et in the riparian zone before making it to the stream temporal storage or et in the riparian zone lupon et al 2016 can reduce the contribution from these flows from the fields to the streams and result in only limited contribution to base flow after the irrigation season has ceased based on an agricultural water budget calculated by gordon et al 2020 23 11 of the applied irrigation water was used by et in the riparian zone applying this fraction on the total volume of water that flowed via surface or subsurface pathways from the modeled fields 89 under the assumption that all water passes first through the riparian zone before entering the stream would result in 66 of applied water returning back to the stream 4 1 3 evapotranspiration the modeled values for each field followed a similar trend at the start of the irrigation season fig 8 during the second part of the season when irrigation had ended and the near surface hydrologic conditions below the fields became drier the model results deviated from the observed et values at the start of the irrigation season when et rates were low with daily rates of 1 4 mm day the modeled rates followed measured rates fig 8 however after haying and before the last irrigation event when the soil moisture in the profile had decreased et rates in the model start fig 8 deviating from observed rates fig 2 modeled values of et for timothy grass in late season were lower for all fields than the observed values the observed values as reported by gordon et al 2020 could be affected by the vegetation in the riparian zones around the fields the footprint of the scintillometer meant that some interference could have been picked up from the riparian vegetation however it is important to note that the modeled et on any field would never exceed the measured et that is used to inform the et component in the flow model even under optimal hydrologic conditions in the model this is because the potential evapotranspiration that hydrus requires as input was informed by the effective evapotranspiration measured at the field 4 1 4 surface runoff while surface runoff on most of the fields was between 18 and 27 of the water applied field 1a north had a higher percentage of runoff with 47 of the applied irrigation water leaving the field via surface runoff this can be explained by the soil profile of field 1a north towards the downhill part of field 1a north the loamy sand layer thinned out and disappeared fig 4 resulting in the 0 5 m sandy top soil directly underlain by a low permeable loam layer water moved slower into this layer during irrigation and once irrigation ceased redistribution processes happened at a slower rate the absence of the loamy sand layer in the middle of the soil profile resulted in a slower draining process the effect of this is that at the start of the second and third irrigation cycle less pore space was drained and available for infiltrating water this resulted in more run off and less infiltration in the 24 h of flooding during the 2nd and 3rd irrigation cycle surface runoff was not directly simulated in the vadose zone transport model and is a source of uncertainty and error in the total modeled water balance of the site the approximation based on the difference between measured applied water and modeled infiltrated water disregards the possibility that runoff might infiltrate on other sections of the fields due to lateral heterogeneities in infiltration capacity or is lost out of the system as evaporation during the short time water is moving as overland flow other studies accounted for runoff dynamics by incorporation of saint venant equations e g köhne et al 2011 the continuous application of water running of over the profile with a moving wetting front and evaporation occurring would require an update to current available boundary conditions in hydrus which lies outside of the scope of this study we do not expect that changing the boundary conditions to represent the flooding process would improve estimates of the portion of infiltrated water and surface runoff as the boundary conditions as they were modeled now are based on measured wetting front movements and field observations and updating them would be based on approximate representations 4 2 subsurface structure and its implications for subsurface return flow processes to model the hydrological processes in the subsurface at field scale information about subsurface structural heterogeneity is necessary some of the processes such as subsurface run off over less permeable layers is driven by these structural heterogeneities claes et al 2019 the seismic refraction data collected along the hydrologic data allowed for upscaling of these structural characteristics from plot to field scale and incorporate them into the vadose zone transport model profiles for each field to delineate the layers layer boundaries based on resistivity profiles by claes et al 2020 were compared with measured seismic velocities the seismic velocities were similar to the ones reported by flinchum et al 2018 and befus et al 2011 which indicated the bottom of the soil profile to be located around the 700 900 m s contour although these delineations were determined in other geologic settings other studies and literature sources revealed similar values for glacial and sedimentary deposits odum et al 2004 reynolds 2011 the overall structure of the soil profiles in each field were similar with a 3 layer structure as expected in fields in close proximity and with the same geology and management however using the seismic data we were also able to discern differences in soil profile details and layer thicknesses below each field incorporation of these differences in subsurface structure in the hydrologic model gives us a means to evaluate their impact on the hydrological processes that occur during and after flood irrigation storage of irrigated water occurs on top of the interface between the loamy sand and loam layer and is directed by the topography of this interface comparing storage of irrigation water in the subsurface of field 1a north fig 7 and the profile structure fig 4 indicates that the stored irrigation water is located in topographical depressions at this interface gravity driven run off after irrigation has ceased is delayed by these depressions and cause temporary storage similar to how hillslope topography and subsurface structure can impact flow path development and storage ticehurst et al 2007 surface nmr measurements were collected before the start of the irrigation season and october at the end of the season at the surface of field 1a north fig 1a these measurements presented by gordon et al 2020 showed an increase in water content at a depth between 6 and 8 m below the surface of this profile at the interface between the loamy sand and loam layer model results for field 1a north as presented on fig 7 were for the same area as the surface nmr measurement converted to 1d results by spatial averaging these results indicated an increase in water content at a depth between 4 5 and 8 m below the surface fig 12 this area in the profile is located just below the interface between the loamy sand and loam layer surface nuclear magnetic resonance measurements showed no change in hydrologic status over the course of an irrigation season below the depths of the 700 m s seismic contour indicating that the mudstone layer is indeed a confining layer it is possible that the field scale resolution 0 75 m of these data as applied in the model can miss subsurface details that can potentially influence vadose zone transport processes at smaller scales such as macropores 0 020 mm 1 mm beven germann 1982 however claes et al 2020 found that inclusion of small scale structural characteristics was not necessary to model the governing hydrologic processes observed during flood irrigation in this setting the small difference between modeled and observed behavior of the wetting front as shown in fig 9 indicates that under flooding conditions when a large hydraulic pressure is present macropores and small scale heterogeneities do not affect the local hydrologic processes once redistribution started to occur the pressure gradient that was driving infiltration disappeared and small local differences in soil properties could play an important role in the redistribution process hillel 1980 because the representation of each soil layer in our model did not include heterogeneity of soil properties redistribution processes that may happen at smaller scale were not represented or accounted for in this model details of soil structure or variability of soil parameters at small scale which might impact local hydrologic behavior at shorter time intervals nielsen et al 1973 were potentially averaged out in this coarser hydrologic representation this could explain the discrepancy between the modeled and observed boundary between the unsaturated and saturated zone fig 9 the modeled draining of the profile at longer temporal scale compares well with the observations of the boundary between the unsaturated and saturated zone at the start of the last irrigation cycle in 2016 fig 9a 4 3 transferability of the method the limited body of return flow literature makes it challenging to compare this study to similar studies involving flood irrigation however flood irrigation on a hillslope underlain by a confining layer can be conceptualized as storm processes on a hillslope underlain by bedrock under these circumstances the subsurface run off processes are governed by bedrock topography troch et al 2003 freer et al 2002 the combination of structural geophysical data and detailed vadose zone flow models provides a way forward to being able to represent these topography driven processes in physical models and address the question about timing and delay of return flows at field and reach scale this study demonstrates that subsurface flow paths potentially facilitate the return of more than 60 of the applied irrigation water back to the system table 3 in areas with an undulating confining layer subsurface storage of irrigation water can happen in local topographic depressions in this layer this subsurface storage was located in the uphill parts of the profiles on the landscape the relatively small percent of storage of irrigation water 2 was in contrast with gordon et al 2020 who estimated 18 storage in the soil profile gordon et al 2020 used surface nmr measurements below field 1a north to calculate the volume of irrigation water stored below the surface fig 9a the advantage of this method is that it is directly sensitive to the volume of water below the surface hertrich 2008 behroozmand et al 2015 the disadvantage is that it provides only a laterally integrated 1d measurement of water content as a function of depth below the instruments location the vadose zone flow model developed in this study demonstrated that storage did occur at the location of the surface nmr measurements on field 1a north fig 7 however the model results indicated that storage was not continuous across the length of the field this shows the strength of using subsurface characteristics based on multiple geophysical observations in a distributed physical based vadose zone transport model to characterize subsurface transport processes for return flow studies 5 conclusion combining field observations of hydrologic changes in the subsurface with geophysical data of soil structure at field scale in a process based model enabled us to address the question of the timing and volume of hydrologic response of flood irrigated fields by including hydrogeophysical data in addition to the hydrologic observations we were able to reveal subsurface flow dynamics and identify preferential flow mechanisms as important contributors to fluxes out of the fields under flood irrigation management a loamy sand layer located below the top soil above a less permeable layer was identified as important factor determining the partitioning between direct run off and subsurface flows over this less permeable layer the majority of applied water was found to leave the fields by the end of the irrigation season at this site with 89 of applied water leaving the irrigated fields as surface runoff or via subsurface flow paths runoff and subsurface processes accounted for 29 and 60 respectively of the total applied irrigation water over the site with 20 of the applied irrigation water flowing from the fields after the last application of flood irrigation in addition this study also pointed out that hydrologic fluxes from agricultural fields

4532,spatially interpolated temperature and precipitation are hydrological variables that are widely applied in models of ecology hydrology agronomy and other environmental sciences the accuracy of meteorological data directly determine model performance however the interpolation of temperature and precipitation over complex areas is affected by the value observed with surrounding meteorological stations and also by aspects of the physical environment such as terrain and land cover effects these effects significantly limit the precise interpolation of temperature and precipitation to normalize these effects a new method coupling random forest rf and inverse distance weighting idw was proposed rf idw the proposed method was applied to generate the climate surfaces of both precipitation and temperature in china in 2015 during the interpolation with rf idw the temperature and precipitation were decomposed into a basic part indicating the atmospheric properties and local parts representing the effects of the physical environment the complex correlations were determined between precipitation temperature and multiple covariates of landcover normalized difference vegetation index ndvi elevation slope longitude soil moisture latitude and land surface temperature lst derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data next 10 fold and leave one region out cross validation were applied to verify the accuracy of rf idw for the interpolation of meteorological values we also compared the rf idw performance to that of rf idw anusplin and mlr to further investigate its feasibility based on 10 fold cross validation the coefficient of determinations r2 between interpolated value and observed values were 0 962 for precipitation and 0 990 for temperature indicating that the rf idw can accurately interpolate climate surfaces the performance comparison showed that the rf idw reduced the mean absolute error by 55 mm to 120 mm for precipitation interpolation and 0 06 to 0 8 for temperature interpolation especially in the complex region the result of monthly interpolations implied the good robustness of the rf idw overall the proposed rf idw approach allows improved spatial interpolation of complex region and suggest alternate methods for the spatial interpolation of hydrological variables keywords spatial interpolation of meteorological variables random forest and inverse distance weighting multiple covariates china 1 introduction the spatially continuous surfaces of temperature and precipitation are hydrological variables that are used as key parameters for hydrological ecological and land surface processing models tan et al 2019a zhang et al 2020a during simulation spatial precipitation and temperature are primary inputs and the accuracy of these data have direct and great impact on hydrologic model performance seo et al 2019 with the growing evidence of climate change shifts in temperature and precipitation is highlighted in hydrometeorological studies and accurate spatial surface of these parameters are emergently required for accurate modelling additionally strategies for biological conservation and natural resource management also require spatially continuous environmental data li et al 2011 unfortunately spatially continuous surfaces of temperature and precipitation are usually not readily available because they are challenging to acquire especially for large and complex regions matos et al 2013 thornton et al 1997 most direct temperature and precipitation data are collected by meteorological stations stahl et al 2006 these data can be interpolated to obtain a spatially continuous climate surface over a region of interest which can facilitate decision making for scientists and environmental managers interpretation method is an important method to obtain the climate surfaces with the data of sparse stations viggiano et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b during spatial interpolation over complex areas the interpolated value of a position is not only determined by the data collected from surrounding meteorological stations but also the effects of environment induced by the physical variables of ground such as terrain and land cover effects dodson and marks 1997 stewart and nitschke 2017 therefore terrain and other physical variables as key factors influencing the spatial distribution of climate variables should be considered in interpolation bostan et al 2012 mcvicar and jupp 2002 price et al 2000 these physical variables can be included as independent variables within the interpolation method in extended and complex region alvarez et al 2014 and the effects of these physical variables on spatial meteorological patterns can be used to refine climate surfaces and improve overall interpolation accuracy thornton et al 1997 simple interpolation methods may fail to consider the effects of topography or other physical variables phillips et al 1992 and hybrid approaches were developed to achieve a more promising performance perry and hollis combined the regression model and idw to interpolate a monthly and annual gridded dataset over the uk perry and hollis 2005 li et al combined rf and svm with ok or ids especially in exploring rf in combination with ordinary kriging and idw li et al 2011 zhang et al found that the hybrid with svm model achieved superior results over idw ok and rk zhang et al 2017 the machine learning is increasing used in exploring the relationship between multiple covariate and meteorological value during climate surface interpolation with hybrid approaches for their robustness and accurate metrics however the effects of multiple covariates may be confusingly integrated with atmospheric properties during spatial interpolation in many interpolation methods which may obscure the effects of physical variables to more completely understand the mechanisms of the spatial distribution of meteorological variables and achieve better interpolation the effects of physical variables should be investigated inspired by the idea that the meteorological value of each position is determined by the value collected from neighboring meteorological stations and the effects of physical environment during interpolation each meteorological value was divided into two parts a basic part and a local part the basic part is the difference in atmospheric properties without the influence of local environment and the local part is the difference in climatic environment derived from the effects of local physical variables such as terrain or land cover this separation can allow the interpolation model to clearly reveal the trend of meteorological values and identify the effects of local physical variables in this study an interpolation method coupling random forest and inverse distance weighting rf idw method was proposed rf has been widely used to interpolate precipitation and temperature nashwan and shahid 2019 pang et al 2017 many researches have implied that rf can precisely capture the relationship between meteorological value and physical environment bhuiyan et al 2018 and rf has shown their superior performance in combination with other spatially interpolated methods li et al 2011 additionally fewer parameters must be set during the predicting with rf making it easier to identify the local parts breiman 2001 schumacher and herman 2018 for the basic part without the influence of physical environment atmospheric properties might gradually change with distance and inverse distance weighting idw can reveal these trend ware et al 1991 china has survived more than 1 4 billion people and there are increasing significant effects of climate change including floods droughts and extreme climate song et al 2011 thomas 2008 zhang et al 2020a therefore more precise knowledge of climate surfaces and changes in these surface are essential to identify hydrological status and the impacts of climate on agricultural production and to guide the decision making process however it is difficult to achieve an accurate interpolation in china for its complex environment stahl et al 2006 a precise interpolation method that considers the effects of multiple covariates is urgently desired to address this need the proposed method was developed and applied to interpolate temperature and precipitation of china in 2015 to assess the performance and feasibility proposed method was compared to the individual rf and idw methods thin plate smoothing splines anusplin and multiple linear regression mlr approaches the mostly applied methods that consider multiple covariates the main objectives of this study were to 1 propose an improved method for spatial interpolation of temperature and precipitation by decomposition 2 explore the effects of physical variables on the spatial distribution of meteorological variables 3 assess the performance of the proposed method for a large and complex region 2 study area and data 2 1 study area china is selected as the study area to validate the performance of the proposed method china has a complex terrain and a territory area of 9 600 000 km2 whose elevation spanning from 155 m to 8845 m fig 1 mountainous areas accounts for approximately 70 of the total land in china wei et al 2008 under the control of pacific and indian ocean monsoons the climate across china varies considerably with significant effects of terrain song et al 2011 2 2 meteorological data the raw station data of temperature and precipitation fig 1 were collected from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn to avoid the influence of abnormal values average values were selected for interpolation of temperature and total values were chosen for the interpolation of precipitation as typically used to measure the performance of the interpolation method bryan and adams 2002 through screening and eliminating abnormal data the average temperature and total precipitation annually and monthly of each station in 2015 were obtained tan et al 2016 2 3 multiple covariates multiple covariates are usually used as secondary information to improve interpolation performance li et al 2011 mcvicar and jupp 2002 terrain factors such as elevation slop aspect are correlative with the temperature and precipitation alvarez et al 2014 boer et al 2001 as well as the longitude latitude and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi appelhans et al 2015 attorre et al 2007 the land surface temperature lst is also widely used for the interpolation of temperature kilibarda et al 2014 stewart and nitschke 2017 and precipitation alvarez et al 2014 land cover can influence the spatial pattern of climate surfaces and was also used as covariates for interpolation bostan et al 2012 jarvis and stuart 2001 soil moisture data is vital in hydro meteorological application and also can affect the distributions of precipitation and temperature hazra et al 2019 kumar et al 2019 the multiple covariates for the interpolation are listed in table 1 elevation was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm at 30 m 30 m spatial resolution from usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov and the data of aspect and slope were derived from the digital elevation model dem data fig 2 we collected time series of the 1 km 8 day lst product mod11a2 and the 250 m 16 days averaged ndvi product mod13q1 of china in 2015 from land processes distributed active archive center lp daac fig 2 the longitude and latitude was calculated for the center location of each pixel fig 2 the data of land cover obtained from the products of mcd12q1 of china in 2015 which is also derived from lp daac and the classification system of igbp was used fig 2 the data of soil moisture was derived from soil moisture active passive smap satellite which is widely used to generate global surface soil moisture map with an l band radar active and radiometer bhuiyan et al 2020 hazra et al 2019 the annually and monthly average values of soil moisture lst and ndvi were calculated to be consistent with the meteorological values for interpolation the spatial resolution for interpolation used here was 500 m so the spatial resolution of data for each variable was resampled into 500 m using a nearest sampling method 3 methods 3 1 random forest algorithm rf methods can minimize variance and help avoid overfitting which have received a great deal of research interest and are widely used algorithms for this model construction breiman 2001 he et al 2016 rf algorithms are based on the premise that a set of predictors ensemble based perform better than an individual predictor rf add an additional layer of randomness using a bootstrap and aggregation bagging method and multiple decision trees to make predictions breiman 2001 duro et al 2012 the schematic of the rf algorithm was illustrated in fig 3 the bootstrap method was applied to sample m subsets from the original training data sets and decision trees dts of each subsets are generated using a random vector derived from the input covariates dts are a hierarchical analysis diagram composed of a collection of nodes and edges organized in a tree structure fig 3 he et al 2016 the decision tree model consist of two types of nodes split internal nodes and leaf terminal nodes a test function was associated with each split node to split the incoming data according to different attributes the test function was used to achieve best split selection based on attribute selection measures as decision tree model is nonparametric it is feasible to add either numeric or categorical data layers in rf rf trains each individual tree on bootstrap resamples of the total data set and the final result is decided by average or majority voting fig 3 in this way rf may avoid overfitting the training data set and perform good on the testing data compared to the standard decision tree model he et al 2016 in the bootstrap sampling method approximately about two thirds of the samples are used for training the trees and the remaining one third are used to obtain the out of bag obb error which was applied to estimate the performance of the model and guarantee its robustness breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 3 2 overview of rf idw method according to eq 1 temperature and precipitation data include a basic part associated with atmospheric properties that are not related to physical environment and a local part related to topography land cover and vegetation status the proposed method aims to acquire the physical variable induced variation and non physical variable related values 1 t p f f atmospheric p r o p e r t i e s f altitude f land cov e r f ndvi where t p is the value of temperature precipitation fatmospheric properties is factor of atmospheric properties which is the basic part faltitude f landcover fndvi are the factor of altitude landcover and vegetation status that cause the differences in climatic environment respectively which are the local part without the influencing of physical variables the meteorological value of each position is determined only by the atmosphere a climate surfaces might be smooth and could gradually change with distance so could be directly and precisely interpolated by idw basic parts ware et al 1991 including the effects of terrain and land surface local parts the climate surface is more heterogeneous fig 3 machine learning methods may be able to identify the interactions between basic parts and local environment rhee and im 2017 separation of these two components can improve the accuracy of interpolation rf can effectively construct interpolation model and presents better ability than other methods belgiu and drăguţ 2016 breiman 2001 which can be used to explore the effects of terrain and land surface on local parts the proposed method is summarized visually in fig 4 in the rf idw method rf was applied to predict the difference in climatic environment caused by the effects of physical variables local parts and the idw was used to simulate the trend of atmospheric properties basic parts fig 4 3 3 the workflow of rf idw to acquire the basic part the effects of physical variables on meteorological surface was firstly explored by using the relationship between them with rf the difference between observed value and predicted value with rf effects of physical variables is deemed the basic part in this manuscript and the basic part was regarded as a co variable in combining with local parts by rf the whole rf idw workflow includes three steps that are described in fig 5 a total of 633 and 638 samples for precipitation and temperature were applied to develop corresponding rf idw model acquiring the values of atmospheric properties of each meteorological station step 1 each value is deemed as a composition of a basic part and a local part in the rf idw method that must be separated the relationships between the value of each meteorological station and its multiple covariates were assessed with rf to explore the local value then the basic value of each meteorological station was defined as the difference between the actual value and local value by eq 1 interpolating the basic climate surface with idw and basic value step 2 after acquiring the basic values for each station the basic surface of atmospheric properties was interpolated using the idw method interpolating the climate surface by coupling physical variables and the basic climate surface with rf step 3 rf was also used to integrate the basic and local parts of the data the basic climate surface was regarded as a covariate in the interpolation model the relationships between the actual meteorological values and multiple covariates including basic parts were determined by training with rf to acquire the interpolation model finally the climate surfaces were acquired by importing the layers of multiple covariates and the basic climate surface into the established interpolation model 3 4 validation and performance comparison the importance and correlations were applied to show the relationship between co variables and annually meteorological values as follows the permutation feature importance measurement was applied to test and measure the importance of each variable by calculating the increase in the prediction error of the measurement after permuting the feature breiman 2001 a 10 fold cross validation cv technique were applied to evaluate the precision of interpolated surfaces alvarez et al 2014 the entire training data set of meteorological stations was randomly divided into 10 subsets with each subset containing approximately 10 of the training data hu et al 2017 next nine subsets were used for model training and applied for interpolations of the held out test subset during each round of cross validation the process was repeated 10 times until every subset was tested stahl et al 2006 then the r2 mean absolute error mae mean squared error rmse and standardized mean squared error smse between cv interpolations and observations were applied to assess the accuracy of the proposed model bostan et al 2012 hengl et al 2004 spadavecchia and williams 2009 the rmse and smse values are frequently used to measure the magnitude of error bostan et al 2012 the error along with terrain was identified we also calculated the importance of each input variable and illustrated the relationship between the result and multiple covariates using a response curve method tan et al 2019b the leave one region out validation method over complex terrain was applied to further understand the effects of a complex terrain during interpolation bhuiyan et al 2019 leave one region out validation was used to evaluate the model by testing the transferability of the method s calibration from other complex terrain regions to do this the study area was divided into three region based on china s three terrain ladders fig 1 wei et al 2017 two regions were used to train the model and the remaining region was used for validation this method was repeated three times to test the exclusion of all three regions to explore the performance of rf idw we compared the performance of the proposed method to these of other interpolation methods mlr anusplin rf and idw methods were compared with the proposed rf idw method using the same meteorological samples and input environmental layers to guarantee the consistency of input environment for comparison all methods applied same samples for the interpolation during each round of cross validation and leave one region out validation and so is the folds the r2 mae remse and smse values of each method were compared during cross validation for both interpolation of monthly and annual surface the annually climate surfaces determined by the proposed method and other methods were compared to identify inconsistent regions the inconsistent regions and cross validation were analyzed to indirectly evaluate the performance of each interpolation method 4 results and analysis 4 1 the importance effects and correlations of variables in rf idw in rf idw interpolation the permutation feature importance measurement as introduced by breiman was used to indicate the contribution of each variables to prediction breiman 2001 a higher importance score indicates greater important of the variable during interpolation fig 6 shows the variable importance and the 5 95 quantile of importance values fisher et al 2018 and its values was presented in table 2 for precipitation the basic value of idw had the highest importance with an increase of mae of 7 07 after permutation and has the widest interval between 5 and 95 importance fig 6 the lst was the most important variable for temperature interpolation with a mae increase of 17 2 after permutation indicating a significant determinant of the distribution of temperature for both temperature and precipitation the altitude basic value of idw latitude and lst were important variables during interpolation table 2 although aspect and land cover theoretically could influence the distribution of precipitation and temperature these effects may be small over a large area the altitude also contributed to in the interpolation model but with a smaller effects than expected it may result from that the relationship between temperature and altitude may not be obvious for a large and complex region diodato 2005 phillips et al 1992 the significance of each variable for the model was tested by janitza s method janitza et al 2016 the p value can be used to assess the statistical significance of a variable s contribution to interpolation where the value decrease with increased importance the p values for the variable are presented in fig 6 both for precipitation and temperature basic value of idw lst latitude altitude and longitude were statistically significant with a significance level of 95 during interpolation with the proposed method these results of significance are consistent with that of feature importance measurement mean decrease accuracy mda is an index that is widely used to assess the reduction of the accuracy of rf with the alteration of variables as shown in table 2 the permutation error is the median error of permutation feature importance over all repetitions which imply the importance of each variable for interpolation a larger mda value and larger permutation error correspond to greater variable importance the mda analysis indicated that basic value of idw is the most important variable during the interpolation of precipitation and lst is the most important for the interpolation of temperature which is consistent with the above conclusion derived from the feature importance the same conclusion was reached based on permutation error the mean of squared residuals and variables that explained the model for interpolating precipitation surface were 15741 7 mm and 96 11 respectively and those for interpolating temperature surface were 0 58 and 98 69 respectively overall the rf idw method achieved a promising performance in identifying the relationships between precipitation temperature and input variables accumulated local effects ale indicate how features influence the prediction of a machine learning model on average which has been widely used apley 2016 ale was computed as the accumulated differences over the conditional distribution and does not require the hypothesis that variables are independent the plot of ale fig 7 a clearly shows that the model for precipitation interpolation mainly relied on feature basic value of idw and latitude the model interpolating temperature surface mainly relied on lst basic value of idw and latitude fig 7b these conclusions are highly consistent with those after assessment of feature importance the observed temperature and precipitation varying across each variable were showed in fig 8 the response curves indicate the correlation between input co variables and meteorological values fig 8 the basic value of idw lst soil moisture and ndvi have positive impacts on precipitation and temperature additionally there is a significantly positive correlation between lst and temperature fig 8b the variables of altitude and latitude are negatively correlated with the meteorological values of temperature and precipitation the negative correlation between altitude and temperature was less significant than the positive correlation between lst and temperature this may explain why the altitude is not so significantly important in temperature interpolation the slope and precipitation exhibited slight effects on temperature with little importance in interpolation model 4 2 the interpolate surface with each method the interpolation results of different methods are presented in fig 9 there was a spatial consistency among the interpolating methods for the temperature and precipitation interpolation fig 9 all results showed highest interpolated precipitation in the south and south east region of china and low interpolated temperatures in the qinghai tibet plateau and the north east region of china as expected domrös and peng 2012 the difference among interpolated precipitation with different methods was relatively obvious compare to that of temperature fig 9 for example the interpolated precipitation was heavy in the south with the mlr method fig 9b5 while the other methods interpolated heavy precipitation in the south east and south parts of china compared with the other method the effects of terrain were considered during the interpolation with the proposed rf idw which exhibited a finer surface of precipitation fig 9b1 for the interpolation of temperature almost all methods considered the effects of terrain except for the idw fig 9 in the surface interpolated with idw cattle eyes occurred around the meteorological station fig 9a3 yang et al 2004 visually the surface of temperature interpolated with the proposed rf idw was a combination of the surfaces obtained using the idw and rf in general there were a few differences in the temperature surfaces derived from each interpolation method the kling gupta efficiency kge metric gupta et al 2009 provides three distinct components representing the correlation the bias and a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values which has been used to identify the relationship between simulated and observed values based on the kge values table 3 the interpolated values with idw rf are closed to the observed values the correlation coefficients for temperature and precipitation were both greater than 0 98 indicating a high consistency between observed value and interpolated value with idw rf additionally the bias values and the relative variability are almost equal to 1 indicating little bias between observed value and interpolated value overall the idw rf method had good performance for the interpolation of both temperature and precipitation table 4 4 3 cross validation the observed precipitation versus interpolated values of cv are plotted in fig 10 compared with other methods the interpolated values with rf idw were highly consistent with the observed values the rf idw and mlr methods underestimated the precipitation in high value range the r2 value of all methods were great than 0 80 except for mlr which was only 0 78 the rf idw method gave the highest r2 value 0 962 the observed temperatures versus interpolated values of cv are plotted in fig 11 same to the interpolation of precipitation the rf idw gave the highest consistency between the interpolated values and the observed value the r2 values of all methods were greater than 0 90 indicating good performance for the interpolation of temperature the rf idw method gave the highest r2 value 0 990 the error values the difference between observed value and interpolated value of each method were acquired and the result are shown in fig 12 for precipitation the value of error ranged from 210 mm to 190 mm fig 12a the rf idw method achieved the least error compared with other methods for the interpolation of precipitation followed by anusplin and idw for temperature the error almost ranged from 0 735 c to 0 598 c fig 12b compared with other methods the rf idw and anusplin were featured with low level error the mae values of precipitation were less than 200 mm for each method except for mlr and the mae values of temperature were all less than 1 c except for idw table 3 the proposed rf idw method was the only one method with mae less than 100 mm for precipitation interpolation and less than 0 5 c for temperature interpolation table 3 rsme and smse comparison showed the same trend rf idw reduced mae by 55 mm to 120 mm for precipitation interpolation and 0 06 c to 0 8 c for temperature interpolation indicating the feasibility of the proposed method the proposed method has significantly improved the interpolation accuracy for precipitation tan et al 2016 but only slight improvements in temperature interpolation overall the rf idw method achieved good agreement between cv estimates and observations for the interpolation of precipitation and temperature indicating the feasibility and potentiality of the proposed method to interpolate climate surfaces the leave one region out cross validation results are presented in fig 13 and table 2 in the 1st terrain ladders the proposed method significantly outperformed other methods for both temperature and precipitation interpolation fig 13 anusplin and idw methods significantly over estimated precipitation and temperature values fig 13 the 1st terrain ladders regions is a typical mountainous area consisting of plateaus mountains and deep valleys which is the most complex region of china tan et al 2017 the good performance of the proposed method in 1st indicates its feasibility for meteorological interpolation in the region of terrain the 2nd terrain ladders consists of hills and basins rf idw and anusplin methods have good performance for precipitation and temperature interpolation in this region fig 13 additionally mlr shows good performance for temperature interpolation the 3rd terrain ladders consists of plains and most methods under estimated the precipitation in this region fig 13 based on the leave one region out cross validation rf idw outperformed other methods in interpolating precipitation and temperature and mlr and anusplin also performed well table 3 fig 13 the conclusions based on the mae rmse and smse values of leave one region out cross validation are consistent with that of 10 fold cross validation table 3 overall the cross validation shows that the proposed method can be used for meteorological interpolation of regions with sparse meteorological stations and complex terrain the errors of the interpolation of monthly temperature and precipitation with cross validation were presented fig 14 the proposed rf idw outperformed other methods and mlr have a large error during the monthly precipitation interpolation during the monthly temperature interpolation both proposed rf idw and anusplin have good performance compared to other methods the result of the monthly interpolation with the proposed rf idw is similar to that of annual interpolation all the methods have higher error in the summer and lower error in the summer for the monthly precipitation interpolation which is contrary to the situation of monthly temperature interpolation fig 14 this may be the result that the variation of precipitation in the summer is larger than that in winter and the variation of temperature in the winter is larger than that in summer in china fig 14 the good performance of the proposed rf idw imply its good robustness to variation of meteorological value 4 4 spatial comparison spatial comparison of precipitation between the surface with rf idw and that derived from other methods was identified by obtaining the difference among them fig 15 the regions where rf idw overestimated rf were mainly located in the east of china jiangxi anhui and zhejiang provinces and the places where its precipitation are extremely high such as ya an and jinan fig 15a combined with the error with 10 fold cross validation the proposed rf idw method outperformed rf in the inconsistent areas the consistency between the surface of rf idw and idw was relatively high fig 15b and so was the consistency between the surface of rf idw and anusplin fig 15d the difference between the surface interpolated with rf idw and mlr was significant fig 15c the region with lower values of the surface interpolated by mlr than those of rf idw stretched across the northern china plain combined with the 10 fold cross validation results the rf idw method significantly outperformed mlr in inconsistent regions overall the precipitation interpolated by rf idw has high consistency with that with idw and anusplin which had better performance than mlr and rf rf idw mostly outperformed other methods in inconsistent areas cased on 10 fold cross validation for temperature the inconsistent regions between the surface interpolated by rf idw and that derived from other methods were mainly located in the qinghai tibet plateau and the north west part of china fig 16 higher values of the surface were interpolated by rf idw than those obtained by rf in the qinghai tibet plateau fig 16a the region of inconsistency between rf idw and mlr was similar to that between rf idw and rf fig 16c the difference between the surface interpolated by rf idw and idw methods was significant in the qinghai tibet plateau with a higher value of idw than that of rf idw fig 16b combined with the error of 10 fold cross validation the rf idw outperformed idw across inconsistent regions fig 16b there was high consistency between the surfaces generated by rf idw and anusplin fig 16d according to the error with 10 fold cross validation the rf idw showed good performance in plain regions compared to anusplin overall the interpolation of temperature with rf idw has high consistency with the surface interpolated by anusplin and both models significantly outperformed idw rf idw mostly outperformed other methods in inconsistent regions based on the error with 10 fold cross validation 4 5 the error and inconsistency along with terrain evaluating the error of each interpolating method along with altitude fig 17 a b the errors of precipitation and temperature interpolation were large in high altitude regions the rf idw method have good performance for precipitation and temperature interpolation in high altitude regions fig 17a b same to the error along with altitude the errors of precipitation and temperature interpolation were small in plains regions fig 17c d in the stepped region there were significantly higher errors for each method compared with the other methods the rf idw outperformed for temperature and precipitation interpolation in the steep region implying the proposed method may work better in complex region this conclusion is consistent with that derived from leave one region out cross validation fig 17c d the consistency between rf idw method and other methods along with the gradient of elevation were presented in fig 7 the inconsistency of precipitation and temperature between rf idw method and other methods were significant in the higher altitude region fig 18 a b this may be related to the sparse distribution of stations and complex terrain in the high altitude regions fig 1 the rf idw method was highly consistent with idw for precipitation interpolation along with altitude fig 18a and consistent with anusplin for temperature interpolation fig 18b coupled with the result from 10 fold cross validation the idw method had good performance for precipitation interpolation and the anusplin method had good performance for temperature interpolation suggesting rf idw may more effectively interpolate climate surfaces the values of the interpolated surface with anusplin and mlr were significantly higher than that with rf idw for precipitation interpolation in high altitude regions fig 18a based on the result of 10 fold cross validation anusplin rf idw and mlr potentially overestimated in the high altitude regions fig 17a the overestimation of anusplin and mlr implied better performance of rf idw for the interpolation of precipitation in the inconsistent region the values of the interpolated surface with both rf and mlr were lower than that with rf idw for temperature interpolation in high altitude regions fig 18b there was high consistency between rf idw and anusplin fig 18b considering the good performance of anusplin in interpolating temperature these conclusions suggest good performance of rf idw for temperature interpolation the trends of the consistency between rf idw and other methods along with the gradient of slope were similar to that of the gradient of altitude fig 18 considering the overestimation of all methods for precipitation interpolation in the steep region with 10 fold cross validation fig 17c the low value interpolated by rf idw compared to other methods indicated its good performance in steep regions fig 18c with the underestimation of mlr and rf for temperature interpolation in the steep region with 10 fold cross validation fig 17d the high value interpolated with rf idw also indicated good performance in the steep region fig 18d we conclude that the proposed method outperformed other methods in inconsistent regions especially steep regions 5 discussion and conclusion with significant global environmental changes and the emergent demand for improved ecological models it is necessary to achieve a precise meteorological interpolate in this study we coupled random forest and inverse distance weighting method to generate climate surfaces with multiple covariates through decomposition 5 1 implications of the proposed method decomposing is widely used in meteorological science larson et al 2017 in this study the meteorological variables were decomposed into a basic part and a local part to achieve an accurate meteorology interpolation the 10 fold cross validation showed that the rf idw method performed well for precipitation and temperature interpolation the rf idw method significantly improved the precision of the precipitation interpolation spatial comparison of the surface with the proposed method and other methods showed that the rf idw method is better in inconsistent regions this conclusion was further validated by the analysis of error and inconsistency along with terrain these results imply that the proposed method has significant potential for climate interpolation therefore it is reasonable approach to couple random forest and inverse distance weighting method for the spatial interpolation of meteorological information compared with other machine learning algorithms that use the whole data set the rf samples the training data based on a bootstrap technique through this method randomness was injected into the rf reducing the redundancy of explanatory variables is reduced and diversifying the forecast models decision trees he et al 2016 this reduces the correlation between trees that may result in overfitting combined with out of bag oob error a reasonable model with little overfitting will be achieved in rf with minimal training and testing fitting errors in the proposed method the basic part was assigned as a covariates in combing with the local part with rf the interpolated residual values and the trend were added together to produce the final predictions during the interpolation with the method of li et al 2011 even though the method of combination of rf and idw in different the result of the proposed method indicated the feasibility of rf in combing with interpolated method which is consistent with the result of li et al 2011 5 2 limitations of the proposed method however there are some limitations of this study first the decomposition method increased the complexity of the spatial interpolation with little improvement in the accuracy of temperature interpolation the proposed rf idw method is similar in accuracy compared to other methods however for precipitation interpolation the rf idw method offered improved accuracy second the basic part in this method was interpolated by the idw method although idw methods are considered as one of the standard spatial interpolation procedures further investigation is required to determine if the spatial relationship among meteorological locations without effects of terrain and land cover are proportional to distance burrough et al 1998 lu and wong 2008 on the other hand the uncertainty coming from idw should follow gaussian error propagation may also have great effects on the performance of the proposed method further work analyzing the uncertainty coming from idw should be made by comparing the integration with kriging spline third there are uncertainties of the validation of spatial comparison in this study all the meteorological stations were located in regions with altitude lower than 5000 m and the greatest inconsistency between the climate surface using the proposed method and other methods was observed in areas with altitude higher than 5000 m the potential trend of the error along with terrain at high altitude was used to indirectly identify the performance of each method in the high altitude the 10 fold cross validation was applied for the analysis of spatial comparison and inconsistency along with terrain we also explored the distributions of error for each method the 10 fold cross validation served as a secondary reference for the analysis in spatial comparison because of the inconsistent meteorological stations for spatial interpolation in the cross validation and spatial comparison even with the uncertainties of the spatial comparison validation the conclusions derived from spatial comparison were consistent with that of 10 fold and leave one region out cross validation fourth mean and total values annual and monthly in 2015 were applied to test the feasibility of the proposed interpolation method in this study the mean and total values can eliminate the influence of abnormal values on the performance validation extreme climate events such as flood and drought needs extreme values which are important in hydrology climatology and ecology how the performance of proposed method in the extreme value is unclear this also limited the application of the proposed method thanks to the large and complex study area and huge meteorological datasets the mean and total values may also have the potential to identify the performance of interpolated method annually and monthly mean temperature and total precipitation are important variables in ecology and hydrology which can also be applied to identify the performance of interpolated method bryan and adams 2002 wang and hou 2009 6 conclusion although there are some tradeoffs in the proposed method and the validation of spatial comparison 10 fold and leave one region out cross validation implied that the proposed method has good performance for precipitation and temperature interpolation the rf method is easily available and can efficiently be coupled with idw in the proposed method by decomposing the meteorological variables into basic and local parts the proposed method outperformed other methods in a complex and large region the proposed method has great potential in interpolating climate surface especially for precipitation interpolation credit authorship contribution statement jianbo tan conceptualization methodology writing original draft xinyao

4532,spatially interpolated temperature and precipitation are hydrological variables that are widely applied in models of ecology hydrology agronomy and other environmental sciences the accuracy of meteorological data directly determine model performance however the interpolation of temperature and precipitation over complex areas is affected by the value observed with surrounding meteorological stations and also by aspects of the physical environment such as terrain and land cover effects these effects significantly limit the precise interpolation of temperature and precipitation to normalize these effects a new method coupling random forest rf and inverse distance weighting idw was proposed rf idw the proposed method was applied to generate the climate surfaces of both precipitation and temperature in china in 2015 during the interpolation with rf idw the temperature and precipitation were decomposed into a basic part indicating the atmospheric properties and local parts representing the effects of the physical environment the complex correlations were determined between precipitation temperature and multiple covariates of landcover normalized difference vegetation index ndvi elevation slope longitude soil moisture latitude and land surface temperature lst derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data next 10 fold and leave one region out cross validation were applied to verify the accuracy of rf idw for the interpolation of meteorological values we also compared the rf idw performance to that of rf idw anusplin and mlr to further investigate its feasibility based on 10 fold cross validation the coefficient of determinations r2 between interpolated value and observed values were 0 962 for precipitation and 0 990 for temperature indicating that the rf idw can accurately interpolate climate surfaces the performance comparison showed that the rf idw reduced the mean absolute error by 55 mm to 120 mm for precipitation interpolation and 0 06 to 0 8 for temperature interpolation especially in the complex region the result of monthly interpolations implied the good robustness of the rf idw overall the proposed rf idw approach allows improved spatial interpolation of complex region and suggest alternate methods for the spatial interpolation of hydrological variables keywords spatial interpolation of meteorological variables random forest and inverse distance weighting multiple covariates china 1 introduction the spatially continuous surfaces of temperature and precipitation are hydrological variables that are used as key parameters for hydrological ecological and land surface processing models tan et al 2019a zhang et al 2020a during simulation spatial precipitation and temperature are primary inputs and the accuracy of these data have direct and great impact on hydrologic model performance seo et al 2019 with the growing evidence of climate change shifts in temperature and precipitation is highlighted in hydrometeorological studies and accurate spatial surface of these parameters are emergently required for accurate modelling additionally strategies for biological conservation and natural resource management also require spatially continuous environmental data li et al 2011 unfortunately spatially continuous surfaces of temperature and precipitation are usually not readily available because they are challenging to acquire especially for large and complex regions matos et al 2013 thornton et al 1997 most direct temperature and precipitation data are collected by meteorological stations stahl et al 2006 these data can be interpolated to obtain a spatially continuous climate surface over a region of interest which can facilitate decision making for scientists and environmental managers interpretation method is an important method to obtain the climate surfaces with the data of sparse stations viggiano et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b during spatial interpolation over complex areas the interpolated value of a position is not only determined by the data collected from surrounding meteorological stations but also the effects of environment induced by the physical variables of ground such as terrain and land cover effects dodson and marks 1997 stewart and nitschke 2017 therefore terrain and other physical variables as key factors influencing the spatial distribution of climate variables should be considered in interpolation bostan et al 2012 mcvicar and jupp 2002 price et al 2000 these physical variables can be included as independent variables within the interpolation method in extended and complex region alvarez et al 2014 and the effects of these physical variables on spatial meteorological patterns can be used to refine climate surfaces and improve overall interpolation accuracy thornton et al 1997 simple interpolation methods may fail to consider the effects of topography or other physical variables phillips et al 1992 and hybrid approaches were developed to achieve a more promising performance perry and hollis combined the regression model and idw to interpolate a monthly and annual gridded dataset over the uk perry and hollis 2005 li et al combined rf and svm with ok or ids especially in exploring rf in combination with ordinary kriging and idw li et al 2011 zhang et al found that the hybrid with svm model achieved superior results over idw ok and rk zhang et al 2017 the machine learning is increasing used in exploring the relationship between multiple covariate and meteorological value during climate surface interpolation with hybrid approaches for their robustness and accurate metrics however the effects of multiple covariates may be confusingly integrated with atmospheric properties during spatial interpolation in many interpolation methods which may obscure the effects of physical variables to more completely understand the mechanisms of the spatial distribution of meteorological variables and achieve better interpolation the effects of physical variables should be investigated inspired by the idea that the meteorological value of each position is determined by the value collected from neighboring meteorological stations and the effects of physical environment during interpolation each meteorological value was divided into two parts a basic part and a local part the basic part is the difference in atmospheric properties without the influence of local environment and the local part is the difference in climatic environment derived from the effects of local physical variables such as terrain or land cover this separation can allow the interpolation model to clearly reveal the trend of meteorological values and identify the effects of local physical variables in this study an interpolation method coupling random forest and inverse distance weighting rf idw method was proposed rf has been widely used to interpolate precipitation and temperature nashwan and shahid 2019 pang et al 2017 many researches have implied that rf can precisely capture the relationship between meteorological value and physical environment bhuiyan et al 2018 and rf has shown their superior performance in combination with other spatially interpolated methods li et al 2011 additionally fewer parameters must be set during the predicting with rf making it easier to identify the local parts breiman 2001 schumacher and herman 2018 for the basic part without the influence of physical environment atmospheric properties might gradually change with distance and inverse distance weighting idw can reveal these trend ware et al 1991 china has survived more than 1 4 billion people and there are increasing significant effects of climate change including floods droughts and extreme climate song et al 2011 thomas 2008 zhang et al 2020a therefore more precise knowledge of climate surfaces and changes in these surface are essential to identify hydrological status and the impacts of climate on agricultural production and to guide the decision making process however it is difficult to achieve an accurate interpolation in china for its complex environment stahl et al 2006 a precise interpolation method that considers the effects of multiple covariates is urgently desired to address this need the proposed method was developed and applied to interpolate temperature and precipitation of china in 2015 to assess the performance and feasibility proposed method was compared to the individual rf and idw methods thin plate smoothing splines anusplin and multiple linear regression mlr approaches the mostly applied methods that consider multiple covariates the main objectives of this study were to 1 propose an improved method for spatial interpolation of temperature and precipitation by decomposition 2 explore the effects of physical variables on the spatial distribution of meteorological variables 3 assess the performance of the proposed method for a large and complex region 2 study area and data 2 1 study area china is selected as the study area to validate the performance of the proposed method china has a complex terrain and a territory area of 9 600 000 km2 whose elevation spanning from 155 m to 8845 m fig 1 mountainous areas accounts for approximately 70 of the total land in china wei et al 2008 under the control of pacific and indian ocean monsoons the climate across china varies considerably with significant effects of terrain song et al 2011 2 2 meteorological data the raw station data of temperature and precipitation fig 1 were collected from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn to avoid the influence of abnormal values average values were selected for interpolation of temperature and total values were chosen for the interpolation of precipitation as typically used to measure the performance of the interpolation method bryan and adams 2002 through screening and eliminating abnormal data the average temperature and total precipitation annually and monthly of each station in 2015 were obtained tan et al 2016 2 3 multiple covariates multiple covariates are usually used as secondary information to improve interpolation performance li et al 2011 mcvicar and jupp 2002 terrain factors such as elevation slop aspect are correlative with the temperature and precipitation alvarez et al 2014 boer et al 2001 as well as the longitude latitude and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi appelhans et al 2015 attorre et al 2007 the land surface temperature lst is also widely used for the interpolation of temperature kilibarda et al 2014 stewart and nitschke 2017 and precipitation alvarez et al 2014 land cover can influence the spatial pattern of climate surfaces and was also used as covariates for interpolation bostan et al 2012 jarvis and stuart 2001 soil moisture data is vital in hydro meteorological application and also can affect the distributions of precipitation and temperature hazra et al 2019 kumar et al 2019 the multiple covariates for the interpolation are listed in table 1 elevation was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm at 30 m 30 m spatial resolution from usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov and the data of aspect and slope were derived from the digital elevation model dem data fig 2 we collected time series of the 1 km 8 day lst product mod11a2 and the 250 m 16 days averaged ndvi product mod13q1 of china in 2015 from land processes distributed active archive center lp daac fig 2 the longitude and latitude was calculated for the center location of each pixel fig 2 the data of land cover obtained from the products of mcd12q1 of china in 2015 which is also derived from lp daac and the classification system of igbp was used fig 2 the data of soil moisture was derived from soil moisture active passive smap satellite which is widely used to generate global surface soil moisture map with an l band radar active and radiometer bhuiyan et al 2020 hazra et al 2019 the annually and monthly average values of soil moisture lst and ndvi were calculated to be consistent with the meteorological values for interpolation the spatial resolution for interpolation used here was 500 m so the spatial resolution of data for each variable was resampled into 500 m using a nearest sampling method 3 methods 3 1 random forest algorithm rf methods can minimize variance and help avoid overfitting which have received a great deal of research interest and are widely used algorithms for this model construction breiman 2001 he et al 2016 rf algorithms are based on the premise that a set of predictors ensemble based perform better than an individual predictor rf add an additional layer of randomness using a bootstrap and aggregation bagging method and multiple decision trees to make predictions breiman 2001 duro et al 2012 the schematic of the rf algorithm was illustrated in fig 3 the bootstrap method was applied to sample m subsets from the original training data sets and decision trees dts of each subsets are generated using a random vector derived from the input covariates dts are a hierarchical analysis diagram composed of a collection of nodes and edges organized in a tree structure fig 3 he et al 2016 the decision tree model consist of two types of nodes split internal nodes and leaf terminal nodes a test function was associated with each split node to split the incoming data according to different attributes the test function was used to achieve best split selection based on attribute selection measures as decision tree model is nonparametric it is feasible to add either numeric or categorical data layers in rf rf trains each individual tree on bootstrap resamples of the total data set and the final result is decided by average or majority voting fig 3 in this way rf may avoid overfitting the training data set and perform good on the testing data compared to the standard decision tree model he et al 2016 in the bootstrap sampling method approximately about two thirds of the samples are used for training the trees and the remaining one third are used to obtain the out of bag obb error which was applied to estimate the performance of the model and guarantee its robustness breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 3 2 overview of rf idw method according to eq 1 temperature and precipitation data include a basic part associated with atmospheric properties that are not related to physical environment and a local part related to topography land cover and vegetation status the proposed method aims to acquire the physical variable induced variation and non physical variable related values 1 t p f f atmospheric p r o p e r t i e s f altitude f land cov e r f ndvi where t p is the value of temperature precipitation fatmospheric properties is factor of atmospheric properties which is the basic part faltitude f landcover fndvi are the factor of altitude landcover and vegetation status that cause the differences in climatic environment respectively which are the local part without the influencing of physical variables the meteorological value of each position is determined only by the atmosphere a climate surfaces might be smooth and could gradually change with distance so could be directly and precisely interpolated by idw basic parts ware et al 1991 including the effects of terrain and land surface local parts the climate surface is more heterogeneous fig 3 machine learning methods may be able to identify the interactions between basic parts and local environment rhee and im 2017 separation of these two components can improve the accuracy of interpolation rf can effectively construct interpolation model and presents better ability than other methods belgiu and drăguţ 2016 breiman 2001 which can be used to explore the effects of terrain and land surface on local parts the proposed method is summarized visually in fig 4 in the rf idw method rf was applied to predict the difference in climatic environment caused by the effects of physical variables local parts and the idw was used to simulate the trend of atmospheric properties basic parts fig 4 3 3 the workflow of rf idw to acquire the basic part the effects of physical variables on meteorological surface was firstly explored by using the relationship between them with rf the difference between observed value and predicted value with rf effects of physical variables is deemed the basic part in this manuscript and the basic part was regarded as a co variable in combining with local parts by rf the whole rf idw workflow includes three steps that are described in fig 5 a total of 633 and 638 samples for precipitation and temperature were applied to develop corresponding rf idw model acquiring the values of atmospheric properties of each meteorological station step 1 each value is deemed as a composition of a basic part and a local part in the rf idw method that must be separated the relationships between the value of each meteorological station and its multiple covariates were assessed with rf to explore the local value then the basic value of each meteorological station was defined as the difference between the actual value and local value by eq 1 interpolating the basic climate surface with idw and basic value step 2 after acquiring the basic values for each station the basic surface of atmospheric properties was interpolated using the idw method interpolating the climate surface by coupling physical variables and the basic climate surface with rf step 3 rf was also used to integrate the basic and local parts of the data the basic climate surface was regarded as a covariate in the interpolation model the relationships between the actual meteorological values and multiple covariates including basic parts were determined by training with rf to acquire the interpolation model finally the climate surfaces were acquired by importing the layers of multiple covariates and the basic climate surface into the established interpolation model 3 4 validation and performance comparison the importance and correlations were applied to show the relationship between co variables and annually meteorological values as follows the permutation feature importance measurement was applied to test and measure the importance of each variable by calculating the increase in the prediction error of the measurement after permuting the feature breiman 2001 a 10 fold cross validation cv technique were applied to evaluate the precision of interpolated surfaces alvarez et al 2014 the entire training data set of meteorological stations was randomly divided into 10 subsets with each subset containing approximately 10 of the training data hu et al 2017 next nine subsets were used for model training and applied for interpolations of the held out test subset during each round of cross validation the process was repeated 10 times until every subset was tested stahl et al 2006 then the r2 mean absolute error mae mean squared error rmse and standardized mean squared error smse between cv interpolations and observations were applied to assess the accuracy of the proposed model bostan et al 2012 hengl et al 2004 spadavecchia and williams 2009 the rmse and smse values are frequently used to measure the magnitude of error bostan et al 2012 the error along with terrain was identified we also calculated the importance of each input variable and illustrated the relationship between the result and multiple covariates using a response curve method tan et al 2019b the leave one region out validation method over complex terrain was applied to further understand the effects of a complex terrain during interpolation bhuiyan et al 2019 leave one region out validation was used to evaluate the model by testing the transferability of the method s calibration from other complex terrain regions to do this the study area was divided into three region based on china s three terrain ladders fig 1 wei et al 2017 two regions were used to train the model and the remaining region was used for validation this method was repeated three times to test the exclusion of all three regions to explore the performance of rf idw we compared the performance of the proposed method to these of other interpolation methods mlr anusplin rf and idw methods were compared with the proposed rf idw method using the same meteorological samples and input environmental layers to guarantee the consistency of input environment for comparison all methods applied same samples for the interpolation during each round of cross validation and leave one region out validation and so is the folds the r2 mae remse and smse values of each method were compared during cross validation for both interpolation of monthly and annual surface the annually climate surfaces determined by the proposed method and other methods were compared to identify inconsistent regions the inconsistent regions and cross validation were analyzed to indirectly evaluate the performance of each interpolation method 4 results and analysis 4 1 the importance effects and correlations of variables in rf idw in rf idw interpolation the permutation feature importance measurement as introduced by breiman was used to indicate the contribution of each variables to prediction breiman 2001 a higher importance score indicates greater important of the variable during interpolation fig 6 shows the variable importance and the 5 95 quantile of importance values fisher et al 2018 and its values was presented in table 2 for precipitation the basic value of idw had the highest importance with an increase of mae of 7 07 after permutation and has the widest interval between 5 and 95 importance fig 6 the lst was the most important variable for temperature interpolation with a mae increase of 17 2 after permutation indicating a significant determinant of the distribution of temperature for both temperature and precipitation the altitude basic value of idw latitude and lst were important variables during interpolation table 2 although aspect and land cover theoretically could influence the distribution of precipitation and temperature these effects may be small over a large area the altitude also contributed to in the interpolation model but with a smaller effects than expected it may result from that the relationship between temperature and altitude may not be obvious for a large and complex region diodato 2005 phillips et al 1992 the significance of each variable for the model was tested by janitza s method janitza et al 2016 the p value can be used to assess the statistical significance of a variable s contribution to interpolation where the value decrease with increased importance the p values for the variable are presented in fig 6 both for precipitation and temperature basic value of idw lst latitude altitude and longitude were statistically significant with a significance level of 95 during interpolation with the proposed method these results of significance are consistent with that of feature importance measurement mean decrease accuracy mda is an index that is widely used to assess the reduction of the accuracy of rf with the alteration of variables as shown in table 2 the permutation error is the median error of permutation feature importance over all repetitions which imply the importance of each variable for interpolation a larger mda value and larger permutation error correspond to greater variable importance the mda analysis indicated that basic value of idw is the most important variable during the interpolation of precipitation and lst is the most important for the interpolation of temperature which is consistent with the above conclusion derived from the feature importance the same conclusion was reached based on permutation error the mean of squared residuals and variables that explained the model for interpolating precipitation surface were 15741 7 mm and 96 11 respectively and those for interpolating temperature surface were 0 58 and 98 69 respectively overall the rf idw method achieved a promising performance in identifying the relationships between precipitation temperature and input variables accumulated local effects ale indicate how features influence the prediction of a machine learning model on average which has been widely used apley 2016 ale was computed as the accumulated differences over the conditional distribution and does not require the hypothesis that variables are independent the plot of ale fig 7 a clearly shows that the model for precipitation interpolation mainly relied on feature basic value of idw and latitude the model interpolating temperature surface mainly relied on lst basic value of idw and latitude fig 7b these conclusions are highly consistent with those after assessment of feature importance the observed temperature and precipitation varying across each variable were showed in fig 8 the response curves indicate the correlation between input co variables and meteorological values fig 8 the basic value of idw lst soil moisture and ndvi have positive impacts on precipitation and temperature additionally there is a significantly positive correlation between lst and temperature fig 8b the variables of altitude and latitude are negatively correlated with the meteorological values of temperature and precipitation the negative correlation between altitude and temperature was less significant than the positive correlation between lst and temperature this may explain why the altitude is not so significantly important in temperature interpolation the slope and precipitation exhibited slight effects on temperature with little importance in interpolation model 4 2 the interpolate surface with each method the interpolation results of different methods are presented in fig 9 there was a spatial consistency among the interpolating methods for the temperature and precipitation interpolation fig 9 all results showed highest interpolated precipitation in the south and south east region of china and low interpolated temperatures in the qinghai tibet plateau and the north east region of china as expected domrös and peng 2012 the difference among interpolated precipitation with different methods was relatively obvious compare to that of temperature fig 9 for example the interpolated precipitation was heavy in the south with the mlr method fig 9b5 while the other methods interpolated heavy precipitation in the south east and south parts of china compared with the other method the effects of terrain were considered during the interpolation with the proposed rf idw which exhibited a finer surface of precipitation fig 9b1 for the interpolation of temperature almost all methods considered the effects of terrain except for the idw fig 9 in the surface interpolated with idw cattle eyes occurred around the meteorological station fig 9a3 yang et al 2004 visually the surface of temperature interpolated with the proposed rf idw was a combination of the surfaces obtained using the idw and rf in general there were a few differences in the temperature surfaces derived from each interpolation method the kling gupta efficiency kge metric gupta et al 2009 provides three distinct components representing the correlation the bias and a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values which has been used to identify the relationship between simulated and observed values based on the kge values table 3 the interpolated values with idw rf are closed to the observed values the correlation coefficients for temperature and precipitation were both greater than 0 98 indicating a high consistency between observed value and interpolated value with idw rf additionally the bias values and the relative variability are almost equal to 1 indicating little bias between observed value and interpolated value overall the idw rf method had good performance for the interpolation of both temperature and precipitation table 4 4 3 cross validation the observed precipitation versus interpolated values of cv are plotted in fig 10 compared with other methods the interpolated values with rf idw were highly consistent with the observed values the rf idw and mlr methods underestimated the precipitation in high value range the r2 value of all methods were great than 0 80 except for mlr which was only 0 78 the rf idw method gave the highest r2 value 0 962 the observed temperatures versus interpolated values of cv are plotted in fig 11 same to the interpolation of precipitation the rf idw gave the highest consistency between the interpolated values and the observed value the r2 values of all methods were greater than 0 90 indicating good performance for the interpolation of temperature the rf idw method gave the highest r2 value 0 990 the error values the difference between observed value and interpolated value of each method were acquired and the result are shown in fig 12 for precipitation the value of error ranged from 210 mm to 190 mm fig 12a the rf idw method achieved the least error compared with other methods for the interpolation of precipitation followed by anusplin and idw for temperature the error almost ranged from 0 735 c to 0 598 c fig 12b compared with other methods the rf idw and anusplin were featured with low level error the mae values of precipitation were less than 200 mm for each method except for mlr and the mae values of temperature were all less than 1 c except for idw table 3 the proposed rf idw method was the only one method with mae less than 100 mm for precipitation interpolation and less than 0 5 c for temperature interpolation table 3 rsme and smse comparison showed the same trend rf idw reduced mae by 55 mm to 120 mm for precipitation interpolation and 0 06 c to 0 8 c for temperature interpolation indicating the feasibility of the proposed method the proposed method has significantly improved the interpolation accuracy for precipitation tan et al 2016 but only slight improvements in temperature interpolation overall the rf idw method achieved good agreement between cv estimates and observations for the interpolation of precipitation and temperature indicating the feasibility and potentiality of the proposed method to interpolate climate surfaces the leave one region out cross validation results are presented in fig 13 and table 2 in the 1st terrain ladders the proposed method significantly outperformed other methods for both temperature and precipitation interpolation fig 13 anusplin and idw methods significantly over estimated precipitation and temperature values fig 13 the 1st terrain ladders regions is a typical mountainous area consisting of plateaus mountains and deep valleys which is the most complex region of china tan et al 2017 the good performance of the proposed method in 1st indicates its feasibility for meteorological interpolation in the region of terrain the 2nd terrain ladders consists of hills and basins rf idw and anusplin methods have good performance for precipitation and temperature interpolation in this region fig 13 additionally mlr shows good performance for temperature interpolation the 3rd terrain ladders consists of plains and most methods under estimated the precipitation in this region fig 13 based on the leave one region out cross validation rf idw outperformed other methods in interpolating precipitation and temperature and mlr and anusplin also performed well table 3 fig 13 the conclusions based on the mae rmse and smse values of leave one region out cross validation are consistent with that of 10 fold cross validation table 3 overall the cross validation shows that the proposed method can be used for meteorological interpolation of regions with sparse meteorological stations and complex terrain the errors of the interpolation of monthly temperature and precipitation with cross validation were presented fig 14 the proposed rf idw outperformed other methods and mlr have a large error during the monthly precipitation interpolation during the monthly temperature interpolation both proposed rf idw and anusplin have good performance compared to other methods the result of the monthly interpolation with the proposed rf idw is similar to that of annual interpolation all the methods have higher error in the summer and lower error in the summer for the monthly precipitation interpolation which is contrary to the situation of monthly temperature interpolation fig 14 this may be the result that the variation of precipitation in the summer is larger than that in winter and the variation of temperature in the winter is larger than that in summer in china fig 14 the good performance of the proposed rf idw imply its good robustness to variation of meteorological value 4 4 spatial comparison spatial comparison of precipitation between the surface with rf idw and that derived from other methods was identified by obtaining the difference among them fig 15 the regions where rf idw overestimated rf were mainly located in the east of china jiangxi anhui and zhejiang provinces and the places where its precipitation are extremely high such as ya an and jinan fig 15a combined with the error with 10 fold cross validation the proposed rf idw method outperformed rf in the inconsistent areas the consistency between the surface of rf idw and idw was relatively high fig 15b and so was the consistency between the surface of rf idw and anusplin fig 15d the difference between the surface interpolated with rf idw and mlr was significant fig 15c the region with lower values of the surface interpolated by mlr than those of rf idw stretched across the northern china plain combined with the 10 fold cross validation results the rf idw method significantly outperformed mlr in inconsistent regions overall the precipitation interpolated by rf idw has high consistency with that with idw and anusplin which had better performance than mlr and rf rf idw mostly outperformed other methods in inconsistent areas cased on 10 fold cross validation for temperature the inconsistent regions between the surface interpolated by rf idw and that derived from other methods were mainly located in the qinghai tibet plateau and the north west part of china fig 16 higher values of the surface were interpolated by rf idw than those obtained by rf in the qinghai tibet plateau fig 16a the region of inconsistency between rf idw and mlr was similar to that between rf idw and rf fig 16c the difference between the surface interpolated by rf idw and idw methods was significant in the qinghai tibet plateau with a higher value of idw than that of rf idw fig 16b combined with the error of 10 fold cross validation the rf idw outperformed idw across inconsistent regions fig 16b there was high consistency between the surfaces generated by rf idw and anusplin fig 16d according to the error with 10 fold cross validation the rf idw showed good performance in plain regions compared to anusplin overall the interpolation of temperature with rf idw has high consistency with the surface interpolated by anusplin and both models significantly outperformed idw rf idw mostly outperformed other methods in inconsistent regions based on the error with 10 fold cross validation 4 5 the error and inconsistency along with terrain evaluating the error of each interpolating method along with altitude fig 17 a b the errors of precipitation and temperature interpolation were large in high altitude regions the rf idw method have good performance for precipitation and temperature interpolation in high altitude regions fig 17a b same to the error along with altitude the errors of precipitation and temperature interpolation were small in plains regions fig 17c d in the stepped region there were significantly higher errors for each method compared with the other methods the rf idw outperformed for temperature and precipitation interpolation in the steep region implying the proposed method may work better in complex region this conclusion is consistent with that derived from leave one region out cross validation fig 17c d the consistency between rf idw method and other methods along with the gradient of elevation were presented in fig 7 the inconsistency of precipitation and temperature between rf idw method and other methods were significant in the higher altitude region fig 18 a b this may be related to the sparse distribution of stations and complex terrain in the high altitude regions fig 1 the rf idw method was highly consistent with idw for precipitation interpolation along with altitude fig 18a and consistent with anusplin for temperature interpolation fig 18b coupled with the result from 10 fold cross validation the idw method had good performance for precipitation interpolation and the anusplin method had good performance for temperature interpolation suggesting rf idw may more effectively interpolate climate surfaces the values of the interpolated surface with anusplin and mlr were significantly higher than that with rf idw for precipitation interpolation in high altitude regions fig 18a based on the result of 10 fold cross validation anusplin rf idw and mlr potentially overestimated in the high altitude regions fig 17a the overestimation of anusplin and mlr implied better performance of rf idw for the interpolation of precipitation in the inconsistent region the values of the interpolated surface with both rf and mlr were lower than that with rf idw for temperature interpolation in high altitude regions fig 18b there was high consistency between rf idw and anusplin fig 18b considering the good performance of anusplin in interpolating temperature these conclusions suggest good performance of rf idw for temperature interpolation the trends of the consistency between rf idw and other methods along with the gradient of slope were similar to that of the gradient of altitude fig 18 considering the overestimation of all methods for precipitation interpolation in the steep region with 10 fold cross validation fig 17c the low value interpolated by rf idw compared to other methods indicated its good performance in steep regions fig 18c with the underestimation of mlr and rf for temperature interpolation in the steep region with 10 fold cross validation fig 17d the high value interpolated with rf idw also indicated good performance in the steep region fig 18d we conclude that the proposed method outperformed other methods in inconsistent regions especially steep regions 5 discussion and conclusion with significant global environmental changes and the emergent demand for improved ecological models it is necessary to achieve a precise meteorological interpolate in this study we coupled random forest and inverse distance weighting method to generate climate surfaces with multiple covariates through decomposition 5 1 implications of the proposed method decomposing is widely used in meteorological science larson et al 2017 in this study the meteorological variables were decomposed into a basic part and a local part to achieve an accurate meteorology interpolation the 10 fold cross validation showed that the rf idw method performed well for precipitation and temperature interpolation the rf idw method significantly improved the precision of the precipitation interpolation spatial comparison of the surface with the proposed method and other methods showed that the rf idw method is better in inconsistent regions this conclusion was further validated by the analysis of error and inconsistency along with terrain these results imply that the proposed method has significant potential for climate interpolation therefore it is reasonable approach to couple random forest and inverse distance weighting method for the spatial interpolation of meteorological information compared with other machine learning algorithms that use the whole data set the rf samples the training data based on a bootstrap technique through this method randomness was injected into the rf reducing the redundancy of explanatory variables is reduced and diversifying the forecast models decision trees he et al 2016 this reduces the correlation between trees that may result in overfitting combined with out of bag oob error a reasonable model with little overfitting will be achieved in rf with minimal training and testing fitting errors in the proposed method the basic part was assigned as a covariates in combing with the local part with rf the interpolated residual values and the trend were added together to produce the final predictions during the interpolation with the method of li et al 2011 even though the method of combination of rf and idw in different the result of the proposed method indicated the feasibility of rf in combing with interpolated method which is consistent with the result of li et al 2011 5 2 limitations of the proposed method however there are some limitations of this study first the decomposition method increased the complexity of the spatial interpolation with little improvement in the accuracy of temperature interpolation the proposed rf idw method is similar in accuracy compared to other methods however for precipitation interpolation the rf idw method offered improved accuracy second the basic part in this method was interpolated by the idw method although idw methods are considered as one of the standard spatial interpolation procedures further investigation is required to determine if the spatial relationship among meteorological locations without effects of terrain and land cover are proportional to distance burrough et al 1998 lu and wong 2008 on the other hand the uncertainty coming from idw should follow gaussian error propagation may also have great effects on the performance of the proposed method further work analyzing the uncertainty coming from idw should be made by comparing the integration with kriging spline third there are uncertainties of the validation of spatial comparison in this study all the meteorological stations were located in regions with altitude lower than 5000 m and the greatest inconsistency between the climate surface using the proposed method and other methods was observed in areas with altitude higher than 5000 m the potential trend of the error along with terrain at high altitude was used to indirectly identify the performance of each method in the high altitude the 10 fold cross validation was applied for the analysis of spatial comparison and inconsistency along with terrain we also explored the distributions of error for each method the 10 fold cross validation served as a secondary reference for the analysis in spatial comparison because of the inconsistent meteorological stations for spatial interpolation in the cross validation and spatial comparison even with the uncertainties of the spatial comparison validation the conclusions derived from spatial comparison were consistent with that of 10 fold and leave one region out cross validation fourth mean and total values annual and monthly in 2015 were applied to test the feasibility of the proposed interpolation method in this study the mean and total values can eliminate the influence of abnormal values on the performance validation extreme climate events such as flood and drought needs extreme values which are important in hydrology climatology and ecology how the performance of proposed method in the extreme value is unclear this also limited the application of the proposed method thanks to the large and complex study area and huge meteorological datasets the mean and total values may also have the potential to identify the performance of interpolated method annually and monthly mean temperature and total precipitation are important variables in ecology and hydrology which can also be applied to identify the performance of interpolated method bryan and adams 2002 wang and hou 2009 6 conclusion although there are some tradeoffs in the proposed method and the validation of spatial comparison 10 fold and leave one region out cross validation implied that the proposed method has good performance for precipitation and temperature interpolation the rf method is easily available and can efficiently be coupled with idw in the proposed method by decomposing the meteorological variables into basic and local parts the proposed method outperformed other methods in a complex and large region the proposed method has great potential in interpolating climate surface especially for precipitation interpolation credit authorship contribution statement jianbo tan conceptualization methodology writing original draft xinyao

4533,terrestrial water storage tws is a crucial indicator of regional water balance and water resources changes due to limited hydrological observations we combined the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo products using the long short term memory lstm neural network to monitor the tws changes from april 2002 to march 2020 over the closed qaidam basin in northwest china and examined the impacts of climate and meteorological changes on tws variations the results indicated that the lstm model driven by the cumulative precipitation temperature and global land data assimilation system datasets was reliable for use in reconstruction of the grace products in the closed basin the tws variations featured seasonal variation characteristics and a significant upward trend at internal annual scales which were tested via linear statistics and a modified mann kendall method the increasing trend is likely to remain strongly sustainable in the near future with a hurst index over 0 75 in most regions moreover the tws oscillation has a periodicity and nonlinearity increase trend of 0 43 mm month as observed using ensemble empirical mode decomposition analysis and the tws components including snow water equivalent soil moisture and groundwater demonstrate discordant increasing trends in the basin under climate change conditions teleconnection factors have strong impacts on tws variability particularly for the pacific decadal oscillation index with a significant negative correlation by cross wavelet transform technology nonetheless the increase in tws is primarily influenced by precipitation increases and is more sensitive to the accumulated precipitation in this region in this study the grace products in combination with grace fo data may help us to better understand the spatiotemporal characterization of tws in qaidam basin which will provide an important support for the water resource management and ecological environment protection in such data scarce regions keywords grace terrestrial water storage long short term memory ensemble empirical mode decomposition qaidam basin 1 introduction qaidam basin in the tibetan plateau with abundant natural resources i e oil coal and a variety of metal deposits but a shortage in water resources is one of the three largest inland basins in china with global warming and social development serious environmental problems have emerged gradually in qaidam basin such as soil salinization groundwater abstraction and urban waterlogging duan 2018 huang et al 2020 terrestrial water storage tws which is composed of aboveground snow ice and surface water and belowground soil moisture and groundwater is a critical component in the land water cycle rodell and famiglietti 1999 behrangi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 meng et al 2019 sun et al 2020 tws comprehensively reflects precipitation p runoff r and evapotranspiration et changes investigating and understanding the spatiotemporal properties of tws are indispensable which can provide significant implications for the effective management of water resources troch et al 2007 yang et al 2017 however owing to the scarce in situ observation sites in remote areas jiang et al 2021 particularly in high mountains it is difficult for us to observe and comprehend the tws dynamics in qaidam basin since march 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission was implemented and recognized as an effective tool for detecting the tws variability with a precision of 1 0 1 5 cm across the globe on a monthly time resolution tapley et al 2004 andersen and hinderer 2005 bibi et al 2019 in previous studies grace gravity anomalies usually in combination with global land data assimilation system gldas data have represented a significant application prospect primarily in monitoring the water budget variations at multiple spatiotemporal scales guo et al 2016 ndehedehe et al 2016 behrangi et al 2017 retrieving groundwater tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 bibi et al 2019 and quantifying drought cao et al 2015 thomas et al 2017 tapley et al 2019 wang et al 2020a grace ended on october 2017 tapley et al 2019 as the successor of grace grace follow on grace fo satellites were launched in may 2018 and has been providing new grace fo data by continuously monitoring the water in lakes rivers soil underground areas etc boergens et al 2020 with the development of grace fo satellites longer grace product sequences could be made available for use in studying tws variations the longer period coverage of the grace tws sequences makes it with greater application utility in hydrometeorological field however due to the existence of a data gap for the period july 2017 to may 2018 there has been a very limited number of studies on tws characteristics by combining the grace and grace fo missions boergens et al 2020 wang et al 2020b landerer et al 2020 machine learning techniques have been utilized in hydrology fields to resolve some difficult problems including drought forecasting dikshit et al 2021 predicting the water table depth zhang et al 2018 merging satellite and rain gauge precipitation wu et al 2020 and reconstructing grace data sun et al 2019 2020 dikshit et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 and wu et al 2020 developed the long short term memory lstm architecture to simulate target values and demonstrated that the lstm model was a useful alternative approach for the data gaps existing between the grace and grace fo products some scholars have utilized machine learning technology for its reconstruction but there have been unsatisfactory results in qaidam basin such as those obtained in a study by sun et al 2020 thus this study focuses on the lstm model for filling in the grace data gaps some previous studies have been undertaken on the variations in tws by applying the grace and gldas datasets in qaidam basin for example jiao et al 2015 investigated spatiotemporal distribution changes in tws and discussed the influencing factors including precipitation and temperature meng et al 2019 reported the seasonal and annual changes in tws and their possible causes e g precipitation and evapotranspiration in the tibetan plateau which mainly focused on revealing the impacts of meteorological variables on the tws however the correlations analysis between tws and climate indices e g el niño southern oscillation enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo are relatively few in qaidam basin while these correlations have been highlighted that the teleconnection factors can profoundly affect the tws changes in other regions such as the sichuan basin yangtze river basin africa and east african great lakes region yao et al 2016 becker et al 2010 anyah et al 2018 hence it is imperative to dissect the response of tws to the variability of teleconnection factors in qaidam basin therefore the purpose of this study was to analyze the spatiotemporal characterization of tws and possible causes by combing grace and grace fo data in the closed qaidam basin china first the missing monthly data between the grace and grace fo products were reconstructed by using the lstm model then the spatiotemporal patterns of tws including its components from april 2002 to march 2020 were identified using different statistical analysis methods finally the correlations and links between the grace based tws and climate indices meteorological factors were analyzed via the time series correlation cross wavelet transform method and comparative analysis the finding of this study will provide new prospects and improved understanding of the tws changes twsc in qaidam basin 2 study area and data 2 1 study area enclosed with an inland arid desert qaidam basin is located between 34 30 n 40 n and 87 30 e 99 20 e in the northwestern area of qinghai province and the northeastern region of the tibetan plateau china with an area of about 250 000 km2 hu and jiao 2015 the basin is surrounded by the altun kunlun and qilian mountains the basin reaches elevations in the range of 2638 6594 m above sea level fig 1 a and is covered with saline materials a wide range of soil types and unevenly distributed surface water resources comprising lakes rivers permanent ice and snow as shown in fig 1b bibi et al 2019 in qaidam basin the monthly precipitation gradually decreases from east 40 8 mm to west 2 2 mm fig 1c and is mainly concentrated in the summer the regional mean monthly air temperature was 0 59 c fig 1d during the study period with strong solar radiation a long sunshine duration and vigorous evaporation of 1974 3000 mm bibi et al 2018 2019 making the region prone to drought this study area is primarily affected by the strong plateau monsoon and weak westerly circulation which is typical of a plateau continental climate 2 2 grace data currently monthly grace spherical harmonics sh and mass concentration mascon data are primarily acquired through the center for space research at the university of texas csr http www2 csr utexas edu grace german research center for geosciences gfz http isdc gfz potsdam de grace isdc and jet propulsion laboratory jpl https grace jpl nasa gov sun et al 2020 there are a variety of processing algorithms and models that correct for the glacial isostatic adjustment between the sh and mascon solutions to calculate the tws value based on grace data namely the sh method utilizes global sh basis functions for parameterizing and simplifying the earth gravity field model egfm but its mass variations feature obvious errors in the grace satellite estimates and the solving process of the egfm wang et al 2020a the mascon solutions employ regional mascon functions to parameterize the egfm and do not require glacial isostatic adjustments moreover the products of mascon solutions with high precision grace data are provided on a high resolution grid particularly for csr rl06 on a 0 25 grid considering the above factors and for the purposes of dissecting the tws variations over the small scale qaidam basin we selected the grace grace fo csr rl06 mascon solutions v2 data from april 2000 to march 2020 with the monthly average data removed from january 2004 to december 2009 more information about csr rl06 can be found in the literature e g save et al 2016 due to technical issues the grace grace fo product has missing data in some months and an 11 month data gap although the missing data can be remedied by a widely used linear interpolation method using neighboring months meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a this approach lacks data smoothness and does not consider the seasonality of tws in this study the six point spline interpolation method was employed to fill in the one to two months of missing data zheng et al 2014 we then utilized machine learning technology to bridge the data gaps between the grace and grace fo products to analyze the successive change characteristics of tws in qaidam basin from april 2002 to march 2020 the machine learning model is introduced in section 3 1 2 3 gldas data gldas is an important data source for global change and water cycle research cooperatively developed by the goddard space flight center of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the national center for environmental prediction ncep of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa using data assimilation techniques and combining ground observations and satellite remote sensing data to drive land surface models gldas includes the mosaic noah community land model and variable infiltration capacity model tian et al 2010 the gldas products have approximately 36 global scale and gridded form land surface field variables i e precipitation temperature air surface skin and soil evapotranspiration runoff surface and baseflow groundwater snow and soil moisture content these data were obtained from https disc gsfc nasa gov gldas at present the gldas dataset is reliable and appropriate for use in the verification and comparison of grace products yao et al 2016 wang et al 2020a particularly for its highest 0 25 resolution noah land surface model lsm that is matched at spatial scales with grace grace fo csr rl06 mascon data therefore we utilized the partial hydrological and meteorological variables from the gldas noah lsm l4 monthly 0 25 0 25 v2 1 product to retrieve tws for repairing the grace products the gldas based tws is computed by using the snow water equivalent swe soil moisture sm depths including 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm layers recorded as soil10 soil40 soil100 and soil200 respectively and canopy interception ci data from the gldas noah lsm products sun et al 2020 to bring the data into correspondence with the grace based tws anomalies dataset the gldas based tws was processed by removing the monthly average from january 2004 to december 2009 to acquire the gldas based tws anomalies the groundwater gw storage dataset not contained in gldas noah lsm products is acquired from the gldas catchment lsm product with a 0 25 daily resolution wang et al 2020c and its anomalies was removed the mean value from january 2004 to december 2009 as well 2 4 climate data global climate change has an indirect impact on tws variations we used two significant climate variables from april 2002 to march 2020 i e the multivariate enso index and pdo the enso index version 2 has positive values indicating el niño and negative values indicating la niña and is represented by the noaa physical sciences laboratory by combining the empirical orthogonal function of oceanic and atmospheric variables yao et al 2016 anyah et al 2018 the monthly data can be obtained from https www psl noaa gov enso mei the pdo has positive negative values indicating the climate anomaly patterns and is available from the noaa national centers for environmental information for modulating the interannual related teleconnections of enso the monthly data can be obtained from https www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections pdo 2 5 meteorological observation data meteorological changes have a direct impact on tws variations two meteorological variables the in situ month precipitation extracted from china gauge based monthly precipitation analysis product cpap v2 0 and temperature extracted from china gauge based monthly temperature analysis product ctap v2 0 were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn the 0 5 resolution cpap and ctap are generated using the thin plate splines method for chinese topography with the data coming from 2400 meteorological stations and 0 05 resolution gtopo30 data owing to their satisfactory quality shen et al 2010 the cpap and ctap datasets were used in this study and resampled to 0 25 resolution datasets via bilinear interpolation to match other datasets additionally their anomalies were processed by detaching the mean from january 2004 to december 2009 to match the grace based tws anomaly dataset 3 methodology 3 1 lstm neural network the lstm neural network is a type of recurrent neural network rnn in a time series which is suitable for processing and predicting important events with relatively long intervals dikshit et al 2021 the rnn features a memory module for retaining past information in the hidden layer which differs from traditional neural networks a gradient vanishing problem arises however due to a gradual decline in the network s ability to perceive past information of the time series and the rnn cannot control the content of the memory module zhang et al 2018 this long term dependency problem can be overcome by explicitly designing the lstm networks the lstm neurons consist of a cell state storing the past long term information an input gate to determine the input information of the network cell state at the present moment a forget gate to delete some of the cell state information from the previous time steps and an output gate that confirms the output information of the cell state wu et al 2020 the architecture of the lstm model was provided by dikshit et al 2021 the forcing data for the cpap precipitation ctap temperature and gldas based tws data were used to drive the lstm model for reconstructing the grace based tws data specifically owing to the great variability of the tws with the time series in qaidam basin the training and testing periods were divided by random sampling in order to reduce the random error 80 and 90 of the samples from the grace and grace fo eras were used to train the model simultaneously and 20 and 10 of the samples were used to measure the predictive performance of the trained model at the grid scale respectively under the premise that the model has a good simulation effect on assessments of the lstm model and because of the short history of grace products all samples were used for retraining the model and simulating the grace based tws anomaly time series by the trained models from july 2017 to may 2018 to yield better prediction results in the testing period the correlation coefficient cc normalized root mean square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to assess the performance of the lstm model the cc with values ranging from 1 to 1 expressed the correlation between the target and reference data jiang et al 2018 the nrmse with an optimal value of 0 expressed the global fitness of the lstm neural network and the nse with a value of to 1 expressed the relative magnitude of the residual variance between the target and observed values these performance metrics have been highlighted for the assessment of machine learning models in the recent study by sun et al 2020 3 2 trend analysis method the mann kendall mk trend test as a nonparametric statistical test method that is not affected by sample values and distribution types is widely recommended by the world meteorological organization to dissect the data trend in time series jiang et al 2019 nevertheless the results of the mk test are sometimes influenced by the persistence of hydrometeorological series including underestimating the trend for a given dataset the modified mk mmk trend test approach proposed by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 for eliminating the lag 1 autocorrelation of the time series and considering the related robustness of the autocorrelation is more credible for acquiring the data series trend for a group of independent samples under a given significance level α the standard statistical variable z is calculated if z 0 the data sequence has an upward trend if z 0 the data sequence has a downward trend when the absolute z value 1 65 1 96 and 2 58 there is a significant trend at the significance levels of 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 respectively in this study the mmk method was used to quantify the grace based tws trends in qaidam basin at a significance level of 0 1 the rescaled range analysis r s is a fractal theory proposed by hurst and improved by mandelbrot and wallis and it can be used to study the internal principles of hydrometeorological elements hamed 2007 the hurst index is the target value in the r s method which is used to reflect the persistence or anti persistence strength of the data series if the hurst value is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 0 5 the data series has inverse persistence in the upcoming time period compared with that at the current stage if the hurst value is 0 5 the data series has randomness if the hurst value is in the range of 0 5 1 the trend direction of the data series in the future stage is consistent with that in the current stage here we utilized the r s analysis method to investigate the internal regularity of the tws ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd a more robust ensemble method proposed by wu and huang 2004 2009 on the basis of empirical mode decomposition emd can be used to describe the non stationarity and nonlinearity in climate and hydrological elements duan et al 2019 eemd can analyze the internal evolution process of hydrometeorological variables on multiple time scales the eemd is produced by adding a white noise sequence to the original data sequence to alleviate the influence of mode mixing on emd which is divorced from the constraint of the fourier transform the procedure of eemd to decompose the components of different scales from the original data series is described by sun et al 2017 in this study we utilized the eemd matlab code from a previous study by wu and huang 2009 and the times and standard deviations of adding white noise were set to 100 and 0 01 respectively cross wavelet transform combines the wavelet transform with cross spectrum to reflect the links between two signals in the time and frequency fields from the multiple timescales and also can reveal the interaction significance between the two sequences in various time frequency domain wang et al 2020a the details of cross wavelet transform method can be found in grinsted et al 2004 and wang et al 2020a the flow chart of the study is shown in fig 2 4 results 4 1 evaluation of lstm for estimating tws anomalies fig 3 displays the magnitudes and spatial distributions of cc nrmse and nse for the lstm models for 41 and 20 test samples including the lstm p model which is run by the precipitation temperature and gldas based tws and the lstm cp model which is driven by the cumulative precipitation temperature and gldas based tws during the same testing period the lstm cp model presented a much better performance than that of the lstm p model in terms of the values of three statistical metrics for instance at 10 of the samples the cc of the lstm cp model is in the range of 0 58 to 0 91 and has a mean value of 0 62 with a low mean nrmse of 0 22 and an nse over 0 at most grids these results are better in this region than those reported by in sun et al 2020 however the lstm p model has a relatively small mean cc of 0 33 mean nrmse of 0 27 and poor nse values this could be because the cumulative precipitation is more closely related to the tws changes compared with the precipitation in the closed basin as the number of training samples increases from 80 to 90 which can lessen the random error affecting the forecast results the accuracy of the lstm cp model significantly improves while the opposite occurs for the lstm p model importantly the response of water storage to precipitation and cumulative precipitation is diverse generally the lstm models especially for the lstm cp model are reliable and acceptable for use in repairing the grace based tws over qaidam basin therefore we used all the samples to train the lstm cp model and interpolate the grace based tws anomalies from july 2017 to may 2018 this program with 95 of the samples for the training period can enhance the performance of the lstm cp model for restoring data gaps 4 2 verification of grace based tws it is necessary to evaluate the quality of satellite hydrometeorological products before use thus the tws be tws determined from the budget equation tws swe sm ci gw was applied to verify the accuracy of the grace based tws product following the common practices in existing studies bibi et al 2019 wang et al 2020c in addition based on the water balance p r et twsc we used the cpap precipitation and gldas evapotranspiration data to calculate the tws wb tws without considering the runoff in the qaidam basin meng et al 2019 bibi et al 2019 the be tws and wb tws series are reliable references for good validation of grace based tws product it can be seen from fig 4 that there is a notably consistency cc of 0 91 between the grace based and be tws variations in qaidam basin the values of the grace based tws anomalies were in the range of 48 2 to 155 4 mm while that of the be tws anomalies ranged from 20 5 to 106 8 mm the variation amplitude of the tws obtained from different products is relatively large probably because lake volume glacier mass balance ground ice stored in permafrost are the components of tws and included in computing the grace product but is excluded in the be tws with a relatively gentle evolution process from the water balance validation it can be observed that the grace based tws anomalies has prominent agreement cc of 0 82 with the wb tws series and they feature similar change process the values of the wb tws anomalies were in the range of 41 6 to 151 4 mm which are consistent with variation range of grace based tws however there are some errors between 50 mm month and 50 mm month for some specific months which may be due to the wb tws does not contain the water consumed by human beings and supplied by thawing the frozen soil glacier and snow in addition there is an apparent correlation between precipitation and the grace based tws jiao et al 2015 bibi et al 2019 similar results can be seen in fig 4 for example in months with abundant precipitation grace based tws anomalies have peak values with a time lag and there are inconsistent fluctuations between the precipitation and grace based tws for the reconstruction of tws the lstm cp simulated series had segments similar to the raw grace and grace fo data the lstm cp estimated tws values were nearly in the range of be tws to wb tws values and it had very similar evolution process with the be tws and wb tws sequences from july 2017 to may 2018 overall the grace product is in good agreement with the regularity and differential fluctuations of the be tws wb tws and precipitation the changes in the grace based tws are consistent with the existing studies meng et al 2019 therefore the performance of the grace based tws is reliable which provides great confidence and certainty for further investigation of tws variation characteristics in qaidam basin 4 3 spatiotemporal patterns of tws to investigate the tws spatial characteristics in qaidam basin the spatial variations of monthly and seasonal average tws values are demonstrated in fig 5 the monthly average tws value is the average value of many years in the same month and the seasonal average tws value is the average value of many years in the same season divided by three for mar may as spring jun aug as summer sep nov as autumn and dec feb as winter the regional mean values of tws anomalies in qaidam basin from january to december were 20 69 0 62 0 39 3 58 3 91 0 58 13 85 18 34 15 12 10 26 8 29 and 7 33 mm respectively while they were 5 26 16 39 16 83 and 7 11 mm in the spring summer autumn and winter respectively obviously the spatial distributions of tws anomalies are inconsistent with values below 20 mm from february to june but were relatively consistent with its values of 5 70 mm from july to january with decreasing variation from southwest to northeast especially with significantly positive signals in january moreover distinct patterns of monthly and seasonal tws anomalies were observed between the southwest i e kunlun mountain and northeast i e qilian mountain of qaidam basin in the southwest of qaidam basin the tws anomalies values were larger and it was easier to identify positive signals than in the northeast of qaidam basin except in april and may in the spring the tws had obvious spatial heterogeneity and larger spatial variation amplitudes compared with that in other seasons these results are crucially affected by the spatiotemporal distribution of meteorological variables bibi et al 2019 meng et al 2019 including precipitation and temperature fig 6 displays the temporal evolution characteristics of the tws in qaidam basin during the study period including the associated monthly seasonal and annual changes the tws featured an obvious upward trend at inter annual scales for instance the tws anomaly values were less than 0 mm in most months and seasons from april 2002 to december 2007 were higher than 0 mm from january 2008 to december 2016 and exceeded 90 mm in august 2012 and 50 mm in summer autumn 2012 subsequently there was more significant increasing trend from 2017 onward and it surpassed 60 mm after august 2018 furthermore the tws has the characteristics of seasonal variations and increase decrease increase change patterns with the time series that is its anomalies are prone to peak values in summer or autumn and are prone to low or decreasing values in spring qaidam basin is a structurally closed area with a relatively independent water circulation system for the basin precipitation is major natural supply mode for tws because it is a long process for surface water to form groundwater and then overflow out of the basin evapotranspiration is the major natural excretion mode for tws the tws changes in qaidam basin have a certain correlation with the precipitation and temperature bibi et al 2019 the air temperature forces the tws to increase or decrease by affecting the regional evapotranspiration and seasonal frozen soil covering the basin in summer higher temperatures thaw the frozen soil and heavy precipitation resulting in large amounts of evapotranspiration that allows the tws supply to exceed the excretion amount the surplus amount of tws accumulates in the following season therefore the tws anomaly values occasionally peak in autumn as shown in fig 6b there was a high probability of low tws volume occurring in the spring with less precipitation and lower temperatures as also found in fig 5 4 4 variation trend characteristics of tws the trend characteristics of the monthly and seasonally gridded tws based on linear trends mmk trend tests and r s analyses are shown in fig 7 in the spring summer autumn and winter the regional average linear slope values of tws in qaidam basin were 0 30 0 48 0 41 0 42 and 0 41 mm month the regional average z values were 1 88 2 29 2 14 2 08 and 2 18 and the regional average hurst index values were 0 55 0 81 0 80 0 79 and 0 87 respectively indicating that the tws variations increased for monthly and seasonal scales there were differences in the tws trend characteristics in various regions specifically the tws showed an upward trend in most regions with a linear trend range of 0 04 1 6 mm month especially with respect to the remarkable increasing trend in the southwest of qaidam basin in the spring and summer the trend was negligibly downward for the same grids these results are consistent with the results of the mmk trend test except for some grids in autumn the area percentage of the tws with an increasing trend was greatest in areas where the z values were over 1 96 through the r s analysis method it was found that the tws was strongly sustainable on a monthly scale with a hurst index over 0 75 illustrating that the upcoming tws variation is consistent with the current tws trend although the tws presented a weakly anti persistence in spring with a hurst index below 0 5 in the east of the basin a strong persistence was notable in summer autumn and winter in general this finding reveals that the tws variations in qaidam basin have been increasing over the past two decades and they are likely to continue increasing for the foreseeable future the regional average tws anomalies in qaidam basin were decomposed into six components and a variation trend using the eemd method fig 8 the variation trend featured nonlinear variation characteristics the eemd analysis displayed an increasing trend which was close to the linear trend with a slope of 0 43 mm month from april 2002 to march 2020 in the bottom panel this is consistent with the results shown in fig 7 these six components represent the tws amplitude characteristics at different timescales and the oscillation frequency changes from high to low from imf1 to imf6 which implies that the period had an increase from top to bottom in terms of the oscillation characteristics of imfs at various timescales we calculate each component s mean period which is defined as the mean interval among extrema maxima in imf1 imf5 and between adjacent minima in imf6 sun et al 2017 it can be seen from fig 8a f that the mean periods of imf1 imf6 are approximately 4 8 17 31 86 and 143 months respectively the periodicities 12 months of the dominant modes of imf1 and imf2 fully reflect the seasonal characteristics of the tws imf3 imf5 represent the tws inter annual properties and imf6 indicates that the tws has an inter decadal quasi periodic this emphasizes that the tws variations feature periodicity and the mean periods of imfs are its main oscillation periods wu and huang 2009 4 5 temporal changes of the tws components the detailed tws components analysis can provide further knowledge of tws variation fig 9 presents the temporal evolution characteristics of snow water equivalent soil moisture and groundwater in the qaidam basin the three tws components exhibit an inconsistent increase from april 2002 to march 2020 in the basin as shown in fig 9a the average snow water equivalent anomalies has a faint upward trend of 0 0007 mm month and some outstanding values in individual month such as it reaching 1 55 mm on january 2008 and exceeding 1 mm on four specific time points i e november 2013 november 2018 january 2019 and 2020 fig 9b illustrates that the time series of soil moisture anomalies shows an increasing trend of 0 0362 mm month and the temporal evolution is that first it rising 2002 04 2011 next descending 2011 2016 then ascending after 2016 again these changes are slightly consistent with that of tws similarly the groundwater series has a prominent upward trend of 0 22 mm month fig 9c and it also features more homologous temporal evolution characteristics with the tws there have been illustrated that the groundwater storage has an apparent increasing trend during 2003 2012 using in situ observations jiao et al 2015 and groundwater increase is the most contribution of tws increase in the basin jiao et al 2015 bibi et al 2019 meng et al 2019 4 6 relationship between the tws and influencing factors to better understand the link between the tws and climate indices two climate variables were denoised by using a five month moving window and the smoothed tws anomalies were normalized fig 10 a to be consistent with the smoothed tws anomalies the precipitation and temperature anomalies are also handled by the moving window thereafter the time series of the precipitation anomalies are accumulated to reflect the dry wet conditions and comprehend the response of tws to the cumulative effects of precipitation in qaidam basin because of the strong seasonal variations in air temperature it is difficult to identify the relationship between the tws and temperature at a monthly scale and the monthly mean temperature anomalies within the year are taken as the annual temperature values the time series of cumulative precipitation monthly precipitation annual temperature and tws anomalies are displayed throughout the study period as shown in fig 10b there were dry episodes of el niño around 2010 and 2016 and wet conditions under la niña in 2011 for qaidam basin as shown in fig 10a these findings are relatively consistent with the observed 2010 drought and 2011 wetter period there were significant discrepancies in the change in amplitude between the tws and enso although they tended to oppose one another thus other factors such as the pdo are attributed to these differences similarly long term positive tws anomalies during 2011 2015 had a significant negative pdo phase and the extreme dry wet conditions in this region were correlated with pdo events there was a negative correlation of 0 17 between the tws and pdo in qaidam basin indicating closer relationship compared with the one between tws and enso however the correlation between tws and enso was not significant during the study period except for after june 2017 with a positive correlation of 0 86 as displayed in table 1 this change is consistent with the results of yao et al 2016 fig 11 shows the cross wavelet energy spectrum for revealing the links between the tws and teleconnection factors from august 2002 to march 2020 in qaidam basin the effective spectral regions are exhibited inside the cone of influence with the thin solid line whose boundary effect and outside areas are not considered as presented in fig 11a there is a resonance period between the enso and tws at the 95 confidence level with a 3 15 month signal appearing in 2009 2012 and they have a significant positive correlation with a 8 12 month signal occurring in 2014 2016 similarly under the 95 confidence level the pdo has a prominent negative correlation with tws series with a 8 14 month signal arising in 2005 2006 whilst it also has an obvious negative association with tws with a 10 13 month signal appearing in 2010 2013 and features an ambiguous correlation with a 6 11 month signal occurring in 2015 2017 fig 11b moreover the two teleconnection factors have short term intermittent resonance periods against the tws with low 8 months over the study period the results in the cross wavelet transforms are basically consistent with the timeseries changes in fig 10a in summary the cross wavelet transform is an effective tool to reflect the links between tws and teleconnection factors in view of the results in table 1 figs 10a and 11 they can imply that the teleconnection factors play an important role on the tws variations compared with the enso index the results suggest that the tws variations in qaidam basin are probably more strongly affected by the pdo index of the pacific climate the tws responds to changes in precipitation temperature and other meteorological variables therefore precipitation and temperature play crucial roles in linking tws and climate change as suggested in section 4 1 the tws variations are more sensitive to the cumulative precipitation in contrast to the raw precipitation meanwhile fig 10b indicates that the tws and cumulative precipitation anomalies have a significant positive correlation of 0 83 especially with a cc of 0 95 in the grace fo era specifically before 2010 the tws anomalies were below 50 mm month with negative values in most months and the cumulative precipitation had a significant downward trend in addition the changes in the behaviors of the tws and cumulative precipitation have a strongly high coincidence with mostly positive values from 2010 to the end of the study period however some absence of the tws and cumulative precipitation can be attributed to other factors during the study period like human activities and temperature the cumulative precipitation anomaly values exceeding the tws anomaly values and the lack of discharge into other basins indicate that the water is primarily used up by evapotranspiration and human consumption the cumulative precipitation values below the tws anomaly values such as those during 2006 2008 are likely to be replenished by the thawing of frozen soil glacier ice and snow when annual temperatures exceed 0 c additionally the annual mean air temperature exhibits a slow upward trend with a linear slope of 0 19 c a in the period of 2003 2019 which is consistent with the tws trend direction 5 discussion 5 1 the influencing factors of tws given distinct global climate change frequent extreme meteorological events and intensive human activities the precise analysis of tws influencing factors has great significance for balancing social stability and ecological health recent studies have demonstrated that teleconnection factors from climate variables play significant roles in the tws variations xavier et al 2010 tang et al 2014 yao et al 2016 wang et al 2020a in this study the intensive impacts of teleconnection factors enso and pdo in association with the tws evolutions can be seen in figs 10a and 11 the pdo index has a greater and more stable impact on the tws variations in qaidam basin compared to the relationship between the tws and two primary climate factors in addition small enso and pdo events can dramatically enhance the intensity of the pacific climate variability which can correspond to strong precipitation and rise in temperature resulting in plentiful tws amounts such as the period after 2017 in this region thus we can conclude that climate change may be the major driving factor of tws replenishment in the past two decades the increase in precipitation with a trend of 3 18 mm a is the main factor for the tws increase of 4 67 mm a in qaidam basin fig 12 a c for the two forms of regional average precipitation the cumulative precipitation features more obvious increasing trend and stronger positive correlation with tws over the study period fig 10b this is because precipitation has a significant cumulative effect in a closed basin in contrast to that in the open sichuan basin yao et al 2016 furthermore the increasing rates in both the gridded tws fig 7 and precipitation are the largest in the southern part of qaidam basin jiao et al 2015 bibi et al 2019 indicating that the precipitation changes are the driving factors of tws variations however the cumulative precipitation anomalies are lower than the tws anomalies in some periods fig 10b thus the supply from the degradation of permafrost snow melt and glacier ice melt caused by the rising temperature at a rate of 0 19 c a may induce increases in tws jin et al 2009 jiao et al 2015 in addition with the increase in temperature the evapotranspiration also increases and features similar and relatively slight upward trend of 0 97 mm a during 2003 2019 fig 12d which coincides with the naturally dominant consumption of tws despite all this the water balance the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration also increases with a linear trend of 2 20 mm a and has similar variation with precipitation fig 12b therefore we suggest that the increase in precipitation is a major driving factor for the increase in tws in qaidam basin and the temperature resulting in the meltwater is also a factor at a regional scale or in a local area with low elevations bibi et al 2019 the global warming has a significant impact on the qaidam basin and some researches show that the climate in the basin is changing from the warming drying to the warming humidifying jiao et al 2015 meng et al 2019 bibi et al 2019 the increase of tws in qaidam basin is mainly caused by the precipitation increasing under the warming and humidification jiao et al 2015 bibi et al 2019 which can be found in fig 12 in the period of 2013 2019 the annual precipitation has more obvious ascendant trend than that during 2003 2012 furthermore both the tws and annual precipitation have a comparatively consistent abrupt increasing trend in the period of 2017 2019 and the accumulated precipitation has a good agreement cc of 0 95 with the tws from july 2017 to march 2020 fig 10b although the monthly precipitation shows a subtle change meanwhile the groundwater also shows an abrupt increasing trend after 2017 in fig 9c thus the abrupt increase of tws after 2017 is primarily caused by the effect of precipitation increasing although the precipitation and tws show an increasing trend in the time series the fragments with anomalous accumulated precipitation values surpassing the tws anomaly values are shown in fig 10b owing to the enclosure of qaidam basin without discharge outflow except for consumption via evapotranspiration most of the residual water is used by human activities for survival and economic production as the population continues to increase alongside social development the demand for water storage is increasing duan 2018 bibi et al 2019 thus the influence of human activities should take into account the tws variations 6 advantages and limitations grace satellite gravimetry is an important technical means for monitoring the tws especially in remote areas with limited hydrometeorological data yao et al 2016 ndehedehe et al 2016 sun et al 2017 yang et al 2017 tapley et al 2019 wang et al 2020a the grace products have been utilized well for large scale or small scale water storage for instance zhao et al 2017 employed grace based tws changes to quantify the regional drought severity in 2002 2014 in the continental united states xu et al 2019 utilized the water balance alongside grace and gldas data and discovered a decreasing trend in the tws change accompanied by a dramatic increase in groundwater variation after 2006 over the cryosphere dominated watershed of the northeast tibetan plateau tapley et al 2019 analyzed the contributions of grace data to understanding climate change at global scale however the short term grace product data were used for these studies since the grace fo mission was launched the grace based tws dataset has been continuously updated and extended in time series from april 2002 to present save 2020 in this study we combined the grace and grace fo products by using the lstm machine learning model to reveal the change characteristics of tws which features more advantages compared with only using the grace product jiao et al 2015 meng et al 2019 such as a more apparent increasing trend for the tws in the grace fo era than that in the grace era in qaidam basin fig 6 the lstm model has better prediction results compared with those in some previous studies sun et al 2020 this is because we consider the cumulative precipitation to drive the model in the closed basin moreover in consideration of the tws signals possessing multiple characteristics four statistical techniques were employed to distinguish the tws variation characteristics these technical methods exposed the tws variation characteristics from multiple perspectives in section 4 3 including linear and nonlinear trends on various spatiotemporal scales although the results of grace data verification in fig 4 showed that the accuracy of the grace based tws was acceptable with respect to the precipitation wb tws values and be tws series some limitations still exist in this study to reduce the uncertainty in the grace satellite observations the tws ensemble mean values from the gfz jpl and csr mascon solutions should be computed wang et al 2020a however there is a spatial resolution mismatch among the three mascon solutions if the spatial interpolation method were implemented for the gfz and jpl mascon solutions to match the csr mascon solution with a resolution of 0 25 it would also introduce additional uncertainty in the results especially in small scale areas additionally reconstructing data in a data gap between grace and grace fo by using the lstm neural network which has good applicability in this region may lack of comparison with some other models in the literatures li et al 2019 ahmed et al 2019 sun et al 2020 therefore the lstm method for handling monthly data in the data gap should be further assessed in comparison with other learning based models in the future 7 conclusions in this study we combined the grace and grace fo products with data gap filled using the lstm model to monitor the tws spatiotemporal variations from april 2002 to march 2020 over the closed qaidam basin in northwest china then we examined the impacts of climate indices and meteorological variables changes on tws variations the major conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 due to the cumulative precipitation being more closely related to the tws changes compared with precipitation in the closed basin the lstm cp model performed better with a mean cc value of 0 62 than the lstm p model for use in filling the grace based tws anomalies for the data gap period july 2017 may 2018 moreover the comparison with monthly precipitation and two water balances simulated tws sequences showed that the performance of the grace based tws was reliable in this region 2 the tws variability featured seasonal variation characteristics and an obvious increase decrease increase change pattern at inter annual scales spatially the tws anomaly values were larger and easier to identify positive signals in the southwest i e kunlun mountain of qaidam basin than those in the northeast of the study area i e qilian mountain 3 the tws displayed a significant increasing trend that will probably be sustained for the future especially in the southwest of qaidam basin meanwhile the tws oscillation has a periodicity and nonlinearity increase trend of 0 43 mm month based on the eemd results besides the snow water equivalent soil moisture and groundwater which are the important components of tws exhibited inconsistent increasing trends of 0 0007 mm month 0 0362 mm month and 0 22 mm month in the basin respectively 4 compared with the enso index the tws variations are probably more strongly affected by the pdo index with a significant negative correlation according to the general correlation analysis and cross wavelet transform technology moreover the tws has a better agreement cc of 0 83 with the accumulated precipitation than with the raw precipitation and also its trend direction is consistent with that of the air temperature in addition the impact of human activities on the tws cannot be ignored in summary this study thoroughly investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of tws by combining grace and grace fo products with lstm model and further revealed the correlations between tws and teleconnection factors although the closed qaidam basin was selected as a case study the approach can be applied in other regions as well it is advised to further assess our demonstrated lstm method for handling grace data gap and compare it with some other methods in different study

4533,terrestrial water storage tws is a crucial indicator of regional water balance and water resources changes due to limited hydrological observations we combined the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo products using the long short term memory lstm neural network to monitor the tws changes from april 2002 to march 2020 over the closed qaidam basin in northwest china and examined the impacts of climate and meteorological changes on tws variations the results indicated that the lstm model driven by the cumulative precipitation temperature and global land data assimilation system datasets was reliable for use in reconstruction of the grace products in the closed basin the tws variations featured seasonal variation characteristics and a significant upward trend at internal annual scales which were tested via linear statistics and a modified mann kendall method the increasing trend is likely to remain strongly sustainable in the near future with a hurst index over 0 75 in most regions moreover the tws oscillation has a periodicity and nonlinearity increase trend of 0 43 mm month as observed using ensemble empirical mode decomposition analysis and the tws components including snow water equivalent soil moisture and groundwater demonstrate discordant increasing trends in the basin under climate change conditions teleconnection factors have strong impacts on tws variability particularly for the pacific decadal oscillation index with a significant negative correlation by cross wavelet transform technology nonetheless the increase in tws is primarily influenced by precipitation increases and is more sensitive to the accumulated precipitation in this region in this study the grace products in combination with grace fo data may help us to better understand the spatiotemporal characterization of tws in qaidam basin which will provide an important support for the water resource management and ecological environment protection in such data scarce regions keywords grace terrestrial water storage long short term memory ensemble empirical mode decomposition qaidam basin 1 introduction qaidam basin in the tibetan plateau with abundant natural resources i e oil coal and a variety of metal deposits but a shortage in water resources is one of the three largest inland basins in china with global warming and social development serious environmental problems have emerged gradually in qaidam basin such as soil salinization groundwater abstraction and urban waterlogging duan 2018 huang et al 2020 terrestrial water storage tws which is composed of aboveground snow ice and surface water and belowground soil moisture and groundwater is a critical component in the land water cycle rodell and famiglietti 1999 behrangi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 meng et al 2019 sun et al 2020 tws comprehensively reflects precipitation p runoff r and evapotranspiration et changes investigating and understanding the spatiotemporal properties of tws are indispensable which can provide significant implications for the effective management of water resources troch et al 2007 yang et al 2017 however owing to the scarce in situ observation sites in remote areas jiang et al 2021 particularly in high mountains it is difficult for us to observe and comprehend the tws dynamics in qaidam basin since march 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission was implemented and recognized as an effective tool for detecting the tws variability with a precision of 1 0 1 5 cm across the globe on a monthly time resolution tapley et al 2004 andersen and hinderer 2005 bibi et al 2019 in previous studies grace gravity anomalies usually in combination with global land data assimilation system gldas data have represented a significant application prospect primarily in monitoring the water budget variations at multiple spatiotemporal scales guo et al 2016 ndehedehe et al 2016 behrangi et al 2017 retrieving groundwater tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 bibi et al 2019 and quantifying drought cao et al 2015 thomas et al 2017 tapley et al 2019 wang et al 2020a grace ended on october 2017 tapley et al 2019 as the successor of grace grace follow on grace fo satellites were launched in may 2018 and has been providing new grace fo data by continuously monitoring the water in lakes rivers soil underground areas etc boergens et al 2020 with the development of grace fo satellites longer grace product sequences could be made available for use in studying tws variations the longer period coverage of the grace tws sequences makes it with greater application utility in hydrometeorological field however due to the existence of a data gap for the period july 2017 to may 2018 there has been a very limited number of studies on tws characteristics by combining the grace and grace fo missions boergens et al 2020 wang et al 2020b landerer et al 2020 machine learning techniques have been utilized in hydrology fields to resolve some difficult problems including drought forecasting dikshit et al 2021 predicting the water table depth zhang et al 2018 merging satellite and rain gauge precipitation wu et al 2020 and reconstructing grace data sun et al 2019 2020 dikshit et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 and wu et al 2020 developed the long short term memory lstm architecture to simulate target values and demonstrated that the lstm model was a useful alternative approach for the data gaps existing between the grace and grace fo products some scholars have utilized machine learning technology for its reconstruction but there have been unsatisfactory results in qaidam basin such as those obtained in a study by sun et al 2020 thus this study focuses on the lstm model for filling in the grace data gaps some previous studies have been undertaken on the variations in tws by applying the grace and gldas datasets in qaidam basin for example jiao et al 2015 investigated spatiotemporal distribution changes in tws and discussed the influencing factors including precipitation and temperature meng et al 2019 reported the seasonal and annual changes in tws and their possible causes e g precipitation and evapotranspiration in the tibetan plateau which mainly focused on revealing the impacts of meteorological variables on the tws however the correlations analysis between tws and climate indices e g el niño southern oscillation enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo are relatively few in qaidam basin while these correlations have been highlighted that the teleconnection factors can profoundly affect the tws changes in other regions such as the sichuan basin yangtze river basin africa and east african great lakes region yao et al 2016 becker et al 2010 anyah et al 2018 hence it is imperative to dissect the response of tws to the variability of teleconnection factors in qaidam basin therefore the purpose of this study was to analyze the spatiotemporal characterization of tws and possible causes by combing grace and grace fo data in the closed qaidam basin china first the missing monthly data between the grace and grace fo products were reconstructed by using the lstm model then the spatiotemporal patterns of tws including its components from april 2002 to march 2020 were identified using different statistical analysis methods finally the correlations and links between the grace based tws and climate indices meteorological factors were analyzed via the time series correlation cross wavelet transform method and comparative analysis the finding of this study will provide new prospects and improved understanding of the tws changes twsc in qaidam basin 2 study area and data 2 1 study area enclosed with an inland arid desert qaidam basin is located between 34 30 n 40 n and 87 30 e 99 20 e in the northwestern area of qinghai province and the northeastern region of the tibetan plateau china with an area of about 250 000 km2 hu and jiao 2015 the basin is surrounded by the altun kunlun and qilian mountains the basin reaches elevations in the range of 2638 6594 m above sea level fig 1 a and is covered with saline materials a wide range of soil types and unevenly distributed surface water resources comprising lakes rivers permanent ice and snow as shown in fig 1b bibi et al 2019 in qaidam basin the monthly precipitation gradually decreases from east 40 8 mm to west 2 2 mm fig 1c and is mainly concentrated in the summer the regional mean monthly air temperature was 0 59 c fig 1d during the study period with strong solar radiation a long sunshine duration and vigorous evaporation of 1974 3000 mm bibi et al 2018 2019 making the region prone to drought this study area is primarily affected by the strong plateau monsoon and weak westerly circulation which is typical of a plateau continental climate 2 2 grace data currently monthly grace spherical harmonics sh and mass concentration mascon data are primarily acquired through the center for space research at the university of texas csr http www2 csr utexas edu grace german research center for geosciences gfz http isdc gfz potsdam de grace isdc and jet propulsion laboratory jpl https grace jpl nasa gov sun et al 2020 there are a variety of processing algorithms and models that correct for the glacial isostatic adjustment between the sh and mascon solutions to calculate the tws value based on grace data namely the sh method utilizes global sh basis functions for parameterizing and simplifying the earth gravity field model egfm but its mass variations feature obvious errors in the grace satellite estimates and the solving process of the egfm wang et al 2020a the mascon solutions employ regional mascon functions to parameterize the egfm and do not require glacial isostatic adjustments moreover the products of mascon solutions with high precision grace data are provided on a high resolution grid particularly for csr rl06 on a 0 25 grid considering the above factors and for the purposes of dissecting the tws variations over the small scale qaidam basin we selected the grace grace fo csr rl06 mascon solutions v2 data from april 2000 to march 2020 with the monthly average data removed from january 2004 to december 2009 more information about csr rl06 can be found in the literature e g save et al 2016 due to technical issues the grace grace fo product has missing data in some months and an 11 month data gap although the missing data can be remedied by a widely used linear interpolation method using neighboring months meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a this approach lacks data smoothness and does not consider the seasonality of tws in this study the six point spline interpolation method was employed to fill in the one to two months of missing data zheng et al 2014 we then utilized machine learning technology to bridge the data gaps between the grace and grace fo products to analyze the successive change characteristics of tws in qaidam basin from april 2002 to march 2020 the machine learning model is introduced in section 3 1 2 3 gldas data gldas is an important data source for global change and water cycle research cooperatively developed by the goddard space flight center of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the national center for environmental prediction ncep of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa using data assimilation techniques and combining ground observations and satellite remote sensing data to drive land surface models gldas includes the mosaic noah community land model and variable infiltration capacity model tian et al 2010 the gldas products have approximately 36 global scale and gridded form land surface field variables i e precipitation temperature air surface skin and soil evapotranspiration runoff surface and baseflow groundwater snow and soil moisture content these data were obtained from https disc gsfc nasa gov gldas at present the gldas dataset is reliable and appropriate for use in the verification and comparison of grace products yao et al 2016 wang et al 2020a particularly for its highest 0 25 resolution noah land surface model lsm that is matched at spatial scales with grace grace fo csr rl06 mascon data therefore we utilized the partial hydrological and meteorological variables from the gldas noah lsm l4 monthly 0 25 0 25 v2 1 product to retrieve tws for repairing the grace products the gldas based tws is computed by using the snow water equivalent swe soil moisture sm depths including 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm layers recorded as soil10 soil40 soil100 and soil200 respectively and canopy interception ci data from the gldas noah lsm products sun et al 2020 to bring the data into correspondence with the grace based tws anomalies dataset the gldas based tws was processed by removing the monthly average from january 2004 to december 2009 to acquire the gldas based tws anomalies the groundwater gw storage dataset not contained in gldas noah lsm products is acquired from the gldas catchment lsm product with a 0 25 daily resolution wang et al 2020c and its anomalies was removed the mean value from january 2004 to december 2009 as well 2 4 climate data global climate change has an indirect impact on tws variations we used two significant climate variables from april 2002 to march 2020 i e the multivariate enso index and pdo the enso index version 2 has positive values indicating el niño and negative values indicating la niña and is represented by the noaa physical sciences laboratory by combining the empirical orthogonal function of oceanic and atmospheric variables yao et al 2016 anyah et al 2018 the monthly data can be obtained from https www psl noaa gov enso mei the pdo has positive negative values indicating the climate anomaly patterns and is available from the noaa national centers for environmental information for modulating the interannual related teleconnections of enso the monthly data can be obtained from https www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections pdo 2 5 meteorological observation data meteorological changes have a direct impact on tws variations two meteorological variables the in situ month precipitation extracted from china gauge based monthly precipitation analysis product cpap v2 0 and temperature extracted from china gauge based monthly temperature analysis product ctap v2 0 were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn the 0 5 resolution cpap and ctap are generated using the thin plate splines method for chinese topography with the data coming from 2400 meteorological stations and 0 05 resolution gtopo30 data owing to their satisfactory quality shen et al 2010 the cpap and ctap datasets were used in this study and resampled to 0 25 resolution datasets via bilinear interpolation to match other datasets additionally their anomalies were processed by detaching the mean from january 2004 to december 2009 to match the grace based tws anomaly dataset 3 methodology 3 1 lstm neural network the lstm neural network is a type of recurrent neural network rnn in a time series which is suitable for processing and predicting important events with relatively long intervals dikshit et al 2021 the rnn features a memory module for retaining past information in the hidden layer which differs from traditional neural networks a gradient vanishing problem arises however due to a gradual decline in the network s ability to perceive past information of the time series and the rnn cannot control the content of the memory module zhang et al 2018 this long term dependency problem can be overcome by explicitly designing the lstm networks the lstm neurons consist of a cell state storing the past long term information an input gate to determine the input information of the network cell state at the present moment a forget gate to delete some of the cell state information from the previous time steps and an output gate that confirms the output information of the cell state wu et al 2020 the architecture of the lstm model was provided by dikshit et al 2021 the forcing data for the cpap precipitation ctap temperature and gldas based tws data were used to drive the lstm model for reconstructing the grace based tws data specifically owing to the great variability of the tws with the time series in qaidam basin the training and testing periods were divided by random sampling in order to reduce the random error 80 and 90 of the samples from the grace and grace fo eras were used to train the model simultaneously and 20 and 10 of the samples were used to measure the predictive performance of the trained model at the grid scale respectively under the premise that the model has a good simulation effect on assessments of the lstm model and because of the short history of grace products all samples were used for retraining the model and simulating the grace based tws anomaly time series by the trained models from july 2017 to may 2018 to yield better prediction results in the testing period the correlation coefficient cc normalized root mean square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to assess the performance of the lstm model the cc with values ranging from 1 to 1 expressed the correlation between the target and reference data jiang et al 2018 the nrmse with an optimal value of 0 expressed the global fitness of the lstm neural network and the nse with a value of to 1 expressed the relative magnitude of the residual variance between the target and observed values these performance metrics have been highlighted for the assessment of machine learning models in the recent study by sun et al 2020 3 2 trend analysis method the mann kendall mk trend test as a nonparametric statistical test method that is not affected by sample values and distribution types is widely recommended by the world meteorological organization to dissect the data trend in time series jiang et al 2019 nevertheless the results of the mk test are sometimes influenced by the persistence of hydrometeorological series including underestimating the trend for a given dataset the modified mk mmk trend test approach proposed by hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 for eliminating the lag 1 autocorrelation of the time series and considering the related robustness of the autocorrelation is more credible for acquiring the data series trend for a group of independent samples under a given significance level α the standard statistical variable z is calculated if z 0 the data sequence has an upward trend if z 0 the data sequence has a downward trend when the absolute z value 1 65 1 96 and 2 58 there is a significant trend at the significance levels of 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 respectively in this study the mmk method was used to quantify the grace based tws trends in qaidam basin at a significance level of 0 1 the rescaled range analysis r s is a fractal theory proposed by hurst and improved by mandelbrot and wallis and it can be used to study the internal principles of hydrometeorological elements hamed 2007 the hurst index is the target value in the r s method which is used to reflect the persistence or anti persistence strength of the data series if the hurst value is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 0 5 the data series has inverse persistence in the upcoming time period compared with that at the current stage if the hurst value is 0 5 the data series has randomness if the hurst value is in the range of 0 5 1 the trend direction of the data series in the future stage is consistent with that in the current stage here we utilized the r s analysis method to investigate the internal regularity of the tws ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd a more robust ensemble method proposed by wu and huang 2004 2009 on the basis of empirical mode decomposition emd can be used to describe the non stationarity and nonlinearity in climate and hydrological elements duan et al 2019 eemd can analyze the internal evolution process of hydrometeorological variables on multiple time scales the eemd is produced by adding a white noise sequence to the original data sequence to alleviate the influence of mode mixing on emd which is divorced from the constraint of the fourier transform the procedure of eemd to decompose the components of different scales from the original data series is described by sun et al 2017 in this study we utilized the eemd matlab code from a previous study by wu and huang 2009 and the times and standard deviations of adding white noise were set to 100 and 0 01 respectively cross wavelet transform combines the wavelet transform with cross spectrum to reflect the links between two signals in the time and frequency fields from the multiple timescales and also can reveal the interaction significance between the two sequences in various time frequency domain wang et al 2020a the details of cross wavelet transform method can be found in grinsted et al 2004 and wang et al 2020a the flow chart of the study is shown in fig 2 4 results 4 1 evaluation of lstm for estimating tws anomalies fig 3 displays the magnitudes and spatial distributions of cc nrmse and nse for the lstm models for 41 and 20 test samples including the lstm p model which is run by the precipitation temperature and gldas based tws and the lstm cp model which is driven by the cumulative precipitation temperature and gldas based tws during the same testing period the lstm cp model presented a much better performance than that of the lstm p model in terms of the values of three statistical metrics for instance at 10 of the samples the cc of the lstm cp model is in the range of 0 58 to 0 91 and has a mean value of 0 62 with a low mean nrmse of 0 22 and an nse over 0 at most grids these results are better in this region than those reported by in sun et al 2020 however the lstm p model has a relatively small mean cc of 0 33 mean nrmse of 0 27 and poor nse values this could be because the cumulative precipitation is more closely related to the tws changes compared with the precipitation in the closed basin as the number of training samples increases from 80 to 90 which can lessen the random error affecting the forecast results the accuracy of the lstm cp model significantly improves while the opposite occurs for the lstm p model importantly the response of water storage to precipitation and cumulative precipitation is diverse generally the lstm models especially for the lstm cp model are reliable and acceptable for use in repairing the grace based tws over qaidam basin therefore we used all the samples to train the lstm cp model and interpolate the grace based tws anomalies from july 2017 to may 2018 this program with 95 of the samples for the training period can enhance the performance of the lstm cp model for restoring data gaps 4 2 verification of grace based tws it is necessary to evaluate the quality of satellite hydrometeorological products before use thus the tws be tws determined from the budget equation tws swe sm ci gw was applied to verify the accuracy of the grace based tws product following the common practices in existing studies bibi et al 2019 wang et al 2020c in addition based on the water balance p r et twsc we used the cpap precipitation and gldas evapotranspiration data to calculate the tws wb tws without considering the runoff in the qaidam basin meng et al 2019 bibi et al 2019 the be tws and wb tws series are reliable references for good validation of grace based tws product it can be seen from fig 4 that there is a notably consistency cc of 0 91 between the grace based and be tws variations in qaidam basin the values of the grace based tws anomalies were in the range of 48 2 to 155 4 mm while that of the be tws anomalies ranged from 20 5 to 106 8 mm the variation amplitude of the tws obtained from different products is relatively large probably because lake volume glacier mass balance ground ice stored in permafrost are the components of tws and included in computing the grace product but is excluded in the be tws with a relatively gentle evolution process from the water balance validation it can be observed that the grace based tws anomalies has prominent agreement cc of 0 82 with the wb tws series and they feature similar change process the values of the wb tws anomalies were in the range of 41 6 to 151 4 mm which are consistent with variation range of grace based tws however there are some errors between 50 mm month and 50 mm month for some specific months which may be due to the wb tws does not contain the water consumed by human beings and supplied by thawing the frozen soil glacier and snow in addition there is an apparent correlation between precipitation and the grace based tws jiao et al 2015 bibi et al 2019 similar results can be seen in fig 4 for example in months with abundant precipitation grace based tws anomalies have peak values with a time lag and there are inconsistent fluctuations between the precipitation and grace based tws for the reconstruction of tws the lstm cp simulated series had segments similar to the raw grace and grace fo data the lstm cp estimated tws values were nearly in the range of be tws to wb tws values and it had very similar evolution process with the be tws and wb tws sequences from july 2017 to may 2018 overall the grace product is in good agreement with the regularity and differential fluctuations of the be tws wb tws and precipitation the changes in the grace based tws are consistent with the existing studies meng et al 2019 therefore the performance of the grace based tws is reliable which provides great confidence and certainty for further investigation of tws variation characteristics in qaidam basin 4 3 spatiotemporal patterns of tws to investigate the tws spatial characteristics in qaidam basin the spatial variations of monthly and seasonal average tws values are demonstrated in fig 5 the monthly average tws value is the average value of many years in the same month and the seasonal average tws value is the average value of many years in the same season divided by three for mar may as spring jun aug as summer sep nov as autumn and dec feb as winter the regional mean values of tws anomalies in qaidam basin from january to december were 20 69 0 62 0 39 3 58 3 91 0 58 13 85 18 34 15 12 10 26 8 29 and 7 33 mm respectively while they were 5 26 16 39 16 83 and 7 11 mm in the spring summer autumn and winter respectively obviously the spatial distributions of tws anomalies are inconsistent with values below 20 mm from february to june but were relatively consistent with its values of 5 70 mm from july to january with decreasing variation from southwest to northeast especially with significantly positive signals in january moreover distinct patterns of monthly and seasonal tws anomalies were observed between the southwest i e kunlun mountain and northeast i e qilian mountain of qaidam basin in the southwest of qaidam basin the tws anomalies values were larger and it was easier to identify positive signals than in the northeast of qaidam basin except in april and may in the spring the tws had obvious spatial heterogeneity and larger spatial variation amplitudes compared with that in other seasons these results are crucially affected by the spatiotemporal distribution of meteorological variables bibi et al 2019 meng et al 2019 including precipitation and temperature fig 6 displays the temporal evolution characteristics of the tws in qaidam basin during the study period including the associated monthly seasonal and annual changes the tws featured an obvious upward trend at inter annual scales for instance the tws anomaly values were less than 0 mm in most months and seasons from april 2002 to december 2007 were higher than 0 mm from january 2008 to december 2016 and exceeded 90 mm in august 2012 and 50 mm in summer autumn 2012 subsequently there was more significant increasing trend from 2017 onward and it surpassed 60 mm after august 2018 furthermore the tws has the characteristics of seasonal variations and increase decrease increase change patterns with the time series that is its anomalies are prone to peak values in summer or autumn and are prone to low or decreasing values in spring qaidam basin is a structurally closed area with a relatively independent water circulation system for the basin precipitation is major natural supply mode for tws because it is a long process for surface water to form groundwater and then overflow out of the basin evapotranspiration is the major natural excretion mode for tws the tws changes in qaidam basin have a certain correlation with the precipitation and temperature bibi et al 2019 the air temperature forces the tws to increase or decrease by affecting the regional evapotranspiration and seasonal frozen soil covering the basin in summer higher temperatures thaw the frozen soil and heavy precipitation resulting in large amounts of evapotranspiration that allows the tws supply to exceed the excretion amount the surplus amount of tws accumulates in the following season therefore the tws anomaly values occasionally peak in autumn as shown in fig 6b there was a high probability of low tws volume occurring in the spring with less precipitation and lower temperatures as also found in fig 5 4 4 variation trend characteristics of tws the trend characteristics of the monthly and seasonally gridded tws based on linear trends mmk trend tests and r s analyses are shown in fig 7 in the spring summer autumn and winter the regional average linear slope values of tws in qaidam basin were 0 30 0 48 0 41 0 42 and 0 41 mm month the regional average z values were 1 88 2 29 2 14 2 08 and 2 18 and the regional average hurst index values were 0 55 0 81 0 80 0 79 and 0 87 respectively indicating that the tws variations increased for monthly and seasonal scales there were differences in the tws trend characteristics in various regions specifically the tws showed an upward trend in most regions with a linear trend range of 0 04 1 6 mm month especially with respect to the remarkable increasing trend in the southwest of qaidam basin in the spring and summer the trend was negligibly downward for the same grids these results are consistent with the results of the mmk trend test except for some grids in autumn the area percentage of the tws with an increasing trend was greatest in areas where the z values were over 1 96 through the r s analysis method it was found that the tws was strongly sustainable on a monthly scale with a hurst index over 0 75 illustrating that the upcoming tws variation is consistent with the current tws trend although the tws presented a weakly anti persistence in spring with a hurst index below 0 5 in the east of the basin a strong persistence was notable in summer autumn and winter in general this finding reveals that the tws variations in qaidam basin have been increasing over the past two decades and they are likely to continue increasing for the foreseeable future the regional average tws anomalies in qaidam basin were decomposed into six components and a variation trend using the eemd method fig 8 the variation trend featured nonlinear variation characteristics the eemd analysis displayed an increasing trend which was close to the linear trend with a slope of 0 43 mm month from april 2002 to march 2020 in the bottom panel this is consistent with the results shown in fig 7 these six components represent the tws amplitude characteristics at different timescales and the oscillation frequency changes from high to low from imf1 to imf6 which implies that the period had an increase from top to bottom in terms of the oscillation characteristics of imfs at various timescales we calculate each component s mean period which is defined as the mean interval among extrema maxima in imf1 imf5 and between adjacent minima in imf6 sun et al 2017 it can be seen from fig 8a f that the mean periods of imf1 imf6 are approximately 4 8 17 31 86 and 143 months respectively the periodicities 12 months of the dominant modes of imf1 and imf2 fully reflect the seasonal characteristics of the tws imf3 imf5 represent the tws inter annual properties and imf6 indicates that the tws has an inter decadal quasi periodic this emphasizes that the tws variations feature periodicity and the mean periods of imfs are its main oscillation periods wu and huang 2009 4 5 temporal changes of the tws components the detailed tws components analysis can provide further knowledge of tws variation fig 9 presents the temporal evolution characteristics of snow water equivalent soil moisture and groundwater in the qaidam basin the three tws components exhibit an inconsistent increase from april 2002 to march 2020 in the basin as shown in fig 9a the average snow water equivalent anomalies has a faint upward trend of 0 0007 mm month and some outstanding values in individual month such as it reaching 1 55 mm on january 2008 and exceeding 1 mm on four specific time points i e november 2013 november 2018 january 2019 and 2020 fig 9b illustrates that the time series of soil moisture anomalies shows an increasing trend of 0 0362 mm month and the temporal evolution is that first it rising 2002 04 2011 next descending 2011 2016 then ascending after 2016 again these changes are slightly consistent with that of tws similarly the groundwater series has a prominent upward trend of 0 22 mm month fig 9c and it also features more homologous temporal evolution characteristics with the tws there have been illustrated that the groundwater storage has an apparent increasing trend during 2003 2012 using in situ observations jiao et al 2015 and groundwater increase is the most contribution of tws increase in the basin jiao et al 2015 bibi et al 2019 meng et al 2019 4 6 relationship between the tws and influencing factors to better understand the link between the tws and climate indices two climate variables were denoised by using a five month moving window and the smoothed tws anomalies were normalized fig 10 a to be consistent with the smoothed tws anomalies the precipitation and temperature anomalies are also handled by the moving window thereafter the time series of the precipitation anomalies are accumulated to reflect the dry wet conditions and comprehend the response of tws to the cumulative effects of precipitation in qaidam basin because of the strong seasonal variations in air temperature it is difficult to identify the relationship between the tws and temperature at a monthly scale and the monthly mean temperature anomalies within the year are taken as the annual temperature values the time series of cumulative precipitation monthly precipitation annual temperature and tws anomalies are displayed throughout the study period as shown in fig 10b there were dry episodes of el niño around 2010 and 2016 and wet conditions under la niña in 2011 for qaidam basin as shown in fig 10a these findings are relatively consistent with the observed 2010 drought and 2011 wetter period there were significant discrepancies in the change in amplitude between the tws and enso although they tended to oppose one another thus other factors such as the pdo are attributed to these differences similarly long term positive tws anomalies during 2011 2015 had a significant negative pdo phase and the extreme dry wet conditions in this region were correlated with pdo events there was a negative correlation of 0 17 between the tws and pdo in qaidam basin indicating closer relationship compared with the one between tws and enso however the correlation between tws and enso was not significant during the study period except for after june 2017 with a positive correlation of 0 86 as displayed in table 1 this change is consistent with the results of yao et al 2016 fig 11 shows the cross wavelet energy spectrum for revealing the links between the tws and teleconnection factors from august 2002 to march 2020 in qaidam basin the effective spectral regions are exhibited inside the cone of influence with the thin solid line whose boundary effect and outside areas are not considered as presented in fig 11a there is a resonance period between the enso and tws at the 95 confidence level with a 3 15 month signal appearing in 2009 2012 and they have a significant positive correlation with a 8 12 month signal occurring in 2014 2016 similarly under the 95 confidence level the pdo has a prominent negative correlation with tws series with a 8 14 month signal arising in 2005 2006 whilst it also has an obvious negative association with tws with a 10 13 month signal appearing in 2010 2013 and features an ambiguous correlation with a 6 11 month signal occurring in 2015 2017 fig 11b moreover the two teleconnection factors have short term intermittent resonance periods against the tws with low 8 months over the study period the results in the cross wavelet transforms are basically consistent with the timeseries changes in fig 10a in summary the cross wavelet transform is an effective tool to reflect the links between tws and teleconnection factors in view of the results in table 1 figs 10a and 11 they can imply that the teleconnection factors play an important role on the tws variations compared with the enso index the results suggest that the tws variations in qaidam basin are probably more strongly affected by the pdo index of the pacific climate the tws responds to changes in precipitation temperature and other meteorological variables therefore precipitation and temperature play crucial roles in linking tws and climate change as suggested in section 4 1 the tws variations are more sensitive to the cumulative precipitation in contrast to the raw precipitation meanwhile fig 10b indicates that the tws and cumulative precipitation anomalies have a significant positive correlation of 0 83 especially with a cc of 0 95 in the grace fo era specifically before 2010 the tws anomalies were below 50 mm month with negative values in most months and the cumulative precipitation had a significant downward trend in addition the changes in the behaviors of the tws and cumulative precipitation have a strongly high coincidence with mostly positive values from 2010 to the end of the study period however some absence of the tws and cumulative precipitation can be attributed to other factors during the study period like human activities and temperature the cumulative precipitation anomaly values exceeding the tws anomaly values and the lack of discharge into other basins indicate that the water is primarily used up by evapotranspiration and human consumption the cumulative precipitation values below the tws anomaly values such as those during 2006 2008 are likely to be replenished by the thawing of frozen soil glacier ice and snow when annual temperatures exceed 0 c additionally the annual mean air temperature exhibits a slow upward trend with a linear slope of 0 19 c a in the period of 2003 2019 which is consistent with the tws trend direction 5 discussion 5 1 the influencing factors of tws given distinct global climate change frequent extreme meteorological events and intensive human activities the precise analysis of tws influencing factors has great significance for balancing social stability and ecological health recent studies have demonstrated that teleconnection factors from climate variables play significant roles in the tws variations xavier et al 2010 tang et al 2014 yao et al 2016 wang et al 2020a in this study the intensive impacts of teleconnection factors enso and pdo in association with the tws evolutions can be seen in figs 10a and 11 the pdo index has a greater and more stable impact on the tws variations in qaidam basin compared to the relationship between the tws and two primary climate factors in addition small enso and pdo events can dramatically enhance the intensity of the pacific climate variability which can correspond to strong precipitation and rise in temperature resulting in plentiful tws amounts such as the period after 2017 in this region thus we can conclude that climate change may be the major driving factor of tws replenishment in the past two decades the increase in precipitation with a trend of 3 18 mm a is the main factor for the tws increase of 4 67 mm a in qaidam basin fig 12 a c for the two forms of regional average precipitation the cumulative precipitation features more obvious increasing trend and stronger positive correlation with tws over the study period fig 10b this is because precipitation has a significant cumulative effect in a closed basin in contrast to that in the open sichuan basin yao et al 2016 furthermore the increasing rates in both the gridded tws fig 7 and precipitation are the largest in the southern part of qaidam basin jiao et al 2015 bibi et al 2019 indicating that the precipitation changes are the driving factors of tws variations however the cumulative precipitation anomalies are lower than the tws anomalies in some periods fig 10b thus the supply from the degradation of permafrost snow melt and glacier ice melt caused by the rising temperature at a rate of 0 19 c a may induce increases in tws jin et al 2009 jiao et al 2015 in addition with the increase in temperature the evapotranspiration also increases and features similar and relatively slight upward trend of 0 97 mm a during 2003 2019 fig 12d which coincides with the naturally dominant consumption of tws despite all this the water balance the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration also increases with a linear trend of 2 20 mm a and has similar variation with precipitation fig 12b therefore we suggest that the increase in precipitation is a major driving factor for the increase in tws in qaidam basin and the temperature resulting in the meltwater is also a factor at a regional scale or in a local area with low elevations bibi et al 2019 the global warming has a significant impact on the qaidam basin and some researches show that the climate in the basin is changing from the warming drying to the warming humidifying jiao et al 2015 meng et al 2019 bibi et al 2019 the increase of tws in qaidam basin is mainly caused by the precipitation increasing under the warming and humidification jiao et al 2015 bibi et al 2019 which can be found in fig 12 in the period of 2013 2019 the annual precipitation has more obvious ascendant trend than that during 2003 2012 furthermore both the tws and annual precipitation have a comparatively consistent abrupt increasing trend in the period of 2017 2019 and the accumulated precipitation has a good agreement cc of 0 95 with the tws from july 2017 to march 2020 fig 10b although the monthly precipitation shows a subtle change meanwhile the groundwater also shows an abrupt increasing trend after 2017 in fig 9c thus the abrupt increase of tws after 2017 is primarily caused by the effect of precipitation increasing although the precipitation and tws show an increasing trend in the time series the fragments with anomalous accumulated precipitation values surpassing the tws anomaly values are shown in fig 10b owing to the enclosure of qaidam basin without discharge outflow except for consumption via evapotranspiration most of the residual water is used by human activities for survival and economic production as the population continues to increase alongside social development the demand for water storage is increasing duan 2018 bibi et al 2019 thus the influence of human activities should take into account the tws variations 6 advantages and limitations grace satellite gravimetry is an important technical means for monitoring the tws especially in remote areas with limited hydrometeorological data yao et al 2016 ndehedehe et al 2016 sun et al 2017 yang et al 2017 tapley et al 2019 wang et al 2020a the grace products have been utilized well for large scale or small scale water storage for instance zhao et al 2017 employed grace based tws changes to quantify the regional drought severity in 2002 2014 in the continental united states xu et al 2019 utilized the water balance alongside grace and gldas data and discovered a decreasing trend in the tws change accompanied by a dramatic increase in groundwater variation after 2006 over the cryosphere dominated watershed of the northeast tibetan plateau tapley et al 2019 analyzed the contributions of grace data to understanding climate change at global scale however the short term grace product data were used for these studies since the grace fo mission was launched the grace based tws dataset has been continuously updated and extended in time series from april 2002 to present save 2020 in this study we combined the grace and grace fo products by using the lstm machine learning model to reveal the change characteristics of tws which features more advantages compared with only using the grace product jiao et al 2015 meng et al 2019 such as a more apparent increasing trend for the tws in the grace fo era than that in the grace era in qaidam basin fig 6 the lstm model has better prediction results compared with those in some previous studies sun et al 2020 this is because we consider the cumulative precipitation to drive the model in the closed basin moreover in consideration of the tws signals possessing multiple characteristics four statistical techniques were employed to distinguish the tws variation characteristics these technical methods exposed the tws variation characteristics from multiple perspectives in section 4 3 including linear and nonlinear trends on various spatiotemporal scales although the results of grace data verification in fig 4 showed that the accuracy of the grace based tws was acceptable with respect to the precipitation wb tws values and be tws series some limitations still exist in this study to reduce the uncertainty in the grace satellite observations the tws ensemble mean values from the gfz jpl and csr mascon solutions should be computed wang et al 2020a however there is a spatial resolution mismatch among the three mascon solutions if the spatial interpolation method were implemented for the gfz and jpl mascon solutions to match the csr mascon solution with a resolution of 0 25 it would also introduce additional uncertainty in the results especially in small scale areas additionally reconstructing data in a data gap between grace and grace fo by using the lstm neural network which has good applicability in this region may lack of comparison with some other models in the literatures li et al 2019 ahmed et al 2019 sun et al 2020 therefore the lstm method for handling monthly data in the data gap should be further assessed in comparison with other learning based models in the future 7 conclusions in this study we combined the grace and grace fo products with data gap filled using the lstm model to monitor the tws spatiotemporal variations from april 2002 to march 2020 over the closed qaidam basin in northwest china then we examined the impacts of climate indices and meteorological variables changes on tws variations the major conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 due to the cumulative precipitation being more closely related to the tws changes compared with precipitation in the closed basin the lstm cp model performed better with a mean cc value of 0 62 than the lstm p model for use in filling the grace based tws anomalies for the data gap period july 2017 may 2018 moreover the comparison with monthly precipitation and two water balances simulated tws sequences showed that the performance of the grace based tws was reliable in this region 2 the tws variability featured seasonal variation characteristics and an obvious increase decrease increase change pattern at inter annual scales spatially the tws anomaly values were larger and easier to identify positive signals in the southwest i e kunlun mountain of qaidam basin than those in the northeast of the study area i e qilian mountain 3 the tws displayed a significant increasing trend that will probably be sustained for the future especially in the southwest of qaidam basin meanwhile the tws oscillation has a periodicity and nonlinearity increase trend of 0 43 mm month based on the eemd results besides the snow water equivalent soil moisture and groundwater which are the important components of tws exhibited inconsistent increasing trends of 0 0007 mm month 0 0362 mm month and 0 22 mm month in the basin respectively 4 compared with the enso index the tws variations are probably more strongly affected by the pdo index with a significant negative correlation according to the general correlation analysis and cross wavelet transform technology moreover the tws has a better agreement cc of 0 83 with the accumulated precipitation than with the raw precipitation and also its trend direction is consistent with that of the air temperature in addition the impact of human activities on the tws cannot be ignored in summary this study thoroughly investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of tws by combining grace and grace fo products with lstm model and further revealed the correlations between tws and teleconnection factors although the closed qaidam basin was selected as a case study the approach can be applied in other regions as well it is advised to further assess our demonstrated lstm method for handling grace data gap and compare it with some other methods in different study

4534,one of the unintended consequences of urban stormwater quality management wet ponds is the thermal enrichment of the shallow pond water during the summer months the outflow from thermally enriched ponds can degrade the cold and cool water aquatic habitat in urban streams an accurate model of the pond temperature profile is needed to assess the pond effluent thermal load however most models developed for this purpose are process based and not simple to use requiring a lengthy monitoring dataset to calibrate this paper introduces a new design assessment tool to predict the hourly water temperatures in these ponds at different depths during the summer season dry weather warming periods and the diurnal cycles we compiled monitoring data from five ponds in the greater toronto area from 2013 2016 to evaluate the ponds thermal impact on the receiving cold water streams using these datasets we developed a new equation that allows for separating the active upper portion and stable lower portion of the pond this ensures the focus is on the active upper part where the majority of the heat transfer within the pond occurs and exhibits diurnal temperature fluctuations we also used machine learning tools to develop accurate equations for the bottom temperature and surface temperature as well as key equation parameters that characterize the thermal profiles the developed thermal profile equation allows for the simple determination of other key thermal metrics such as average temperature energy stored thermocline location which may be used as inputs to model wet weather flow conditions and pond outflow temperature the results show that the proposed machine learning model is acceptably accurate and capable according to the low mean absolute percentage error mape and coefficient of determination r2 values of 5 and 0 965 respectively for temperature prediction for all depths this work provides a building block for the overall objective to develop a new easy to use wet weather explicit equation for predicting the outlet temperature from stormwater management wet ponds since it establishes the initial thermal condition before the storm hits keywords environmentally sensitive areas cool and cold water streams stormwater management water resources engineering pond temperature profile 1 introduction stormwater detention ponds are a common best management practice in many recently developed communities and their widespread use can present a threat to aquatic life by the discharge of thermally enriched outflow into receiving streams current models are process based and require the collection and calibration of many input parameters this work presents a new thermal modelling tool that addresses the limitations of process based models by using easy to obtain climatic input and pond characteristics temperature is an essential regulator of aquatic biological processes and as such it is a crucial indicator of health in aquatic ecosystems hawkins et al 1997 hester and doyle 2011 perkins et al 2012 somers et al 2013 alizamir et al 2020 increased urbanization which reduces riparian cover the urban heat island effect and discharge from stormwater facilities and more significant climatic variability due to climate change are all factors that affect the stability of the thermal regime in urban streams cold water streams are particularly vulnerable to rapid temperature changes as the thermal regime shifts to a warmer state aquatic species requiring cooler temperatures are restricted to an increasingly smaller habitat range cold water fish are sensitive to these high temperatures as they can increase susceptibility to diseases and parasites reduced reproductive success and retarded growth armour 1991 hester and doyle 2011 steedman 1991 a significant source of thermal energy loading to receiving streams is runoff from heated impervious surfaces and outflow from stormwater detention ponds abdi and endreny 2019 hathaway et al 2016 herb et al 2009 hirzel et al 2006 martin et al 2021 sabouri et al 2016 2013 sattar et al 2017 timm et al 2020 due to their large surface area ponds act as thermal energy sinks during the summer months with a net gain of solar radiation energy because of this heating stratified conditions can develop with thermal gradients larger than 10 c between the surface and pond mcenroe et al 2013 song et al 2013 sabouri et al 2016 over time this warm active layer grows in thickness over the cooler stable bottom temperature profile knowing the distribution of temperature profile in the pond in relation to the pond outlet is required to predict the pond outflow temperature since the dynamics of the active layer of the pond controls the overall heat export to the receiving water course the majority of existing models developed to predict the temperature of shallow water bodies both small lakes and ponds are process based herb et al 2009 hondzo and stefan 1993 janssen et al 2019 klemetson and rogers 1985 lamoureux et al 2006 where the boundary condition at the surface is determined by climatological data and empirical equations to estimate convective advective and evaporative heat transfer these process based models then use numerical methods to solve the heat equation in one or more dimensions model accuracy is highly dependent on the quality of the input variables some of which are prone to error or are difficult to obtain one of the most advanced and popular thermal models for stormwater management ponds is the minuhet model developed by the trout stream research group based in the university of minnesota st anthony research laboratory herb et al 2009 2008 this one dimensional model can predict thermal stratification utilizing pond characteristics such as outlet and inlet depth bathymetry shading sheltering and secchi depth this model s drawbacks are that it is not simple to use requires a large dataset to calibrate and use the model for example the heat transfer processes at the pond surface boundary are complex and nonlinear requiring numerical models there is uncertainty with the physical parameters used in the minuhet model such as the heat transfer coefficients for latent and sensible heat wind sheltering and light absorption in the water column that require instrumentation to measure for example during nighttime conditions where there is ordinarily low wind speed pond surface temperature can exceed air temperature this in turn can lead to unstable atmospheric conditions at the boundary layer which complicates the heat transfer calculations abbasi et al 2017 solcerova et al 2019 another complex boundary condition is at the pond bottom since stormwater ponds are engineered facilities there is usually a clay liner designed to limit the pond water s infiltration the process based models ignore this layer and assume a thermal conductivity for the pond sediment even though the liner may have a lower thermal conductivity value finally the absorption scattering and attenuation of solar radiation can be difficult to determine in stormwater ponds suspended sediment algae and aquatic plants can attenuate solar radiation penetrating the water column as well as affect the emissivity of the water surface which can impact net longwave radiation cooling from the pond surface andersen et al 2017 hocking and straškraba 1999 kirk 1985 pilla et al 2018 torma and wu 2019 the uncertainty and cost of obtaining the above mentioned complex variables required for using the process based models can be avoided by applying machine learning to predict pond temperature by resolving complex nonlinear relationships between model inputs and the outputs machine learning algorithms are commonly applied to hydrology and complex water management problems atieh et al 2017 maier and dandy 2000 nourani et al 2014 sabouri et al 2013 sattar et al 2017 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 stajkowski et al 2020a 2020b langridge et al 2020 among the machine learning methods the group method of data handling gmdh is one of the most promising self organizing algorithms it is well suited because it yields explicit equations for prediction of outcome using input parameters needed for practical applications shaghaghi et al 2017 the gmdh network is a nonlinear model that combines quadratic polynomials with the multilayer procedure bonakdari et al 2019 the biggest advantage of the gmdh method compared other machine learning methods is that it produces a highly accurate empirical equation that can be easily imported into microsoft excel for the practitioner in the consulting engineering and the government agencies to use in their stormwater management pond designs and environmental assessments many studies have been carried out applying gmdh methods for on site engineering problems with the number of such studies increasing every day walton et al 2019 gao et al 2020 li et al 2020 despite the importance of dry weather temperature profiles in the thermal impact assessment of stormwater management ponds on sensitive receiving streams no simple yet accurate practical method has been developed that consider climatic factors and pond characteristics to estimate pond water temperature profiles in this paper we present a new modelling methodology where we apply a mathematical function to describe the thermal profiles of a pond temperature dataset and then use the gmdh machine learning method to predict the thermal profiles using simple climatic inputs and pond characteristics 2 methodology 2 1 monitoring site locations five ponds located in the greater toronto area fig 1 were monitored between 2013 and 2016 to evaluate the ponds thermal impact on the receiving streams which are cool headwater streams these ponds all discharge to cool or cold water receiving streams with potential adverse effects to the endangered aquatic life e g the redside dace and required as part of their development permits to be monitored for thermal impact assessment the monitoring included installing temperature sensors at multiple pond depths to capture the thermal structure of the pond water column the ponds are all located in dense urban areas and range in maximum depth from 1 5 m to 3 0 m table 1 the pond surface area varies between 4000 15000 m2 the adjacent ponds he 3 and he 5 have a combined surface area of 25000 m2 and discharge to the pristine cool and cold headwater tributaries of the credit river in the city of brampton fig 1 shows the location of the monitored ponds s7 he 3 he 5 pond 3 and duffin in ontario canada all pond monitoring locations used the same sensor package table 2 shows an overview of the instrumentation used for monitoring 2 2 new shallow water thermocline equation a new equation has been developed to predict the stratified conditions of stormwater ponds to aid in the comparisons between ponds the depth from the pond bottom is normalized such that the bottom corresponds with z 0 and the surface with z 1 this equation is comprised of three main components the bottom temperature an equation in the form of an exponential and a logistic function two known reference temperatures are required the bottom temperature and the surface temperature the thermal profile curve is constructed such that the logistic function intercepts with the surface temperature t z 1 ts a scaling factor α is used to meet the above condition and is a function of all parameters t z t b a 1 e bz α 1 e c z d α t s t b a 1 e b 1 e c 1 d t s surface temperature t b bottom temperature a lower mixed zone temperature rise δt from the bottom to the inflection point b growth parameter for first equation c growth parameter of second equation d x value of inflection point for logistic equation α stratification scaling factor as shown in fig 2 the pond temperature profile can be split into two primary zones corresponding to the curve s exponential and logistic components the exponential part describes the pond s lower temperature which does not change greatly during the diurnal heating cooling cycle the logistic component corresponds with the profile s active zone where most of the thermal energy is gained during the day and where cooling occurs at night parameter a controls the lower temperature profile and influences the whole curve by shifting the entire temperature profile along the y axis with the surface and bottom boundary temperature fixed parameter b controls the exponential growth of the curve and how quickly it reaches the a value parameter c controls the logistic curve s growth and parameter d controls the inflection point effectively shifting the logistic along the x axis depth stratification scaling factor α is a function of all 6 parameters and corresponds to the logistic equation s amplitude 2 3 temperature profile curve fitting method dry weather periods were determined from the climatic data and were isolated from the pond dataset a period was considered dry if less than 5 mm of precipitation occurred between wet weather events water level was also monitored for ponds duffin and he 5 which was used to determine the end of the wet weather event and sufficient drawdown of the pond the threshold for the end of the drawdown was chosen to be when the level reached 5 of pond depth for pond s7 which lacked pond level data the end of the precipitation event was selected to be 48 h after the last recorded precipitation from the pond temperature data analysis it was determined that the daily minimum and maximum surface temperatures of the ponds occurred on average two hours after sunrise and three hours before sunset respectively these times were selected to represent the temperature profiles of the daily minimum and maximum fitting of the thermal profile equation was performed in python using the scipy scientific computing library virtanen et al 2020 python has seen immense growth in the area of scientific computing and popularity among research community worldwide in recent years as it is transparent open source with many contributors across many disciplines the scipy optimize curve fit function was used to preform a non linear least square fit of the data to the new thermal profile equation for the curve fitting we selected the trust region reflective algorithm with bounds since tb and ts are known there are only four parameters that need to be solved a b c and d through experimentation the parameters b and c were found to be the least sensitive and were therefore fixed at optimum values that minimized the rmse of the curve fit these values were a 5 and b 10 which left two parameters to be solved two cases were observed in the structure of the pond temperature profile the main case occurs during the summer and early fall where the pond temperature monotonically increases from bottom to surface where parameter a was bound by the interval 0 ts the second case can occur in the late fall and early winter where the surface is rapidly cooled to temperatures less than the bottom resulting in an unstable temperature profile for this case parameter a was fixed on the interval ts tb 0 parameter d was fixed between the values of 0 5 and 1 the minimum value was chosen so that only the upper half of the pond profile is controlled by the logistic equation it should be noted that at d 0 5 α ts tb a 1 e 5 and at d 1 α 2 ts tb a 1 e 5 2 4 group method of data handling gmdh although climatic factors are easily measured and the theoretical foundation for the heat transfer processes is well known there is still uncertainty within the water surface boundary layer and overlying air heat transfer coefficients for convection must be estimated the light absorption and scattering of light within the water column may be variable these parameters are subject to local random variability and a precise prediction of the variability in the data set is limited by the number of available input variables the group method of data handling gmdh method was employed in this study it is suited to solve complex nonlinear problems ebtehaj et al 2016 2015 shaghaghi et al 2017 and was used to overcome the limitation of temperature input variables in theoretical modelling the observed variable y as a function of input vector x1 x2 x3 xn with given m observation i 1 2 m can be defined as follows 1 y i f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n gmdh can be trained to evaluate the model value y for a given input variables as follows 2 y i f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n the objective function which is to be minimized is the square difference between the observed variable y and model y as follows 3 m i n i 1 m f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n 2 the basis of the gmdh algorithm is the process of constructing a high order polynomial known as the volterra functional series as follows 4 y a 0 i 1 m a i x i i 1 m j 1 m a ij x i x j i 1 m j 1 m k 1 m a ijk x i x j x k in the gmdh algorithm the series of volterra functions are decomposed into quadratic binomial polynomials this mathematical description is further simplified by applying quadratic polynomials consisting of only two variables neurons in the form of 5 y i f x i x j a 0 a 1 x i a 2 x j a 3 x i 2 a 4 x j 2 a 5 x i x j in the gmdh algorithm a regression polynomial is formed according to equation 5 for all possible combinations of two independent variables the objective function is then applied to find the best fit between the m observed values more details about the methods can be found in azimi et al 2018 ebtehaj et al 2018 gholami et al 2017 the input parameters for the gmdh models include mat mean air temperature c od ordinal day mcc mean cloud cover as

condition pond surface water temperature follows a seasonal trend varying slightly from year to year due to seasonal variance the seasonal trend follows a parabolic shape with a peak occurring late summer and intercepts occurring at the onset of ice cover during winter and thawing during spring the surface water temperature of pond 3 is shown for the years 2014 and 2016 fig 3a the surface water temperature follows the same trend as air temperature with 2014 experiencing a cooler summer period than 2016 precipitation events are also linked to the cooler trend the total precipitation for the period between june and august was 221 mm in 2014 compared to only 133 mm in 2016 fig 3b shows the comparison between the surface temperature of two ponds with different depths 1 5 m and 3 m for the same year and they follow the same trend this suggests that the pond surface water temperature s major trends are independent of pond characteristics such as depth and size the produced gmdh model mirrors this observation through the inputs for the pond surface temperature model the gmdh surface water temperature s key inputs are mat od mcc msr mw and dmat this model does not use pond depth as an input and instead relies only on climatic and time based parameters 3 2 bottom boundary condition the bottom water temperature also follows a seasonal trend fig 4a which is also affected by the seasonal variance for example in 2015 the late spring experienced an early heatwave with air temperatures above 25 c which resulted in an abrupt rise in bottom surface temperature compared to the other years of measured data the bottom temperature is also dependent on the depth of the pond the bottom temperature in shallow ponds is more sensitive to climatic conditions due to greater solar radiation penetration during the day and convective cooling at night and greater mixing fig 4b deeper ponds have greater temperature stratification which also adds resistance to mixing the bottom temperature in the spring and summer is cooler for deeper ponds due to the factors mentioned above but the bottom temperatures for both ponds converge in the fall season this is most likely due to the ponds overturning and mixing from the cooler air temperatures and the lack of temperature stratification large precipitation events also influence the bottom temperature due to the mixing of cooler influent temperatures reducing the bottom temperature for the deeper pond events in the summer may temporarily increase the bottom temperature since the influent temperature is higher than the bottom temperature chemical stratification due to road salt application in winter months may also play a part in the temperature gradient s growth and stability this denser solution may not be fully flushed out during the spring melt and remain during the summer the bottom temperature gmdh model is the simplest of the four models developed requiring only four input parameters depth od hour and dmat hour and od are needed to convey the seasonal trend in the bottom temperature as discussed above depth is an important parameter since it determines the underlying ground temperature at the bottom of the pond and the temperature distribution within the pond the depth of the water column controls the amount of light and solar radiation that penetrates the pond s bottom this effect is illustrated in fig 4b where the shallower 1 5 m deep pond has a larger variation in temperature compared the deeper 3 m 3 3 warming trends and association with equation parameters fig 5 shows how the pond temperature at different depths responds to a dry weather warming period for pond he 5 the diurnal cycle of warming during the day and cooling during the night becomes damped with depth to the point where the bottom is unaffected the penetration depth of the nightly convective cooling can also be estimated at between 1 and 1 5 m at night at this depth the temperature is the same up to the surface and is thoroughly mixed during the warming period shown in fig 5 parameter a can be estimated based on the amplitude of the diurnal cycle and the slope of the trend we can assume here that a occurs between the 1 5 m and 1 0 m measurement locations at the 1 5 m depth the diurnal cycle is almost completely damped and the trend is also near horizontal this contrasts with the 1 0 m depth where there is a noticeable diurnal cycle and an increasing trend for example the real value of a from the curve fitting at 2015 07 26 17 00 is 6 4 c which corresponds to a temperature of 24 2 c which occurs between the depths of 1 0 m and 1 5 m during the period in this example parameter a fluctuated between 4 3 and 6 4 c with the peak occurring during the peak surface temperature on july 29 the warm evening air temperatures reduce the convective cooling at night during this period which allows more heat to transfer to lower depths increasing the thermocline temperature with an associated increase in parameter a fig 6 shows on a typical thermal profile raising a will shift the curve vertically in the temperature profile parameter α has a more significant diurnal fluctuation in comparison to parameter a for the above sample period the values of α at peak temperature range from 4 0 to 6 7 and for minimum temperature range between 1 7 and 4 2 c this is due to the growth of the active portion of the thermal profile during the day and the decline of the active zone from convective cooling at night when the convective cooling penetrates to a depth below the thermocline the profile is effectively reset with a new lower parameter a parameter d which controls the inflection point of the logistic equation component shifts the center of the upper zone along the depth axis fig 6 this parameter not only influences the inflection points of the thermal profile but also controls the shape of the active zone and therefore the slope of the curve ranging from a sigmoid shape at d 0 5 to exponential at d 1 0 for a warming trend d decreases to 0 5 during the daily minimum and increases to between 0 6 and 0 9 daily the maximum value occurs at the maximum thermal gradient near the surface 3 2 c between surface and 0 5 m depth occurring on july 26 the minimum value occurs during the minimal thermal gradient at the surface with a difference of only 0 1 c between surface and 0 5 m depth the gmdh model developed for both parameter a and parameter α both required more input parameters than the surface and bottom temperature models parameter a required three climatic parameters both the mat and the dmat as well as msr periods of high air temperature and high solar radiation allows growth in temperature which can raise a conversely low nighttime temperatures can lower parameters a pond depth is also included since it relates to the heat transfer and distribution in the water column the dwt is used to help scale the parameter and od conveys seasonal variation the model for α is the most complex requiring 10 parameters including all climatic as well as seasonal od diurnal hour boundary conditions dwt and parameter a this is to be expected since this parameter is a function of surface and bottom temperature a and d this parameter scales the logistic curve to intercept the surface temperature and is therefore influenced by the complex heat transfer and mixing processes that occur in the active zone of the thermal profile 3 4 gmdh model temperature prediction performance fig 7 shows the gmdh model can successfully predicted the hourly water temperatures in the five case study ponds at different depths during the summer season dry weather warming periods and the diurnal cycles the dataset was randomly split 80 for training and 20 for testing to train the model rmse was used as the objective function the gmdh model performance statistics results are presented in table 3 indicating that the gmdh models accurately predicted the measured pond water temperatures with a mean absolute percent error mape of less than 7 a root mean square error of less than 1 1 c 4 conclusions understating the growth and dynamics of the thermal stratification that occurs in stormwater management ponds is the first step required for predicting pond outflow temperature and the risk of thermal shock this model is therefore an essential step in the modelling chain being developed to predict the impact of the stormwater management ponds on the thermally sensitive aquatic life in the receiving streams this work has demonstrated a novel method for mathematically characterizing the thermal profile the first known application of machine learning to predict pond temperature and a new modelling methodology that produces acceptable accuracy with small number of input requirements this paper presents a new mathematical equation to characterize the water temperature profiles of stormwater management ponds this equation allows for the separation of the lower portion of the pond where the temperature is stable from the active upper portion which exhibits diurnal fluctuations in temperature and where the majority of the heat transfer within the pond occurs this thermocline of the thermal profile can be easily obtained by locating the inflection point of the curve the surface boundary condition was found to be similar for ponds irrespective of pond size and depth which suggests that it can be considered independent of pond characteristics the general method of data handling gmdh machine learning method was then successfully used to develop a practical and accurate model for pond design as an environmental impact assessment tool for streams with thermally sensitive at risk or endangered aquatic life the gmdh models developed in this research are most applicable to sites within the same latitude with similar climatic conditions due to the lack of a training dataset for other conditions however the developed mathematical model and curve fitting process may be applied to all ponds and do not carry the same limitations for future study it would be beneficial to apply this methodology to a larger dataset to determine the impact of other pond characteristics as well as different climatic conditions on the gmdh model this modelling methodology is a key component in developing a full design tool to predict the impact of thermal pollution from stormwater ponds this tool will include modelling of pond outflow conditions during wet weather events with integration of stream water quality models such as the ones presented

4534,one of the unintended consequences of urban stormwater quality management wet ponds is the thermal enrichment of the shallow pond water during the summer months the outflow from thermally enriched ponds can degrade the cold and cool water aquatic habitat in urban streams an accurate model of the pond temperature profile is needed to assess the pond effluent thermal load however most models developed for this purpose are process based and not simple to use requiring a lengthy monitoring dataset to calibrate this paper introduces a new design assessment tool to predict the hourly water temperatures in these ponds at different depths during the summer season dry weather warming periods and the diurnal cycles we compiled monitoring data from five ponds in the greater toronto area from 2013 2016 to evaluate the ponds thermal impact on the receiving cold water streams using these datasets we developed a new equation that allows for separating the active upper portion and stable lower portion of the pond this ensures the focus is on the active upper part where the majority of the heat transfer within the pond occurs and exhibits diurnal temperature fluctuations we also used machine learning tools to develop accurate equations for the bottom temperature and surface temperature as well as key equation parameters that characterize the thermal profiles the developed thermal profile equation allows for the simple determination of other key thermal metrics such as average temperature energy stored thermocline location which may be used as inputs to model wet weather flow conditions and pond outflow temperature the results show that the proposed machine learning model is acceptably accurate and capable according to the low mean absolute percentage error mape and coefficient of determination r2 values of 5 and 0 965 respectively for temperature prediction for all depths this work provides a building block for the overall objective to develop a new easy to use wet weather explicit equation for predicting the outlet temperature from stormwater management wet ponds since it establishes the initial thermal condition before the storm hits keywords environmentally sensitive areas cool and cold water streams stormwater management water resources engineering pond temperature profile 1 introduction stormwater detention ponds are a common best management practice in many recently developed communities and their widespread use can present a threat to aquatic life by the discharge of thermally enriched outflow into receiving streams current models are process based and require the collection and calibration of many input parameters this work presents a new thermal modelling tool that addresses the limitations of process based models by using easy to obtain climatic input and pond characteristics temperature is an essential regulator of aquatic biological processes and as such it is a crucial indicator of health in aquatic ecosystems hawkins et al 1997 hester and doyle 2011 perkins et al 2012 somers et al 2013 alizamir et al 2020 increased urbanization which reduces riparian cover the urban heat island effect and discharge from stormwater facilities and more significant climatic variability due to climate change are all factors that affect the stability of the thermal regime in urban streams cold water streams are particularly vulnerable to rapid temperature changes as the thermal regime shifts to a warmer state aquatic species requiring cooler temperatures are restricted to an increasingly smaller habitat range cold water fish are sensitive to these high temperatures as they can increase susceptibility to diseases and parasites reduced reproductive success and retarded growth armour 1991 hester and doyle 2011 steedman 1991 a significant source of thermal energy loading to receiving streams is runoff from heated impervious surfaces and outflow from stormwater detention ponds abdi and endreny 2019 hathaway et al 2016 herb et al 2009 hirzel et al 2006 martin et al 2021 sabouri et al 2016 2013 sattar et al 2017 timm et al 2020 due to their large surface area ponds act as thermal energy sinks during the summer months with a net gain of solar radiation energy because of this heating stratified conditions can develop with thermal gradients larger than 10 c between the surface and pond mcenroe et al 2013 song et al 2013 sabouri et al 2016 over time this warm active layer grows in thickness over the cooler stable bottom temperature profile knowing the distribution of temperature profile in the pond in relation to the pond outlet is required to predict the pond outflow temperature since the dynamics of the active layer of the pond controls the overall heat export to the receiving water course the majority of existing models developed to predict the temperature of shallow water bodies both small lakes and ponds are process based herb et al 2009 hondzo and stefan 1993 janssen et al 2019 klemetson and rogers 1985 lamoureux et al 2006 where the boundary condition at the surface is determined by climatological data and empirical equations to estimate convective advective and evaporative heat transfer these process based models then use numerical methods to solve the heat equation in one or more dimensions model accuracy is highly dependent on the quality of the input variables some of which are prone to error or are difficult to obtain one of the most advanced and popular thermal models for stormwater management ponds is the minuhet model developed by the trout stream research group based in the university of minnesota st anthony research laboratory herb et al 2009 2008 this one dimensional model can predict thermal stratification utilizing pond characteristics such as outlet and inlet depth bathymetry shading sheltering and secchi depth this model s drawbacks are that it is not simple to use requires a large dataset to calibrate and use the model for example the heat transfer processes at the pond surface boundary are complex and nonlinear requiring numerical models there is uncertainty with the physical parameters used in the minuhet model such as the heat transfer coefficients for latent and sensible heat wind sheltering and light absorption in the water column that require instrumentation to measure for example during nighttime conditions where there is ordinarily low wind speed pond surface temperature can exceed air temperature this in turn can lead to unstable atmospheric conditions at the boundary layer which complicates the heat transfer calculations abbasi et al 2017 solcerova et al 2019 another complex boundary condition is at the pond bottom since stormwater ponds are engineered facilities there is usually a clay liner designed to limit the pond water s infiltration the process based models ignore this layer and assume a thermal conductivity for the pond sediment even though the liner may have a lower thermal conductivity value finally the absorption scattering and attenuation of solar radiation can be difficult to determine in stormwater ponds suspended sediment algae and aquatic plants can attenuate solar radiation penetrating the water column as well as affect the emissivity of the water surface which can impact net longwave radiation cooling from the pond surface andersen et al 2017 hocking and straškraba 1999 kirk 1985 pilla et al 2018 torma and wu 2019 the uncertainty and cost of obtaining the above mentioned complex variables required for using the process based models can be avoided by applying machine learning to predict pond temperature by resolving complex nonlinear relationships between model inputs and the outputs machine learning algorithms are commonly applied to hydrology and complex water management problems atieh et al 2017 maier and dandy 2000 nourani et al 2014 sabouri et al 2013 sattar et al 2017 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 stajkowski et al 2020a 2020b langridge et al 2020 among the machine learning methods the group method of data handling gmdh is one of the most promising self organizing algorithms it is well suited because it yields explicit equations for prediction of outcome using input parameters needed for practical applications shaghaghi et al 2017 the gmdh network is a nonlinear model that combines quadratic polynomials with the multilayer procedure bonakdari et al 2019 the biggest advantage of the gmdh method compared other machine learning methods is that it produces a highly accurate empirical equation that can be easily imported into microsoft excel for the practitioner in the consulting engineering and the government agencies to use in their stormwater management pond designs and environmental assessments many studies have been carried out applying gmdh methods for on site engineering problems with the number of such studies increasing every day walton et al 2019 gao et al 2020 li et al 2020 despite the importance of dry weather temperature profiles in the thermal impact assessment of stormwater management ponds on sensitive receiving streams no simple yet accurate practical method has been developed that consider climatic factors and pond characteristics to estimate pond water temperature profiles in this paper we present a new modelling methodology where we apply a mathematical function to describe the thermal profiles of a pond temperature dataset and then use the gmdh machine learning method to predict the thermal profiles using simple climatic inputs and pond characteristics 2 methodology 2 1 monitoring site locations five ponds located in the greater toronto area fig 1 were monitored between 2013 and 2016 to evaluate the ponds thermal impact on the receiving streams which are cool headwater streams these ponds all discharge to cool or cold water receiving streams with potential adverse effects to the endangered aquatic life e g the redside dace and required as part of their development permits to be monitored for thermal impact assessment the monitoring included installing temperature sensors at multiple pond depths to capture the thermal structure of the pond water column the ponds are all located in dense urban areas and range in maximum depth from 1 5 m to 3 0 m table 1 the pond surface area varies between 4000 15000 m2 the adjacent ponds he 3 and he 5 have a combined surface area of 25000 m2 and discharge to the pristine cool and cold headwater tributaries of the credit river in the city of brampton fig 1 shows the location of the monitored ponds s7 he 3 he 5 pond 3 and duffin in ontario canada all pond monitoring locations used the same sensor package table 2 shows an overview of the instrumentation used for monitoring 2 2 new shallow water thermocline equation a new equation has been developed to predict the stratified conditions of stormwater ponds to aid in the comparisons between ponds the depth from the pond bottom is normalized such that the bottom corresponds with z 0 and the surface with z 1 this equation is comprised of three main components the bottom temperature an equation in the form of an exponential and a logistic function two known reference temperatures are required the bottom temperature and the surface temperature the thermal profile curve is constructed such that the logistic function intercepts with the surface temperature t z 1 ts a scaling factor α is used to meet the above condition and is a function of all parameters t z t b a 1 e bz α 1 e c z d α t s t b a 1 e b 1 e c 1 d t s surface temperature t b bottom temperature a lower mixed zone temperature rise δt from the bottom to the inflection point b growth parameter for first equation c growth parameter of second equation d x value of inflection point for logistic equation α stratification scaling factor as shown in fig 2 the pond temperature profile can be split into two primary zones corresponding to the curve s exponential and logistic components the exponential part describes the pond s lower temperature which does not change greatly during the diurnal heating cooling cycle the logistic component corresponds with the profile s active zone where most of the thermal energy is gained during the day and where cooling occurs at night parameter a controls the lower temperature profile and influences the whole curve by shifting the entire temperature profile along the y axis with the surface and bottom boundary temperature fixed parameter b controls the exponential growth of the curve and how quickly it reaches the a value parameter c controls the logistic curve s growth and parameter d controls the inflection point effectively shifting the logistic along the x axis depth stratification scaling factor α is a function of all 6 parameters and corresponds to the logistic equation s amplitude 2 3 temperature profile curve fitting method dry weather periods were determined from the climatic data and were isolated from the pond dataset a period was considered dry if less than 5 mm of precipitation occurred between wet weather events water level was also monitored for ponds duffin and he 5 which was used to determine the end of the wet weather event and sufficient drawdown of the pond the threshold for the end of the drawdown was chosen to be when the level reached 5 of pond depth for pond s7 which lacked pond level data the end of the precipitation event was selected to be 48 h after the last recorded precipitation from the pond temperature data analysis it was determined that the daily minimum and maximum surface temperatures of the ponds occurred on average two hours after sunrise and three hours before sunset respectively these times were selected to represent the temperature profiles of the daily minimum and maximum fitting of the thermal profile equation was performed in python using the scipy scientific computing library virtanen et al 2020 python has seen immense growth in the area of scientific computing and popularity among research community worldwide in recent years as it is transparent open source with many contributors across many disciplines the scipy optimize curve fit function was used to preform a non linear least square fit of the data to the new thermal profile equation for the curve fitting we selected the trust region reflective algorithm with bounds since tb and ts are known there are only four parameters that need to be solved a b c and d through experimentation the parameters b and c were found to be the least sensitive and were therefore fixed at optimum values that minimized the rmse of the curve fit these values were a 5 and b 10 which left two parameters to be solved two cases were observed in the structure of the pond temperature profile the main case occurs during the summer and early fall where the pond temperature monotonically increases from bottom to surface where parameter a was bound by the interval 0 ts the second case can occur in the late fall and early winter where the surface is rapidly cooled to temperatures less than the bottom resulting in an unstable temperature profile for this case parameter a was fixed on the interval ts tb 0 parameter d was fixed between the values of 0 5 and 1 the minimum value was chosen so that only the upper half of the pond profile is controlled by the logistic equation it should be noted that at d 0 5 α ts tb a 1 e 5 and at d 1 α 2 ts tb a 1 e 5 2 4 group method of data handling gmdh although climatic factors are easily measured and the theoretical foundation for the heat transfer processes is well known there is still uncertainty within the water surface boundary layer and overlying air heat transfer coefficients for convection must be estimated the light absorption and scattering of light within the water column may be variable these parameters are subject to local random variability and a precise prediction of the variability in the data set is limited by the number of available input variables the group method of data handling gmdh method was employed in this study it is suited to solve complex nonlinear problems ebtehaj et al 2016 2015 shaghaghi et al 2017 and was used to overcome the limitation of temperature input variables in theoretical modelling the observed variable y as a function of input vector x1 x2 x3 xn with given m observation i 1 2 m can be defined as follows 1 y i f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n gmdh can be trained to evaluate the model value y for a given input variables as follows 2 y i f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n the objective function which is to be minimized is the square difference between the observed variable y and model y as follows 3 m i n i 1 m f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n 2 the basis of the gmdh algorithm is the process of constructing a high order polynomial known as the volterra functional series as follows 4 y a 0 i 1 m a i x i i 1 m j 1 m a ij x i x j i 1 m j 1 m k 1 m a ijk x i x j x k in the gmdh algorithm the series of volterra functions are decomposed into quadratic binomial polynomials this mathematical description is further simplified by applying quadratic polynomials consisting of only two variables neurons in the form of 5 y i f x i x j a 0 a 1 x i a 2 x j a 3 x i 2 a 4 x j 2 a 5 x i x j in the gmdh algorithm a regression polynomial is formed according to equation 5 for all possible combinations of two independent variables the objective function is then applied to find the best fit between the m observed values more details about the methods can be found in azimi et al 2018 ebtehaj et al 2018 gholami et al 2017 the input parameters for the gmdh models include mat mean air temperature c od ordinal day mcc mean cloud cover as

condition pond surface water temperature follows a seasonal trend varying slightly from year to year due to seasonal variance the seasonal trend follows a parabolic shape with a peak occurring late summer and intercepts occurring at the onset of ice cover during winter and thawing during spring the surface water temperature of pond 3 is shown for the years 2014 and 2016 fig 3a the surface water temperature follows the same trend as air temperature with 2014 experiencing a cooler summer period than 2016 precipitation events are also linked to the cooler trend the total precipitation for the period between june and august was 221 mm in 2014 compared to only 133 mm in 2016 fig 3b shows the comparison between the surface temperature of two ponds with different depths 1 5 m and 3 m for the same year and they follow the same trend this suggests that the pond surface water temperature s major trends are independent of pond characteristics such as depth and size the produced gmdh model mirrors this observation through the inputs for the pond surface temperature model the gmdh surface water temperature s key inputs are mat od mcc msr mw and dmat this model does not use pond depth as an input and instead relies only on climatic and time based parameters 3 2 bottom boundary condition the bottom water temperature also follows a seasonal trend fig 4a which is also affected by the seasonal variance for example in 2015 the late spring experienced an early heatwave with air temperatures above 25 c which resulted in an abrupt rise in bottom surface temperature compared to the other years of measured data the bottom temperature is also dependent on the depth of the pond the bottom temperature in shallow ponds is more sensitive to climatic conditions due to greater solar radiation penetration during the day and convective cooling at night and greater mixing fig 4b deeper ponds have greater temperature stratification which also adds resistance to mixing the bottom temperature in the spring and summer is cooler for deeper ponds due to the factors mentioned above but the bottom temperatures for both ponds converge in the fall season this is most likely due to the ponds overturning and mixing from the cooler air temperatures and the lack of temperature stratification large precipitation events also influence the bottom temperature due to the mixing of cooler influent temperatures reducing the bottom temperature for the deeper pond events in the summer may temporarily increase the bottom temperature since the influent temperature is higher than the bottom temperature chemical stratification due to road salt application in winter months may also play a part in the temperature gradient s growth and stability this denser solution may not be fully flushed out during the spring melt and remain during the summer the bottom temperature gmdh model is the simplest of the four models developed requiring only four input parameters depth od hour and dmat hour and od are needed to convey the seasonal trend in the bottom temperature as discussed above depth is an important parameter since it determines the underlying ground temperature at the bottom of the pond and the temperature distribution within the pond the depth of the water column controls the amount of light and solar radiation that penetrates the pond s bottom this effect is illustrated in fig 4b where the shallower 1 5 m deep pond has a larger variation in temperature compared the deeper 3 m 3 3 warming trends and association with equation parameters fig 5 shows how the pond temperature at different depths responds to a dry weather warming period for pond he 5 the diurnal cycle of warming during the day and cooling during the night becomes damped with depth to the point where the bottom is unaffected the penetration depth of the nightly convective cooling can also be estimated at between 1 and 1 5 m at night at this depth the temperature is the same up to the surface and is thoroughly mixed during the warming period shown in fig 5 parameter a can be estimated based on the amplitude of the diurnal cycle and the slope of the trend we can assume here that a occurs between the 1 5 m and 1 0 m measurement locations at the 1 5 m depth the diurnal cycle is almost completely damped and the trend is also near horizontal this contrasts with the 1 0 m depth where there is a noticeable diurnal cycle and an increasing trend for example the real value of a from the curve fitting at 2015 07 26 17 00 is 6 4 c which corresponds to a temperature of 24 2 c which occurs between the depths of 1 0 m and 1 5 m during the period in this example parameter a fluctuated between 4 3 and 6 4 c with the peak occurring during the peak surface temperature on july 29 the warm evening air temperatures reduce the convective cooling at night during this period which allows more heat to transfer to lower depths increasing the thermocline temperature with an associated increase in parameter a fig 6 shows on a typical thermal profile raising a will shift the curve vertically in the temperature profile parameter α has a more significant diurnal fluctuation in comparison to parameter a for the above sample period the values of α at peak temperature range from 4 0 to 6 7 and for minimum temperature range between 1 7 and 4 2 c this is due to the growth of the active portion of the thermal profile during the day and the decline of the active zone from convective cooling at night when the convective cooling penetrates to a depth below the thermocline the profile is effectively reset with a new lower parameter a parameter d which controls the inflection point of the logistic equation component shifts the center of the upper zone along the depth axis fig 6 this parameter not only influences the inflection points of the thermal profile but also controls the shape of the active zone and therefore the slope of the curve ranging from a sigmoid shape at d 0 5 to exponential at d 1 0 for a warming trend d decreases to 0 5 during the daily minimum and increases to between 0 6 and 0 9 daily the maximum value occurs at the maximum thermal gradient near the surface 3 2 c between surface and 0 5 m depth occurring on july 26 the minimum value occurs during the minimal thermal gradient at the surface with a difference of only 0 1 c between surface and 0 5 m depth the gmdh model developed for both parameter a and parameter α both required more input parameters than the surface and bottom temperature models parameter a required three climatic parameters both the mat and the dmat as well as msr periods of high air temperature and high solar radiation allows growth in temperature which can raise a conversely low nighttime temperatures can lower parameters a pond depth is also included since it relates to the heat transfer and distribution in the water column the dwt is used to help scale the parameter and od conveys seasonal variation the model for α is the most complex requiring 10 parameters including all climatic as well as seasonal od diurnal hour boundary conditions dwt and parameter a this is to be expected since this parameter is a function of surface and bottom temperature a and d this parameter scales the logistic curve to intercept the surface temperature and is therefore influenced by the complex heat transfer and mixing processes that occur in the active zone of the thermal profile 3 4 gmdh model temperature prediction performance fig 7 shows the gmdh model can successfully predicted the hourly water temperatures in the five case study ponds at different depths during the summer season dry weather warming periods and the diurnal cycles the dataset was randomly split 80 for training and 20 for testing to train the model rmse was used as the objective function the gmdh model performance statistics results are presented in table 3 indicating that the gmdh models accurately predicted the measured pond water temperatures with a mean absolute percent error mape of less than 7 a root mean square error of less than 1 1 c 4 conclusions understating the growth and dynamics of the thermal stratification that occurs in stormwater management ponds is the first step required for predicting pond outflow temperature and the risk of thermal shock this model is therefore an essential step in the modelling chain being developed to predict the impact of the stormwater management ponds on the thermally sensitive aquatic life in the receiving streams this work has demonstrated a novel method for mathematically characterizing the thermal profile the first known application of machine learning to predict pond temperature and a new modelling methodology that produces acceptable accuracy with small number of input requirements this paper presents a new mathematical equation to characterize the water temperature profiles of stormwater management ponds this equation allows for the separation of the lower portion of the pond where the temperature is stable from the active upper portion which exhibits diurnal fluctuations in temperature and where the majority of the heat transfer within the pond occurs this thermocline of the thermal profile can be easily obtained by locating the inflection point of the curve the surface boundary condition was found to be similar for ponds irrespective of pond size and depth which suggests that it can be considered independent of pond characteristics the general method of data handling gmdh machine learning method was then successfully used to develop a practical and accurate model for pond design as an environmental impact assessment tool for streams with thermally sensitive at risk or endangered aquatic life the gmdh models developed in this research are most applicable to sites within the same latitude with similar climatic conditions due to the lack of a training dataset for other conditions however the developed mathematical model and curve fitting process may be applied to all ponds and do not carry the same limitations for future study it would be beneficial to apply this methodology to a larger dataset to determine the impact of other pond characteristics as well as different climatic conditions on the gmdh model this modelling methodology is a key component in developing a full design tool to predict the impact of thermal pollution from stormwater ponds this tool will include modelling of pond outflow conditions during wet weather events with integration of stream water quality models such as the ones presented
