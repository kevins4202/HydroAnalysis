21540,in practical applications undesirable deformation and failure of the container may appear due to intense liquid oscillation anti slosh baffle is extensively applied to the reduction of sloshing response thus a semi analytical mathematical model is proposed to extract the vibratory characteristics of liquid interacting with elastic baffle in a rectangular rigid container the superposition method and the separation of variables are used to analytically formulate the velocity potentials of sub domains the baffle deflection is expanded using its dry modal functions a linear finite dimension equation system is derived to treat the eigenvalue problem of liquid considering hydroelasticity through implementation of sloshing condition continuity and compatibility conditions then the total velocity potential is comprised of rigid and perturbed components for laterally excited container the coupled modal orthogonality is demonstrated by use of hamilton s principle the system response equation is established by combination of wave equations and baffle equation convergence study is performed the present results are compared with the theoretical and numerical solutions from the reported literatures good agreements are achieved the effects of baffle parameters on the natural frequencies mode shapes and dynamic responses are evaluated in detail it is found that the thin baffle may increase the sloshing frequencies to higher values keywords rectangular container elastic baffle sub domain natural frequencies coupled models dynamic responses 1 introduction sloshing problem due to a variety of external disturbances is one of important concerns in many engineering systems such as water fluctuation in rectangular cross section aqueducts and rectangular tuned liquid dampers tld as well as nuclear waste sloshing in nuclear vessels etc when the period of the container movement gets close to the fundamental sloshing period of liquid within the container the inevitable hydrodynamic loads on the container wall akyildiz and ünal 2005 2006 may be induced by the violent liquid oscillation to result in a structural instability or collapse ibrahim 2005 faltinsen and timokha 2009 commonly the available anti slosh devices such as baffle plate can be employed to suppress severe sloshing by increasing the damping of liquid motion nayak and biswal 2015 goudarzi et al 2010 as a result it is necessary to appraise the dynamic behavior of liquid with and without hydroelasticity to ensure the integrity and safety of structure there are many reports to estimate the sloshing suppression effects of the various types of baffle nayak and biswal 2015 experimentally assessed the variation of natural frequencies sloshing damping and free surface displacement in the moving rectangular containers with the different internal bodies also panigrahy et al 2009 performed several experimental tests to explore the effects of horizontal and vertical baffles attached to a square container on a shake table they measured the pressure distribution and surface wave elevation with excitation frequencies and liquid fill level for the complicated sloshing problem in terms of large capacity storage containers the numerical simulations jung et al 2012 hu et al 2018 liu et al 2016 jena and biswal 2017 are more efficient than the experimental approaches zang et al 2019 examined the effect of different types of baffle on dynamic responses in a two dimensional 2d rectangular container by means of the boundary element method bem with green s theorem kargbo et al 2019 numerically investigated the effect of the submersed block with different sizes and positions on the layered liquid sloshing interfacial wave using arbitraty lagrangian eulerian ale approach mitra and sinhamahapatra 2007 proposed a pressure based galerkin s finite element method fem to analyze the dynamic response of a rectangular rigid container within the bottom mounted submerged structure cho and kim 2016 used the eigenfunction expansion method to study the effect of the dual surface mounted vertical porous baffle on the sloshing reduction in a rectangular container based on the volume of liquid technique two numerical models were developed to evaluate the liquid sloshing behavior in a 2d rectangular container with the vertical baffle by goudarzi and danesh 2016 and akyildiz 2012 respectively cho et al 2005 investigated the sloshing damping characteristics of horizontal baffles in contact with liquid in a 2d rectangular tank by using fem an experiment was conducted out to validate the proposed numerical procedure based on bem sygulski 2011 gave the natural frequency and mode shapes of liquid oscillation in the three dimensional 3d baffled containers the previously mentioned literatures have demonstrated the effectiveness of rigid baffles in dissipating the sloshing energy for the storage containers increasing the thickness of baffle may make the baffle become rigid from the economic cost point of view however the increase of baffle thickness may reduce the liquid storage capacity of the container thereby the elasticity of baffle effect on the dynamic behavior of sloshing liquid should also be research interest for liquid filled containers in general due to the presence of the baffle flexibility there is a dynamic interaction between baffle and liquid bauer 1981 analytically determined the coupled hydroelastic vibration of liquid in a 2d rectangular container the surface with nonzero normal derivative was covered by a flexible membrane or a thin elastic plate parasil and watanabe 2016 employed ale approach to define the moving boundaries and to examine the liquid membrane interactions kolaei and rakheja 2019 used the combination of a variational formulation and the galerkin method to presented the fem model and to simulate the coupled hydroelastic frequencies of the sloshing flexible membrane interaction in a container with arbitrary geometry they also concluded that the sloshing frequencies may be shifted to higher values to prevent resonance wang et al 2016 2019 and wang and zhou 2018 proposed the semi analytical mathematical models to extract the coupled sloshing characteristics of liquid for a cylindrical rigid container mounted with one or more flexible annular baffles which was verified to possess a high accuracy and small computational cost using fem and or bem many studies were performed to develop the numerical procedures to simulate the coupled liquid and elastic structures interaction by ghalandari et al 2019 hernández and santamarina 2012 noorian et al 2012 and biswal and bhattacharyya 2010 the obtained data indicated that the liquid oscillation behavior may be significantly affected by the baffle flexibility hwang et al 2016 presented a newly modified particle based fluid structure interaction fsi solver to describe the oscillation flows of liquid contained in a rolling container equipped with elastic baffle a fully lagranian meshfree computational algorithm was proposed by khayyer et al 2018 to assess the incompressible liquid sloshing considering hydroelasticity khayyer et al 2019 developed an enhanced multi resolution mps mps fsi solver to simulate the sloshing of liquid interacting with a bottom clamped elastic baffle a set of ocean engineering related benchmark tests were conducted to validate their approach hermange et al 2019 explored the complex tire hydroplaning simulations on rough ground through implementation of an innovative 3d sph fe coupled model the present study aims at semi analytically evaluating the effects of horizontal baffle with elasticity on the coupled natural frequencies mode shapes and dynamic responses in rectangular rigid container containing the incompressible and non viscos liquid the linearized boundary condition of free liquid surface is considered the four liquid sub domains are separated from the entire liquid domain the superposition principle combined with the separation of variables is used to formulate the velocity potential functions of sub domains the governing equation of coupled liquid baffle system is described via the forced equation of the 2d euler bernoulli beam with the clamped free edges the continuity conditions of pressure and velocity are incorporated at the artificial interfaces and the compatibility condition is satisfied at the contact interface of sub domains and baffle the sloshing and structural modes of liquid coupled baffle are acquired by using the finite fourier series expansion and the generalized eigenvalue approach the total velocity potential consists of rigid and perturbed velocity potentials for horizontally excited rectangular rigid container the coupled modal orthogonality is demonstrated the dynamic response equation of the coupled system is established via the combination of the surface sloshing equation and the dominant equation of a baffle 2 mathematical background fig 1 describes an elastic baffle horizontally attached at the one sidewall of a 2d rectangular rigid container of width b where a denotes the length of the baffle and h is the height of the baffle measured from the bottom the thickness and material density of baffle is t p and ρ the notations ρ f and h represent mass density and height of liquid respectively a cartesian coordinate frame oxz is established in fig 1 the container is filled with inviscid and incompressible liquid with irrotational flow according to the sub domain method proposed by wang et al 2016 2019 and wang and zhou 2018 the mean liquid region ω is comprised of four simple sub domains ω j j 1 2 3 4 with three virtual interfaces γ k k 1 2 3 as shown in fig 2 the initial free surface is made up of the two sub surfaces σ1 and σ2 the oscillation amplitude of liquid is sufficiently small to satisfy the linear free surface condition such being a case the velocity potential function in a scalar form can be used to describe the liquid flow field 1 φ x z t φ j x z t x z ω j j 1 2 3 4 since the artificial interfaces γ k between the adjacent sub domains ω j and ω j j j are introduced the velocity potential function of sub domain φ j x z t must satisfy the continuity conditions of the artificial interfaces γ k 2 φ j t φ j t φ j n k φ j n k on γ k where image 1 denotes the outward unit vectossr normal to the interface the ordered triples j j k are taken as the set 1 2 1 3 4 2 2 4 3 2 1 formulation for an elastic baffle the thin baffle is treated as a 2d euler bernoulli beam of which shear deformation can be ignored the baffle is composed of an isotropic homogeneous and linear elastic material according to the assumption of the 2d euler bernoulli beam theory generally when the thickness of baffle is less than twenty times the length of baffle the effect of transverse shear strain of baffle can be ignored the left end of the baffle is fixed at the sidewall x 0 while the other end of the baffle is viewed as a free boundary according to the vibration theory of the euler bernoulli beam the transverse deflection function of baffle w x t is given by the following dominant equation 3 e i 4 w x 4 ρ t p 2 w t 2 f baffle where f baffle ρ f φ 3 t z h ρ f φ 1 t z h denotes the vertical force exerted on the wetted baffle surfaces induced by sub domains ω1 and ω3 ei is the flexural rigidity of baffle and ρt p its mass per unit length along the baffle the compatibility of the normal velocity to the contact interface between the baffle and the sub domains should be fulfilled by 4 φ 1 z z h φ 3 z z h w t when the baffle vibrates freely the motion of any point of baffle is regarded as the harmonic function of time thence the solutions of eq 3 are expressed by 5 w x t n 1 n 1 e i ω t a n n p w n x i 2 1 where ω is the natural circular frequency of the coupled liquid baffle system a n n p n 1 2 3 n 1 2 3 is the appropriate mode coefficient the n th normal mode of baffle oscillation w n x in vacuum can be expressed as 6 w n x sinh λ n x sin λ n x c n cosh λ n x cos λ n x with 7 c n sinh λ n a sin λ n a cosh λ n a cos λ n a where the frequency parameters λ n are the characteristic roots of cos λ n a cosh λ n a 1 2 2 free vibration of liquid in an elasticity baffled container 2 2 1 solution of velocity potential the velocity potential function φ j x z t of each sub domain ω j should satisfy the linearized form of laplace equation 8 2 φ j x z t 0 in ω j so the liquid velocity of any point of each sub domain can be written as 9 v x j φ j x v z j φ j z the boundary conditions on the wetted area of the container are written as 10 φ j x x 0 0 j 1 3 φ j x x b 0 j 2 4 φ j z z 0 0 j 1 2 thus the sloshing condition at the free sub surfaces σ1 and σ2 corresponding the sub domains ω3 and ω4 is given by 11 φ j z z h 1 g 2 φ j t 2 z h 0 j 3 4 where g is the body force per unit mass of liquid according to the linear sloshing theory the velocity potential can be considered as the harmonic function of time i e φ j x z t i ω e i ω t φ j x z j 1 2 3 4 φ j x z indicates the sloshing mode shape for the sub domain ω j in such a case eqs 2 8 10 and 11 are rewritten as 12 2 φ j 0 j 1 2 3 4 13 φ j x x 0 0 j 1 3 φ j x x b 0 j 2 4 φ j z z 0 0 j 1 2 14 φ j φ j φ j n k φ j n k on γ k 15 φ j z z h 1 g 2 φ j t 2 z h 0 j 3 4 obviously it is observed from eqs 12 15 that predominate equations and the boundary conditions are all linear therefore based on the superposition principle the modal function inside the sub domain ω j can be expressed as 16 φ j q 1 q j φ j q q j 2 j 1 2 3 j 3 4 where q j denotes the total number of the inhomogeneous boundary condition for each sub domain ω j φ j q is the qth mode component of image 2 φ j 1 j 1 2 satisfies the rigid boundary conditions at the upper and lower surfaces as well as the sidewall surface for the corresponding sub domain φ j 1 j 3 4 satisfies the rigid boundary conditions at the sidewall surface and the lower surface and the zero pressure boundary condition at the upper surface for the corresponding sub domain φ j 2 j 1 2 3 4 satisfies the rigid boundary conditions at the left and right lateral surfaces as well as at the lower surface for the corresponding sub domain φ j 3 j 3 4 satisfies the rigid boundary conditions at the left and right lateral surfaces and the zero pressure boundary condition at the upper surface for the corresponding sub domain consequently the mode component φ j q j 1 2 3 4 q 1 2 3 should meet the following formulations φ 1 1 x x 0 0 φ 1 1 z z

at the free liquid surface the linearized dynamic boundary condition is 34 φ j t z h g η j 0 j 3 4 where η j 0 t φ j z z h d t represents the surface wave elevations of sub domains 2 3 2 solution of velocity potential the velocity potential φ j of sub domain ω j can be decomposed into two parts the first part is the rigid potential function φ j r x z t that the liquid behaves like a frozen mass moving in unison with the container with the same velocity and the rest part the perturbed potential function φ j p x z t that the liquid motion at the free surface is separated from the container motion in such a case eqs 31 34 can be displaced by 35 2 φ j r 0 2 φ j p 0 j 1 2 3 4 φ j r x x 0 u t φ j p x x 0 0 j 1 3 36 φ j r x x b u t φ j p x x b 0 j 2 4 φ j r z z 0 0 φ j p z z 0 0 j 1 2 37 φ 1

expressed as the form of 40 φ j r x u t j 1 2 3 4 the oscillation amplitude of liquid is regarded as to be sufficiently small to linearize the sloshing problem thereby the perturbed potential function can be expanded into the finite series form based on the sloshing mode shapes now by introducing the generalized time factor q n t the perturbed potential function is given by 41 φ j p n 1 q n t φ j n x z j 1 2 3 4 also the transverse deflection of baffle w x t is computed as 42 w x t n 1 q n t w n x where φ j n x z and w n x are nth free surface profile of liquid for the sub domain ω j and nth bulging profile of baffle given by the eigenvalue problem in subsection 2 2 respectively 2 3 3 orthogonality of coupled mode shapes using hamilton s principle can produce the following expression 43 δ t 0 t 1 t u d t t 0 t 1 0 a f baffle δ w d x d t 0 where u and t represent the potential energy and reference kinetic energy of baffle respectively then they can be expressed as 44 u e i 0 a 2 w x 2 2 d x t ρ t p 0 a w t d x inserting u and t from eq 44 into eq 43 gives rise to 45 e i t 0 t 1 0 a 4 w x 4 δ w d x d t ρ t p t 0 t 1 0 a 2 w t 2 δ w d x d t t 0 t 1 0 a f baffle δ w d x d t where δw denotes the virtual displacement of baffle which meets relevant boundary conditions thence the sth vibration mode of baffle can be considered as the virtual displacement δ w x t e i ω s t w s x assuming that the baffle is forced to vibrate in the lth mode and the transverse deflection of baffle is defined as w x t e i ω l t w l x such being a case eq 45 can be rewritten as 46 e i 0 a w s 4 w l x 4 d x ω l 2 0 a ρ t p w s w l ρ f w s φ 3 l z h φ 1 l z h d x 2 4 once again one can also acquire 47 e i 0 a w l 4 w s x 4 d x ω s 2 0 a ρ t p w l w s ρ f w l φ s 3 z h φ s 1 z h d x according to the variational expression of the strain energy in eq 44 one has 48 0 a w s 4 w l x 4 d x 0 a w l 4 w s x 4 d x plugging eq 48 in eqs 46 and 47 yields the following integral equation ω s 2 0 a ρ t p w

eq 29 inserting eqs 40 and 41 into eq 38 gives 51 n 1 q n t φ j n z h n 1 q n t ω n 2 φ j n z h x u t j 3 4 applying eqs 5 and 42 to eq 3 with eq 41 it can be easily shown that n 1 q n t ρ t p ρ f w n φ 3 n z h φ 1 n z h 52 n 1 q n t ω n 2 ρ t p ρ f w n φ 3 n z h φ 1 n z h 0 obviously eqs 51 and 52 represent the coupled vibration equations for the interaction of the flexible baffle and liquid the space coordinate x can be eliminated via multiplying both sides of eq 51 by φ s z z h and making the integral of variable x over the intervals 0 a and a b the space coordinate x can be eliminated by multiplying the both sides of eq 52 by φ s z z h and making the integral of variable x over the interval 0 a then adding eq 52 to both sides of eq 51 and taking advantage of the modal orthogonality from eq 50 the coupled dynamic response equations are obtained in terms of the generalized coordinate q n t 53 m n q n t k n q n t u t where m n and k n are defined as m n 0 a φ 3 n z z h φ 3 n z h d

duhamel s integral can be employed to estimate the response of a linearly undamped sdf system to any form of dynamic loading hence the general solution of the generalized time coordinate is expressed as 56 q n t q n 0 cos ω n t q n 0 ω n sin ω n t 1 m n ω n 0 t u τ sin ω n t τ d τ where q n 0 and q n 0 are referred to as the initial value and the initial velocity of the generalized time coordinate respectively consequently one can obtain the other quantities of practical interest such as the surface wave elevation hydrodynamic force and moment exerted on the container substitution of eq 56 back into eq 42 yields the expression of the dynamic deflection of baffle using eqs 40 41 and 56 results in the total velocity potential 57 φ j φ j r φ j p n 1 q n t φ j n x z x u t j 1 2 3 4 implementation of eq 57 in eq 34 generates the surface wave elevation 58 η j 1 g n 1 q n t φ j n x z z h x u t j 3 4 the hydrodynamic pressure imposed on the container wall can be determined by applying eq 57 to the linearized bernoulli equation 59 p j ρ f φ j t ρ f n 1 q n t φ j n x z x u t j 1 2 3 4 directly integrating eq 59 over the left and right sidewalls of the container the resultant

thickness of thin baffle is t p 2 mm the non dimensional baffle length is β 1 0 5 0 6 the non dimensional baffle height is fixed at α 0 5 0 7 table 2 gives the convergence of the lowest two sloshing frequencies λ s n 2 n 1 2 and bulging frequencies λ b n 2 n 1 2 versus the combination of truncation constants n s n b when the truncated number of items is n s 28 and n b 13 the present method can guarantee the coupled frequencies with the three significant digits at least thence n s 30 and n b 15 are considered in the ensuing calculations example 2 consider the relative baffle length and height to be β 1 0 1 and α 0 7 respectively the container and baffle possess the same other dimensions and material properties as the previous section for the given rectangular rigid container without baffle the natural frequencies of liquid normalized by using eq 21 are theoretically written as λ n 2 n π β tanh n π β ibrahim 2005 where n indicates the mode number to validate the semi analytical procedure the eight lowest natural frequencies from the present and theoretical formulations are calculated and listed in table 3 the maximum relative error is less than 1 52 between two different formulations observed from table and consequently the semi analytical results matches closely with theoretical results this means that the very small length of baffle has a limit effect on the natural frequencies of liquid example 3 when the aspect ratio h b of the container with horizontal baffle is considered as 1 the baffle length to container width ratio is taken as a b 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 the baffle thickness is fixed at t p 5 mm to represent a nearly rigid baffle as shown in fig 3 a degenerate comparison is made between the present results and those by hu et al 2018 the numerical data of hu et al 2018 are obtained by means of bem procedure for a 2d single baffled rectangular container containing an ideal liquid it is observed from fig 3 that the results of the present analysis are found to be in good accordance with available results the above verification examples 2 and 3 signify that the present semi analytical model can reasonably predict the coupled liquid structure interaction features example 4 in terms of liquid sloshing in a 2d unbaffled rectangular container faltinsen 1978 formulated the general linear solution for the liquid velocity potential φ which can

comparison with the theoretical solutions from faltinsen 1978 a nearly close agreement observed from this figure signifies that the present computational algorithm is able to predict the reasonable response of liquid minor discrepancies in the oscillation amplitude exhibited by fig 4 may be caused due to the presence of a short baffle considering hydroelasticity in this study example 5 in order

ω 5 290 rad s by use of the potential flow based formulations biswal et al 2006 developed a mixed eulerian lagrangian fem to acquire the linear and nonlinear oscillation predictions of liquid in a 2d rigidly baffled rectangular container xue et al 2012 estimated the effect of single baffle on the nonlinear sloshing response with a change in the rigid baffle length via solving the navier stokes equations in a 2d rectangular container fig 5 depicts the temporal evolution of the wave heights on the free surface at right wall for two different ratios a b it can be seen from this figure that the present results appear to match closely with the numerical data of biswal et al 2006 and xue et al 2012 in first several seconds of duration however as the excitation time is going on there is a slight difference between the present amplitude and the linear one by biswal et al 2006 this is because of biswal et al 2006 considering the baffle to be rigid moreover some discrepancies can also be observed between the present and nonlinear amplitudes it is initiated from the consideration of rigid baffle and the nonlinear analysis by xue et al 2012 4 numerical results 4 1 sloshing and bulging frequencies versus the baffle length and height fig 6 shows the effects of the baffle length ratio a h on the first two sloshing frequencies it is found that there is a decrease of sloshing frequencies with the increase of the baffle length ratio from 0 1 to 0 5 also when the baffle gradually comes to liquid surface there is a more apparent decrease of sloshing frequencies with the increase of the baffle length however as the baffle length ratio continuously increase within an interval of 0 5 0 9 a sudden change may occur and the sloshing frequencies are shifted to higher values the magnitude of this change is greater with the baffle position being moved closer to liquid surface fig 7 presents the effects of the baffle height on the first two sloshing frequencies if the ratio of the baffle length to the filling level is less than 0 5 the sloshing frequencies decreases monotonically with the increase of the baffle height when the baffle length continues to be elongated the sloshing frequencies no longer keep monotonically decreasing as the baffle is away from the bottom the sloshing frequencies are first amplified reach a certain constant and then drop sharply the reason behind these behaviors observed from figs 6 and 7 is to avoid the resonance condition induced by the strong coupled effect of liquid and flexible baffle this means that a thin baffle may magnify or reduce the sloshing frequencies which is appreciably helpful of improving the structural stability of a rectangular container the bulging frequencies of the clamped free baffle is dependent of the length and position of baffle fig 8 illustrates the lowest two bulging frequencies as a function of a h for h h 0 7 and a function of h h for a h 0 6 respectively in the container with an elastic baffle of t p 2 mm it follows that the bulging frequencies decrease remarkably with an increase in a h this is due to the stronger hydroelastic effect induced by the increasing length of baffle as the baffle gets close to the quiescent free surface the bulging frequencies increase and reach a convergence value 4 2 sloshing and bulging mode shapes versus the baffle length and height the rectangular container with a thin baffle of t p 2 mm is considered fig 9 illustrates the free surface profiles and baffle profiles of the first two normalized sloshing mode shapes and bulging mode shapes against the dimensionless length and height of baffle we define f sn and f bn n 1 2 as the sloshing mode shape and the bulging mode shape respectively the coupled mode shapes of the considered system are a function of the normalized parameters of baffle as shown in fig 9 the vibration amplitudes of baffle are very small in comparison with those of free surface in the sloshing mode shapes for a η 0 3 and 0 4 when the baffle is away from the static free surface this phenomenon is more obvious the baffle deformations are dominant in the bulging mode shapes there is no sloshing motion of liquid in the second bulging mode shapes for all the considered cases one may obtain that the liquid sloshing and baffle vibration are decoupled when the baffle length and height are not large in the case of a η 0 5 the amplitude of baffle vibration is noticeably amplified in the sloshing mode shapes especially for h η 0 7 because the longer and higher baffle can result in the stronger coupled hydroelastic vibration between the liquid and the baffle 4 3 sloshing and bulging frequencies versus the baffle thickness fig 10 gives the effect of the baffle thickness on the lowest two sloshing frequencies ignoring φ 1 2 in eq 17 and φ 3 3 in eq 19 and employing the same procedure as the present work can obtain the sloshing frequencies of liquid for rigid baffle case for a comparative study if the ratio of the baffle length to the filling level is less than 0 3 the baffle thickness has no effect on the sloshing frequencies beyond this point the sloshing frequencies for elastic baffle considerably deviate from those for rigid baffle this deviation is more pronounced at low value of baffle thickness when the baffle thickness is very thin for instance t p 1 mm the sloshing frequencies are first reduced and then increase to higher values because the presence of baffle flexibility enhances the baffle effect on liquid sloshing frequencies as the thickness of baffle becomes above 2 mm the phenomenon of increasing sloshing frequencies vanishes the sloshing frequencies remain decrease with the baffle length becoming large when the baffle further becomes thick the sloshing frequencies for flexible baffle approach to those for rigid baffle this can be attributed to the fact that the thick baffle behaves like the rigid baffle and has no deformation to cause the liquid motion in the partially liquid filled rectangular container this means that the total kinetic energy owing to the free surface waves keeps unchanged thereby the sloshing frequencies do not vary for the rectangular container with a thick baffle the effect of the baffle thickness on the variation of the lowest two bulging frequencies is plotted in fig 11 for the rectangular container the dimensionless length and height of baffle are a η 0 6 and h η 0 7 respectively the bulging frequencies are magnified with the increase in the baffle thickness the reason for this behavior is that the rigidity of baffle grows up with the increasing thickness of baffle 4 4 sloshing and bulging mode shapes versus the baffle thickness the baffle with a h 0 3 is positioned at a relative depth of h h 0 8 measured from the container bottom the baffle thickness is considered to be 1 2 and 8 mm the free surface profiles and baffle profiles of the first two normalized sloshing and bulging mode shapes are depicted in fig 12 it shows that the second bulging mode shapes may be characterized by the baffle motion alone for thin or thick baffle besides it can be seen from fig 12 that the baffle deformation is larger than the liquid oscillation amplitude in the case of t p 1 mm in the sloshing mode shapes it can expound this behavior that the coupling interaction of sloshing mode shapes with thin baffle is strong in the case of the baffle thickness t p 2 mm the vibration conditions of sloshing and bulging mode shapes are similar to those of t p 1 mm however the amplitudes of the baffle vibration become small in the sloshing mode shapes because the increase of baffle thickness enhances the rigidity of baffle the additional force induced by liquid sloshing does not cause the large deformation of baffle in the case of the baffle thickness t p 8 mm the baffle has no deformation in the sloshing mode shapes due to higher rigidity of baffle the sloshing mode shapes and the first bulging mode shapes are fully decoupled from each other one may obtain that upon the baffle becoming thick the sloshing mode shapes are associated with the oscillatory liquid alone and the bulging mode shapes with baffle deformation alone 4 5 effect of baffle parameters on the dynamic responses the variations of the steady state responses are evaluated against the baffle length height and thickness the container is forced to vibrate by a sinusoidal horizontal base acceleration with the excitation amplitude x 0 and the angular frequency ω the steady state solution of generalized time coordinate can be expressed as 65 q n t x 0 ω 2 m n ω n 2 ω 2 sin ω t three baffle thicknesses are selected as t p 1 5 2 and 2 5 mm respectively the amplitude and angular frequency of the excitation are fixed at x 0 0 005 m and ω 6 rad s for all the cases 4 5 1 wave elevation versus the baffle length and height by fixing the height of baffle at h h 0 7 fig 13 exhibits the amplitude variations of surface wave elevation η max at the right wall against the baffle length ratio a h under three different thicknesses of baffle in this figure as the ratio a h increases to the certain value η max may reach zero value at a h 0 44 for t p 1 5 mm a h 0 49 for t p 2 mm and a h 0 53 for t p 2 5 mm respectively then as the baffle length continues to increase η max rapidly displays the very large values this may be because of the occurrence of resonance condition which is induced by the excitation frequency close to the fundamental sloshing frequency of liquid when the ratio a h further increases η max is first shifted to smallest value and then realizes a slow growth it should be pointed out that the observed behaviors are in line with the sloshing frequency behaviors of fig 6 from subsection 4 1 additionally it can be also found from fig 13 that the baffle thickness effect on the amplitude of surface wave elevation is almost negligible in the case of a h 0 4 with a h being more than 0 4 there is an apparent difference in the wave amplitude due to the varying baffle thickness the thicker the baffle is the longer baffle is needed for the occurrence of sloshing resonance these response behaviors caused by baffle thickness comply with the conclusions obtained by fig 10 fig 14 presents the variations of surface wave amplitudes η max at the right wall with regard to the baffle height ratio h h at a h 0 4 it can be seen that η max decreases with the lifting of baffle height and η max may reach zero value in the approximate range of h h 0 73 0 76 for three baffle thicknesses this indicates an efficient suppressing influence of baffle on the liquid oscillation then η max is monotonically magnified as the increase of baffle height is in progress according to fig 14 as the baffle sinks down toward the bottom of the container h h 0 2 the baffle thickness imposes a negligible effect on the wave amplitude it can be also observed that η max is reduced owing to the decrease of baffle thickness when 0 2 h h 0 73 moreover the effect of baffle thickness increases with the lifting of baffle height instead η max grows up with the thinner partition in the case of h h 0 76 according to the above findings from figs 13 and 14 the baffle parameters such as length height and thickness of baffle can be suitably designed to result in the minimal amplitude of surface wave elevation and consequently avoid the resonance case 4 5 2 hydrodynamic force and moment versus the baffle length and height when the baffle is situated in a relative height of h h 0 7 the effects of the baffle length ratio a h on the amplitudes of the resultant force and moment v max and m max are depicted in fig 15 as can be observed from fig 15 a as the baffle length ratio increases v max decreases monotonically and approaches to zero value at a h 0 28 in case of all the baffle thicknesses instead v max is amplified with further increase of baffle length ratio to a certain value which is of a h 0 38 for t p 1 5 mm a h 0 46 for t p 2 mm a h 0 52 for t p 2 5 mm in fig 15 b m max decreases to the minimal value with the increase of a h to 0 46 0 51 and 0 55 corresponding to three baffle thicknesses respectively in the vicinity of the extreme value points the sharp increase and then decrease in m max occurs with a h further increasing moreover the resonance phenomenon from v max and m max aligns with the conclusions found from fig 6 that the flexible baffle can change the sloshing frequency to higher value fig 16 gives the amplitudes of the resultant force and moment v max and m max pertaining to the baffle height ratio h h in terms of a h 0 4 it is clear from fig 16 a that v max is reduced uniformly to the lowest value with the baffle height ratio increasing to h h 0 6 0 62 for the considered baffle thicknesses when h h 0 6 the decreasing baffle thickness results in the reduction of v max however v max grows up with further increase of h h from 0 62 and v max is amplified due to the baffle thickness decreasing according to fig 16 b m max decreases to zero value with h h being altered from 0 1 to 0 74 beyond the ratio h h 0 76 the increasing baffle height amplifies m max in addition the thinner baffle leads to a mitigation in the resultant moment amplitude when h h 0 74 while m max increases due to the lower baffle thickness for h h 0 76 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to evaluate the sloshing behaviors and responses of liquid considering hydroelasticity effect in the rectangular container with a horizontally flexible baffle to this end a semi analytical scheme was proposed to characterize the sloshing problem liquid interacting with elastic baffle under the consideration of the linearized potential flow theory parametric analysis is performed to estimate the influence of the position length and thickness of baffle in changing the natural frequencies mode shapes and dynamic responses of liquid baffled container system the following conclusions were achieved based on the numerical results 1 as the longer horizontal baffle is moved closer to the free surface the thin baffle brings about strong coupled effect between liquid and baffle this coupled effect causes the presentence of the baffle to no longer just reduce the sloshing frequency of liquid 2 the elastic baffle may shift the sloshing frequencies to higher values which can expand the influence range of the baffle on the sloshing behavior and avoid the resonance conditions and effectively suppress the sloshing problem 3 the increasing length of baffle leads to the decrease of the bulging frequencies the smaller the distance from the baffle to the free liquid surface is the larger the bulging frequencies are since the rigidity of baffle gradually becomes large due to the thicker baffle the bulging frequencies increase 4 in terms of harmonic excitation there may exist the optimal parameter configuration of baffle which can minimize the amplitudes of surface wave elevation resultant hydrodynamic force and moment the present study provides a semi analytical procedure for hydroelastic interaction between liquid and single horizontal baffle with flexibility this scheme can be readily extended to other configurations such as the multiple horizontal baffles as well as the surface piercing and bottom mounted vertical baffles which

21540,in practical applications undesirable deformation and failure of the container may appear due to intense liquid oscillation anti slosh baffle is extensively applied to the reduction of sloshing

method and the separation of variables are used to analytically formulate the velocity potentials of sub domains the baffle deflection is expanded using its dry modal functions a linear finite

the reported literatures good agreements are achieved the effects of baffle parameters on the natural frequencies mode shapes and dynamic responses are evaluated in detail it is found that the thin baffle may increase the sloshing frequencies to higher values keywords rectangular container elastic baffle sub domain natural frequencies coupled models dynamic responses 1 introduction sloshing problem due to a variety of external disturbances is one of important concerns in many engineering systems such as water fluctuation in rectangular cross section aqueducts and rectangular tuned liquid dampers tld as well as nuclear waste sloshing in nuclear vessels etc when the period of the container movement gets close to the fundamental sloshing period of liquid within the container the inevitable hydrodynamic loads on the container wall akyildiz and ünal 2005 2006 may be induced by the violent liquid oscillation to result in a structural instability or collapse ibrahim 2005 faltinsen and timokha 2009 commonly the available anti slosh devices such as baffle plate can be employed to suppress severe sloshing by increasing the damping of liquid motion nayak and biswal 2015 goudarzi et al 2010 as a result it is necessary to appraise the dynamic behavior of liquid with and without hydroelasticity to ensure the integrity and safety of structure there are many reports to estimate the sloshing suppression effects of the various types of baffle nayak and biswal 2015 experimentally assessed the variation of natural frequencies sloshing damping and free surface displacement in the moving rectangular containers with the different internal bodies also panigrahy et al 2009 performed several experimental tests to explore the effects of horizontal and vertical baffles attached to a square container on a shake table they measured the pressure distribution and surface wave elevation with excitation frequencies and liquid fill level for the complicated sloshing problem in terms of large capacity storage containers the numerical simulations jung et al 2012 hu et al 2018 liu et al 2016 jena and biswal 2017 are more efficient than the experimental approaches zang et al 2019 examined the effect of different types of baffle on dynamic responses in a two dimensional 2d rectangular container by means of the boundary element method bem with green s theorem kargbo et al 2019 numerically investigated the effect of the submersed block with different sizes and positions on the layered liquid sloshing interfacial wave using arbitraty lagrangian eulerian ale approach mitra and sinhamahapatra 2007 proposed a pressure based galerkin s finite element method fem to analyze the dynamic response of a rectangular rigid container within the bottom mounted submerged structure cho and kim 2016 used the eigenfunction expansion method to study the effect of the dual surface mounted vertical porous baffle on the sloshing reduction in a rectangular container based on the volume of liquid technique two numerical models were developed to evaluate the liquid sloshing behavior in a 2d rectangular container with the vertical baffle by goudarzi and danesh 2016 and akyildiz 2012 respectively cho et al 2005 investigated the sloshing damping characteristics of horizontal baffles in contact with liquid in a 2d rectangular tank by using fem an experiment was conducted out to validate the proposed numerical procedure based on bem sygulski 2011 gave the natural frequency and mode shapes of liquid oscillation in the three dimensional 3d baffled containers the previously mentioned literatures have demonstrated the effectiveness of rigid baffles in dissipating the sloshing energy for the storage containers increasing the thickness of baffle may make the baffle become rigid from the economic cost point of view however the increase of baffle thickness may reduce the liquid storage capacity of the container thereby the elasticity of baffle effect on the dynamic behavior of sloshing liquid should also be research interest for liquid filled containers in general due to the presence of the baffle flexibility there is a dynamic interaction between baffle and liquid bauer 1981 analytically determined the coupled hydroelastic vibration of liquid in a 2d rectangular container the surface with nonzero normal derivative was covered by a flexible membrane or a thin elastic plate parasil and watanabe 2016 employed ale approach to define the moving boundaries and to examine the liquid membrane interactions kolaei and rakheja 2019 used the combination of a variational formulation and the galerkin method to presented the fem model and to simulate the coupled hydroelastic frequencies of the sloshing flexible membrane interaction in a container with arbitrary geometry they also concluded that the sloshing frequencies may be shifted to higher values to prevent resonance wang et al 2016 2019 and wang and zhou 2018 proposed the semi analytical mathematical models to extract the coupled sloshing characteristics of liquid for a cylindrical rigid container mounted with one or more flexible annular baffles which was verified to possess a high accuracy and small computational cost using fem and or bem many studies were performed to develop the numerical procedures to simulate the coupled liquid and elastic structures interaction by ghalandari et al 2019 hernández and santamarina 2012 noorian et al 2012 and biswal and bhattacharyya 2010 the obtained data indicated that the liquid oscillation behavior may be significantly affected by the baffle flexibility hwang et al 2016 presented a newly modified particle based fluid structure interaction fsi solver to describe the oscillation flows of liquid contained in a rolling container equipped with elastic baffle a fully lagranian meshfree computational algorithm was proposed by khayyer et al 2018 to assess the incompressible liquid sloshing considering hydroelasticity khayyer et al 2019 developed an enhanced multi resolution mps mps fsi solver to simulate the sloshing of liquid interacting with a bottom clamped elastic baffle a set of ocean engineering related benchmark tests were conducted to validate their approach hermange et al 2019 explored the complex tire hydroplaning simulations on rough ground through implementation of an innovative 3d sph fe coupled model the present study aims at semi analytically evaluating the effects of horizontal baffle with elasticity on the coupled natural frequencies mode shapes and dynamic responses in rectangular rigid container containing the incompressible and non viscos liquid the linearized boundary condition of free liquid surface is considered the four liquid sub domains are separated from the entire liquid domain the superposition principle combined with the separation of variables is used to formulate the velocity potential functions of sub domains the governing equation of coupled liquid baffle system is described via the forced equation of the 2d euler bernoulli beam with the clamped free edges the continuity conditions of pressure and velocity are incorporated at the artificial interfaces and the compatibility condition is satisfied at the contact interface of sub domains and baffle the sloshing and structural modes of liquid coupled baffle are acquired by using the finite fourier series expansion and the generalized eigenvalue approach the total velocity potential consists of rigid and perturbed velocity potentials for horizontally excited rectangular rigid container the coupled modal orthogonality is demonstrated the dynamic response equation of the coupled system is established via the combination of the surface sloshing equation and the dominant equation of a baffle 2 mathematical background fig 1 describes an elastic baffle horizontally attached at the one sidewall of a 2d rectangular rigid container of width b where a denotes the length of the baffle and h is the height of the baffle measured from the bottom the thickness and material density of baffle is t p and ρ the notations ρ f and h represent mass density and height of liquid respectively a cartesian coordinate frame oxz is established in fig 1 the container is filled with inviscid and incompressible liquid with irrotational flow according to the sub domain method proposed by wang et al 2016 2019 and wang and zhou 2018 the mean liquid region ω is comprised of four simple sub domains ω j j 1 2 3 4 with three virtual interfaces γ k k 1 2 3 as shown in fig

velocity potential function in a scalar form can be used to describe the liquid flow field 1 φ x z t φ j x z t x z ω j j 1 2 3 4 since the artificial interfaces γ k between the adjacent sub domains ω

image 1 denotes the outward unit vectossr normal to the interface the ordered triples j j k are taken as the set 1 2 1 3 4 2 2 4 3 2 1 formulation for an elastic baffle the thin baffle is treated as a 2d euler bernoulli beam of which shear deformation can be ignored the baffle is composed of an isotropic homogeneous and linear elastic material according to the assumption of the 2d euler bernoulli beam theory generally when the thickness of baffle is less than twenty times the length of baffle the effect of transverse shear strain of baffle can be ignored the left end of the baffle is fixed at the sidewall x 0 while the other end of the baffle is viewed as a free boundary according to the vibration theory of the euler bernoulli beam the transverse deflection function of baffle w x t is given by the following dominant equation 3 e i 4 w x 4 ρ t p 2 w t 2 f baffle where f baffle ρ f φ 3 t z h ρ f φ 1 t z h denotes the vertical force exerted on the wetted baffle surfaces induced by sub domains ω1 and ω3 ei is the flexural rigidity of baffle and ρt p its mass per unit length along the baffle the compatibility of the normal velocity to the contact interface between the baffle and the sub domains should be fulfilled by 4 φ 1 z z h φ 3 z z h w t when the baffle vibrates freely the motion of any point of baffle is regarded as the harmonic function of time thence the solutions of eq 3 are expressed by 5 w x t n 1 n 1 e i ω t a n n p w n x i 2 1 where ω is the natural circular frequency of the coupled liquid baffle system a n n p n 1 2 3 n 1 2 3 is the appropriate mode coefficient the n th normal mode of baffle oscillation w n x in vacuum can be expressed as 6 w n x sinh λ n x sin λ n x c n cosh λ n x cos λ n x with 7 c n sinh λ n a sin λ n a cosh λ n a cos λ n a where the frequency parameters λ n are the characteristic roots of cos λ n a cosh λ n a 1 2 2 free vibration of liquid in an elasticity baffled container 2 2 1 solution of velocity potential the velocity potential function φ j x z t of each sub domain ω j should satisfy the linearized form of laplace equation 8 2 φ j x z t 0 in ω j so the liquid velocity of any point of each sub domain can be written as 9 v x j φ j x v z j φ j z the boundary conditions on the wetted area of the container are written as 10 φ j x x 0 0 j 1 3 φ j x x b 0 j 2 4 φ j z z 0 0 j 1 2 thus the sloshing condition at the free sub surfaces σ1 and σ2 corresponding the sub domains ω3 and ω4 is given by 11 φ j z z h 1 g 2 φ j t 2 z h 0 j 3 4 where g is the body force per unit mass of liquid according to the linear sloshing theory the velocity potential can be considered as the harmonic function of time i e φ j x z t i ω e i ω t φ j x z j 1 2 3 4 φ j x z indicates the sloshing mode shape for the sub domain ω j in such a case eqs 2 8 10 and 11 are rewritten as 12 2 φ j 0 j 1 2 3 4 13 φ j x x 0 0 j 1 3 φ j x x b 0 j 2 4 φ j z z 0 0 j 1 2 14 φ j φ j φ j n k φ j n k on γ k 15 φ j z z h 1 g 2 φ j t 2 z h 0 j 3 4 obviously it is observed from eqs 12 15 that predominate equations and the boundary conditions are all linear therefore based on the superposition principle the modal function inside the sub domain ω j can be expressed as 16 φ j q 1 q j φ j q q j 2 j 1 2 3 j 3 4 where q j denotes the total number of the inhomogeneous boundary condition for each sub domain ω j φ j q is the qth mode component of image 2 φ j

space coordinate x can be eliminated via multiplying both sides of eq 51 by φ s z z h and making the integral of variable x over the intervals 0 a and a b the space coordinate x can be eliminated by multiplying the both sides of eq 52 by φ s z z h and making the integral of variable x over the interval 0 a then adding eq 52 to both sides of eq 51 and taking advantage of the modal orthogonality from eq 50 the coupled dynamic response equations are obtained in terms of the generalized coordinate q n t 53 m n q n t k n q n t u t where m n and k n are defined as m n 0 a φ 3 n z z h φ 3 n z h d

respectively consequently one can obtain the other quantities of practical interest such as the surface wave elevation hydrodynamic force and moment exerted on the container substitution of eq 56 back into eq 42 yields the expression of the dynamic deflection of baffle using eqs 40 41 and 56 results in the total velocity potential 57 φ j φ j r φ j p n 1 q n t φ j n x z x u t j 1 2 3 4 implementation of eq 57 in eq 34 generates the surface wave elevation 58 η j 1 g n 1 q n t φ j n x z z h x u t j 3 4 the hydrodynamic pressure imposed on the container wall can be determined by

performed to demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the developed semi analytical procedure for simulating the free vibration behavior and dynamic response of the coupled system in the baffled rectangular rigid container unless otherwise specified in the following analysis the considered geometrical dimensions and material properties for the baffled rectangular are given in table 1 example 1 an example is presented to demonstrate the convergence of the semi analytical results by observing the stability in the value of solutions with the increase of the truncated number of items the thickness of thin baffle is t p 2 mm the non dimensional baffle length is β 1 0 5 0 6 the non dimensional baffle height is fixed at α 0 5 0 7 table 2 gives the convergence of the lowest two sloshing frequencies λ s n 2 n 1 2 and bulging frequencies λ b n 2 n 1 2 versus the combination of truncation constants n s n b when the truncated number of items is n s 28 and n b 13 the present method can guarantee the coupled frequencies with the three significant digits at least thence n s 30 and n b 15 are considered in the ensuing calculations example 2 consider the relative baffle length and height to be β 1 0 1 and α 0 7 respectively the container and baffle possess the same other dimensions and material properties as the previous section for the given rectangular rigid container without baffle the natural frequencies of liquid normalized by using eq 21 are theoretically written as λ n 2 n π β tanh n π β ibrahim 2005 where n indicates the mode number to validate the semi analytical procedure the eight lowest natural frequencies from the present and theoretical formulations are calculated and listed in table 3 the maximum relative error is less than 1 52 between two different formulations observed from table and consequently the semi analytical results matches closely with theoretical results this means that the very small length of baffle has a limit effect on the natural frequencies of liquid example 3 when the aspect ratio h b of the container with horizontal baffle is considered as 1 the baffle length to container width ratio is taken as a b 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 the baffle thickness is fixed at t p 5 mm to represent a nearly rigid baffle as shown in fig 3 a degenerate comparison is made between the present results and those by hu et al 2018 the numerical data of hu et al 2018 are obtained by means of bem procedure for a 2d single baffled rectangular container containing an ideal liquid it is observed from fig 3 that the results of the present analysis are found to be in good accordance with available results the above verification examples 2 and 3 signify that the present semi analytical model can reasonably predict the coupled liquid structure interaction features example 4 in terms of liquid sloshing in a 2d unbaffled rectangular container faltinsen 1978 formulated the general linear solution for the liquid velocity potential φ which can

c n q n ω n 2 ω 2 d n c n q n ω 2 q n ω 3 2 a 1 n k n 2 the relative length and height of baffle are β 1 0 1 and α 0 3 respectively the thickness of baffle is taken as 0 005 m the container is subjected to the horizontal sinusoidal excitation u t x 0 ω 2 sin ω t where the excitation amplitude x 0 0 002 m as shown in fig 4 the vertical displacement of the free surface at right wall are in comparison with the theoretical solutions from faltinsen 1978 a nearly close agreement observed from this figure signifies that the present computational algorithm is able to predict the reasonable response of liquid minor discrepancies in the oscillation amplitude exhibited by fig 4 may be caused due to the presence of a short baffle considering hydroelasticity in this study example 5 in order to verify the procedure developed in the present study for simulating the liquid sloshing in a 2d baffled rectangular container two comparisons of surface wave elevations are performed the container of width b 1 m is filled with the liquid of depth h 0 5 m the baffle is positioned at a height of h 0 1 m from the container bottom the ratios of the baffle and the container width are selected as a b 0 4 0 6 the baffle thickness is fixed at 0 005 m used by biswal et al 2006 and xue et al 2012 the container is excited by the horizontal sinusoidal excitation u t x 0 ω 2 sin ω t where x 0 0 002 m and ω 5 290 rad s by use of the potential flow based formulations biswal et al 2006 developed a mixed eulerian lagrangian fem to acquire the linear and nonlinear oscillation predictions of liquid in a 2d rigidly baffled rectangular container xue et al 2012 estimated the effect of single baffle on the nonlinear sloshing response with a change in the rigid baffle length via solving the navier stokes equations in a 2d rectangular container fig 5 depicts the temporal evolution of the wave heights on the free surface at right wall for two different ratios a b it can be seen from this figure that the present results appear to match closely with the numerical data of biswal et al 2006 and xue et al 2012 in first several seconds of duration however as the excitation time is going on there is a slight difference between the present amplitude and the linear one by biswal et al 2006 this is because of biswal et al 2006 considering the baffle to be rigid moreover some discrepancies can also be observed between the present and nonlinear amplitudes it is initiated from the consideration of rigid baffle and the nonlinear analysis by xue et al 2012 4 numerical results 4 1 sloshing and bulging frequencies versus the baffle length and height fig 6 shows the effects of the baffle length ratio a h on the first two sloshing frequencies it is found that there is a decrease of sloshing frequencies with the increase of the baffle length ratio from 0 1 to 0 5 also when the baffle gradually comes to liquid surface there is a more apparent decrease of sloshing frequencies with the increase of the baffle length however as the baffle length ratio continuously increase within an interval of 0 5 0 9 a sudden change may occur and the sloshing frequencies are shifted to higher values the magnitude of this change is greater with the baffle position being moved closer to liquid surface fig 7 presents the effects of the baffle height on the first two sloshing frequencies if the ratio of the baffle length to the filling level is less than 0 5 the sloshing frequencies decreases monotonically with the increase of the baffle height when the baffle length continues to be elongated the sloshing frequencies no longer keep monotonically decreasing as the baffle is away from the bottom the sloshing frequencies are first amplified reach a certain constant and then drop sharply the reason behind these behaviors observed from figs 6 and 7 is to avoid the resonance condition induced by the strong coupled effect of liquid and flexible baffle this means that a thin baffle may magnify or reduce the sloshing frequencies which is appreciably helpful of improving the structural stability of a rectangular container the bulging frequencies of the clamped free baffle is dependent of the length and position of baffle fig 8 illustrates the lowest two bulging frequencies as a function of a h for h h 0 7 and a function of h h for a h 0 6 respectively in the container with an elastic baffle of t p 2 mm it follows that the bulging frequencies decrease remarkably with an increase in a h this is due to the stronger hydroelastic effect induced by the increasing length of baffle as the baffle gets close to the quiescent free surface the bulging frequencies increase and reach a convergence value 4 2 sloshing and bulging mode shapes versus the baffle length and height the rectangular container with a thin baffle of t p 2 mm is considered fig 9 illustrates the free surface profiles and baffle profiles of the first two normalized sloshing mode shapes and bulging mode shapes against the dimensionless length and height of baffle we define f sn and f bn n 1 2 as the sloshing mode shape and the bulging mode shape respectively the coupled mode shapes of the considered system are a function of the normalized parameters of baffle as shown in fig 9 the vibration amplitudes of baffle are very small in comparison with those of free surface in the sloshing mode shapes for a η 0 3 and 0 4 when the baffle is away from the static free surface this phenomenon is more obvious the baffle deformations are dominant in the bulging mode shapes there is no sloshing motion of liquid in the second bulging mode shapes for all the considered cases one may obtain that the liquid sloshing and baffle vibration are decoupled when the baffle length and height are not large in the case of a η 0 5 the amplitude of baffle vibration is noticeably amplified in the sloshing mode shapes especially for h η 0 7 because the longer and higher baffle can result in the stronger coupled hydroelastic vibration between the liquid and the baffle 4 3 sloshing and bulging frequencies versus the baffle thickness fig 10 gives the effect of the baffle thickness on the lowest two sloshing frequencies ignoring φ 1 2 in eq 17 and φ 3 3 in eq 19 and employing the same procedure as the present work can obtain the sloshing frequencies of liquid for rigid baffle case for a comparative study if the ratio of the baffle length to the filling level is less than 0 3 the baffle thickness has no effect on the sloshing frequencies beyond this point the sloshing frequencies for elastic baffle considerably deviate from those for rigid baffle this deviation is more pronounced at low value of baffle thickness when the baffle thickness is very thin for instance t p 1 mm the sloshing frequencies are first reduced and then increase to higher values because the presence of baffle flexibility enhances the baffle effect on liquid sloshing frequencies as the thickness of baffle becomes above 2 mm the phenomenon of increasing sloshing frequencies vanishes the sloshing frequencies remain decrease with the baffle length becoming large when the baffle further becomes thick the sloshing frequencies for flexible baffle approach to those for rigid baffle this can be attributed to the fact that the thick baffle behaves like the rigid baffle and has no deformation to cause the liquid motion in the partially liquid filled rectangular container this means that the total kinetic energy owing to the free surface waves keeps unchanged thereby the sloshing frequencies do not vary for the rectangular container with a thick baffle the effect of the baffle thickness on the variation of the lowest two bulging frequencies is plotted in fig 11 for the rectangular container the dimensionless length and height of baffle are a η 0 6 and h η 0 7 respectively the bulging frequencies are magnified with the increase in the baffle thickness the reason for this behavior is that the rigidity of baffle grows up with the increasing thickness of baffle 4 4 sloshing and bulging mode shapes versus the baffle thickness the baffle with a h 0 3 is positioned at a relative depth of h h 0 8 measured from the container bottom the baffle thickness is considered to be 1 2 and 8 mm the free surface profiles and baffle profiles of the first two normalized sloshing and bulging mode shapes are depicted in fig 12 it shows that the second bulging mode shapes may be characterized by the baffle motion alone for thin or thick baffle besides it can be seen from fig 12 that the baffle deformation is larger than the liquid oscillation amplitude in the case of t p 1 mm in the sloshing mode shapes it can expound this behavior that the coupling interaction of sloshing mode shapes with thin baffle is strong in the case of the baffle thickness t p 2 mm the vibration conditions of sloshing and bulging mode shapes are similar to those of t p 1 mm however the amplitudes of the baffle vibration become small in the sloshing mode shapes because the increase of baffle thickness enhances the rigidity of baffle the additional force induced by liquid sloshing does not cause the large deformation of baffle in the case of the baffle thickness t p 8 mm the baffle has no deformation in the sloshing mode shapes due to higher rigidity of baffle the sloshing mode shapes and the first bulging mode shapes are fully decoupled from each other one may obtain that upon the baffle becoming thick the sloshing mode shapes are associated with the oscillatory liquid alone and the bulging mode shapes with baffle deformation alone 4 5 effect of baffle parameters on the dynamic responses the variations of the steady state responses are evaluated against the baffle length height and thickness the container is forced to vibrate by a sinusoidal horizontal base acceleration with the excitation amplitude x 0 and the angular frequency ω the steady state solution of generalized time coordinate can be expressed as 65 q n t x 0 ω 2 m n ω n 2 ω 2 sin ω t three baffle thicknesses are selected as t p 1 5 2 and 2 5 mm respectively the amplitude and angular frequency of the excitation are fixed at x 0 0 005 m and ω 6 rad s for all the cases 4 5 1 wave elevation versus the baffle length and height by fixing the height of baffle at h h 0 7 fig 13 exhibits the amplitude variations of surface wave elevation η max at the right wall against the baffle length ratio a h under three different thicknesses of baffle in this figure as the ratio a h increases to the certain value η max may reach zero value at a h 0 44 for t p 1 5 mm a h 0 49 for t p 2 mm and a h 0 53 for t p 2 5 mm respectively then as the baffle length continues to increase η max rapidly displays the very large values this may be because of the occurrence of resonance condition which is induced by the excitation frequency close to the fundamental sloshing frequency of liquid when the ratio a h further increases η max is first shifted to smallest value and then realizes a slow growth it should be pointed out that the observed behaviors are in line with the sloshing frequency behaviors of fig 6 from subsection 4 1 additionally it can be also found from fig 13 that the baffle thickness effect on the amplitude of surface wave elevation is almost negligible in the case of a h 0 4 with a h being more than 0 4 there is an apparent difference in the wave amplitude due to the varying baffle thickness the thicker the baffle is the longer baffle is needed for the occurrence of sloshing resonance these response behaviors caused by baffle thickness comply with the conclusions obtained by fig 10 fig 14 presents the variations of surface wave amplitudes η max at the right wall with regard to the baffle height ratio h h at a h 0 4 it can be seen that η max decreases with the lifting of baffle height and η max may reach zero value in the approximate range of h h 0 73 0 76 for three baffle thicknesses this indicates an efficient suppressing influence of baffle on the liquid oscillation then η max is monotonically magnified as the increase of baffle height is in progress according to fig 14 as the baffle sinks down toward the bottom of the container h h 0 2 the baffle thickness imposes a negligible effect on the wave amplitude it can be also observed that η max is reduced owing to the decrease of baffle thickness when 0 2 h h 0 73 moreover the effect of baffle thickness increases with the lifting of baffle height instead η max grows up with the thinner partition in the case of h h 0 76 according to the above findings from figs 13 and 14 the baffle parameters such as length height and thickness of baffle can be suitably designed to result in the minimal amplitude of surface wave elevation and consequently avoid the resonance case 4 5 2 hydrodynamic force and moment versus the baffle length and height when the baffle is situated in a relative height of h h 0 7 the effects of the baffle length ratio a h on the amplitudes of the resultant force and moment v max and m max are depicted in fig 15 as can be observed from fig 15 a as the baffle length ratio increases v max decreases monotonically and approaches to zero value at a h 0 28 in case of all the baffle thicknesses instead v max is amplified with further increase of baffle length ratio to a certain value which is of a h 0 38 for t p 1 5 mm a h 0 46 for t p 2 mm a h 0 52 for t p 2 5 mm in fig 15 b m max decreases to the minimal value with the increase of a h to 0 46 0 51 and 0 55 corresponding to three baffle thicknesses respectively in the vicinity of the extreme value points the sharp increase and then decrease in m max occurs with a h further increasing moreover the resonance phenomenon from v max and m max aligns with the conclusions found from fig 6 that the flexible baffle can change the sloshing frequency to higher value fig 16 gives the amplitudes of the resultant force and moment v max and m max pertaining to the baffle height ratio h h in terms of a h 0 4 it is clear from fig 16 a that v max is reduced uniformly to the lowest value with the baffle height ratio increasing to h h 0 6 0 62 for the considered baffle thicknesses when h h 0 6 the decreasing baffle thickness results in the reduction of v max however v max grows up with further increase of h h from 0 62 and v max is amplified due to the baffle thickness decreasing according to fig 16 b m max decreases to zero value with h h being altered from 0 1 to 0 74 beyond the ratio h h 0 76 the increasing baffle height amplifies m max in addition the thinner baffle leads to a mitigation in the resultant moment amplitude when h h 0 74 while m max increases due to the lower baffle thickness for h h 0 76 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to evaluate the sloshing behaviors and responses of liquid considering hydroelasticity effect in the rectangular container with a horizontally flexible baffle to this end a semi analytical scheme was proposed to characterize the sloshing problem liquid interacting with elastic baffle under the consideration of the linearized potential flow theory parametric analysis is performed to estimate the influence of the position length and thickness of baffle in changing the natural frequencies mode shapes and dynamic responses of liquid baffled container system the following conclusions were achieved based on the numerical results 1 as the longer horizontal baffle is moved closer to the free surface the thin baffle brings about strong coupled effect between liquid and baffle this coupled effect causes the presentence of the baffle to no longer just reduce the sloshing frequency of liquid 2 the elastic baffle may shift the sloshing frequencies to higher values which can expand the influence range of the baffle on the sloshing behavior and avoid the resonance conditions and effectively suppress the sloshing problem 3 the increasing length of baffle leads to the decrease of the bulging frequencies the smaller the distance from the baffle to the free liquid surface is the larger the bulging frequencies are since the rigidity of baffle gradually becomes large due to the thicker baffle the bulging frequencies increase 4 in terms of harmonic excitation there may exist the optimal parameter configuration of baffle which can minimize the amplitudes of surface wave elevation resultant hydrodynamic force and moment the present study provides a semi analytical procedure for hydroelastic interaction between liquid and single horizontal baffle with flexibility this scheme can be readily extended to other configurations such as the multiple horizontal baffles as well as the surface piercing and bottom mounted vertical baffles which

21541,although some studies have been conducted to simulate the dynamic response of bridge piers under barge impact several essential modeling issues e g reasonably exerting permanent loads and simplifying fe models are not well examined hence high resolution fe models are meticulously developed in this paper to simulate barge collisions with a typical four span continuous girder bridge numerical results highlight the importance of the gravity load for barge impact induced responses a simplified bridge model is proposed to improve computational efficiency the proposed simplified method is found to be more accurate than that of the one pier two span opts model also it is observed that although the peak impact force increases with impact energy the impact induced displacement does not always increase it is attributed to the fact that the spectral characteristics of the impact force time history have a significant influence on the impact induced responses to improve the impact resistance three strengthening methods based on ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc are investigated and compared it is found that strengthening columns with two end uhpfrc jackets is superior to other strengthening methods when considering cost benefit ratio finally a multi objective optimization design procedure is presented for the uhpfrc strengthened columns keywords barge impact bridge structures reinforced concrete rc column fe modeling dynamic behavior uhpfrc based strengthening 1 introduction a growing number of catastrophic accidents on vessel collisions with bridges have been reported recently around the world aashto 2009 yuan and harik 2010 kantrales et al 2015 fan et al 2018a sha and hao 2013a consolazio et al 2014 fig 1 shows some collapses of bridge structures caused by vessel collisions just in 2019 vessel collisions led to substantial damage to over ten bridge structures including the collapse of the bridge spanning the moju river in brazil and severe damage of the i 10 bridge over the san jacinto river in the united states the majority of these accidents were caused by aberrant barges which are widely used throughout inland and coastal regions kantrales et al 2019 all these accidents imply that bridge structures spanning navigable waterways must be carefully designed to minimize their susceptibility to damage from vessel collisions aashto 2009 ministry of communications of china 2015 bridge design specifications aashto 2009 ministry of communications of china 2015 aashto aashtolrfd bridge design specifications and u s 2016 usually use an equivalent static analysis procedure to design bridge structures to resist vessel impacts due to its simplicity for engineering practice however it was demonstrated that the impact induced response of a bridge would be significantly underestimated by the code prescribed static analysis method since it neglects dynamic amplification effects to overcome the limitations of the static analysis procedure some alternative analysis methods e g coupled vessel impact analysis cvia consolazio and cowan 2005 and shock spectrum analysis ssa cowan et al 2015 fan et al 2016a were recently proposed most of these methods employed an equivalent elastic perfectly plastic force deformation relationship to approximate the behavior of barge bow and fiber based beam elements to model bridge piers davidson et al 2013 these treatments can significantly improve computational efficiency but also result in some drawbacks for example local and shear damage of the impacted bridge column cannot be captured due to the use of the fiber based beam elements in addition when an elastic perfectly plastic force deformation relationship is used to represent the behavior of a barge bow the impact load forms i e sine function and trapezoid form are different from those obtained from the high resolution fe simulations typically an initial peak impact force can be observed in the detailed fe simulation sha and hao 2013a these differences in the impact loads would lead to different impact induced responses of bridge structures hence although several simplified methods are currently available the high resolution fe simulations based on general contact impact nonlinear fe codes are still irreplaceable in some cases the majority of the high resolution fe simulations were only used to determine vessel impact loads rather than structural behaviors in the current studies compared with vehicle collisions with bridges limited studies employed detailed fe simulations to investigate the nonlinear dynamic performance of bridge structures under vessel collisions sha and hao 2012 2013a 2013b adopted the nonlinear fe analysis technique to simulate barge collisions with a single reinforced concrete pier and a continuous girder bridge jiang et al 2017 numerically investigated the progressive collapse of a continuous girder bridge under collisions using a high resolution fe model gholipour et al 2020 developed detailed fe models to simulate a cable stayed bridge pier under ship collisions although these studies have been devoted to modeling bridge structures under vessel collisions several essential modeling issues e g reasonably exerting gravity loads and appropriately simplifying fe models were not clarified therefore it is necessary to address these modeling issues by developing a new fe analysis method for vessel bridge collosions on the other hand all accidents shown in fig 1 were initiated from damage of off channel piers with low crashworthiness that were struck by errant vessels this highlights the importance of off channel piers to resist vessel collisions for a bridge crossing waterways as shown in fig 1 there are many off channel piers that are exposed to vessel collisions if independent protective structures e g fenders fan et al 2018a pile supported structures fan and yuan 2014 are used to protect the off channel piers it is not only uneconomical but may also lead to scouring issues induced by the increase of the water blocking area due to the presence of the protective structures hence some strengthening methods using steel or fiber reinforced plastics frp jackets wang et al 2013 sha and hao 2015 have been studied for improving the impact resistance of bridge piers as pointed out by aashto aashto 2009 however the use of steel materials for protections has some disadvantages such as low durability against corrosion similarly frp jackets are also vulnerable to degradation particularly for adhesive epoxy resin and damage due to the impact of small floating objects fan et al 2018b ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc is defined as an advanced engineering material with a compressive strength no less than 150 mpa and a tensile strength no less than 8 mpa russell and graybeal 2013 habel et al 2006 yoo and banthia 2016 in addition to the high strength uhpfrc materials exhibit superior long term durability and excellent energy absorption capacity russell and graybeal 2013 habel et al 2006 yoo and banthia 2016 uhpfrc exhibits an outstanding performance for structural members subjected to impact and shock loadings fan et al 2018b 2019 fan et al 2020 yoo and banthia 2017 guo et al 2018 because of the excellent material properties the potential of uhpfrc is worth exploring in bridge protections against vessel collisions particularly for the off channel piers with low resistances in this context this study aims to develop the fe modeling method of bridge structures under barge collision scenarios and to evaluate the barge impact resistant performance of uhpfrc strengthened columns using the developed analysis method some essential modeling issues e g the influence of gravity loads are examined to improve computational efficiency a new simplified bridge model is proposed and compared with the one pier two span opts model reported in the previous studies based on the proposed model different collision scenarios are considered to explore the barge impact resistance of rc piers the barge impact induced responses of a bridge structure are discussed based on structural dynamics to improve the impact resistance of rc columns three different strengthening methods with uhpfrc jackets are investigated and compared a detailed parametric study is conducted for the recommended solution with two end uhpfrc jackets to examine the influences of reinforcement ratios length and thickness of uhpfrc jackets in addition a multi objective optimization design procedure is developed to find the optimal configuration of the strengthened rc columns for barge impact 2 bridge and barge fe models and verifications 2 1 bridge fe model and parameters refer to the jiujiang bridge shown in fig 1 c a four span continuous girder bridge is selected in this paper each span length is 50 m and the total span length is 200 m for the bridge fig 2 a each bridge pier consists of two columns a cap beam and a footing fig 2 b each bridge column has a circular cross section with 2 m in diameter and 18 m in height the two cell box girder widely used in china is designed as the bridge superstructure and its dimensions are shown in fig 2 c according to china s bridge design code ministry of communications of china 2015 the typical reinforcement ratios longitudinal ratio 0 99 and transverse ratio 0 24 are employed in all bridge columns the normal concrete with a strength grade of c40 mpa in china is used for all columns fig 3 shows the high resolution fe model of the continuous girder bridge all bridge column bents are modeled using eight node solid elements with single point integration it is worth mentioning that the non impacted piers can also be simulated by beam elements as a result of this treatment computational efficiency can be improved but the connections e g the connection between the pier column and the cap beam should be carefully modeled to decrease the approximation error the bridge girders and piles are simulated using beam elements to reduce computation time as observed in the past collision accidents the impacted bridge columns are more severely damaged than other structural components e g cap beams and footing hence similar to the vehicle collision analysis do et al 2018 xu 2017 liu 2012 the elastic material model in ls dyna keyword 2014 is utilized to simulate these components for simplification discrete elements combining with material type 67 are used to simulate different bearings i e fix supports one way movable support and two way movable support between the substructure and superstructure the influence of soil pile interaction can be approximately modeled by using the m method i e linear elastic spring method provided in china s bridge design code ministry of transport of china 2007 when the geological conditions e g stiff soil or rock are good for simplification the bridge structure is assumed to be built upon a stiff rock in this study hence two orthogonal linear elastic springs at each node on the piles are employed to account for the influence of soil pile interactions where the spring stiffnesses are determined in accordance with china s bridge design code ministry of transport of china 2007 the nonlinear spring elements should be used when the nonlinear interaction between the pile and the surrounding soil is not negligible consolazio et al 2003 the concrete and reinforcement materials of the bridge columns are simulated using nonlinear material models to capture the impact induced damage and response like the previous studies fan and yuan 2014 fan et al 2015 2018b the material model mat plastic kinematic with strain rate effects is chosen to model the longitudinal and transverse reinforcement the detailed properties of all the materials are summarized in table 1 2 2 nonlinear concrete models and validations murray et al murray 2007 murray et al 2007 developed the continuous surface cap csc model and implemented it in ls dyna to simulate concrete roadside structures subjected to vehicle collisions in addition to the validations by the developers murray et al 2007 the csc model has been confirmed in many other studies fan and yuan 2014 fan et al 2019 cao et al 2019 for modeling concrete subjected to low velocity impacts therefore the csc model is used herein to simulate concrete materials for ease of use the developer incorporated default material properties into the csc model as a function of concrete compressive strength murray 2007 murray et al 2007 these default material properties can be used to define the cover concrete in the rc columns however the impact simulations of rc columns liu et al 2017 indicated that the default material properties were not suitable for simulating the softening behavior of the confined concrete thus the adjustment method of the ductile damage parameters suggested by liu et al 2017 is made for the confined concrete in this study in addition guo et al 2018 extended the csc model to simulate uhpfrc based on the constitutive theory and the uhpfrc properties the previous study fan et al 2019 has performed the impact tests on rc uhpfrc and uhpfrc strengthened columns and developed and validated the corresponding fe modeling method it was found that the fe results were in good agreement with the experimental data indicating the rationality of the developed fe modeling method for axially loaded columns under impact loading fan et al 2019 hence the modeling method is used to model bridge columns in this study 2 3 barge fe model and verification the jumbo hopper barge which is defined as a typical vessel in aashto aashto 2009 is chosen as the impacting vessel in this study the barge bow width is 10 6 m with a head log height of 0 6 m and the entire barge is approximately 59 4 m in length according to the detailed drawings provided by consolazio et al 2014 a full scale high resolution barge model is established as shown in fig 4 shell elements with full integration are used to model the outer plates and internal structural members of the bow portion fig 4 c steel components such as plates angles and channels in the bow portion are welded together using the keyword constrained spotweld the elastoplastic material model i e material type 24 is employed to simulate the bow portion the rigid material model is defined in the hull portion to reduce computation time the cowper symonds equation is used to account for the strain rate effect of structural steel in the barge bow where the strain rate parameters c and p measured by getter et al 2015 are adopted consolazio et al 2014 presented a detailed evaluation of the barge fe model with a 0 4 scale model as illustrated in fig 5 to make the fe model in this study comparable with consolazio s model the full scale barge model is scaled down by 0 4 and the material parameters same as consolazio s model are used fig 5 shows the impact force time histories the impact force versus crush depth curves and the damage mode obtained from the developed barge model which are all in good agreement with the results provided in consolazio et al 2014 all these results confirm the applicability of the barge fe model it should be noted that the model used in this study is slightly different from consolazio s model considered in the above verification more specifically the experimentally measured stress versus strain curve of the a32 high strength steel recently used in china s vessels is used to define the barge steel in the full scale model for the sake of conservatism this is because the strength of the a32 steel is slightly higher than that given in getter et al 2015 due to the use of the measured data higher impact forces are achieved 3 fe simulation of barge bridge collision and simplification based on the aforementioned bridge and barge models detailed fe models fig 6 a are established by setting the contact automatic surface to surface like references cowan et al 2015 consolazio and davidson 2008 davidson 2007 yuan and harik 2010 wan et al 2019 sha and amdahl 2019 the initial impact velocity of the barge is applied through the keyword initial velocity generation the mass of the barge is considered as a variable to investigate its influence on the impact responses the total weights of the barge adopted in this study are assumed to include the hydrodynamic mass through the added mass coefficient e g 2 7 for head on collisions petersen 1982 motora 1960 modeling details including the application of gravity loads and the model simplification are discussed in the following to assure the effectiveness and efficiency of the barge bridge collision simulations 3 1 influence of permanent load many studies wang et al 2013 zeinoddini et al 2002 gholipour et al 2018 indicated that axial forces have a significant influence on the impact resistance of rc columns structural vibrations will be induced when the permanent loads e g self weight load is abruptly applied in the collision simulations as shown in fig 7 a thus it is critical to appropriately impose the gravity load in fe simulations of a barge to bridge collision based on the traditional damping based method an efficient method based on varying mass weighted damping with time was proposed by the authors fan et al 2018b to shorten the time for static equilibrium it has been demonstrated that the method can save over 50 time compared with the traditional approach hence the mass weighted damping method is employed in this study as shown in fig 7 a the axial force at the column base induced by the structural gravity quickly achieved the stable value which is consistent with the hand calculation result also it maintains a steady state when the mass weighted damping is released at 0 3 s using the detailed fe model fig 6 a barge collision simulations with and without the structural gravity are carried out to evaluate the influence of the initial permanent load on vessel impact resistance it is observed from fig 7 b that the displacement of the column without considering permanent loads is significantly higher than that with the gravity force the considerable increase in the impact resistance is attributed to the fact that the presence of the initial permanent loads not only induces the confinement effect and compressive arch action for the impacted columns but also improves the overturning resistance of the bridge superstructure to provide additional rotational constraints for the pier top all these results highlight the importance of properly accounting for the influence of initial permanent loads in vessel bridge collision simulations 3 2 simplification of the bridge fe model it is crucial to improve the computational efficiency of vessel to bridge collision analysis particularly for high resolution fe simulations based on nonlinear contact impact algorithms e g as shown in fig 6 a for this purpose consolazio et al consolazio and davidson 2008 davidson et al 2013 developed an equivalent one pier two span opts model to replace the detailed bridge model as illustrated in fig 6 b in the opts bridge model the impacted pier and its connected spans are retained while other portions are replaced by lumped mass and equivalent translational and rotational springs the stiffness of the equivalent springs can be determined from the static analysis of the eliminated right and left flanking structures consolazio and davidson 2008 davidson et al 2013 consolazio et al 2008 mass of the left and right flanking structures is lumped and placed at the corresponding ends of the opts model consolazio et al consolazio and davidson 2008 davidson et al 2013 consolazio et al 2008 suggested that the quantity of mass lumped at each end should be equal to the total weight of superstructure lying with the half span tributary length the detailed procedure to determine the lumped mass and springs can be found in consolazio and davidson 2008 although the rationality of the opts model has been demonstrated in the fiber based beam element analysis limited studies have been devoted to investigating its applicability in high resolution fe collision simulations in the current studies davidson et al 2013 consolazio and davidson 2008 the simplified force deformation relationship was used to represent the complicated barge bow in the fiber based beam analysis typically impact forces obtained from high resolution simulations are more complicated than those derived from the fiber based beam element analysis hence the need is evident to examine the accuracy of the opts modeling method in high resolution fe simulations the opts model and the full bridge model are adopted to simulate the same barge collision event i e 2000 ton barge with an initial impact speed of 3 0 m s in this study fig 8 presents the barge impact forces and impact induced responses of the bridge structure obtained from both models for the impact forces close agreements are achieved between the opts model and the full bridge model with regards to the maximum impact responses e g displacement the opts model provides acceptable accuracy however some differences can be observed for the impact responses derived from these two models particularly after the forced collision stage this is primarily attributed to the fact that the dynamic behaviors particularly high mode effects of the bridge girder cannot be well approximated by the lumped mass spring system at two ends as a result of the simplification the oscillation of the opts model is different from that of the bridge model with the entire girder an alternative simplified model is proposed in this study to overcome the limitations of the opts model as illustrated in fig 6 c the proposed simplified model retains all the girders and employes the equivalent springs and lumped mass to represent the non impacted piers as shown in fig 8 all the results obtained from the proposed simplified model are in good agreement with those using the full bridge model the proposed simplified model is more accurate than the opts model it is attributed to the fact that the proposed model can adequately capture the dynamic behavior of the bridge superstructure also the non impacted piers are driven by the vibration of the superstructure at pier tops so that they behave as single degree of freedom sdof systems in addition numerical studies are performed to investigate the influence of the equivalent mass of the non impacted pier it is found that the influence of the lumped mass is negligible because the lumped mass i e the weight of half piers is much less than the superstructure mass hence only the equivalent stiffness of the non impacted pier is taken into account for convenience overall both the opts model and the proposed simplified model can be used for bridge designs under vessel impact loading compared with the full bridge model the proposed method can improve the calculation accuracy but requires some additional spring and beam elements due to the complexity of bridge structures fe analysis is usually needed to determine the boundary parameters in both the opts model and the proposed model hence no significant modeling efforts are added in the proposed method because the modeling on the additional spans and bearings in the proposed model is also required in the opts method to determine the boundary parameters on the other hand because a limited number of beam elements and discrete elements are added the proposed model is almost as computationally efficient as the opts model 3 3 impact responses of rc column and discussions several collisions with different barge mass and impact velocities are simulated using the proposed simplified fe model to evaluate the barge impact resistant performance of the rc pier before the occurrence of a collision incident the gravity load has been imposed on the bridge structures two typical collision cases of 2000 ton barges with initial impact velocities of 2 m s and 4 m s are examined and compared to understand the response of the rc piers subjected to barge collisions fig 9 shows the damage distribution of the rc columns and the barge bow during the above two collision events it is observed that the rc columns subjected to different impact velocities exhibited similar flexure dominated damage and the damage is mainly located at the impact zone and the two ends of the rc columns fig 10 a and b present the impact forces and the displacements of the rc columns according to the impact force histories four different interaction phases between the impacting barge and the impacted columns can be clearly identified initial peak force phase plateau force phase unloading phase and free vibration phase similar to sha and hao 2015 the peak impact force occurs in the initial contact phase during this phase the contact stiffness is mainly associated with the internal trusses that actively participate in resisting bow crushing and the impact force increases rapidly before these trusses yield fig 9 b and c show the local buckling of the barge bows at the time corresponding to the peak impact forces for the two collision events the times that the peak impact forces occur are different the initial buckling of the barge bows remains the approximate crush depth fig 9 b and c hence different times are attributed to the different initial impact velocities in the two collision events also the peak impact force does not significantly increase with the initial kinetic energy of the barge as mentioned above the impact forces are primarily dependent upon the mechanical properties of the impacting barge the slight increase in the peak impact force is attributed to the strain rate effect and the mass related inertial effect after the internal members of the barge bow buckled there is an abrupt decrease in the contact stiffness of the barge as a result the impact force begins to decrease until the force plateau is achieved i e plateau force phase by combining with the energy conversions shown in fig 10 c and d it can be seen that the plateau force phase ends when the kinetic energy of the barge is completely dissipated most of the initial kinetic energy is dissipated in the plateau force phase with the increase of the impact energy the duration of the plateau force phase is significantly elongated and more severe damage to the barge is observed in the unloading phase the impacting barge tends to move backward until completely separates from the impacted bridge pier and the bridge structure freely vibrates thereafter in addition to the interaction analysis fig 10 c and d indicate that the majority of the kinetic energy is transferred into the internal energy of the barge bow and only a small amount less than 20 of the initial kinetic energy is transferred into the impacted bridge structure with respect to the impact induced displacements of the bridge piers at the impact zone as shown in fig 10 b they do not increase with the initial kinetic energy of impacting barges unexpectedly the slightly larger displacements are predicted for the impact with lower energy input a similar phenomenon was also observed by sha and hao 2012 it was speculated that the barge bow buckled dramatically at the beginning of the contact and the bow s deformation absorbed a large amount of energy however such speculation cannot completely explain the phenomenon first fig 10 a and b show that the maximum displacement occurs in the plateau force phase rather than the initial contact phase second based on the energy results given in fig 10 c and d the impacted structure under the high energy collision 2 23 mj absorbs much more energy than that 0 70 mj of the low energy collision accordingly further explanations are still required for these counterintuitive results fan et al 2016b pointed out that the shock spectrum approximation is very critical to the development of dynamic vessel impact loads on bridge structures this implies that the frequency characteristics of impact forces and the dynamic characteristics of the impacted structure significantly influence the impact induced response therefore the shock spectra corresponding to the impact loads in fig 10 a are generated to address the unexpected results as shown in fig 10 b by solving the following dynamic equation 1 u s 2 ζ n ω n u s ω n 2 u f t m s where u s u s and u s are the displacement velocity and acceleration of the impacted structure respectively f t is the impact force time history shown in fig 10 a ζ n is the damping ratio ζ n 0 05 according to fan et al 2016b m s is the mass of the impacted structure ω n is the natural circular frequency of vibration the central difference method is employed to solve the above dynamic equation for convenience the structural stiffness is assumed to be constant i e k s 1 109 n m and the natural period of vibration is gradually changed by changing the mass fig 11 presents the shock spectra for various collision events where the horizontal axis is the natural period of vibration and the vertical axis is the peak displacement in addition to the shock spectra the modal analysis of the impacted bridge structure is performed for the lateral direction of the impacted pier the first three natural periods of vibration are 1 48 s 0 902 s and 0 836 s respectively typically the dynamic responses are dominated by these lower modes hence these modes are marked out in the shock spectra as shown in fig 11 the spectral displacements of the low energy collision event are higher than those of the high energy collision event which can explain the unexpected impact induced behaviors provided in fig 10 b indeed the shock spectrum analysis is based on an elastic system which is different from the inelastic system in the detailed fe simulations however chopra and goel 2002 pointed out that the primary natural vibration mode can still be dominant for inelastic systems in the development of the modal pushover analysis method accordingly the barge shock spectrum provides a reasonable way to understand the counterintuitive results shown in fig 10 b the simplified impact loads determined by the equations provided in getter and consolazio 2011 are compared with the fe results fig 10 a as mentioned earlier some differences can be observed between the simplified impact loads and the numerically obtained forces as a result the impact induced displacements obtained from the high resolution simulations are different from those using the simplified loads as shown in figs 10 b and 11 b in addition to the above typical cases a parametric study is performed to investigate the influence of barge mass and velocity on the impact force and impact induced response the corresponding results are presented in fig 12 the above observations are further supported by these results since bridge columns must support axial loads during the period of service it is of importance to evaluate the residual axial strength after the lateral vessel impact thus the residual axial strengths of bridge columns after impacts are quantitatively evaluated through fe simulations the damage evaluation based on residual strengths can overcome the limitations of the deformation based evaluation method that is not suitable for comparing damage extents of bridge columns with varying failure modes e g flexural and shear failures for this reason the damage index based on the axial strengths is used in this study to evaluate the performance of bridge columns which can be written as shi et al 2008 2 d 1 p r e s i p m where p r e s i is the residual axial load carrying capacity of the impact damaged column p m is the ultimate axial capacity of the undamaged column according to the relationship between the damage level and the damage index the columns are categorized into a moderate damage level for d 0 2 0 5 and a severe damage level for d 0 5 0 8 shi et al 2008 the damage levels of the bridge columns under various collision scenarios are shown in fig 12 d generally the damage degree of the piers increases with the increase of barge mass when the initial impact velocity of the barge exceeds 2 m s all columns are considered to be severely damaged 4 dynamical response evaluation of uhpfrc strengthened columns under barge impact to improve the barge impact resistance of bridge columns several different kinds of uhpfrc strengthened columns are investigated in this section a proper strengthening method using uhpfrc is also presented 4 1 uhpfrc strengthened columns the drop hammer impact tests were conducted in the previous study fan et al 2019 to examine the impact resistant performance of uhpfrc and uhpfrc strengthened columns the test specimens had small reduced size and the use of the experimental data for full scale bridge columns under vessel impacts have not yet been confirmed based on the modeling method developed above numerical simulations are performed in this study to investigate the performance of different uhpfrc based strengthening methods in bridge columns subjected to barge impacts according to the position and length of the uhpfrc jackets three strengthened columns i e column i column e and column w are considered as shown in fig 3 c the symbols l and t are used to denote the length and thickness of the uhpfrc jacket respectively l 4 8 m and t 0 25 m are assumed in this section the uhpfrc columns indicated by column u are also considered for comparison without loss of generality the collision scenario 2000 ton barge with an impact velocity of 3 m s corresponding to the median level shown in fig 12 is used in the following section to evaluate the performance of uhpfrc strengthened columns 4 2 comparisons of uhpfrc strengthening methods and discussions figs 13 and 14 present the damage distributions and dynamic responses of different types of bridge columns subjected to the same barge collision scenarios by comparing with the conventional rc columns i e column n it can be found that the local damage around the impact zone is considerably reduced when the uhpfrc jacket i e column i is placed at the impact zone this means that the designed uhpfrc jacket can provide enough capacity to carry the local impact load due to the high strength and ductility of the uhpfrc material however the reduced damage at the column ends is relatively small when the uhpfrc jacket is used at the contact impact zone on the contrary using a two end uhpfrc jacket i e column e dramatically decreases the damage at the column ends these two strengthening schemes can also effectively reduce the impact induced displacements of the impacted columns as shown in fig 14 specifically the displacement dropped by 33 7 of column e at the impact point is slightly smaller than that decreased by 31 6 of column i in comparison with the partially strengthening methods i e column i and column e the presence of the whole length uhpfrc jackets throughout the columns can further improve the impact resistance and the residual strengths however the volumes of the uhpfrc material used in column w and column u are about four and eight times more than that of column i or column e respectively therefore the use of the whole length uhpfrc jackets for the columns will dramatically increase the cost because the uhpfrc material is much more expensive than normal concrete the whole length uhpfrc jackets column w are only recommended when there are no economic constraints for some critical bridge structures otherwise the partially strengthening schemes like column i and column e are more suited for general applications for the waterway that a bridge locates water levels usually change with time as a result the barge impact position is uncertain in engineering practice for this reason further comparisons should be conducted for the impact resistant performance of column i and column e considering the uncertainty of impact position due to the water level change three meter shifts positive and negative of the water level is considered herein to investigate the influence on the barge impact resistant performance as illustrated in figs 13 and 14 0 represents the mean water level 3 and 3 denote the lowest and the highest water levels respectively the damage distributions along the column are shown in fig 13 b and c for the lowest and highest water levels respectively compared with column e the damage of column i is more affected by the changes in water levels similarly the residual axial strengths of column i are smaller than those of column e when the water level increases or decreases by 3 m in practice it is challenging to predetermine the impact position due to the varied water level column i and column e have equal volumes of uhpfrc therefore it can be concluded that the impact resistant performances of the columns with two end uhpfrc jackets are superior to the columns with a uhpfrc jacket at the contact impact zone the former scheme exhibits more potential to be used in reality and its optimization design is worth exploring in the following section 5 sensitivity analysis and multi objective optimization multi objective optimizations are conducted to seek the optimal design of the potential strengthening solution in this section the surrogate models are presented and validated the sensitivity of primary design parameters including the length l and thickness t of the uhpfrc jacket and the longitudinal ρ l and transverse ρ s reinforcement ratios are discussed subsequently the multi objective optimization design problem is defined finally the optimization results of the two end uhpfrc strengthening schemes are provided and verified 5 1 problem definition for the optimization of the uhpfrc based strengthening solution the objectives are to maximize the impact resistant performance and minimize economic input i e cost as discussed above the residual strengths denoted by r s is used as an indicator to reflect the barge impact resistant performance of the strengthened column the column cost denoted by c s is defined as the economic indicator according to the market prices in china the general expenses of uhpfrc normal concrete and reinforcing steel bar are about 1 104 rmb m3 500 rmb m3 and 3500 rmb ton respectively it is apparent that these two objectives are conflicting the primary task of a two objective optimization is to search a cloud of best trade off solution called pareto optimal front in the design space then design decisions can be made based on the obtained trade off solutions and the subjective preferences of the designer or owner of a bridge structure the multi objective optimization problem of the suggested strengthening scheme under barge impacts can be defined as follows 3 max r s l t ρ l ρ t min c s l t ρ l ρ t subjected to 2 m l 5 m 0 1 m t 0 4 m 0 89 ρ l 1 78 0 24 ρ s 1 08 5 2 response surface models and sensitivity analysis it is unrealistic to directly apply detailed fe simulations in the multi objective optimization of the uhpfrc strengthening method because of the high demand in computational resources and time for this reason surrogate models are developed to reduce the number of fe simulations response surface method rsm has been extensively employed in the multi objective optimization to generate the surrogate models which can be expressed as 4 y x j n a j ϕ j x where y x is the required variable which is the residual strength r s and the cost c s of the column in this study ϕ j x is the basis functions e g the polynomials n is the number of functions a j is the coefficient of the basis function which can be determined from the least square method and the m sampling points estimated by fe simulations m n it is essential to examine the accuracy of the developed surrogate model before applying to the multi objective optimization the maximum relative error i m r e the average relative error i a r e and the coefficient of multiple determination r 2 are used to evaluate the applicability of the developed response surface model which can be written respectively as 5 i m r e m a x y i y i y i 100 6 i a r e y i y i y i 100 n 7 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i is the value predicted by the response surface model y i is the target value which is determined from fe simulations in this study n is the sampling number for verifications the box behnken design bbd widely used in the previous studies fan et al 2020 is employed to generate the sampling points for the fe simulations table 2 shows three levels of all varying parameters for the box behnken design as shown in table 3 a total of 29 sampling points are generated and simulated by the simplified fe models based on the fe results of the sampling points the response surface models of r s and c s are determined as follows 8 r s 0 609 6 376 l 37 245 t 27 635 ρ l 29 857 ρ s l t 2 360 10 15 l ρ l 0 6 l ρ s 8 84 t ρ l 11 595 t ρ s 1

ρ s 0 024 l 2 38 94 t 2 0 23 ρ l 2 0 36 ρ s 2 fig 15 plots the comparisons of r s and c s obtained from the developed response surface models eq 8 and 9 and the detailed fe simulations along with the expected trend lines i e y x good agreements are observed between the fe results and those predicted by eqs 8 and 9 for both r s and c s the i m r e and i a r e values are small and the results of r 2 are very close to 1 0 the results confirm the applicability of the developed response surface models to the sensitivity analysis of the multi objective optimization the 3d plots of the residual axial strengths with respect to pairs of design parameters are presented in fig 16 it is observed that the residual axial strengths increase with increasing longitudinal and transverse reinforcement ratios it is attributed to the fact that the increase of the longitudinal reinforcement ratio increases the bending moment resistance and the increase of transverse reinforcement ratio is beneficial for improving the residual capacity the residual strength is not very sensitive to the length and thickness of the two end uhpfrc jackets when these parameters change in a certain range however whether the uhpfrc jackets used or not have a noticeable influence on the impact resistant performance of the impacted column as observed in fig 16 compared with increasing the length of the uhpfrc jacket increasing the thickness of the jacket is more beneficial for improving the residual capacity it is because the increase of the jacket thickness can improve the resistance of the column to significant bending moments at the ends fig 17 shows the relationship between the cost and different pairs of design parameters it can be seen that the column cost is more sensitive to the increase in the length and the thickness of the uhpfrc jacket it is because the price of uhpfrc is much higher than the regular concrete these results imply that increasing the reinforcement ratios is a better option for a new bridge in comparison with increasing the length and thickness of uhpfrc jackets however it is worth mentioning that the method of increasing the reinforcement ratios is usually only applicable to new bridges and may lead to congested reinforcing details and some difficulties in structural construction zhang et al 2016 on the contrary the method using the uhpfrc jackets is not only suitable for both new and existing bridges but also avoid congested reinforcing details 5 3 multi objective optimization design of bridge pier considering barge collision the verified surrogate models instead of the fe simulations are employed to estimate the values of r s and c s with different design parameters in the multi objective optimization to obtain the pareto optimal solutions a number of the multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas have been proposed in the previous studies vo duy et al 2020 deb et al 2002 among the existing moeas the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm named nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2002 has been widely used in design optimization of various problems e g fan et al 2020 vo duy et al 2020 it is an extended and improved version of nsga srinivas and deb 1994 evolved from the well known genetic algorithm and nondominated sorting concept by goldenberg 1989 in addition to genetic operators crossover and mutation two specialized multi objective operators and mechanisms are defined and utilized in nsga ii thus nsga ii is employed in this study to search for the pareto front of the multi objective optimization defined in eq 3 after iterating for 200 generations the pareto front of the optimization problems for barge collisions is obtained as shown in fig 18 the two objectives are found to conflict with each other in other words increasing r s resulted in the undesirable growth of c s based on the derived pareto set using relatively high reinforcement ratios is recommended to design a new bridge while thicker uhpfrc jackets are suggested for improving an existing bridge four typical optimization results are presented in table 4 additional fe simulations corresponding to these optimal design parameters are performed to evaluate the optimized results as shown in table 4 the optimal results are in good agreement with the corresponding fe results which confirm the feasibility of the multi objective optimization design method for the partially strengthened columns with uhpfrc jackets for barge impact in practical applications of the multi objective optimization design any constraint can be imposed on the pareto front to conduct the desired design for example the constraint on the reinforcement ratios can be added to the optimization design of an existing bridge 6 conclusions an fe modeling method for bridge structures under barge impact is developed in this paper based on the verified numerical models the barge impact induced responses of the bridge columns are thoroughly examined and interpreted also the uhpfrc based strengthening methods are proposed and extensively investigated for improving the barge impact resistance of rc columns based on the detailed fe studies the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the influence of the initial permanent load structural gravity on the performance of the pier under barge collision is investigated the results indicate that the gravity of the superstructure improves the resistance of the pier under barge collision this is attributed to the fact that the presence of the initial permanent load not only induces the confinement effect and compressive arch action for the impacted column but also improve the overturning resistance of the bridge superstructure by providing additional rotational restraints to the pier top 2 a simplified bridge model retaining the whole girder is proposed and compared with the entire bridge model and the opts model both the opts model and the proposed simplified model exhibit acceptable accuracy in the estimation of barge impact induced responses as compensation for a small increase in the boundary definition and the number of the beam or discrete elements the oscillation behavior of the superstructure is better captured by the proposed model and its accuracy is improved 3 several barge bridge collision scenarios are simulated to investigate the process of the collision and the behavior of the impacted columns it is found that the peak impact force increases with the initial kinetic energy however the impact induced responses e g displacement of the impacted columns do not always increase it is because the spectral characteristics of the impact force time history have a significant influence on the impact induced responses 4 three different strengthening methods based on ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc are investigated for barge impact consideration is also given to the change of the water level results show that the strengthened column with two end uhpfrc jackets is more promising than the other considered methods in terms of efficiency and costs 5 a multi objective optimization design procedure is developed for the uhpfrc strengthened columns under barge collision the problem is defined to increase the residual axial load capacity and reduce the costs the developed response surface models are demonstrated to be capable of accurately predicting the performance indictors under various design parameters the pareto front is obtained using nsga ii and some typical optimum results are examined and confirmed through detailed

21541,although some studies have been conducted to simulate the dynamic response of bridge piers under barge impact several essential modeling issues e g reasonably exerting permanent loads and simplifying fe models are not well examined hence high resolution fe models are meticulously developed in this paper to simulate barge collisions with a typical four span continuous girder bridge numerical results highlight the importance of the gravity load for barge impact induced responses a simplified bridge model is proposed to improve computational efficiency the proposed simplified method is found to be more accurate than that of the one pier two span opts model also it is observed that although the peak impact force increases with impact energy the impact induced displacement does not always increase it is attributed to the fact that the spectral characteristics of the impact force time history have a significant influence on the impact induced responses to improve the impact resistance three strengthening methods based on ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc are investigated and compared it is found that strengthening columns with two end uhpfrc jackets is superior to other strengthening methods when considering cost benefit ratio finally a multi objective optimization design procedure is presented for the uhpfrc strengthened columns keywords barge impact bridge structures reinforced concrete rc column fe modeling dynamic behavior uhpfrc based strengthening 1 introduction a growing number of catastrophic accidents on vessel collisions with bridges have been reported recently around the world aashto 2009 yuan and harik 2010 kantrales et al 2015 fan et al 2018a sha and hao 2013a consolazio et al 2014 fig 1 shows some collapses of bridge structures caused by vessel collisions just in 2019 vessel collisions led to substantial damage to over ten bridge structures including the collapse of the bridge spanning the moju river in brazil and severe damage of the i 10 bridge over the san jacinto river in the united states the majority of these accidents were caused by aberrant barges which are widely used throughout inland and coastal regions kantrales et al 2019 all these accidents imply that bridge structures spanning navigable waterways must be carefully designed to minimize their susceptibility to damage from vessel collisions aashto 2009 ministry of communications of china 2015 bridge design specifications aashto 2009 ministry of communications of china 2015 aashto aashtolrfd bridge design specifications and u s 2016 usually use an equivalent static analysis procedure to design bridge structures to resist vessel impacts due to its simplicity for engineering practice however it was demonstrated that the impact induced response of a bridge would be significantly underestimated by the code prescribed static analysis method since it neglects dynamic amplification effects to overcome the limitations of the static analysis procedure some alternative analysis methods e g coupled vessel impact analysis cvia consolazio and cowan 2005 and shock spectrum analysis ssa cowan et al 2015 fan et al 2016a were recently proposed most of these methods employed an equivalent elastic perfectly plastic force deformation relationship to approximate the behavior of barge bow and fiber based beam elements to model bridge piers davidson et al 2013 these treatments can significantly improve computational efficiency but also result in some drawbacks for example local and shear damage of the impacted bridge column cannot be captured due to the use of the fiber based beam elements in addition when an elastic perfectly plastic force deformation relationship is used to represent the behavior of a barge bow the impact load forms i e sine function and trapezoid form are different from those obtained from the high resolution fe simulations typically an initial peak impact force can be observed in the detailed fe simulation sha and hao 2013a these differences in the impact loads would lead to different impact induced responses of bridge structures hence although several simplified methods are currently available the high resolution fe simulations based on general contact impact nonlinear fe codes are still irreplaceable in some cases the majority of the high resolution fe simulations were only used to determine vessel impact loads rather than structural behaviors in the current studies compared with vehicle collisions with bridges limited studies employed detailed fe simulations to investigate the nonlinear dynamic performance of bridge structures under vessel collisions sha and hao 2012 2013a 2013b adopted the nonlinear fe analysis technique to simulate barge collisions with a single reinforced concrete pier and a continuous girder bridge jiang et al 2017 numerically investigated the progressive collapse of a continuous girder bridge under collisions using a high resolution fe model gholipour et al 2020 developed detailed fe models to simulate a cable stayed bridge pier under ship collisions although these studies have been devoted to modeling bridge structures under vessel collisions several essential modeling issues e g reasonably exerting gravity loads and appropriately simplifying fe models were not clarified therefore it is necessary to address these modeling issues by developing a new fe analysis method for vessel bridge collosions on the other hand all accidents shown in fig 1 were initiated from damage of off channel piers with low crashworthiness that were struck by errant vessels this highlights the importance of off channel piers to resist vessel collisions for a bridge crossing waterways as shown in fig 1 there are many off channel piers that are exposed to vessel collisions if independent protective structures e g fenders fan et al 2018a pile supported structures fan and yuan 2014 are used to protect the off channel piers it is not only uneconomical but may also lead to scouring issues induced by the increase of the water blocking area due to the presence of the protective structures hence some strengthening methods using steel or fiber reinforced plastics frp jackets wang et al 2013 sha and hao 2015 have been studied for improving the impact resistance of bridge piers as pointed out by aashto aashto 2009 however the use of steel materials for protections has some disadvantages such as low durability against corrosion similarly frp jackets are also vulnerable to degradation particularly for adhesive epoxy resin and damage due to the impact of small floating objects fan et al 2018b ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc is defined as an advanced engineering material with a compressive strength no less than 150 mpa and a tensile strength no less than 8 mpa russell and graybeal 2013 habel et al 2006 yoo and banthia 2016 in addition to the high strength uhpfrc materials exhibit superior long term durability and excellent energy absorption capacity russell and graybeal 2013 habel et al 2006 yoo and banthia 2016 uhpfrc exhibits an outstanding performance for structural members subjected to impact and shock loadings fan et al 2018b 2019 fan et al 2020 yoo and banthia 2017 guo et al 2018 because of the excellent material properties the potential of uhpfrc is worth exploring in bridge protections against vessel collisions particularly for the off channel piers with low resistances in this context this study aims to develop the fe modeling method of bridge structures under barge collision scenarios and to evaluate the barge impact resistant performance of uhpfrc strengthened columns using the developed analysis method some essential modeling issues e g the influence of gravity loads are examined to improve computational efficiency a new simplified bridge model is proposed and compared with the one pier two span opts model reported in the previous studies based on the proposed model different collision scenarios are considered to explore the barge impact resistance of rc piers the barge impact induced responses of a bridge structure are discussed based on structural dynamics to improve the impact resistance of rc columns three different strengthening methods with uhpfrc jackets are investigated and compared a detailed parametric study is conducted for the recommended solution with two end uhpfrc jackets to examine the influences of reinforcement ratios length and thickness of uhpfrc jackets in addition a multi objective optimization design procedure is developed to find the optimal configuration of the strengthened rc columns for barge impact 2 bridge and barge fe models and verifications 2 1 bridge fe model and parameters refer to the jiujiang bridge shown in fig 1 c a four span continuous girder bridge is selected in this paper each span length is 50 m and the total span length is 200 m for the bridge fig 2 a each bridge pier consists of two columns a cap beam and a footing fig 2 b each bridge column has a circular cross section with 2 m in diameter and 18 m in height the two cell box girder widely used in china is designed as the bridge superstructure and its dimensions are shown in fig 2 c according to china s bridge design code ministry of communications of china 2015 the typical reinforcement ratios longitudinal ratio 0 99 and transverse ratio 0 24 are employed in all bridge columns the normal concrete with a strength grade of c40 mpa in china is used for all columns fig 3 shows the high resolution fe model of the continuous girder bridge all bridge column bents are modeled using eight node solid elements with single point integration it is worth mentioning that the non impacted piers can also be simulated by beam elements as a result of this treatment computational efficiency can be improved but the connections e g the connection between the pier column and the cap beam should be carefully modeled to decrease the approximation error the bridge girders and piles are simulated using beam elements to reduce computation time as observed in the past collision accidents the impacted bridge columns are more severely damaged than other structural components e g cap beams and footing hence similar to the vehicle collision analysis do et al 2018 xu 2017 liu 2012 the elastic material model in ls dyna keyword 2014 is utilized to simulate these components for simplification discrete elements combining with material type 67 are used to simulate different bearings i e fix supports one way movable support and two way movable support between the substructure and superstructure the influence of soil pile interaction can be approximately modeled by using the m method i e linear elastic spring method provided in china s bridge design code ministry of transport of china 2007 when the geological conditions e g stiff soil or rock are good for simplification the bridge structure is assumed to be built upon a stiff rock in this study hence two orthogonal linear elastic springs at each node on the piles are employed to account for the influence of soil pile interactions where the spring stiffnesses are determined in accordance with china s bridge design code ministry of transport of china 2007 the nonlinear spring elements should be used when the nonlinear interaction between the pile and the surrounding soil is not negligible consolazio et al 2003 the concrete and reinforcement materials of the bridge columns are simulated using nonlinear material models to capture the impact induced damage and response like the previous studies fan and yuan 2014 fan et al 2015 2018b the material model mat plastic kinematic with strain rate effects is chosen to model the longitudinal and transverse reinforcement the detailed properties of all the materials are summarized in table 1 2 2 nonlinear concrete models and validations murray et al murray 2007 murray et al 2007 developed the continuous surface cap csc model and implemented it in ls dyna to simulate concrete roadside structures subjected to vehicle collisions in addition to the validations by the developers murray et al 2007 the csc model has been confirmed in many other studies fan and yuan 2014 fan et al 2019 cao et al 2019 for modeling concrete subjected to low velocity impacts therefore the csc model is used herein to simulate concrete materials for ease of use the developer incorporated default material properties into the csc model as a function of concrete compressive strength murray 2007 murray et al 2007 these default material properties can be used to define the cover concrete in the rc columns however the impact simulations of rc columns liu et al 2017 indicated that the default material properties were not suitable for simulating the softening behavior of the confined concrete thus the adjustment method of the ductile damage parameters suggested by liu et al 2017 is made for the confined concrete in this study in addition guo et al 2018 extended the csc model to simulate uhpfrc based on the constitutive theory and the uhpfrc properties the previous study fan et al 2019 has performed the impact tests on rc uhpfrc and uhpfrc strengthened columns and developed and validated the corresponding fe modeling method it was found that the fe results were in good agreement with the experimental data indicating the rationality of the developed fe modeling method for axially loaded columns under impact loading fan et al 2019 hence the modeling method is used to model bridge columns in this study 2 3 barge fe model and verification the jumbo hopper barge which is defined as a typical vessel in aashto aashto 2009 is chosen as the impacting vessel in this study the barge bow width is 10 6 m with a head log height of 0 6 m and the entire barge is approximately 59 4 m in length according to the detailed drawings provided by consolazio et al 2014 a full scale high resolution barge model is established as shown in fig 4 shell elements with full integration are used to model the outer plates and internal structural members of the bow portion fig 4 c steel components such as plates angles and channels in the bow portion are welded together using the keyword constrained spotweld the elastoplastic material model i e material type 24 is employed to simulate the bow portion the rigid material model is defined in the hull portion to reduce computation time the cowper symonds equation is used to account for the strain rate effect of structural steel in the barge bow where the strain rate parameters c and p measured by getter et al 2015 are adopted consolazio et al 2014 presented a detailed evaluation of the barge fe model with a 0 4 scale model as illustrated in fig 5 to make the fe model in this study comparable with consolazio s model the full scale barge model is scaled down by 0 4 and the material parameters same as consolazio s model are used fig 5 shows the impact force time histories the impact force versus crush depth curves and the damage mode obtained from the developed barge model which are all in good agreement with the results provided in consolazio et al 2014 all these results confirm the applicability of the barge fe model it should be noted that the model used in this study is slightly different from consolazio s model considered in the above verification more specifically the experimentally measured stress versus strain curve of the a32 high strength steel recently used in china s vessels is used to define the barge steel in the full scale model for the sake of conservatism this is because the strength of the a32 steel is slightly higher than that given in getter et al 2015 due to the use of the measured data higher impact forces are achieved 3 fe simulation of barge bridge collision and simplification based on the aforementioned bridge and barge models detailed fe models fig 6 a are established by setting the contact automatic surface to surface like references cowan et al 2015 consolazio and davidson 2008 davidson 2007 yuan and harik 2010 wan et al 2019 sha and amdahl 2019 the initial impact velocity of the barge is applied through the keyword initial velocity generation the mass of the barge is considered as a variable to investigate its influence on the impact responses the total weights of the barge adopted in this study are assumed to include the hydrodynamic mass through the added mass coefficient e g 2 7 for head on collisions petersen 1982 motora 1960 modeling details including the application of gravity loads and the model simplification are discussed in the following to assure the effectiveness and efficiency of the barge bridge collision simulations 3 1 influence of permanent load many studies wang et al 2013 zeinoddini et al 2002 gholipour et al 2018 indicated that axial forces have a significant influence on the impact resistance of rc columns structural vibrations will be induced when the permanent loads e g self weight load is abruptly applied in the collision simulations as shown in fig 7 a thus it is critical to appropriately impose the gravity load in fe simulations of a barge to bridge collision based on the traditional damping based method an efficient method based on varying mass weighted damping with time was proposed by the authors fan et al 2018b to shorten the time for static equilibrium it has been demonstrated that the method can save over 50 time compared with the traditional approach hence the mass weighted damping method is employed in this study as shown in fig 7 a the axial force at the column base induced by the structural gravity quickly achieved the stable value which is consistent with the hand calculation result also it maintains a steady state when the mass weighted damping is released at 0 3 s using the detailed fe model fig 6 a barge collision simulations with and without the structural gravity are carried out to evaluate the influence of the initial permanent load on vessel impact resistance it is observed from fig 7 b that the displacement of the column without considering permanent loads is significantly higher than that with the gravity force the considerable increase in the impact resistance is attributed to the fact that the presence of the initial permanent loads not only induces the confinement effect and compressive arch action for the impacted columns but also improves the overturning resistance of the bridge superstructure to provide additional rotational constraints for the pier top all these results highlight the importance of properly accounting for the influence of initial permanent loads in vessel bridge collision simulations 3 2 simplification of the bridge fe model it is crucial to improve the computational efficiency of vessel to bridge collision analysis particularly for high resolution fe simulations based on nonlinear contact impact algorithms e g as shown in fig 6 a for this purpose consolazio et al consolazio and davidson 2008 davidson et al 2013 developed an equivalent one pier two span opts model to replace the detailed bridge model as illustrated in fig 6 b in the opts bridge model the impacted pier and its connected spans are retained while other portions are replaced by lumped mass and equivalent translational and rotational springs the stiffness of the equivalent springs can be determined from the static analysis of the eliminated right and left flanking structures consolazio and davidson 2008 davidson et al 2013 consolazio et al 2008 mass of the left and right flanking structures is lumped and placed at the corresponding ends of the opts model consolazio et al consolazio and davidson 2008 davidson et al 2013 consolazio et al 2008 suggested that the quantity of mass lumped at each end should be equal to the total weight of superstructure lying with the half span tributary length the detailed procedure to determine the lumped mass and springs can be found in consolazio and davidson 2008 although the rationality of the opts model has been demonstrated in the fiber based beam element analysis limited studies have been devoted to investigating its applicability in high resolution fe collision simulations in the current studies davidson et al 2013 consolazio and davidson 2008 the simplified force deformation relationship was used to represent the complicated barge bow in the fiber based beam analysis typically impact forces obtained from high resolution simulations are more complicated than those derived from the fiber based beam element analysis hence the need is evident to examine the accuracy of the opts modeling method in high resolution fe simulations the opts model and the full bridge model are adopted to simulate the same barge collision event i e 2000 ton barge with an initial impact speed of 3 0 m s in this study fig 8 presents the barge impact forces and impact induced responses of the bridge structure obtained from both models for the impact forces close agreements are achieved between the opts model and the full bridge model with regards to the maximum impact responses e g displacement the opts model provides acceptable accuracy however some differences can be observed for the impact responses derived from these two models particularly after the forced collision stage this is primarily attributed to the fact that the dynamic behaviors particularly high mode effects of the bridge girder cannot be well approximated by the lumped mass spring system at two ends as a result of the simplification the oscillation of the opts model is different from that of the bridge model with the entire girder an alternative simplified model is proposed in this study to overcome the limitations of the opts model as illustrated in fig 6 c the proposed simplified model retains all the girders and employes the equivalent springs and lumped mass to represent the non impacted piers as shown in fig 8 all the results obtained from the proposed simplified model are in good agreement with those using the full bridge model the proposed simplified model is more accurate than the opts model it is attributed to the fact that the proposed model can adequately capture the dynamic behavior of the bridge superstructure also the non impacted piers are driven by the vibration of the superstructure at pier tops so that they behave as single degree of freedom sdof systems in addition numerical studies are performed to investigate the influence of the equivalent mass of the non impacted pier it is found that the influence of the lumped mass is negligible because the lumped mass i e the weight of half piers is much less than the superstructure mass hence only the equivalent stiffness of the non impacted pier is taken into account for convenience overall both the opts model and the proposed simplified model can be used for bridge designs under vessel impact loading compared with the full bridge model the proposed method can improve the calculation accuracy but requires some additional spring and beam elements due to the complexity of bridge structures fe analysis is usually needed to determine the boundary parameters in both the opts model and the proposed model hence no significant modeling efforts are added in the proposed method because the modeling on the additional spans and bearings in the proposed model is also required in the opts method to determine the boundary parameters on the other hand because a limited number of beam elements and discrete elements are added the proposed model is almost as computationally efficient as the opts model 3 3 impact responses of rc column and discussions several collisions with different barge mass and impact velocities are simulated using the proposed simplified fe model to evaluate the barge impact resistant performance of the rc pier before the occurrence of a collision incident the gravity load has been imposed on the bridge structures two typical collision cases of 2000 ton barges with initial impact velocities of 2 m s and 4 m s are examined and compared to understand the response of the rc piers subjected to barge collisions fig 9 shows the damage distribution of the rc columns and the barge bow during the above two collision events it is observed that the rc columns subjected to different impact velocities exhibited similar flexure dominated damage and the damage is mainly located at the impact zone and the two ends of the rc columns fig 10 a and b present the impact forces and the displacements of the rc columns according to the impact force histories four different interaction phases between the impacting barge and the impacted columns can be clearly identified initial peak force phase plateau force phase unloading phase and free vibration phase similar to sha and hao 2015 the peak impact force occurs in the initial contact phase during this phase the contact stiffness is mainly associated with the internal trusses that actively participate in resisting bow crushing and the impact force increases rapidly before these trusses yield fig 9 b and c show the local buckling of the barge bows at the time corresponding to the peak impact forces for the two collision events the times that the peak impact forces occur are different the initial buckling of the barge bows remains the approximate crush depth fig 9 b and c hence different times are attributed to the different initial impact velocities in the two collision events also the peak impact force does not significantly increase with the initial kinetic energy of the barge as mentioned above the impact forces are primarily dependent upon the mechanical properties of the impacting barge the slight increase in the peak impact force is attributed to the strain rate effect and the mass related inertial effect after the internal members of the barge bow buckled there is an abrupt decrease in the contact stiffness of the barge as a result the impact force begins to decrease until the force plateau is achieved i e plateau force phase by combining with the energy conversions shown in fig 10 c and d it can be seen that the plateau force phase ends when the kinetic energy of the barge is completely dissipated most of the initial kinetic energy is dissipated in the plateau force phase with the increase of the impact energy the duration of the plateau force phase is significantly elongated and more severe damage to the barge is observed in the unloading phase the impacting barge tends to move backward until completely separates from the impacted bridge pier and the bridge structure freely vibrates thereafter in addition to the interaction analysis fig 10 c and d indicate that the majority of the kinetic energy is transferred into the internal energy of the barge bow and only a small amount less than 20 of the initial kinetic energy is transferred into the impacted bridge structure with respect to the impact induced displacements of the bridge piers at the impact zone as shown in fig 10 b they do not increase with the initial kinetic energy of impacting barges unexpectedly the slightly larger displacements are predicted for the impact with lower energy input a similar phenomenon was also observed by sha and hao 2012 it was speculated that the barge bow buckled dramatically at the beginning of the contact and the bow s deformation absorbed a large amount of energy however such speculation cannot completely explain the phenomenon first fig 10 a and b show that the maximum displacement occurs in the plateau force phase rather than the initial contact phase second based on the energy results given in fig 10 c and d the impacted structure under the high energy collision 2 23 mj absorbs much more energy than that 0 70 mj of the low energy collision accordingly further explanations are still required for these counterintuitive results fan et al 2016b pointed out that the shock spectrum approximation is very critical to the development of dynamic vessel impact loads on bridge structures this implies that the frequency characteristics of impact forces and the dynamic characteristics of the impacted structure significantly influence the impact induced response therefore the shock spectra corresponding to the impact loads in fig 10 a are generated to address the unexpected results as shown in fig 10 b by solving the following dynamic equation 1 u s 2 ζ n ω n u s ω n 2 u f t m s where u s u s and u s are the displacement velocity and acceleration of the impacted structure respectively f t is the impact force time history shown in fig 10 a ζ n is the damping ratio ζ n 0 05 according to fan et al 2016b m s is the mass of the impacted structure ω n is the natural circular frequency of vibration the central difference method is employed to solve the above dynamic equation for convenience the structural stiffness is assumed to be constant i e k s 1 109 n m and the natural period of vibration is gradually changed by changing the mass fig 11 presents the shock spectra for various collision events where the horizontal axis is the natural period of vibration and the vertical axis is the peak displacement in addition to the shock spectra the modal analysis of the impacted bridge structure is performed for the lateral direction of the impacted pier the first three natural periods of vibration are 1 48 s 0 902 s and 0 836 s respectively typically the dynamic responses are dominated by these lower modes hence these modes are marked out in the shock spectra as shown in fig 11 the spectral displacements of the low energy collision event are higher than those of the high energy collision event which can explain the unexpected impact induced behaviors provided in fig 10 b indeed the shock spectrum analysis is based on an elastic system which is different from the inelastic system in the detailed fe simulations however chopra and goel 2002 pointed out that the primary natural vibration mode can still be dominant for inelastic systems in the development of the modal pushover analysis method accordingly the barge shock spectrum provides a reasonable way to understand the counterintuitive results shown in fig 10 b the simplified impact loads determined by the equations provided in getter and consolazio 2011 are compared with the fe results fig 10 a as mentioned earlier some differences can be observed between the simplified impact loads and the numerically obtained forces as a result the impact induced displacements obtained from the high resolution simulations are different from those using the simplified loads as shown in figs 10 b and 11 b in addition to the above typical cases a parametric study is performed to investigate the influence of barge mass and velocity on the impact force and impact induced response the corresponding results are presented in fig 12 the above observations are further supported by these results since bridge columns must support axial loads during the period of service it is of importance to evaluate the residual axial strength after the lateral vessel impact thus the residual axial strengths of bridge columns after impacts are quantitatively evaluated through fe simulations the damage evaluation based on residual strengths can overcome the limitations of the deformation based evaluation method that is not suitable for comparing damage extents of bridge columns with varying failure modes e g flexural and shear failures for this reason the damage index based on the axial strengths is used in this study to evaluate the performance of bridge columns which can be written as shi et al 2008 2 d 1 p r e s i p m where p r e s i is the residual axial load carrying capacity of the impact damaged column p m is the ultimate axial capacity of the undamaged column according to the relationship between the damage level and the damage index the columns are categorized into a moderate damage level for d 0 2 0 5 and a severe damage level for d 0 5 0 8 shi et al 2008 the damage levels of the bridge columns under various collision scenarios are shown in fig 12 d generally the damage degree of the piers increases with the increase of barge mass when the initial impact velocity of the barge exceeds 2 m s all columns are considered to be severely damaged 4 dynamical response evaluation of uhpfrc strengthened columns under barge impact to improve the barge impact resistance of bridge columns several different kinds of uhpfrc strengthened columns are investigated in this section a proper strengthening method using uhpfrc is also presented 4 1 uhpfrc strengthened columns the drop hammer impact tests were conducted in the previous study fan et al 2019 to examine the impact resistant performance of uhpfrc and uhpfrc strengthened columns the test specimens had small reduced size and the use of the experimental data for full scale bridge columns under vessel impacts have not yet been confirmed based on the modeling method developed above numerical simulations are performed in this study to investigate the performance of different uhpfrc based strengthening methods in bridge columns subjected to barge impacts according to the position and length of the uhpfrc jackets three strengthened columns i e column i column e and column w are considered as shown in fig 3 c the symbols l and t are used to denote the length and thickness of the uhpfrc jacket respectively l 4 8 m and t 0 25 m are assumed in this section the uhpfrc columns indicated by column u are also considered for comparison without loss of generality the collision scenario 2000 ton barge with an impact velocity of 3 m s corresponding to the median level shown in fig 12 is used in the following section to evaluate the performance of uhpfrc strengthened columns 4 2 comparisons of uhpfrc strengthening methods and discussions figs 13 and 14 present the damage distributions and dynamic responses of different types of bridge columns subjected to the same barge collision scenarios by comparing with the conventional rc columns i e column n it can be found that the local damage around the impact zone is considerably reduced when the uhpfrc jacket i e column i is placed at the impact zone this means that the designed uhpfrc jacket can provide enough capacity to carry the local impact load due to the high strength and ductility of the uhpfrc material however the reduced damage at the column ends is relatively small when the uhpfrc jacket is used at the contact impact zone on the contrary using a two end uhpfrc jacket i e column e dramatically decreases the damage at the column ends these two strengthening schemes can also effectively reduce the impact induced displacements of the impacted columns as shown in fig 14 specifically the displacement dropped by 33 7 of column e at the impact point is slightly smaller than that decreased by 31 6 of column i in comparison with the partially strengthening methods i e column i and column e the presence of the whole length uhpfrc jackets throughout the columns can further improve the impact resistance and the residual strengths however the volumes of the uhpfrc material used in column w and column u are about four and eight times more than that of column i or column e respectively therefore the use of the whole length uhpfrc jackets for the columns will dramatically increase the cost because the uhpfrc material is much more expensive than normal concrete the whole length uhpfrc jackets column w are only recommended when there are no economic constraints for some critical bridge structures otherwise the partially strengthening schemes like column i and column e are more suited for general applications for the waterway that a bridge locates water levels usually change with time as a result the barge impact position is uncertain in engineering practice for this reason further comparisons should be conducted for the impact resistant performance of column i and column e considering the uncertainty of impact position due to the water level change three meter shifts positive and negative of the water level is considered herein to investigate the influence on the barge impact resistant performance as illustrated in figs 13 and 14 0 represents the mean water level 3 and 3 denote the lowest and the highest water levels respectively the damage distributions along the column are shown in fig 13 b and c for the lowest and highest water levels respectively compared with column e the damage of column i is more affected by the changes in water levels similarly the residual axial strengths of column i are smaller than those of column e when the water level increases or decreases by 3 m in practice it is challenging to predetermine the impact position due to the varied water level column i and column e have equal volumes of uhpfrc therefore it can be concluded that the impact resistant performances of the columns with two end uhpfrc jackets are superior to the columns with a uhpfrc jacket at the contact impact zone the former scheme exhibits more potential to be used in reality and its optimization design is worth exploring in the following section 5 sensitivity analysis and multi objective optimization multi objective optimizations are conducted to seek the optimal design of the potential strengthening solution in this section the surrogate models are presented and validated the sensitivity of primary design parameters including the length l and thickness t of the uhpfrc jacket and the longitudinal ρ l and transverse ρ s reinforcement ratios are discussed subsequently the multi objective optimization design problem is defined finally the optimization results of the two end uhpfrc strengthening schemes are provided and verified 5 1 problem definition for the optimization of the uhpfrc based strengthening solution the objectives are to maximize the impact resistant performance and minimize economic input i e cost as discussed above the residual strengths denoted by r s is used as an indicator to reflect the barge impact resistant performance of the strengthened column the column cost denoted by c s is defined as the economic indicator according to the market prices in china the general expenses of uhpfrc normal concrete and reinforcing steel bar are about 1 104 rmb m3 500 rmb m3 and 3500 rmb ton respectively it is apparent that these two objectives are conflicting the primary task of a two objective optimization is to search a cloud of best trade off solution called pareto optimal front in the design space then design decisions can be made based on the obtained trade off solutions and the subjective preferences of the designer or owner of a bridge structure the multi objective optimization problem of the suggested strengthening scheme under barge impacts can be defined as follows 3 max r s l t ρ l ρ t min c s l t ρ l ρ t subjected to 2 m l 5 m 0 1 m t 0 4 m 0 89 ρ l 1 78 0 24 ρ s 1 08 5 2 response surface models and sensitivity analysis it is unrealistic to directly apply detailed fe simulations in the multi objective optimization of the uhpfrc strengthening method because of the high demand in computational resources and time for this reason surrogate models are developed to reduce the number of fe simulations response surface method rsm has been extensively employed in the multi objective optimization to generate the surrogate models which can be expressed as 4 y x j n a j ϕ j x where y x is the required variable which is the residual strength r s and the cost c s of the column in this study ϕ j x is the basis functions e g the polynomials n is the number of functions a j is the coefficient of the basis function which can be determined from the least square method and the m sampling points estimated by fe simulations m n it is essential to examine the accuracy of the developed surrogate model before applying to the multi objective optimization the maximum relative error i m r e the average relative error i a r e and the coefficient of multiple determination r 2 are used to evaluate the applicability of the developed response surface model which can be written respectively as 5 i m r e m a x y i y i y i 100 6 i a r e y i y i y i 100 n 7 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i is the value predicted by the response surface model y i is the target value which is determined from fe simulations in this study n is the sampling number for verifications the box behnken design bbd widely used in the previous studies fan et al 2020 is employed to generate the sampling points for the fe simulations table 2 shows three levels of all varying parameters for the box behnken design as shown in table 3 a total of 29 sampling points are generated and simulated by the simplified fe models based on the fe results of the sampling points the response surface models of r s and c s are determined as follows 8 r s 0 609 6 376 l 37 245 t 27 635 ρ l 29 857 ρ s l t 2 360 10 15 l ρ l 0 6 l ρ s 8 84 t ρ l 11 595 t ρ s 1

ρ s 0 024 l 2 38 94 t 2 0 23 ρ l 2 0 36 ρ s 2 fig 15 plots the comparisons of r s and c s obtained from the developed response surface models eq 8 and 9 and the detailed fe simulations along with the expected trend lines i e y x good agreements are observed between the fe results and those predicted by eqs 8 and 9 for both r s and c s the i m r e and i a r e values are small and the results of r 2 are very close to 1 0 the results confirm the applicability of the developed response surface models to the sensitivity analysis of the multi objective optimization the 3d plots of the residual axial strengths with respect to pairs of design parameters are presented in fig 16 it is observed that the residual axial strengths increase with increasing longitudinal and transverse reinforcement ratios it is attributed to the fact that the increase of the longitudinal reinforcement ratio increases the bending moment resistance and the increase of transverse reinforcement ratio is beneficial for improving the residual capacity the residual strength is not very sensitive to the length and thickness of the two end uhpfrc jackets when these parameters change in a certain range however whether the uhpfrc jackets used or not have a noticeable influence on the impact resistant performance of the impacted column as observed in fig 16 compared with increasing the length of the uhpfrc jacket increasing the thickness of the jacket is more beneficial for improving the residual capacity it is because the increase of the jacket thickness can improve the resistance of the column to significant bending moments at the ends fig 17 shows the relationship between the cost and different pairs of design parameters it can be seen that the column cost is more sensitive to the increase in the length and the thickness of the uhpfrc jacket it is because the price of uhpfrc is much higher than the regular concrete these results imply that increasing the reinforcement ratios is a better option for a new bridge in comparison with increasing the length and thickness of uhpfrc jackets however it is worth mentioning that the method of increasing the reinforcement ratios is usually only applicable to new bridges and may lead to congested reinforcing details and some difficulties in structural construction zhang et al 2016 on the contrary the method using the uhpfrc jackets is not only suitable for both new and existing bridges but also avoid congested reinforcing details 5 3 multi objective optimization design of bridge pier considering barge collision the verified surrogate models instead of the fe simulations are employed to estimate the values of r s and c s with different design parameters in the multi objective optimization to obtain the pareto optimal solutions a number of the multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas have been proposed in the previous studies vo duy et al 2020 deb et al 2002 among the existing moeas the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm named nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2002 has been widely used in design optimization of various problems e g fan et al 2020 vo duy et al 2020 it is an extended and improved version of nsga srinivas and deb 1994 evolved from the well known genetic algorithm and nondominated sorting concept by goldenberg 1989 in addition to genetic operators crossover and mutation two specialized multi objective operators and mechanisms are defined and utilized in nsga ii thus nsga ii is employed in this study to search for the pareto front of the multi objective optimization defined in eq 3 after iterating for 200 generations the pareto front of the optimization problems for barge collisions is obtained as shown in fig 18 the two objectives are found to conflict with each other in other words increasing r s resulted in the undesirable growth of c s based on the derived pareto set using relatively high reinforcement ratios is recommended to design a new bridge while thicker uhpfrc jackets are suggested for improving an existing bridge four typical optimization results are presented in table 4 additional fe simulations corresponding to these optimal design parameters are performed to evaluate the optimized results as shown in table 4 the optimal results are in good agreement with the corresponding fe results which confirm the feasibility of the multi objective optimization design method for the partially strengthened columns with uhpfrc jackets for barge impact in practical applications of the multi objective optimization design any constraint can be imposed on the pareto front to conduct the desired design for example the constraint on the reinforcement ratios can be added to the optimization design of an existing bridge 6 conclusions an fe modeling method for bridge structures under barge impact is developed in this paper based on the verified numerical models the barge impact induced responses of the bridge columns are thoroughly examined and interpreted also the uhpfrc based strengthening methods are proposed and extensively investigated for improving the barge impact resistance of rc columns based on the detailed fe studies the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the influence of the initial permanent load structural gravity on the performance of the pier under barge collision is investigated the results indicate that the gravity of the superstructure improves the resistance of the pier under barge collision this is attributed to the fact that the presence of the initial permanent load not only induces the confinement effect and compressive arch action for the impacted column but also improve the overturning resistance of the bridge superstructure by providing additional rotational restraints to the pier top 2 a simplified bridge model retaining the whole girder is proposed and compared with the entire bridge model and the opts model both the opts model and the proposed simplified model exhibit acceptable accuracy in the estimation of barge impact induced responses as compensation for a small increase in the boundary definition and the number of the beam or discrete elements the oscillation behavior of the superstructure is better captured by the proposed model and its accuracy is improved 3 several barge bridge collision scenarios are simulated to investigate the process of the collision and the behavior of the impacted columns it is found that the peak impact force increases with the initial kinetic energy however the impact induced responses e g displacement of the impacted columns do not always increase it is because the spectral characteristics of the impact force time history have a significant influence on the impact induced responses 4 three different strengthening methods based on ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete uhpfrc are investigated for barge impact consideration is also given to the change of the water level results show that the strengthened column with two end uhpfrc jackets is more promising than the other considered methods in terms of efficiency and costs 5 a multi objective optimization design procedure is developed for the uhpfrc strengthened columns under barge collision the problem is defined to increase the residual axial load capacity and reduce the costs the developed response surface models are demonstrated to be capable of accurately predicting the performance indictors under various design parameters the pareto front is obtained using nsga ii and some typical optimum results are examined and confirmed through detailed

21542,the safety of civil structures e g bridges and frame buildings are threatened by various inevitable hazards such as corrosion fatigue and extreme loading e g earthquake blast impact such hazards may cause significant damage to structures and hence reduce their performance this paper proposes two different strategies i e the direct identification method which assumes that the information of loading which causes damage to a structure is not known and the indirect identification method which assumes that the loading causing structural damage is known to be generated by certain scenarios e g impact to identify the damage of civil structures after certain loading processes barge impact upon a single reinforced concrete rc column is considered in this paper to assess the prediction

degree of freedom model cmm the proposed strategies show great potential for practical applications to damage identification of civil structures keywords civil structures extreme loading direct identification method barge impact cmm 1 introduction civil structures such as bridges and frame buildings are fundamental facilities and systems that serve our society and promote both social and economic development however our civil structures are susceptible to various inevitable hazards e g corrosion ai harthy et al 2011 fatigue kwon and frangopol 2010 and extreme loading such as blast li et al 2016 bao and li 2010 earthquake bi and hao 2016 lu et al 2012 and impact do et al 2019 wang and morgenthal 2017 which result in non negligible structural deficiencies over time such deteriorations reduce the performance of structures and can even lead to structural collapses threatening both people s lives and our economy it is thus critical to identify the damage of civil structures to determine their future behavior under different loading conditions with the increasing number of vessel collision accidents the design of bridge piers to resist such impact loading has become a critical issue substantial research has been conducted over the past decade in the field of vessel pier collisions the main focus of most studies is on the prediction of impact force time history as this contact force is critical for the analysis and assessment of bridge piers by means of either experimental impact tests consolazio et al 2006 sha and hao 2013a 2015 or numerical analyses based on finite element simulations sha and hao 2012 consolazio and cowan 2003 yuan 2005 gholipour et al 2020 computationally efficient simplified vessel pier collision models consolazio and cowan 2005 yuan and harik 2008 fan et al 2011 sha and hao 2014 wang and morgenthal 2018 or empirical formulas provided by e g aashto guide specification aashtowashington 2009 and eurocode cen 2006 the development and assessment of different types of anti collision protective structures which absorb a large amount of impact energy and thus protect bridge piers from vessel collisions is another major focus of many previous studies saul et al 2001 wang et al 2018 2019 2020 fan et al 2018 the residual load bearing capacity of rc columns after impact loading was also investigated by previous researchers via both experimental and numerical approaches fan et al 2019 sun et al 2020 in addition sha sha and hao 2013b developed the numerical models based on finite element simulations to assess the conditions of a continuous girder bridge after vessel impact using frequency domain decomposition method significant research for structural damage identification was conducted in the past such damage identification techniques can be categorized into two types i e local methods and global methods the local methods e g visual inspection acoustic emission ultrasonic methods are effective for identification of local damage however they require a prior localization of the damaged zones which shall be readily accessible the vibration based damage identification method is a form of global method which is most extensively studied this method uses measured changes in dynamic features such as modal parameters to evaluate changes in physical properties of a structure e g structural stiffness doebling et al 1998 this leads to an inverse problem which is often coupled with model updating to reproduce results that agree as closely as possible with the measured features various methods for model updating have been proposed which can be categorized into two types i e direct methods which directly update the structural model matrices including mass stiffness and damping indirect or parametric methods which update parameters regarding e g material properties feng et al 2006 such model updating technique has also been employed to locate and quantify the severity of damage by defining a damage indicator regarding e g the reduction in stiffness of each individual structural element ren and roeck 2002 kim et al 2003 the development of constrained optimization models for model updating has gained much attention feng et al 2006 bakir et al 2007 in addition to the measurement of modal parameters of structures using sensor systems for model updating there are also studies which use measured global static responses of structures to identify structural damage by model updating techniques seyedpoor and yazdanpanah 2014 he and hwang 2007 besides the small unmanned aircraft system uas equipped with high quality cameras has been widely used for structural condition assessment this technique allows for the extraction of structural geometry e g cross section geometry structural displacement based on point cloud analysis morgenthal et al 2019a however research related to the application of these techniques to identification of impact induced damages on bridge piers is quite limited the existing model updating strategies using either direct or indirect methods are based on certain assumptions e g the stiffness matrix of a damaged structural element is proportional to the original stiffness matrix of the undamaged element ren and roeck 2002 a uniform erosion in material properties applies to a whole structure feng et al 2006 whilst in reality the damage distribution in a structure may be rather irregular these assumptions may therefore deviate from realistic cases besides the existing model updating strategies cannot generate e g distributions of residual stresses and strains in a damaged structure which are useful information for further predicting the responses of a damaged structure under the action of various post damage loading conditions this paper thus aims to develop effective strategies which allow for a full quantification of the state of damaged structures to the fiber level based on measured quantities e g structural displacements modal parameters and apply such strategies to the identification of damage on rc pier columns induced by vessel collisions two different strategies i e the direct identification method dim which assumes that the information of loading which causes structural damage is not known and the indirect identification method idim which assumes that the loading causing structural damage is known to be generated by certain scenarios e g impact are proposed in this paper to identify the damage of civil structures as barges are one of the main types of vessels in navigation waterways and rc columns are generally the main load bearing elements for many civil structures e g bridges frame buildings this paper focuses on the investigation of a single rc column subjected to barge impact loading an exact deformation analysis is conducted first in this paper using the coupled multi degree of freedom model cmm previously developed and validated by the authors wang and morgenthal 2017 for non linear dynamic analysis of rc pier columns subjected to barge impact the dim is then developed based on a constrained optimization model which uses measured structural displacements and modal parameters to identify the most basic output data which can be used to fully determine the state quantities of a damaged rc column e g distribution of residual stresses and strains deformed shape and structural stiffness via the fiber based formulations developed in this paper the identified basic output data are compared with the benchmark data generated from the exact deformation analysis using cmm in addition the idim is proposed to identify the impact force time history based on measured structural displacements to reduce the number of structural quantities which shall be measured an idealization of the deformed shape of the rc column is conducted in this paper using a continuous curve which satisfies the boundary conditions and requires only the measurement of column top displacement and by coupling this strategy with the proposed idim a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of the measuring error in column top displacement on the identified impact force time history 2 numerical analysis of barge column impact in this section numerical analyses are conducted using the previously developed cmm to determine the dynamic responses of an rc column subjected to a given barge impact scenario the numerical results generated in this section are used as exact reference output data for assessing the prediction quality of the damage identification strategies proposed in this paper 2 1 information of rc column the rc column with a cross section of 2 134 m 2 134 m and concrete cover depth of 50 0 mm is considered here the column is 15 0 m in height the diameter of the longitudinal reinforcement rebars is taken to be 30 0 mm whilst the diameter of the stirrups is taken to be 20 0 mm the longitudinal reinforcement rebars are spaced at 0 25 m along the four sides of the column cross section and the stirrups are spaced at 0 25 m along the column height the superstructure mass is taken to be 500 0 ton the column bottom is totally fixed whilst the rotational dofs at column top are assumed to be constrained the configuration of the rc column and the layout of reinforcements are shown in fig 1 the geometric parameters regarding the rc column is tabulated in table 1 whilst the material parameters are tabulated in table 2 a fully loaded barge 1723 7 ton in weight with a head on impact velocity of 2 0 m s is considered here the impact position is assumed to be in the middle of column height i e 7 5 m measured from the column bottom detailed descriptions of the barge model used here are provided in ref wang and morgenthal 2018 2 2 methods for numerical analysis the fiber based method is employed here for non linear dynamic analysis of the rc column subjected to barge impact this method can effectively account for the plasticity distribution as well as axial flexural deformation interaction at section level by assigning section fibers with realistic uni axial stress strain relationships as shown in fig 2 the concrete and reinforcements are assumed to be perfectly bonded torsion effects are totally ignored and all sections are assumed to remain plane and perpendicular to the central axis the step by step time history analysis is conducted using the previously developed cmm wang and morgenthal 2017 to determine the dynamic responses of the rc column subjected to the given barge impact scenario 2 3 material models 2 3 1 stress strain relationship of concrete the uni axial stress strain relationship of concrete proposed by scott et al 1982 is used here this model modifies the stress strain relationship of concrete considering the influence of confinement for low strain rate cases the maximum stress of concrete k f c is attained at a strain of k ε 0 ε 0 0 002 which is the yielding strain of unconfined concrete in which f c is the concrete compressive cylinder strength mpa and k is the enhancement factor dependent on hoop reinforcement 1 k 1 r s f y h s f c where r s is the ratio of hoop reinforcement volume to the volume of concrete core measured to outside of the hoops and f y h s is the yielding stress of hoop mpa the stress strain relationship of concrete in compression is described as the following 2 σ c k f c 2 ε c k ε 0 ε c k ε 0 2 ε c k ε 0 k f c 1 z m ε c k ε 0 0 2 k f c ε c k ε 0 where ε c and σ c are the longitudinal strain and stress mpa in concrete respectively z m is calculated by 3 z m 0 5 3 0 29 f c 145 f c 1000 3 4 r s w s h k ε 0 where w is the width of concrete core measured to outside of the peripheral hoop m s h is the center to center spacing of hoop sets m the maximum available concrete compressive strain is taken as scott et al 1982 4 ε u ε u 0 0 9 r s f y h s 300 where ε u 0 is the maximum available compressive strain of unconfined concrete which equals to 0 004 the unloading properties of concrete proposed by taucer et al 1991 is used here it is suggested that the unloading takes place in a straight line with a slope of e c u calculated by 5 e c u σ r ε r ε p where ε r and σ r are the strain and stress on the envelop stress strain curve where unloading occurs ε p is the residual plastic strain calculated by 6 ε p k ε 0 0 145 ε r k ε 0 2 0 130 ε r k ε 0 ε r k ε u 0 k ε 0 0 707 ε r k ε 0 2 0 834 ε r k ε u 0 the stress strain relationship and unloading properties of concrete are shown in fig 3 the tensile strength of the concrete is neglected in the model as the tensile strength of an rc section is mainly contributed by the reinforcement rebars 2 3 2 stress strain relationship of reinforcement the bi linear stress strain relationship is adopted here for the reinforcement steel as shown in fig 4 the unloading slope is assumed to be e s which is the elastic modulus of the reinforcement steel 2 4 numerical results the number of gauss integration points gip n g i p in each fiber beam element and the total number of fiber beam elements n e l e shall be determined first before detailed numerical analysis can be conducted here detailed convergence tests are conducted to provide standard cases for comparison purposes a baseline case is considered where n g i p 2 and n e l e 6 two sets of numerical simulations are conducted each set of simulations include the baseline simulation and the simulations in which only one parameter is changed as the adoption of one gip in each fiber beam element would result in numerical instability and often lead to poor numerical performance feng and jun 2018 wu 2013 the minimum value of n g i p is taken to be 2 here three values i e 2 3 and 4 are considered for n g i p whilst 5 values i e 2 4 6 8 10 are considered for n e l e the time history of displacement at the column top is chosen here to investigate the sensitivity of output quantities to the values of n g i p and n e l e the results are plotted in fig 5 which shows that an increase in n g i p only has negligible effects on the numerical result which converges when the value of n e l e reaches 6 as a result two gips are used in each fiber beam element with their locations described in fig 2 whilst 6 fiber beam elements each of which is 2 5 m in length are used to discretize the rc column as shown in fig 6 where the cmm using a non linear mass spring model to replicate the complex barge model is illustrated each lumped column mass has three degrees of freedom dof i e one lateral displacement one axial displacement and one rotation angle as depicted in fig 6 where the locations of two gips on each fiber beam element are also provided the lumped column masses are numbered from 1 to 7 the fiber beam elements are numbered from 1 to 6 and the gips are numbered from 1 to 12 counting from the bottom of the rc column the time history of impact force f acting on the rc column is shown in fig 7 the impact force reaches the peak value of 14 03 mn after 0 014 s of impact and the duration of impact force is 0 76 s after which the rc column starts the free vibration process the time history of displacement at the top of rc column μ t during impact is shown in fig 8 the column top displacement reaches the maximum value of 0 84 m after 1 02 s of impact it can be seen from fig 8 that the column top displacement roughly keeps constant after 2 0 s of impact with a residual value of 0 72 m at time of 6 0 s after which the column displacement and deformation are considered to keep stable without significant oscillations to demonstrate the deformation process of the rc column during barge impact the time histories of section curvatures κ at the location of lumped column masses as shown in fig 6 are plotted in fig 9 which shows that all section curvatures roughly keep constant after around 2 0 s of barge impact fig 10 shows the initial shape and the deformed shapes of the rc column after 1 0 s 3 5 s and 6 0 s of barge impact respectively where the distributions of bending moment at corresponding time steps and the distribution of maximum bending moment are also provided it can be seen that the maximum bending moments occur at the column bottom column top and impact position to quantify the damage of an rc section the degree of plasticity denoted as ξ p is defined based on the reduction of bending stiffness of the section the value of ξ p for a given rc section varies between 0 0 no damage and 1 0 complete damage and is calculated by the following equation 7 ξ p k b 0 k b k b 0 where k b 0 is the initial bending stiffness of the rc section before damage mn m2 and k b is the bending stiffness mn m2 of the post damage rc section note that the section bending stiffness defined here denotes the increase of section bending moment with the increase of a unit section curvature and is calculated by the following equation 8 k b i 1 n f e t a n i z i 2 a i where e t a n i z i and a i are the tangent modulus z coordinate and area of the i th section fiber respectively n f is the total number of section fibers both z i and a i are geometric parameters which are constant over time whilst e t a n i is time dependent based on the loading and unloading history of the fiber the initial elastic modulus of each section fiber is used here to calculate k b 0 based on eq 8 based on eq 7 the degree of plasticity along the height of the rc column after barge impact is quantified and plotted in fig 11 the result shows that the rc column experiences the largest degree of plasticity at the impact position column bottom and column top where the largest bending moments occur as shown in fig 10 3 damage identification of rc column in this section two different strategies are proposed for damage identification of rc columns the first one is defined as direct identification method which assumes that the information of loading causing the structural damage is completely unknown and a constrained optimization model is developed to directly identify the damage of rc columns based on measured structural displacements and modal parameters the second one is defined as indirect identification method which assumes that the information of loading causing the structural damage is known and another optimization model is developed to identify the impact force time history based on measured column displacements the prediction quality of the proposed strategies is assessed using the benchmark output data obtained from the numerical analysis in the previous section 3 1 direct identification method to quantify the state of a damaged rc column without prior information of the loading process it is necessary to clarify the basic output parameters based on which the state parameters e g stress and strain distribution structural displacements structural stiffness can be fully determined in this section the fiber based formulations and a constrained optimization model are developed to quantify the basic output parameters based on measured structural quantities and a validation of the proposed strategies is conducted using benchmark output data generated in section 2 3 1 1 clarification of basic output parameters for a given fiber beam element the number index of which is denoted as i i 1 2 6 if the curvatures κ 2 i 1 κ 2 i and uni axial central fiber strains ε c 2 i 1 ε c 2 i of two gips are provided as shown in fig 12 the axial displacement μ n i 1 on node i 1 can be determined by gauss integration with the following equation where w j j 1 2 is the weighting factor and both w 1 and w 2 equal to 0 5 μ n i is the axial displacement on node i the lateral displacement μ i 1 and rotation θ i 1 on node i 1 can be determined using shape functions as μ i θ i κ 2 i 1 and κ 2 i are assumed to be known a three order polynomial shape function can be used 10 μ x k 1 4 c k x k 1 where x 0 x l is the x coordinate of the point on the fiber beam element using the known parameters i e μ 0 μ i μ 0 θ i μ x 1 κ 2 i 1 and μ x 2 κ 2 i the values of c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 can be derived as follows 11 c k μ i k 1 θ i k 2 x 2 κ 2 i 1 x 1 κ 2 i 2 x 2 x 1 k 3 κ 2 i 1 κ 2 i 6 x 2 x 1 k 4 substituting the coefficients into eq 10 the shape function can be expressed as follows 12 μ x x 3 3 x 2 x 2 6 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i 1 x 3 3 x 1 x 2 6 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i x θ i μ i using eq 12 the lateral displacement μ i 1 and rotation angle θ i 1 on node i 1 can be calculated as follows 13 μ i 1 l 3 3 x 2 l 2 6 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i 1 l 3 3 x 1 l 2 6 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i θ i l μ i 14 θ i 1 l 2 2 x 2 l 2 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i 1 l 2 3 x 1 l 2 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i θ i for the rc column considered here the bottom of the 1st fiber beam element is totally fixed as shown in fig 6 we have μ 1 0 μ n 1 0 and θ 1 0 using eqs 9 13 and 14 the values of μ 2 μ n 2 and θ 2 can be calculated until the nodal displacements and nodal rotations of all nodes are determined based on the assumptions in section 2 1 when the curvature and uni axial strain of the central fiber of an rc section are provided the distribution of true fiber strains can be generated when additionally the distribution of plastic fiber strains of the section is provided the distribution of fiber stresses and tangent fiber stiffness can be determined based on the uni axial stress strain relationships of section fibers shown in figs 3 and 4 and the internal section forces and section stiffness can be generated by integration of fiber stresses and tangent fiber stiffness respectively the stiffness of a fiber beam element k e can be obtained by integration of section stiffness described as follows taucer et al 1991 15 k e t t 0 l b t x k 1 x b x d x 1 t where k x is the stiffness of section at location x b x is the interpolation function and t is the transformation matrix expressed as follows wang and morgenthal 2017 b x 0 x l 1 x l 1 0 0 t 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 l 1 l 0 0 1 0 1 l 1 l 0 0 0 1 the stiffness of sections located at two gips can be used to obtain the element stiffness using eq 15 it can thus be concluded based on the study in this section that when the basic output parameters i e curvatures uni axial central fiber strains and distributions of plastic fiber strains of all rc sections located at gips are provided the state of a damaged rc column can be fully determined to validate the methodology proposed in this section the lateral displacements μ axial displacements μ n and rotation angles θ of the 7 lumped column masses depicted in fig 6 at time of 6 0 s are calculated based on the basic output parameters determined in section 2 4 and are compared with the ones directly determined by cmm using step by step time history analysis as shown in fig 13 where i m denotes the number index of a lumped column mass it can be seen that the results generated by the proposed methodology match the benchmark results with negligible errors 3 1 2 quantification of basic output parameters the studies in section 3 1 1 have shown that the state of a damaged rc column can be fully quantified when the basic output parameters are obtained in practical engineering such basic output parameters cannot be directly measured and shall be determined based on certain strategies using measured structural quantities e g structural displacements modal parameters the deformed shape of a damaged rc column can be readily measured using e g the unmanned aircraft system uas equipped with high quality cameras as demonstrated in the work of morgenthal et al 2019b the curvatures of the two sections located at gips in the i th fiber beam element i e κ 2 i 1 and κ 2 i can be calculated using the three order shape function determined by the two lateral nodal displacements i e μ i and μ i 1 and two nodal rotations i e θ i and θ i 1 see fig 12 16 κ 2 i 1 12 x 1 6 l μ i μ i 1 l 3 6 x 1 4 l l 2 θ i 6 x 1 2 l l 2 θ i 1 17 κ 2 i 12 x 2 6 l μ i μ i 1 l 3 6 x 2 4 l l 2 θ i 6 x 2 2 l l 2 θ i 1 based on eq 9 ε c 2 i 1 and ε c 2 i shall satisfy the following equation 18 ε c 2 i u n i 1 u n i w 1 ε c 2 i 1 l w 2 l for a given fiber beam element e g the i th element the value of ε c 2 i 1 can be effectively determined based on the realistic deformed shape of a damaged rc column this paper will not discuss the detailed method to determine the value of ε c 2 i 1 but rather assume that it is already known for each fiber beam element an optimization model shall be developed to determine the distribution of plastic fiber strains at two sections located at the gips the objective of this optimization model is to minimize the error between the calculated modal parameters e g natural frequencies and the ones measured by e g structural health monitoring shm technique it is noteworthy that this paper assumes that the deformed shape and modal parameters of a damaged rc column are already known and does not involve practical field measurement of these data however due to the large amount of fibers in each section the number of optimization parameters will consequently be very large to reduce the number of optimization parameters linear functions are used to compute the plastic strain of each section fiber in terms of its coordinates as the head on impact scenario considered here is symmetrical with an impact velocity along the direction of z axis the distribution of plastic fiber strains ε p will be symmetrical about z axis see fig 2 the functions are thus expressed as follows 19 ε p z k 1 2 c c o n c k z w p k 1 concrete fibers k 1 2 c r e i n k z w p k 1 reinforcement fibers where w p is the width of cross section along z axis see fig 2 the measured natural frequencies and mode shapes of the damaged rc column are used as the target goal and the optimization parameters are the coefficients introduced in eq 19 for all sections located at gips the total number of optimization parameters is thus 8 n e l e where n e l e is the number of fiber beam elements the optimization model is described as follows minimize 20 e f i 1 n f ω c a l i ω r e f i ω r e f i i 1 n f j 1 n f φ c a l i j φ r e f i j φ r e f i j where n f is the total number of natural frequencies ω r e f i and ω c a l i are the i th measured and calculated natural frequency respectively φ r e f i j and φ c a l i j are the measured and calculated value of the element located at the i th row and j th column of the mode shape matrix as the internal forces in the damaged rc column shall be self balanced the proposed optimization model shall satisfy the following constraints 21 f i t f i 1 b f i i 0 0 f n i t f n i 1 b f i n i 0 0 m i t m i 1 b 0 0 the forces defined in eq 21 corresponding to the i th lumped column mass are illustrated in fig 14 where f i t and f i 1 b are two shear forces f n i t and f n i 1 b are two axial forces f i i and f i n i are the inertial forces due to free vibration in the lateral direction and axial direction respectively m i t and m i 1 b are two bending moments the superscript t and b denotes the top section and bottom section of a fiber beam element respectively as the objective function described in eq 20 is highly non linear with an unpredictable number of local minimums the global particle swarm method zhang and wang 2015 is employed in this paper for solving the proposed optimization problem however this method is limited to unconstrained optimization problems the following objective function transforms the proposed constrained optimization model into an unconstrained one minimize 22 e e f e b where e b is calculated by the following equation based on eq 21 23 e b e b 1 e b 2 e b 3 where e b 1 e b 2 and e b 3 are calculated by 24 e b 1 i 1 n e l e f i t f i 1 b f i i f i t f i 1 b e b

section 2 4 is employed for the analysis the lateral displacements axial displacements and rotation angles of the 7 lumped column masses are tabulated in table 3 whilst the uni axial central fiber strain at the 1st gip of each fiber beam element are tabulated in table 4 where i g i g 1 2 12 denotes the number index of gip the values of 12 natural frequencies generated from the 12 12 tangent stiffness of the damaged rc column at time of 6 0 s are tabulated in table 5 using eqs 16 and 17 the curvatures κ c a l c of sections located at the 12 gips counted from column bottom to column top are calculated whilst the uni axial central fiber strains ε c c a l c at the 2nd gip of each fiber beam element can be determined using eq 18 the calculated results are compared with the reference ones κ r e f and ε c r e f directly generated by cmm as shown in tables 6 and 7 respectively where the relative errors e r e l are also presented the results indicate that the proposed strategy can accurately predict the section curvatures and uni axial central fiber strains at gips should the deformed shape of the damaged rc column can be accurately measured as the largest bending moment tends to occur at the impact position the bottom and the top of the rc column as shown in fig 10 the distributions of true fiber strains at the 12th 7th 6th and 1st gip are shown in fig 15 where the calculated results are compared with the reference results it can be seen that the distribution of true strains at the sections can be very accurately predicted by the proposed strategy the proposed optimization model is used to determine the distribution of plastic fiber strains at gips based on the modal parameters of the damaged rc column the natural frequencies ω c a l determined by the optimization model and the reference ones ω r e f are tabulated in table 8 where the relative errors e r e l are also provided it is shown that the identified natural frequencies match the reference ones very well a contour plot is drawn to show the distribution of relative errors between the elements in the mode shape matrix determined by the optimization model and the elements in the reference one as shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the error is generally large for high modes as they are more sensitive to structural damage the distributions of plastic fiber strains at the 12th 7th 6th and 1st gip where the maximum bending moments occur are shown in fig 17 where the optimum results are compared with the reference results it can be seen that for the 1st and 12th gip the proposed optimization model provides an accurate prediction of plastic strains of steel fibers for the 6th and 7th gip the optimum results corresponding to the steel fibers deviate from the reference results as the distribution of plastic strains of steel fibers does not actually show a linear trend it can also be seen that for concrete fibers the optimum results deviate from the reference results as the distribution of plastic strains of concrete fibers does not show a linear trend however the magnitudes of plastic strains of concrete fibers determined by the optimization model are in good agreement with the reference ones 3 2 indirect identification method assuming that the loading which causes the damage to the rc column is known to be generated by barge impact and the impact position is known and only the deformed shape of the rc column after barge impact is measured it would be possible to determine the impact force time history so that the predicted deformed shape of the rc column after barge impact matches the measured one as closely as possible in this section an optimization model is developed to identify the impact force time history based on the measured structural displacements to reduce the number of parameters which shall be measured several different types of continuous curves satisfying the boundary conditions are proposed to idealize the deformed shape of the rc column based on the measured column top displacement a sensitivity analysis is then conducted to investigate the influence of measuring error in column top displacement on the identified impact force time history 3 2 1 using exact deformed shape of rc column the shape of the force time history curve generated by barge impact generally includes an abrupt increase until a peak value very shortly after impact followed by a rapid decrease until the force plateaus after which unloading occurs as substantially investigated in previous studies wang and morgenthal 2017 2018 and shown in fig 7 the shape of an impact force time history curve can thus be idealized as several linear segments as shown in fig 18 an optimization model is developed here to generate the impact force time history based on measured column displacements the parameters which need to be optimized include t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 f 1 f 2 and f 3 whilst the objective function is expressed as follows minimize 25 e d e d 1 e d 2 e d 3 where 26 e d 1 i 2 n m μ c a l i μ r e f i μ r e f i 27 e d 2 i 2 n m μ n c a l i μ n r e f i μ n r e f i 28 e d 3 i 2 n m 1 θ c a l i θ r e f i θ r e f i where n m is the number of lumped column masses μ c a l i and μ r e f i are the calculated and measured lateral displacement respectively of the i th lumped column mass μ n c a l i and μ n r e f i are the calculated and measured axial displacement respectively of the i th lumped column mass and θ c a l i and θ r e f i are the calculated and measured rotation respectively of the i th lumped column mass the nelder mead simplex method lagarias et al 1998 is used to solve this optimization problem this method can be used for unconstrained optimization problems with direct search method the initial values of optimization parameters are chosen and the optimum parameter set is found very robustly as confirmed by detailed checks assuming that the column displacements are accurately measured i e the measured column displacements equal to the reference lateral displacements axial displacements and rotations of lumped column masses tabulated in table 3 the optimum set of parameters i e t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 f 1 f 2 and f 3 generated by the proposed optimization model are tabulated in table 9 a comparison of the optimum impact force time history and the reference one is shown in fig 19 which shows that the impact force time history can be very well predicted by the proposed optimization model if the column displacements can be accurately measured besides a comparison of the calculated and reference column displacements is shown in table 10 where the relative errors are also provided it can be seen that the calculated column displacements based on the proposed optimization model match the reference results with high accuracy a comparison of the calculated and the reference results of the distribution of plastic strains at the 12th 7th 6th and 1st gips where the maximum bending moments occur are shown in fig 20 which shows that the calculated results based on the proposed optimization model match the reference results very well 3 2 2 using idealized deformed shape of rc column however it would be challenging in practical engineering to accurately measure the lateral displacements axial displacements and rotation angles at different locations of a damaged rc column to facilitate practical engineering application it would be beneficial if the least amount of data is required to be measured for the rc column considered in this paper the deformed column shape may be idealized as a continuous curve which satisfies the boundary conditions i e fixed at the bottom and zero rotation angle at the top four types of curves are considered here three order polynomial curve trigonometric curve parametrized curve and logistic curve as shown in fig 21 assuming that the column top displacement μ t is measured using the boundary conditions i e μ 0 0 θ 0 0 μ h μ t θ h 0 where h is the height of the column the lateral displacement μ and rotation angle θ along the column height can be expressed as follows three order polynomial curve 29 μ x 2 μ t h 3 x 3 3 μ t h 2 x 2 30 θ x 6 μ t h 3 x 2 6 μ t h 2 x trigonometric curve 31 μ x μ t sin π x 2 h 2 32 θ x π μ t 2 h sin π x h parametrized curve 33 μ x μ t x 2 x 2 h x 2 34 θ x 2 μ t h x h x x 2 h x 2 2 logistic curve 35 μ x 1 1 μ t e 2 c h x c 36 θ x 2 c h e 2 c h x c 1 μ t e 2 c h x c 2 where c is a positive constant the value of which approaches infinite to satisfy the boundary conditions in this study the value of c is taken to be 10 0 and the boundary conditions can already be well satisfied the axial displacements of the column are not accounted for and thus the objective function of the optimization model becomes minimize 37 e d e d 1 e d 3 assuming that the column top displacement is accurately measured i e μ t 0 727 m the optimum sets of parameters corresponding to the four idealized deformed shapes of column are tabulated in table 11 the optimum impact force time histories in comparison to the reference one are shown in fig 22 it can be seen that the three order polynomial curve and the trigonometric curve enable a relatively accurate prediction of the impact force time history whilst the other two idealized deformed shapes lead to an inaccurate prediction this is because the realistic deformed shape of column can be much better approximated by the three order polynomial curve and the trigonometric curve as shown in fig 23 the results indicate that it is possible to identify the impact force time history with sufficient accuracy based on an accurately measured column top displacement if a suitable continuous curve is used to approximate the deformed shape of the rc column to investigate the influence of measuring error in column top displacement on the prediction of impact force time history the three order polynomial curve is used here to idealize the deformed shape of column with consideration of several different measured column top displacements the ratio of the measured column top displacement to the reference one 0 727 m is defined as r μ and several different values of r μ i e 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 and 1 8 are considered here as shown in fig 24 the optimum impact force time histories corresponding to different values of r μ are plotted in fig 25 where the reference impact force time history is also plotted it can be observed that the peak impact force is not that much influenced by the measured column top displacement as this force peak lasts very shortly and a large increase or decrease in column displacement does not necessarily lead to a significant change of this force peak the main difference in the force time histories lies in the magnitudes of force plateaus which are the main factor that influences the column displacement since this force plateau lasts relatively long as can be seen in fig 25 it is also noticeable that an increase in the force plateau often leads to a much larger increase in the column displacement this is because the column has significant plastic deformation for the cases considered here and hence a small increase in impact force could possibly lead to a significant increase in column displacement an additional optimization model is developed here using the same objective function described in eq 37 to identify the optimum set of barge mass m b and impact velocity v b so that the deformed shape of the rc column predicted by cmm match the three order polynomial curve with a given measured column top displacement as closely as possible for the several measured column top displacements considered above the optimum sets of barge mass and impact velocity are tabulated in table 12 where the identified barge kinetic energy e o p t and the ratio of e o p t to the reference barge kinetic energy e r e f are also provided it is assumed here that the barge mass varies between 181 4 ton weight of empty barge and 1723 7 ton weight of fully loaded barge and barge impact velocity varies between 0 1 m s and the maximum velocity of 3 09 m s as per ref yuan 2005 the results show that when the column top displacement is accurately measured i e r u 1 0 the optimum set of barge mass and impact velocity matches the reference barge mass of 1723 7 ton and reference impact velocity of 2 0 m s very well however with the increase of measuring error in column top displacement the identified barge mass and impact velocity start to deviate from the reference ones with an increasing prediction error it can also be observed that with the increase of r μ the predicted barge kinetic energy increases accordingly 4 summary and conclusions this paper numerically analyzed the deformation process of an rc column subjected to a given barge impact scenario using the previously developed coupled multi degree of freedom model cmm it is found that the regions around the bottom impact position and top of the rc column experience the largest degree of damage after barge impact due to the occurrence of large bending moments in these regions the direct identification method based on measured column displacements and modal parameters is proposed to identify the basic output parameters which can be used to fully quantify the state of a damaged rc column with fiber based formulations a comparison to the reference output parameters found that the proposed strategy can very reasonably quantify the state of a damaged rc column without prior information of the loading which caused column damage as an alternative approach the indirect identification method is proposed to determine the time history of impact force based on measured column displacements this method requires prior information on the type of loading which caused column damage but it does not require the measurement of modal parameters of the damaged rc column the study found that if the column displacements are accurately measured the proposed strategy can very accurately identify the impact force time history besides several different types of continuous curves are proposed based on the boundary conditions and column top displacement to idealize the deformed shape of the damaged rc column enabling the implementation of the proposed indirect identification method with only one measured structural quantity i e the column top displacement the results indicate that the three order polynomial curve and the trigonometric curve allow for a reasonable identification of impact force time history if the column top displacement is accurately measured and the plateau of the identified impact force time history is very sensitive to the measured column top displacement which is not influential upon the force peak the proposed strategy is also found to be able to reasonably identify the barge mass and impact velocity based on measured column top displacement however this paper only demonstrated the application of the proposed strategies to the damage identification of a single rc column subjected to barge impact their applications to large scale rc frame structures subjected to various other loading

identification method barge impact cmm 1 introduction civil structures such as bridges and frame buildings are fundamental facilities and systems that serve our society and promote both social and economic development however our civil structures are susceptible to various inevitable hazards e g corrosion ai harthy et al 2011 fatigue kwon and frangopol 2010 and extreme loading such as blast li

deteriorations reduce the performance of structures and can even lead to structural collapses threatening both people s lives and our economy it is thus critical to identify the damage of civil structures to determine their future behavior under different loading conditions with the increasing number of vessel collision accidents the design of bridge piers to resist such impact loading has become a critical issue substantial research has been conducted over the past decade in the field of vessel pier collisions the main focus of most studies is on the prediction of impact force time history as this contact force is critical for the analysis and assessment of bridge piers by means of either experimental impact tests consolazio et al 2006 sha and hao 2013a 2015 or numerical analyses based on finite element simulations sha and hao 2012 consolazio and cowan 2003 yuan 2005 gholipour et al 2020 computationally efficient simplified vessel pier collision models consolazio and cowan 2005 yuan and harik 2008 fan et al 2011 sha and hao 2014 wang and morgenthal 2018 or empirical formulas provided by e g aashto guide specification aashtowashington 2009 and eurocode cen 2006 the development and assessment of different types of anti collision protective structures which absorb a large amount of impact energy and thus protect bridge piers from vessel collisions is another major focus of many previous studies saul et al 2001 wang et al 2018 2019 2020 fan et al 2018 the residual load bearing capacity of rc columns after impact loading was also investigated by previous researchers via both experimental and numerical approaches fan et al 2019 sun et al 2020 in addition sha sha and hao 2013b developed the numerical models based on finite element simulations to assess the conditions of a continuous girder bridge after vessel impact using frequency domain decomposition method significant research for structural damage identification was conducted in the past such damage identification techniques can be categorized into two types i e local methods and global methods the local methods e g visual inspection acoustic emission ultrasonic methods are effective for identification of local damage however they require a prior localization of the damaged zones which shall be readily accessible the vibration based damage identification method is a form of global method which is most extensively studied this method uses measured changes in dynamic features such as modal parameters to evaluate changes in physical properties of a structure e g structural stiffness doebling et al 1998 this leads to an inverse problem which is often coupled with model updating to reproduce results that agree as closely as possible with the measured features various methods for model updating have been proposed which can be categorized into two types i e direct methods which directly update the structural model matrices including mass stiffness and damping indirect or parametric methods which update parameters regarding e g material properties feng et al 2006 such model updating technique has also been employed to locate and quantify the severity of damage by defining a damage indicator regarding e g the reduction in stiffness of each individual structural element ren and roeck 2002 kim et al 2003 the development of constrained optimization models for model updating has gained much attention feng et al 2006 bakir et al 2007 in addition to the measurement of modal parameters of structures using sensor systems for model updating there are also studies which use measured global static responses of structures to identify structural damage by model updating techniques seyedpoor and yazdanpanah 2014 he and hwang 2007 besides the small unmanned aircraft system uas equipped with high quality cameras has been widely used for structural condition assessment this technique allows for the extraction of structural geometry e g cross section geometry structural displacement based on point cloud analysis morgenthal et al 2019a however research related to the application of these techniques to identification of impact induced damages on bridge piers is quite limited the existing model updating strategies using either direct or indirect methods are based on certain assumptions e g the stiffness matrix of a damaged structural element is proportional to the original stiffness matrix of the undamaged element ren and roeck 2002 a uniform erosion in material properties applies to a whole structure feng et al 2006 whilst in reality the damage distribution in a structure may be rather irregular these assumptions may therefore deviate from realistic cases besides the existing model updating strategies cannot generate e g distributions of residual stresses and strains in a damaged structure which are useful information for further predicting the responses of a damaged structure under the action of various post damage loading conditions this paper thus aims to develop effective strategies which allow for a full quantification of the state of damaged structures to the fiber level based on measured quantities e g structural displacements modal parameters and apply such strategies to the identification of damage on rc pier columns induced by vessel collisions two different strategies i e the direct identification method dim which assumes that the information of loading which causes structural damage is not known and the indirect identification method idim which assumes that the loading causing structural damage is known to be generated by certain scenarios e g impact are proposed in this paper to identify the damage of civil structures as barges are one of the main types of vessels in navigation waterways and rc columns are generally the main load bearing elements for many civil structures e g bridges frame buildings this paper focuses on the investigation of a single rc column subjected to barge impact loading an exact deformation analysis is conducted first in this paper using the coupled multi degree of freedom model cmm previously developed and validated by the authors wang and morgenthal 2017 for non linear dynamic analysis of rc pier columns subjected to barge impact the dim is then developed based on a constrained optimization model which uses measured structural displacements and modal parameters to identify the most basic output data which can be used to fully determine the state quantities of a damaged rc column e g distribution of residual stresses and strains deformed shape and structural stiffness via the fiber based formulations developed in this paper the identified basic output data are compared with the benchmark data generated from the exact deformation analysis using cmm in addition the idim is proposed to identify the impact force time history based on measured structural displacements to reduce the number of structural quantities which shall be measured an idealization of the deformed shape of the rc column is conducted in this paper using a continuous curve which satisfies the boundary conditions and requires only the measurement of column top displacement and by coupling this strategy with the proposed idim a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of the measuring error in column top displacement on the identified impact force time history 2 numerical analysis of barge column impact in this section numerical analyses are conducted using the previously developed cmm to determine the dynamic responses of an rc column subjected to a given barge impact scenario the numerical results generated in this section are used as exact reference output data for assessing the prediction quality of the damage identification strategies proposed in this paper 2 1 information of rc column the rc column with a cross section of 2 134 m 2 134 m and concrete cover depth of 50 0 mm is considered here the column is 15 0 m in height the diameter of the longitudinal reinforcement rebars is taken to be 30 0 mm whilst the diameter of the stirrups is taken to be 20 0 mm the longitudinal reinforcement rebars are spaced at 0 25 m along the four sides of the column cross section and the stirrups are spaced at 0 25 m along the column height the superstructure mass is taken to be 500 0 ton the column bottom is totally fixed whilst the rotational dofs at column top are assumed to be constrained the configuration of the rc column and the layout of reinforcements are shown in fig 1 the geometric parameters regarding the rc column is tabulated in table 1 whilst the material parameters are tabulated in table 2 a fully loaded barge 1723 7 ton in weight with a head on impact velocity of 2 0 m s is considered here the impact position is assumed to be in the middle of column height i e 7 5 m measured from the column bottom detailed descriptions of the barge model used here are provided in ref wang and morgenthal 2018 2 2 methods for numerical analysis the fiber based method is employed here for non linear dynamic analysis of the rc column subjected to barge impact this method can effectively account for the plasticity distribution as well as axial flexural deformation interaction at section level by assigning section fibers with realistic uni axial stress strain relationships as shown in fig 2 the concrete and reinforcements are assumed to be perfectly bonded torsion effects are totally ignored and all sections are assumed to remain plane and perpendicular to the central axis the step by step time history analysis is conducted using the previously developed cmm wang and morgenthal 2017 to determine the dynamic responses of the rc column subjected to the given barge impact scenario 2 3 material models 2 3 1 stress strain relationship of concrete the uni axial stress strain relationship of concrete proposed by scott et al 1982 is used here this model modifies the stress strain relationship of concrete considering the influence of confinement for low strain rate cases the maximum stress of concrete k f c is attained at a strain of k ε 0 ε 0 0 002 which is the yielding strain of unconfined concrete in which f c is the concrete compressive cylinder strength mpa and k is the enhancement factor dependent on hoop reinforcement 1 k 1 r s f y h s f c where r s is the ratio of hoop reinforcement volume to the volume of concrete core measured to outside of the hoops and f y h s is the yielding stress of hoop mpa the stress strain relationship of concrete in compression is described as the following 2 σ c k f c 2 ε c k ε 0 ε c k ε 0 2 ε c k ε 0 k f c 1 z m ε c k ε 0 0 2 k f c ε c k ε 0 where ε c and σ c are the longitudinal strain and stress mpa in concrete respectively z m is calculated by 3 z m 0 5 3 0 29 f c 145 f c 1000 3 4 r s w s h k ε 0 where w is the width of concrete core measured to outside of the peripheral hoop m s h is the center to center spacing of hoop sets m the maximum available concrete compressive strain is taken as scott et al 1982 4 ε u ε u 0 0 9 r s f y h s 300 where ε u 0 is the maximum available compressive strain of unconfined concrete which equals to 0 004 the unloading properties of concrete proposed by taucer et al 1991 is used here it is suggested that the unloading takes place in a straight line with a slope of e c u calculated by 5 e c u σ r ε r ε p where ε r and σ r are the strain and stress on the envelop stress strain curve where unloading occurs ε p is the residual plastic strain calculated by 6 ε p k ε 0 0 145 ε r k ε 0 2 0 130 ε r k ε 0 ε r k ε u 0 k ε 0 0 707 ε r k ε 0 2 0 834 ε r k ε u 0 the stress strain relationship and unloading properties of concrete are shown in fig 3 the tensile strength of the concrete is neglected in the model as the tensile strength of an rc section is mainly contributed by the reinforcement rebars 2 3 2 stress strain relationship of reinforcement the bi linear stress strain relationship is adopted here for the reinforcement steel as shown in fig 4 the unloading slope is assumed to be e s which is the elastic modulus of the reinforcement steel 2 4 numerical results the number of gauss integration points gip n g i p in each fiber beam element and the total number of fiber beam elements n e l e shall be determined first before detailed numerical analysis can be conducted here detailed convergence tests are conducted to provide standard cases for comparison purposes a baseline case is considered where n g i p 2 and n e l e 6 two sets of numerical simulations are conducted each set of simulations include the baseline simulation and the simulations in which only one parameter is changed as the adoption of one gip in each fiber beam element would result in numerical instability and often lead to poor numerical performance feng and jun 2018 wu 2013 the minimum value of n g i p is taken to be 2 here three values i e 2 3 and 4 are considered for n g i p whilst 5 values i e 2 4 6 8 10 are considered for n e l e the time history of displacement at the column top is chosen here to investigate the sensitivity of output quantities to the values of n g i p and n e l e the results are plotted in fig 5 which shows that an increase in n g i p only has negligible effects on the numerical result which converges when the value of n e l e reaches 6 as a result two gips are used in each fiber beam element with their locations described in fig 2 whilst 6 fiber beam elements each of which is 2 5 m in length are used to discretize the rc column as shown in fig 6 where the cmm using a non linear mass spring model to replicate the complex barge model is illustrated each lumped column mass has three degrees of freedom dof i e one lateral displacement one axial displacement and one rotation angle as depicted in fig 6 where the locations of two gips on each fiber beam element are also provided the lumped column masses are numbered from 1 to 7 the fiber beam elements are numbered from 1 to 6 and the gips are numbered from 1 to 12 counting from the bottom of the rc column the time history of impact force f acting on the rc column is shown in fig 7 the impact force reaches the peak value of 14 03 mn after 0 014 s of impact and the duration of impact force is 0 76 s after which the rc column starts the free vibration process the time history of displacement at the top of rc column μ t during impact is shown in fig 8 the column top displacement reaches the maximum value of 0 84 m after 1 02 s of impact it can be seen from fig 8 that the column top displacement roughly keeps constant after 2 0 s of impact with a residual value of 0 72 m at time of 6 0 s after which the column displacement and deformation are considered to keep stable without significant oscillations to demonstrate the deformation process of the rc column during barge impact the time histories of section curvatures κ at the location of lumped column masses as shown in fig 6 are plotted in fig 9 which shows that all section curvatures roughly keep constant after around 2 0 s of barge impact fig 10 shows the initial shape and the deformed shapes of the rc column after 1 0 s 3 5 s and 6 0 s of barge impact respectively where the distributions of bending moment at corresponding time steps and the distribution of maximum bending moment are also provided it can be seen that the maximum bending moments occur at the column bottom column top and impact position to quantify the damage of an rc section the degree of plasticity denoted as ξ p is defined based on the reduction of bending stiffness of the section the value of ξ p for a given rc section varies between 0 0 no damage and 1 0 complete damage and is calculated by the following equation 7 ξ p k b 0 k b k b 0 where k b 0 is the initial bending stiffness of the rc section before damage mn m2 and k b is the bending stiffness mn m2 of the post damage rc section note that the section bending stiffness defined here denotes the increase of section bending moment with the increase of a unit section curvature and is calculated by the following equation 8 k b i 1 n f e t a n i z i 2 a i where e t a n i z i and a i are the tangent modulus z coordinate and area of the i th section fiber respectively n f is the total number of section fibers both z i and a i are geometric parameters which are constant over time whilst e t a n i is time dependent based on the loading and unloading history of the fiber the initial elastic modulus of each section fiber is used here to calculate k b 0 based on eq 8 based on eq 7 the degree of plasticity along the height of the rc column after barge impact is quantified and plotted in fig 11 the result shows that the rc column experiences the largest degree of plasticity at the impact position column bottom and column top where the largest bending moments occur as shown in fig 10 3 damage identification of rc column in this section two different strategies are proposed for damage identification of rc columns the first one is defined as direct identification method which assumes that the information of loading causing the structural damage is completely unknown and a constrained optimization model is developed to directly identify the damage of rc columns based on measured structural displacements and modal parameters the second one is defined as indirect identification method which assumes that the information of loading causing the structural damage is known and another optimization model is developed to identify the impact force time history based on measured column displacements the prediction quality of the proposed strategies is assessed using the benchmark output data obtained from the numerical analysis in the previous section 3 1 direct identification method to quantify the state of a damaged rc column without prior information of the loading process it is necessary to clarify the basic output parameters based on which the state parameters e g stress and strain distribution structural displacements structural stiffness can be fully determined in this section the fiber based formulations and a constrained optimization model are developed to quantify the basic output parameters based on measured structural quantities and a validation of the proposed strategies is conducted using benchmark output data generated in section 2 3 1 1 clarification of basic output parameters for a given fiber beam element the number index of which is denoted as i i 1 2 6 if the curvatures κ 2 i 1 κ 2 i and uni axial central fiber strains ε c 2 i 1 ε c 2 i of two gips are provided as shown in fig 12 the axial displacement μ n i 1 on node i 1 can be determined by gauss integration with the following equation where w j j 1 2 is the weighting factor and both w 1 and w 2 equal to 0 5 μ n i is the axial displacement on node i the lateral displacement μ i 1 and rotation θ i 1 on node i 1 can be determined using shape functions as μ i θ i κ 2 i 1 and κ 2 i are assumed to be known a three order polynomial shape function can be used 10 μ x k 1 4 c k x k 1 where x 0 x l is the x coordinate of the point on the fiber beam element using the known parameters i e μ 0 μ i μ 0 θ i μ x 1 κ 2 i 1 and μ x 2 κ 2 i the values of c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 can be derived as follows 11 c k μ i k 1 θ i k 2 x 2 κ 2 i 1 x 1 κ 2 i 2 x 2 x 1 k 3 κ 2 i 1 κ 2 i 6 x 2 x 1 k 4 substituting the coefficients into eq 10 the shape function can be expressed as follows 12 μ x x 3 3 x 2 x 2 6 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i 1 x 3 3 x 1 x 2 6 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i x θ i μ i using eq 12 the lateral displacement μ i 1 and rotation angle θ i 1 on node i 1 can be calculated as follows 13 μ i 1 l 3 3 x 2 l 2 6 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i 1 l 3 3 x 1 l 2 6 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i θ i l μ i 14 θ i 1 l 2 2 x 2 l 2 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i 1 l 2 3 x 1 l 2 x 2 x 1 κ 2 i θ i for the rc column considered here the bottom of the 1st fiber beam element is totally fixed as shown in fig 6 we have μ 1 0 μ n 1 0 and θ 1 0 using eqs 9 13 and 14 the values of μ 2 μ n 2 and θ 2 can be calculated until the nodal displacements and nodal rotations of all nodes are determined based on the assumptions in section 2 1 when the curvature and uni axial strain of the central fiber of an rc section are provided the distribution of true fiber strains can be generated when additionally the distribution of plastic fiber strains of the section is provided the distribution of fiber stresses and tangent fiber stiffness can be determined based on the uni axial stress strain relationships of section fibers shown in figs 3 and 4 and the internal section forces and section stiffness can be generated by integration of fiber stresses and tangent fiber stiffness respectively the stiffness of a fiber beam element k e can be obtained by integration of section stiffness described as follows taucer et al 1991 15 k e t t 0 l b t x k 1 x b x d x 1 t where k x is the stiffness of section at location x b x is the interpolation function and t is the transformation matrix expressed as follows wang and morgenthal 2017 b x 0 x l 1 x l 1 0 0 t 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 l 1 l 0 0 1 0 1 l 1 l 0 0 0 1 the stiffness of sections located at two gips can be used to obtain the element stiffness using eq 15 it can thus be concluded based on the study in this section that when the basic output parameters i e curvatures uni axial central fiber strains and distributions of plastic fiber strains of all rc sections located at gips are provided the state of a damaged rc column can be fully determined to validate the methodology proposed in this section the lateral displacements μ axial displacements μ n and rotation angles θ of the 7 lumped column masses depicted in fig 6 at time of 6 0 s are calculated based on the basic output parameters determined in section 2 4 and are compared with the ones directly determined by cmm using step by step time history analysis as shown in fig 13 where i m denotes the number index of a lumped column mass it can be seen that the results generated by the proposed methodology match the benchmark results with negligible errors 3 1 2 quantification of basic output parameters the studies in section 3 1 1 have shown that the state of a damaged rc column can be fully quantified when the basic output parameters are obtained in practical engineering such basic output parameters cannot be directly measured and shall be determined based on certain strategies using measured structural quantities e g structural displacements modal parameters the deformed shape of a damaged rc column can be readily measured using e g the unmanned aircraft system uas equipped with high quality cameras as demonstrated in the work of morgenthal et al 2019b the curvatures of the two sections located at gips in the i th fiber beam element i e κ 2 i 1 and κ 2 i can be calculated using the three order shape function determined by the two lateral nodal displacements i e μ i and μ i 1 and two nodal rotations i e θ i and θ i 1 see fig 12 16 κ 2 i 1 12 x 1 6 l μ i μ i 1 l 3 6 x 1 4 l l 2 θ i 6 x 1 2 l l 2 θ i 1 17 κ 2 i 12 x 2 6 l μ i μ i 1 l 3 6 x 2 4 l l 2 θ i 6 x 2 2 l l 2 θ i 1 based on eq 9 ε c 2 i 1 and ε c 2 i shall satisfy the following equation 18 ε c 2 i u n i 1 u n i w 1 ε c 2 i 1 l w 2 l for a given fiber beam element e g the i th element the value of ε c 2 i 1 can be effectively determined based on the realistic deformed shape of a damaged rc column this paper will not discuss the detailed method to determine the value of ε c 2 i 1 but rather assume that it is already known for each fiber beam element an optimization model shall be developed to determine the distribution of plastic fiber strains at two sections located at the gips the objective of this optimization model is to minimize the error between the calculated modal parameters e g natural frequencies and the ones measured by e g structural health monitoring shm technique it is noteworthy that this paper assumes that the deformed shape and modal parameters of a damaged rc column are already known and does not involve practical field measurement of these data however due to the large amount of fibers in each section the number of optimization parameters will consequently be very large to reduce the number of optimization parameters linear functions are used to compute the plastic strain of each section fiber in terms of its coordinates as the head on impact scenario considered here is symmetrical with an impact velocity along the direction of z axis the distribution of plastic fiber strains ε p will be symmetrical about z axis see fig 2 the functions are thus expressed as follows 19 ε p z k 1 2 c c o n c k z w p k 1 concrete fibers k 1 2 c r e i n k z w p k 1 reinforcement fibers where w p is the width of cross section along z axis see fig 2 the measured natural frequencies and mode shapes of the damaged rc column are used as the target goal and the optimization parameters are the coefficients introduced in eq 19 for all sections located at gips the total number of optimization parameters is thus 8 n e l e where n e l e is the number of fiber beam elements the optimization model is described as follows minimize 20 e f i 1 n f ω c a l i ω r e f i ω r e f i i 1 n f j 1 n f φ c a l i j φ r e f i j φ r e f i j where n f is the total number of natural frequencies ω r e f i and ω c a l i are the i th measured and calculated natural frequency respectively φ r e f i j and φ c a l i j are the measured and calculated value of the element located at the i th row and j th column of the mode shape matrix as the internal forces in the damaged rc column shall be self balanced the proposed optimization model shall satisfy the following constraints 21 f i t f i 1 b f i i 0 0 f n i t f n i 1 b f i n i 0 0 m i t m i 1 b 0 0 the forces defined in eq 21 corresponding to the i th lumped column mass are illustrated in fig 14 where f i t and f i 1 b are two shear forces f n i t and f n i 1 b are two axial forces f i i and f i n i are the inertial forces due to free vibration in the lateral direction and axial direction respectively m i t and m i 1 b are two bending moments the superscript t and b denotes the top section and bottom section of a fiber beam element respectively as the objective function described in eq 20 is highly non linear with an unpredictable number of local minimums the global particle swarm method zhang and wang 2015 is employed in this paper for solving the proposed optimization problem however this method is limited to unconstrained optimization problems the following objective function transforms the proposed constrained optimization model into an unconstrained one minimize 22 e e f e b where e b is calculated by the following equation based on eq 21 23 e b e b 1 e b 2 e b 3 where e b 1 e b 2 and e b 3 are calculated by 24 e b 1 i 1 n e l e f i t f i 1 b f i i f i t f i 1 b e b 2 i 1 n e l e f n i t f n i 1 b f i n i f n i t f n i 1 b e b 3 i 1 n e l e m i t m i 1 b m i t m i 1 b 3 1 3 application example the state of the damaged rc column at time of 6 0 s analyzed in section 2 4 is employed for the analysis the lateral displacements axial displacements and rotation angles of the 7 lumped column masses are tabulated in table 3 whilst the uni axial central fiber strain at the 1st gip of each fiber beam element are tabulated in table 4 where i g i g 1 2 12 denotes the number index of gip the values of 12 natural frequencies generated from the 12 12 tangent stiffness of the damaged rc column at time of 6 0 s are tabulated in table 5 using eqs 16 and 17 the curvatures κ c a l c of sections located at the 12 gips counted from column bottom to column top are calculated whilst the uni axial central fiber strains ε c c a l c at the 2nd gip of each fiber beam element can be determined using eq 18 the calculated results are compared with the reference ones κ r e f and ε c r e f directly generated by cmm as shown in tables 6 and 7 respectively where the relative errors e r e l are also presented the results indicate that the proposed strategy can accurately predict the section curvatures and uni axial central fiber strains at gips should the deformed shape of the damaged rc column can be accurately measured as the largest bending moment tends to occur at the impact position the bottom and the top of the rc column as shown in fig 10 the distributions of true fiber strains at the 12th 7th 6th and 1st gip are shown in fig 15 where the calculated results are compared with the reference results it can be seen that the distribution of true strains at the sections can be very accurately predicted by the proposed strategy the proposed optimization model is used to determine the distribution of plastic fiber strains at gips based on the modal parameters of the damaged rc column the natural frequencies ω c a l determined by the optimization model and the reference ones ω r e f are tabulated in table 8 where the relative errors e r e l are also provided it is shown that the identified natural frequencies match the reference ones very well a contour plot is drawn to show the distribution of relative errors between the elements in the mode shape matrix determined by the optimization model and the elements in the reference one as shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the error is generally large for high modes as they are more sensitive to structural damage the distributions of plastic fiber strains at the 12th 7th 6th and 1st gip where the maximum bending moments occur are shown in fig 17 where the optimum results are compared with the reference results it can be seen that for the 1st and 12th gip the proposed optimization model provides an accurate prediction of plastic strains of steel fibers for the 6th and 7th gip the optimum results corresponding to the steel fibers deviate from the reference results as the distribution of plastic strains of steel fibers does not actually show a linear trend it can also be seen that for concrete fibers the optimum results deviate from the reference results as the distribution of plastic strains of concrete fibers does not show a linear trend however the magnitudes of plastic strains of concrete fibers determined by the optimization model are in good agreement with the reference ones 3 2 indirect identification method assuming that the loading which causes the damage to the rc column is known to be generated by barge impact and the impact position is known and only the deformed shape of the rc column after barge impact is measured it would be possible to determine the impact force time history so that the predicted deformed shape of the rc column after barge impact matches the measured one as closely as possible in this section an optimization model is developed to identify the impact force time history based on the measured structural displacements to reduce the number of parameters which shall be measured several different types of continuous curves satisfying the boundary conditions are proposed to idealize the deformed shape of the rc column based on the measured column top displacement a sensitivity analysis is then conducted to investigate the influence of measuring error in column top displacement on the identified impact force time history 3 2 1 using exact deformed shape of rc column the shape of the force time history curve generated by barge impact generally includes an abrupt increase until a peak value very shortly after impact followed by a rapid decrease until the force plateaus after which unloading occurs as substantially investigated in previous studies wang and morgenthal 2017 2018 and shown in fig 7 the shape of an impact force time history curve can thus be idealized as several linear segments as shown in fig 18 an optimization model is developed here to generate the impact force time history based on measured column displacements the parameters which need to be optimized include t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 f 1 f 2 and f 3 whilst the objective function is expressed as follows minimize 25 e d e d 1 e d 2 e d 3 where 26 e d 1 i 2 n m μ c a l i μ r e f i μ r e f i 27 e d 2 i 2 n m μ n c a l i μ n r e f i μ n r e f i 28 e d 3 i 2 n m 1 θ c a l i θ r e f i θ r e f i where n m is the number of lumped column masses μ c a l i and μ r e f i are the calculated and measured lateral displacement respectively of the i th lumped column mass μ n c a l i and μ n r e f i are the calculated and measured axial displacement respectively of the i th lumped column mass and θ c a l i and θ r e f i are the calculated and measured rotation respectively of the i th lumped column mass the nelder mead simplex method lagarias et al 1998 is used to solve this optimization problem this method can be used for unconstrained optimization problems with direct search method the initial values of optimization parameters are chosen and the optimum parameter set is found very robustly as confirmed by detailed checks assuming that the column displacements are accurately measured i e the measured column displacements equal to the reference lateral displacements axial displacements and rotations of lumped column masses tabulated in table 3 the optimum set of parameters i e t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 f 1 f 2 and f 3 generated by the proposed optimization model are tabulated in table 9 a comparison of the optimum impact force time history and the reference one is shown in fig 19 which shows that the impact force time history can be very well predicted by the proposed optimization model if the column displacements can be accurately measured besides a comparison of the calculated and reference column displacements is shown in table 10 where the relative errors are also provided it can be seen that the calculated column displacements based on the proposed optimization model match the reference results with high accuracy a comparison of the calculated and the reference results of the distribution of plastic strains at the 12th 7th 6th and 1st gips where the maximum bending moments occur are shown in fig 20 which shows that the calculated results based on the proposed optimization model match the reference results very well 3 2 2 using idealized deformed shape of rc column however it would be challenging in practical engineering to accurately measure the lateral displacements axial displacements and rotation angles at different locations of a damaged rc column to facilitate practical engineering application it would be beneficial if the least amount of data is required to be measured for the rc column considered in this paper the deformed column shape may be idealized as a continuous curve which satisfies the boundary conditions i e fixed at the bottom and zero rotation angle at the top four types of curves are considered here three order polynomial curve trigonometric curve parametrized curve and logistic curve as shown in fig 21 assuming that the column top displacement μ t is measured using the boundary conditions i e μ 0 0 θ 0 0 μ h μ t θ h 0 where h is the height of the column the lateral displacement μ and rotation angle θ along the column height can be expressed as follows three order polynomial curve 29 μ x 2 μ t h 3 x 3 3 μ t h 2 x 2 30 θ x 6 μ t h 3 x 2 6 μ

36 θ x 2 c h e 2 c h x c 1 μ t e 2 c h x c 2 where c is a positive constant the value of which approaches infinite to satisfy the boundary conditions in this study the value of c is taken to be 10 0 and the boundary conditions can already be well satisfied the axial displacements of the column are not accounted for and thus the objective function of the optimization model becomes minimize 37 e d e d 1 e d 3 assuming that the column top displacement is accurately measured i e μ t 0 727 m the optimum sets of parameters corresponding to the four idealized deformed shapes of column are tabulated in table 11 the optimum impact force time histories in comparison to the reference one are shown in fig 22 it can be seen that the three order polynomial curve and the trigonometric curve enable a relatively accurate prediction of the impact force time history whilst the other two idealized deformed shapes lead to an inaccurate prediction this is because the realistic deformed shape of column can be much better approximated by the three order polynomial curve and the trigonometric curve as shown in fig 23 the results indicate that it is possible to identify the impact force time history with sufficient accuracy based on an accurately measured column top displacement if a suitable continuous curve is used to approximate the deformed shape of the rc column to investigate the influence of measuring error in column top displacement on the prediction of impact force time history the three order polynomial curve is used here to idealize the deformed shape of column with consideration of several different measured column top displacements the ratio of the measured column top displacement to the reference one 0 727 m is defined as r μ and several different values of r μ i e 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 and 1 8 are considered here as shown in fig 24 the optimum impact force time histories corresponding to different values of r μ are plotted in fig 25 where the reference impact force time history is also plotted it can be observed that the peak impact force is not that much influenced by the measured column top displacement as this force peak lasts very shortly and a large increase or decrease in column displacement does not necessarily lead to a significant change of this force peak the main difference in the force time histories lies in the magnitudes of force plateaus which are the main factor that influences the column displacement since this force plateau lasts relatively long as can be seen in fig 25 it is also noticeable that an increase in the force plateau often leads to a much larger increase in the column displacement this is because the column has significant plastic deformation for the cases considered here and hence a small increase in impact force could possibly lead to a significant increase in column displacement an additional optimization model is developed here using the same objective function described in eq 37 to identify the optimum set of barge mass m b and impact velocity v b so that the deformed shape of the rc column predicted by cmm match the three order polynomial curve with a given measured column top displacement as closely as possible for the several measured column top displacements considered above the optimum sets of barge mass and impact velocity are tabulated in table 12 where the identified barge kinetic energy e o p t and the ratio of e o p t to the reference barge kinetic energy e r e f are also provided it is assumed here that the barge mass varies between 181 4 ton weight of empty barge and 1723 7 ton weight of fully loaded barge and barge impact velocity varies between 0 1 m s and the maximum velocity of 3 09 m s as per ref yuan 2005 the results show that when the column top displacement is accurately measured i e r u 1 0 the optimum set of barge mass and impact velocity matches the reference barge mass of 1723 7 ton and reference impact velocity of 2 0 m s very well however with the increase of measuring error in column top displacement the identified barge mass and impact velocity start to deviate from the reference ones with an increasing prediction error it can also be observed that with the increase of r μ the predicted barge kinetic energy increases accordingly 4 summary and conclusions this paper numerically analyzed the deformation process of an rc column subjected to a given barge impact scenario using the previously developed coupled multi degree of freedom model cmm it is found that the regions around the bottom impact position and top of the rc column experience the largest degree of damage after barge impact due to the occurrence of large bending moments in these regions the direct identification method based on measured column displacements and modal parameters is proposed to identify the basic output parameters which can be used to fully quantify the state of a damaged rc column with fiber based formulations a comparison to the reference output parameters found that the proposed strategy can very reasonably quantify the state of a damaged rc column without prior information of the loading which caused column damage as an alternative approach the indirect identification method is proposed to determine the time history of impact force based on measured column displacements this method requires prior information on the type of loading which caused column damage but it does not require the measurement of modal parameters of the damaged rc column the study found that if the column displacements are accurately measured the proposed strategy can very accurately identify the impact force time history besides several different types of continuous curves are proposed based on the boundary conditions and column top displacement to idealize the deformed shape of the damaged rc column enabling the implementation of the proposed indirect identification method with only one measured structural quantity i e the column top displacement the results indicate that the three order polynomial curve and the trigonometric curve allow for a reasonable identification of impact force time history if the column top displacement is accurately measured and the plateau of the identified impact force time history is very sensitive to the measured column top displacement which is not influential upon the force peak the proposed strategy is also found to be able to reasonably identify the barge mass and impact velocity based on measured column top displacement however this paper only demonstrated the application of the proposed strategies to the damage identification of a single rc column subjected to barge impact their applications to large scale rc frame structures subjected to various other loading conditions e g blast earthquake require further investigations in future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
21543,this paper represents the state of the art in the field of ice tank numerical simulation methods it gives a comprehensive review of existing commercial and prototype numerical methods in the ship ice interaction including aspects such as features capabilities and presents a discussion in terms of their characteristics the numerical simulation techniques are categorized as discrete element method finite element method cohesive element method smoothed particle hydrodynamics method peridynamics method lattice boltzmann method and some coupled models of these methods mainly depending on what the numerical methods are implemented to simulate the behavior of ice one purpose is to classify the chosen methods and evaluate their efficiency and accuracy and to enable potential readers to quickly grasp the main numerical methods and the development of their applications in the ship ice interaction scenarios we assess their practicability and validity from both perspectives of practice and physics and discuss challenges in existing numerical simulation methods we highlight the significance of interdisciplinary applications for developing the research in fluid structure interactions instead of elaborating on the numerical simulation techniques theoretically their applications in ship ice interaction scenarios are focused and presented keywords numerical simulation numerical ice tank ice loads ice going vessels ship ice interaction 1 introduction due to the shrinkage of ice cover there is an increasing interest in shipping activities in the arctic and antarctica which will also increase the demand for ice going vessels in these waters tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 xue and liu 2019 simulating the process of the ship ice interaction can be rather complex with large deformation and displacement of hulls fracture and fragmentation forming of ice as well as the motions of the ice fragments must be taken into consideration to optimize the design of ice going vessels the numerical method is necessary because of the high cost and long period of model tests although the complete data on ice loads is rather precious there are still limitations generally the range of parameters is very narrow and on some occasions it is difficult to obtain the definite data on the ice properties such as thickness strength and friction therefore to some extent it is difficult to figure out how the parameters influence ice loads by handling the full scale data a candidate data can be obtained with numerical simulations of ship ice interaction in a statistical study based on simulation all the parameters used are straightforward and can be adjusted in correspondence with requirements it is not difficult to do simulations where the parameters only change slightly and obtain the results on how sensitive the process can be to the changes in parameters ranta et al 2017 in most scenarios of ship ice interaction the nonlinearity could not be neglected due to the complex mechanical behavior of ice such as the elastoplastic deformation strain rate dependent properties fracture and friction generated among the ice fragments timco and weeks 2010 kuutti et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 1 the nonlinearities of the structure may further contribute to the complication konuk et al 2009a studies on ice constitutive model from the range of ductility to brittleness were started a few decades ago derradji aouat 2003 kolari et al 2007 as the most scenarios of ship ice interaction occur in a high range of interacting speed it means the elastic brittle failure of ice is dominant and the ductility and plasticity are neglect two main methods are adopted to investigate the ice constitutive model continuum methods such as the finite element method fem finite difference method fdm and particle in cell pic method particle methods such as the discrete element method dem the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method and peridynamics pd the advantages of fem are its robust theoretical support for simulating contact collision deformation damage etc which are focus of the interaction between the hull and the ice kuutti et al 2013 liu et al 2011b the particle method such as dem can well model and analyze the dynamic characteristics of floating ice and crushed ice with discrete characteristics and the navigation process of ships in the field of floating ice and small ice blocks yulmetov and løset 2017 yulmetov et al 2016 fem has been commonly used to simulate local ice pressure and global ice loads in ice fields such as level ice ice ridge and iceberg aksnes 2010 su et al 2011a sayed et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 however to describe the icebreaking characteristics in the process of ship ice interaction the advantages of dem are prominent dem can describe the discreteness of ice structure on the micro scale and simulate the ice fracture in the process of ship ice interaction on the macro scale which shows the inherent superiority in the estimation of ice load shen et al 1987 lepparanta et al 1990 hansen and løset 1999b a in most numerical models the fluid was simply treated as elastic foundations with constant hydrodynamic coefficients lubbad et al 2008 for more details of the fluid including hydrodynamic effects under the same numerical set up see lu et al 2012a studies on the hydrodynamic coupling between ship and ice and the coupling between floater and ice rubble were conducted and compared with the model test in a wave tank tsarau et al 2013 2014 mintu et al 2018 however the influence of the surface waves was not considered the numerical model and software platform based on computational fluid dynamics cfd is a promising candidate tool to capture the details of fluid but it leads to extreme computing time and highly depends on the physical hardware some applications based on this see refs gagnon 2007 and gagnon and wang 2012 investigated the collision characteristics between an iceberg and a loaded tanker a common weakness of the above models is most of them with a high computational cost which leads to difficulty in real time engineering applications fortunately a computational platform known as the physical engine satisfies the real time practical simulation physical engine is a software system specially used for fast physics correlated calculations such as rigid body dynamics the integration performance and contact detection accuracy of four common physical engines were compared including agx multiphysics open dynamics engine physx and vortex metrikin et al 2012 when it is applied in computer games speed may be considered prior to precision however it has been proved that physical engines can successfully describe the behavior of granular materials pytlos et al 2015 this largely promotes the validation and application of physical engines in ship ice interaction the real time simulation of ship navigation can be applied to sailors training and offshore operation preparation as one of these simulations general computing models based on physical engine and graphics processing unit gpu were introduced daley et al 2014 alawneh et al 2015 another effective scheme to simulate the ship ice interaction is to decide the geometry of the broken ice formed by bending failure with numerical computation store the calculation results in the database and then use the database to simulate the ship ice interaction sawamura 2012 however this strategy has a drawback that the fracture patterns preset in the database can be insufficient this paper reviews numerical simulation methods of the ship ice interaction the engineering application scenarios are significantly introduced and some representative figures are presented according to different methods i e the discrete element method dem finite element method fem cohesive element method cem the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method sph peridynamics method pd the lattice boltzmann method lbm and some derivative models coupled with these methods the paper begins with an introduction to the numerical simulation techniques in ship ice interaction then different numerical approaches and analyses on some details are given then a discussion about the selected numerical methods is presented and concludes with suggestions for the future 2 the discrete element method dem formulated by cundall 1971 and cundall and strack 1979 is especially useful when the discrete ice blocks play an important role tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 compared with other methods the dem features an advantage in calculating ice loads owing to its capability to depict the discreteness of ice on a micro scale and to reasonably model the phase of icebreaking during the ship ice interaction on a macro scale shen et al 1987 lepparanta et al 1990 hansen and løset 1999b a ji et al 2013 a comprehensive review studied ice structure interaction with emphasis on the lessons learned about the behavior of sea ice tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 different from that the current work focuses on the ship ice interaction four ice fields ice floe level ice ridges and iceberg ice will be discussed in this section to a certain extent other ship ice interaction scenarios can be studied by combining these four types 2 1 ice floe fields a relatively large part of the sea of our planet is scattered with broken ice made up of independent floes weeks 2010 recently ice floe fields have been considered appealing to us because a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of marginal ice zones is required moreover shipping business prefers sea regions with ice floes than pack ice the ship maneuvering performances turning circle and zig zag maneuvers were simulated with the ship maneuvering laboratory sml program and the dem model decice zhan et al 2010 sml is used to calculate ship hull hydrodynamics propulsion forces and rudder forces other topics including numerical modeling of ships in broken ice see zhan et al 2010 and lau and simões ré 2006 the work lau and simões ré 2006 defined practical performance measures for the totally enclosed motor propelled survival craft design in ice covered waters by experimentally investigating the hull s ice transiting resistance and its motions and validated a numerical model of lifeboat sail away a 3d expanded analysis on this topic was about a simulation of an arctic drill vessel interacting with pack ice ice concentration reached 90 to test ship s abilities of turning circle and zigzag maneuver zhan and molyneux 2013 more details about the ship maneuvering performances were investigated experimentally and numerically kim et al 2017 a moored ship in a floe field was simulated and the results gained just conform to experiments qualitatively hansen and løset 1999b a similar simulations were also conducted to compare the results karulin and karulina 2011 it was found that the differences presented were caused by the inherent limitation of 2d models and the neglect of the influence of hydrodynamics this is because when the concentration of the ice floes reached 79 the floe field compression changed from 2d drifting into 3d drifting and floe overturning thus unless it can be ensured that the floe concentration stays low the ice floe fields should be modeled in 3d much more 2d simulations have been conducted to study ships navigating in an ice floe field and the turning circle is showed to be smaller in a floe field than in open water according to the results zhan et al 2010 kim and sawamura 2016 exm004 is an integrated tug barge with twin azimuthing drives as its propulsion system and psm004 is a ferry with two conventional propellers as shown in fig 4 the turning circle in ice condition with ice concentration of 70 is smaller than that in open water one reason is that the ship s heading changed as the existence of ice however more ice concentration environments need to be conducted before obtaining a general conclusion the loads concerning the influence of ice floe follow a weibull distribution han and sawamura 2017 and the load on the turret mooring system increases with concentration karulin and karulina 2017 a study on the ice resistance for ship navigating in a brash ice channel found that the arrangement of ice pieces does not significantly affect the ship resistance but results suggested the importance of the size distribution of ice pieces konno 2009 konno et al 2011 before more cases need to be conducted we can guess that the ice load on a ship in the same ice concentration is dependent on the ice thickness ship s speed and independent on the redistribution of ice floes this conclusion can be verified by a series of experiments of a ship sailing in the field of unbreakable artificial ice floes see figs 2 5 3d processes like floe rafting and overturning however will affect the out of plane thickening which is the critical factor for deciding the horizontal strength of ice jam and ice floe field hopkins and tuhkuri 1999 mckenna et al 1997 3d dem was also adopted in simulations of ship interacting with ice floes lau et al 2011 vroegrijk 2012 ji et al 2013 in ref lau et al 2011 a ship maneuvering in ice floes the simulations from decice were compared with experimental data and found satisfactory in terms of accuracy and real time simulation capability and the simulation of a ship in an ice channel sorsimo et al 2014 in ref vroegrijk 2012 the practical application of the combined dem and cfd method to full scale problems showed the ability to simulate ice flows in nature and highlighted challenges encountered during post processing however the model would especially benefit from a validation study against full scale measured data sets in ref ji et al 2013 the pancake ice floes are modeled with 3 d dilated disk elements considering the buoyancy drag force and additional mass induced by the current the influences of ship maneuvering speeds and ice conditions current velocity and direction ice thicknesses floe sizes concentration on the global ice resistance were discussed the simulated results were compared qualitatively well with the existing field data and other numerical results the ice load increases with the increase of ship speed current velocity ice concentration and ice thickness but the influence of ice floe size is not obvious under constant concentration the results obtained are mainly about three aspects that is how the load generated by the influence of ice floes rises with the increase of ice concentration and ice thickness how the decrease of stiffness of mooring system correlates with the reducing of ice loads and how important the influence of wall constraints on the ice resistance is when the ice concentration exceeds 70 a novel non smooth discrete element model was adopted to perform a numerical multi body simulation of a series of model tests with a conceptual arctic drillship on dynamic positioning in managed ice using the commercial physics engine vortex to simulate the ice basin the dynamic positioning vessel the managed ice the surrounding fluid and their interactions metrikin et al 2013 a ship ice floes fluid coupling interaction was simulated embedding the dem within the framework of the star ccm software where fluid solutions are solved using the traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd model of a ship proceeding in open water and an array inject coupling method was used to simulate ice floes cover the water huang et al 2019a it shows that the total ship resistance is highly dictated by ship speed ice concentration and floe size more important it finds that the ship generated waves can reduce the ice resistance and the ice added resistance is more significant when the ship speed is relatively low in addition both ice concentration and ice floe size have a quasi linear relationship with the total ship resistance 2 2 ice ridges and rubble fields ice ridges are actually piles of ice blocks which are slender in shape and its thickness can reach tens of meters weeks 2010 rubble field is a general designation of the ice ridges field and the broad ridges the formation of the ice ridges mainly depends on the winds and currents to squeeze the ice sheet and break it up into blocks which pile up later pressure ridges are made up of ice fragments that are piled up in a line with the steep sloped ridge 5 to 10 ft or more above the adjacent level ice extension anon 2019 it is essential to understand the process of ridging and properties of ice ridges it has been found that the forces needed for ridging will constrain the global ice loads acting on marine structures and ridges causing high local ice loads should be seriously considered for shipping moreover the energy dissipates during the process of ridging which requires to be considered in large scale sea ice models see fig 6 in the early 2d dem simulations the ways of modeling ridges were to compress a layer of floating ice blocks hopkins and hibler 1991a or a layer of ice blocks laying on a frictionless surface evgin et al 1992 the significance of illustrating the angularity of ice blocks and that in the process of ridging energy actually dissipates much more than assumed were commonly demonstrated later the complete ice sheet was simulated and the process of breaking into discrete blocks has also been simulated hopkins et al 1999 hopkins 1994 hopkins and hibler 1991b the simulation results of ridge forming from thin lead ice compressed between two thick floes show that the energy dissipation declines with the rise of ice friction coefficient and increases with the increase of ice thickness hopkins 1994 in further studies the small scale results were upscaled to study pack ice dynamics hopkins 2004 1996 hopkins and thorndike 2006 and adopted to identify different phases of ridging process and the effects shown on ridging loads hopkins 1998 in fact only a part of ridges are formed by lead ice between thick ice floes and a part of ridges are formed by two ice sheets compressed together based on the model scale test tuhkuri and lensu 2002 the simulation of this process by 2d dem was verified and the parameters of whether ridging or drifting dominates the deformation of ice sheet were studied hopkins et al 1999 from these corresponding experiments and simulations it is found that rafting and ridging are not two independent physical processes rafting occurs before ridging which is considered to be the precursor of ridging a 3d study aiming at calculating the ice ridge resistance of a ship illustrated the correspondence between ridge width and resistance gong et al 2017 2019 the simulations were divided in two phases the ice rubble was piled up at the beginning and then the ship passed through the rubble the ice rubble was generated by releasing ice blocks underwater and by running the simulation till the viscous damping and frictional forces had run out of virtually all of the kinetic energy of the system polojärvi and tuhkuri 2009 see fig 7 rubble ice is a pile of crushed ice or small ice such as pancake ice which covers a wider area and is disordered compared with other ice types in antarctica the expansion of the ocean breaks down the newly formed ice and aggregates it into rubble ice sheets the surface characteristic height of rubble ice is often lower than that of ice ridge the scenarios on ship rubble ice is not yet available as an accurate representation of ice rubble is important in the modeling of ice ridges we introduce some representing investigations about rubble ice study on the shear box test of ice rubble model hopkins and hibler iii 1991 polojärvi et al 2015 study on the properties of rubble is the punch through test leppäranta and hakala 1992 karulin 2002 van den berg and lubbad 2015 polojärvi and tuhkuri 2009 2 3 ice sheets sheet ice is a region of ice with relatively uniform thickness also called level ice iso19906 2010 a 3d dem model of a floating plate was used to simulate the ship ice interaction which can fail along the element boundary or along a plane passing through the center of mass of the element to create a discrete element hocking 1992 with mohr coulomb failure criterion adopted in this model it prefers fractures through elements than fractures along element boundaries where fracture directions are set by the mesh hocking 1992 lawrence 2009 the model has been adopted in the simulation of ships turning in ice lau 2006 and the ice resistance of ships molyneux et al 2012b bonded particle models potyondy and cundall 2004 in which a solid is embodied by spheres bonded together have been applied to sea ice sheets jou et al 2019 which can be de bonded according to the bonding breaking criteria in this model the stiffness and strength of the spheres and the bonds correlate with the stiffness and strength of the ice sheet the size of the sphere has an influence on the mechanical behavior of the modeled ice sheet by simulating the bending and the compressive strength of the ice bonded particle models have been calibrated and applied to calculate ice resistance and local loads on ships ji 2016 although the implementation is quite simple the bonded particle models seem to require further development in order to better simulate particle rotation user specific counter torque is supplemented to the particles and the sliding of bonded particles is distinct from that of smooth particles which requires for adjustment morgan 2016 however the study showed that bonded particle models can give the ice loads similar to the theoretical di et al 2017 and experimental results feng et al 2015 the ice induced forces operating on the ship and the performance of a dynamically controlled vessel operating in level ice were also simulated lau et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 the numerical simulations conducted in this work include a 1 21 scale model of the canadian icebreaker terry fox advancing and turning in level ice conditions the physical experiments were carried out in the institute for ocean technology iot ice tank using a planar motion mechanism pmm analysis of the numerical results showed the effects of ice conditions and ship motions on the computed forces and moments comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data provided a validation of the numerical model see fig 8 3 dem coupling with sph most of the dem codes including decice molyneux et al 2012b and woo bailey dudley et al 2017 treat fluid water air as a static foundation molyneux et al 2012b a considering only the buoyancy and or approximating drag forces lubbad et al 2018 tsarau et al 2017 di et al 2017 yulmetov et al 2016 or simply neglecting them liu et al 2016 feng et al 2015 in the simulation these codes do not account for the dynamic effects of fluid structure interactions known as hydrodynamic effects added mass water drag wave damping some researchers integrated potential flow solvers in the dem code to predict the ice floe motion tsarau et al 2014 tsarau and løset 2015 huang et al 2019b the limitation of the potential flow method is that it assumes the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational however it was reported that viscosity plays an important role in floe kinematics bai et al 2017 the role of fluids water and air is necessary to investigate the influences of hydrodynamic forces on the ice interaction scenarios molyneux et al 2011 the importance of hydrodynamic effects in ship ice interaction has been reported by many researchers luo et al 2018 keijdener et al 2018 aarsæther et al 2018 strong hydrodynamic effects that are not possible to be captured accurately by approximation of drag forces are explained in refs yulmetov et al 2016 and alawneh et al 2016 in the scenario of pack ice simulations the significance of hydrodynamic effects was presented in the iceberg towing simulations hoving et al 2017 talimi et al 2016 some commercial codes can include the fluid water air in the simulations but the validation of those cases have not been reported for example a simplified ls dyna simulation for an ice ridge and a floating offshore structure interaction was studied in ref molyneux et al 2011 where the ice ridge was modeled by dem and the fluid domains water and air were defined by eulerian spaces to capture the free surface the buoyancy and the hydrodynamic characteristics the multi phase ls dyna simulation was implemented in ref millan and wang 2011 where it presented a preliminary pack ice ship simulation with no validation studies the sph formulated on computational fluid dynamics cfd is widely used in the fluid solid interaction coupling sph with the dem model considers the hydrodynamic effects nearby the interacting objects like the ice blocks in the coupled model the ice is modeled by dem which enables to calculate interacting forces according to contact laws the water foundation is modeled by smooth particles which are formulated with the naiver stokes equations mintu et al 2018 applications about these scenarios on fluid and solids interaction like the interaction between the fluid and solid computed using sph and interaction between blocks and the blocks and the tank walls computed using dem crespo et al 2011 an open source sph model named dualsphysics crespo et al 2011 originates from sphysics gómez gesteira et al 2010 which presents a coupled numerical solution to fluid solid interaction using dem and sph discretizations over a wide range of scales by virtue of the parallel power computing of graphics processing units gpus see fig 9 4 the finite element method as the fem is an alternative numerical technique for solving partial differential equations pde with approximate solutions by discretizing the whole computational domain into a series of subdomains with simple geometry named finite elements within the framework of the fem the pde problems can be transposed into a set of linear algebraic equations and some theoretical research such as contact problems wang et al 2008 matsui et al 2018 liu et al 2011b a scattering from layered sea ice with the action of multi frequency and multi incidence waves xu et al 2018 the finite element technique was adopted because of its superior mathematical robustness for model the constitutive model of rock like materials such as rate depended size depended models concerning numerical simulations of ship ice interaction the fem has been used widely to calculate local ice force and global ice load on the hull in the field of the ice ridge level ice and iceberg some researchers investigated the resistance of ice going vessels applying the fluid structure interaction fsi method during the process of the ship ice interactions and compared the results with those obtained by model scale ship tests performed in a towing tank covered with synthetic ice to analyze the practicability of the fem guo et al 2018 because the early fem cannot deal with the crack initiation and other failure behaviors all of the above referred investigations assumed that the maximum load to the structure occurred during the first instances of interaction to simulate the initial failure the erosion technique and sufficient mesh refinement were used to visualize initial failure in the continuum representation of the ice yu et al 2007 alternatively a transformation of state was introduced to change the constitutive properties of pack ice to that of broken ice rather than erode a distinct element however both approaches conflict with energy conservations sand and fransson 2008 as traditional fem may endure the mathematical stress singularity at the crack tip and the xfem method theoretically enables the simulation of arbitrary cracks within the framework of the xfem a heaviside enhancement term was introduced in the formulation to capture the displacement jump across the crack line belytschko and black 1999 moës et al 1999 and cracks allow to propagate through traditional finite elements based on enhancement functions which conversely generate a discontinuous displacement field several comprehensive reviews of this method are referred to karihaloo and xiao 2003 and abdelaziz and hamouine 2008 the ice failure is qualitatively investigated through full scale and model scale observations as well as a numerical simulation with xfem li et al 2020 and it found that the modulus gradient through thickness should not be simply neglected especially when the modulus at the top layer is over three times of the mean modulus the xfem was used to simulate a field test where an inclined landing craft bow impact on level ice in baltic sea xu et al 2020 and it found that the competition between the circumferential crack and the radial crack which is related with the impact speed and inclination of the landing craft bow the phenomena of ice sheet bending and deflection caused by a ship sailing in ice level were analyzed using fem based on euler and cantilever methods koto et al 2019 a realistic performance in both visual and theoretical aspects was developed based on the nonlinear finite element technique to demonstrate the complicated mechanical behavior of ice and to investigate the local ice forces and global ice loading on structures sand 2008 a one dimensional sea ice dynamics model was conducted accounting for the contribution of ice floe size wind and current to simulate the interaction of a vertically sided offshore structure and a drifting ice floe based on the nonlinear speed dependent brittle and ductile deformation and local crushing of ice phenomenologically hendrikse and nord 2019 to estimate the strain rate effects of ice on the process of ship ice interaction a strain rate dependent constitutive model that enables hardening behaviors and yield stress vary with strain rate was introduced to simulate the collision between ice and ship hull nho et al 2016 the fe analysis concerning fluid ice interaction was applied to study the dynamic effect of an ice plate bending failure on the ice breaking patterns of level ice sawamura et al 2009 the buoyancy effects of brash ice in water were investigated to estimate the resistance performance of a scaling model of the standard canadian icebreaker terry fox sailing in the brash ice field wang and derradji aouat 2010 although the numerical and analytical results were in relatively good agreement the results were not satisfactory in terms of the motion of ice pieces and the crack nucleation and propagation phenomenologically the potential factors leading to this according to them were the mesh dependency boundary effects the geometry of ice and rigid body kinematic mechanics see fig 10 to capture the ice abrasion characteristics as crashing of an ice floe against a structure the mixed eulerian lagrangian method of fem was proposed to simulate the bulbous bow ice interaction afrizal et al 2018 and the ice abrasion caused by unbreakable ice floes kim and kim 2017 2019 kim et al 2019 in these references ice floes were modeled with random distributions of shape size and thickness and an efficient numerical simulation technique for ice ice ice fluid and ice structure interactions was introduced to accelerate computation significant parameters were analyzed in detail such as the relationship of pressure and penetration and the drag force coefficient see fig 11 with the development of finite element software there are a lot of numerical applications by using the commercial software ls dyna for example numerical simulation of ship ice interaction using the fluid structure interaction fsi method wang and derradji aouat 2010 in this simulation the description and investigation of the ship ice contact is one of the significant challenges to investigate this an energy saving device of ice floes and the ice class ship was introduced to illuminate the characteristics of the structural response and ice force time history and the coupling effects between them matsui et al 2018 a user defined failure criterion embedded into ls dyna concerning the effect of the hydrostatic pressure the effective plastic strain and allow crack nucleation and damage evolution was introduced to the scenario of icebergs and the ice was considered to be isotropic strain rate dependent and temperature sensitive liu et al 2011b a 3d model concerning nonlinear viscoelasticity and shear stress and hydrostatic pressure dependent tsai wu type yield criterion was adopted xu et al 2019 in this scenario there are significant uncertainties about the properties of ice while crushing and interacting against a deformable structure like the hull of non ice going vessels the internal and external mechanics were explained for the characteristics of the fore ship and iceberg collision liu et al 2011a for the pack ice field a model mixed penalty based fluid structure interaction strategy and multi material arbitrary lagrangian eulerian approach was applied to estimate the hydrodynamic loads and the instantaneous ice force during the ship ice interaction yang et al 2018 similar numerical simulations were investigated for the crushable foam ice model gagnon and wang 2012 a more detailed investigation about the effect of waterline angles on the resistance performance of an ice going cargo ship was conducted numerically and experimentally three concentrations i e 90 80 and 60 of ice floe fields were produced concerning each waterline angle to compare the results from numerical simulation and experiment kim et al 2013 2014 5 fem coupling with dem in the scenarios of ship ice interaction dem used in conjunction with the fem has strong advantages in describing the ice mechanics at the microscale and reasonably modeling the ice breaking and ice clearing dynamics at the macro scale and thus obtaining a representation of the whole ice loading process ji and liu 2012 to cover the advantage of both fem and dem the combined finite discrete element method fem dem was employed to simulate ice rubbing munjiza 2004 the coupling of the dem and fem is based on the interface shared by two spatially separated domains liu and ji 2017 on which the contact forces obtained by the dem and deformations obtained by the fem are external loads of the fem and boundary conditions of the dem respectively chung and ooi 2012 in this framework the dem was used to model the ice rubble pile in a discontinuous way and the fem was used to model the ice sheet and its fracture in a continuous way paavilainen and tuhkuri 2012 more details about this approach were presented in ref munjiza et al 2009 the dem part followed the model in ref hopkins 1992 while the ice sheet was modeled using the fem dem timoshenko beam simulation of ridge keel punches through tests by modeling freeze bonds between ice blocks potyondy and cundall 2004 in these models the discrete elements were connected with beam elements following a cohesive law during the damage process an effective transportation strategy between the beam elements and the bonding breaking spherical elements was introduced in ref ji and wang 2018 in the dem simulations the explicit central difference method requires a very small time step to ensure computational stability on the other hand the fem which employs the implicit newmark scheme to obtain the dynamic responses of the structure can use a larger time step in the coupled fem dem analysis a constant small time step size is not recommended as it poses a huge disadvantage to the low computational efficiency a multiscale strategy with space and time can be helpful to efficiently solve this problem to do this the domain decomposition method ddm was introduced into the coupled fem dem with multiscale time steps and it decomposes the computational domain into subdomains that can be solved individually with different time steps the applications are referred to refs chantrait et al 2014 bettinotti et al 2014 combescure and gravouil 2002 and wang et al 2018d to analyze the dynamic responses of a conical jacket platform under the collisions of sea ice the gpu based parallel algorithm also was developed to improve the computation efficiency ji and wang 2018 however there is no published literature available concerning the ship ice interaction 6 the cohesive zone method cohesive zone model czm also called cohesive surface model barenblatt 1959 1962 dugdale 1960 kuutti et al 2013 was formed initially to account for the softening behavior as crack propagation and to estimate the nonlinear stress field nearby the crack tip hillerborg et al 1976 hillerborg 1983 in these models a traction separation law tsl was introduced to capture the softening behavior the tsl curve describes the endurance of material to cracking and employs one law to estimate both crack nucleation and propagation without any pre set variables the mode i fracture of sea ice was firstly investigated with employing a size independent tsl mulmule and dempsey 1997a the performance of tsl is mostly depended on the shape of the tsl curve fracture stress and fracture energy fracture energy is determined by the energy absorbed in creating a unit crack and fracture mechanics tests are used to obtain its value the czm being a local damage model overcomes several significant challenges in the application of the nonlocal damage models and the j integral strategies in terms of fracture problems one of the crucial unknowns of any initial boundary value problem concerning fracture is on how to determine the crack propagation surface konuk et al 2010 2009a b therefore it is crucially significant to have the traction separation curve some experimental testing methods and strategies were adopted to obtain the traction separation curve for concrete bazant 2019 for ice the only traction separation curve model i fracture energy of 15 n m available was estimated in refs mulmule and dempsey 1997b 1999 and mulmule and dempsey 2000 which were from the field experiment with the strengths of the weight function method viscoelastic fracture theory and the cohesive zone method dempsey et al 1999 for simplicity a linearly softening law was investigated together with cohesive fracture energy munjiza et al 2009 paavilainen et al 2010 2011 lu et al 2012b and a cohesive zone micromechanical model was used to simulate the compressive and tensile failure of polycrystalline ice gribanov et al 2018 the cohesive zone model has been performed by numerous numerical methods such as the cohesive element method gürtner et al 2010 gürtner 2009 meshless method zi and belytschko 2003 remmers et al 2003 and discrete element method paavilainen and tuhkuri 2012 paavilainen et al 2010 munjiza et al 2009 paavilainen et al 2006 2011 the strengths and weaknesses of employing various numerical approaches to perform the cohesive zone model on application of ice structure interaction are comprehensively reviewed in refs konuk et al 2010 and lu et al 2012b 6 1 fem coupling with czm the finite element framework is preferred owing to its strong mathematical robustness each approximate solution of the variational equations can rigorously be proven and there are a lot of commercial software available that makes the fem widely used in various fields gürtner 2009 investigation of czm within the framework of fem is called the cohesive element method cem ruiz et al 2000 xu and needleman 1994 to investigate the czm into the framework of fem if it is not sure whether there are cracks in advance the cohesive elements usually are embedded along the edges of all the bulk elements as the mesh generating or be adaptively embedded along boundaries of the mesh during the computation brocks et al 2003 pandolfi and ortiz 2002 paulino et al 2008 the cem has been successfully applied to solve complicated initial boundary value problems relevant to the ship and structure ice interaction scenarios see fig 12 the cem has been proved to be effective in explicitly simulating the crack nucleation propagation and fragmentation formation liu and wu 2012 lu et al 2014 since the applications of cem in ship ice interaction is rarely available and the failure mode of the ice interacting with the ship is similar to that of the ice and conical structure interaction where the bending failure leads to ice fracture a robust criterion for evaluation of whether an ice floe is subjected to only rigid body motions i e the ice floe is unbreakable or not in the process of ice structure interaction scenario was developed employing the cem in abaqus and the existing linear elastic fracture mechanics methods towards splitting were validated lindseth 2013 a defect model embedded in the framework of cem was used to investigate the initial defects within the ice sheet and the effects of the initial defects on the ice structure interaction wang et al 2019b an elastoplastic softening constitutive model was embedded into cem to simulate the consecutive icebreaking process of a ship sailing in level ice and the ice local crushing behavior was captured wang et al 2019a see figs 13 and 14 6 2 dem coupling with czm similar to the theoretical framework of cem simulating the ice fracturing and rubble accumulation the dem stands for a potential candidate to capture the ice accumulation and clearing process in the cem models the discrete elements are connected with beam elements following a cohesive law during the damage process motivated by this methodology a discrete element method together with a cohesive contact algorithm was proposed lu et al 2012b within this framework any two neighboring discrete elements are following a special contact algorithm this contact is hard contact under compression i e interelement penetration is not allowed in compression while in tension loads transferred through the contact are initially elastic however when the crack initiation criterion is reached the contact stiffness is weakened in such a way that the stress and separation follow the cohesive law applications of czm in the dem were conducted with a series of 2d numerical investigations on the ice fragments formation and accumulation process as interacting with an inclined structure munjiza et al 2009 paavilainen et al 2011 paavilainen and tuhkuri 2012 2013 however there is not yet any applications available concerning the ship ice interaction 7 sph method the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method as a particle or mesh free method has been widely implemented in computational fluid simulations morris et al 1997 shao and lo 2003 zheng et al 2014 gotoh and khayyer 2018 recently applications of sph method have further been expanded to fluid solid interaction scenario such as the interactions of fluid flow and saturated porous media khayyer et al 2017 the fracture of plates under the water impact considering both plastic and brittle behavior eghtesad et al 2012 the interactions of fluid and elastic solid khayyer et al 2018 and the fracture process of a flexible oil boom due to the interactions of both currents and waves shi et al 2018 in addition the sph can be efficiently applied to simulate the deformation in a large range and failure behavior of solids owing to its lagrangian nature libersky and petschek 1991 benz and asphaug 1995 randles and libersky 1996 bui et al 2008 deb and pramanik 2013 zhang et al 2017 for ice mechanics scenario the sph was used to study the failure process of ice beam in four point bending das et al 2017 das and holm 2018 and during the interaction of a ship and level ice zhang et al 2019 a more complex elastoplastic constitutive model with a failure model and the drucker prager yield criterion was introduced within the framework of the sph to capture the plastic failure behavior of ice zhang et al 2017 a comparison of fluid treated as the elastic foundation and the fluid solid coupling interaction was conducted to study the effect on ice resistance i e the ice breaking resistance and immersion resistance during the ice breaking process respectively liu et al 2019b see fig 15 8 peridynamics method as most of the ice mass models are developed with local continuum constitutive laws a natural inclination is to simulate the failure processes through embedding a nonlocal damage criterion into the constitutive model one of the significant challenges of the ice ship interaction problems is connected to the arbitrary branching and merging behavior of multiple cracks an ice sheet can fracture in various patterns as interacting with the ship hull for instance a local flexural failure or global splitting failure depends on the contact properties boundary conditions and geometry of the ice sheet capturing these different failure modes as an instinctual performance of numerical simulations based on traditional continuum mechanics is rather challenging it is primarily because the behavior of crack nucleation propagation branching multiple fracture patterns and final fragmentation in a solid material is still unknown to be explained in the computational mechanic field based on traditional continuum mechanics liu et al 2018 recently a nonlocal meshless approach termed peridynamics is treated as a reformulation of the traditional continuum mechanics and uses a nonlocal model to characterize material properties silling 1998 2000 silling and askari 2005 silling et al 2007 particles in a continuum body are assumed to interact across a finite distance and the equations are formulated in forms of integro differential instead of partial differential equations peridynamics has manifested its unique advantage in solving discontinuous problems and it has been introduced to estimate ice loads such as propeller ice interactions ye et al 2017 wang et al 2018a xiong and chao 2018 ye et al 2018a b xiong et al 2019 ye et al 2019a ship ice interactions liu et al 2018 xue et al 2019 ice sloping or cylindrical structure interactions liu et al 2017 lu et al 2018c jia et al 2019 nguyen and oterkus 2019 ice cover impact by an underwater explosion wang et al 2018c and others related to ice fracture vazic et al 2019 liu et al 2019a lu et al 2019 see fig 16 9 the lattice boltzmann method the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a relatively new numerical technique for simulating complex fluid dynamics and has drawn attention from researchers in computational physics different from the traditional cfd approaches e g particle based lagrangian methods e g sph or eulerian finite volume approaches which numerically solve the macroscopic properties including mass energy and momentum using the corresponding conservation equations lbm describes the fluid with fictitious particles and these particles perform the process of continuous propagation and collision within a discrete lattice mesh due to its unique characteristics and local dynamics lbm has numerous advantages than other traditional cfd approaches particularly in solving complex boundaries combining microscopic interactions data locality and parallelization of the algorithm wikipedia contributors 2019 the application of lbm solver elbe from tuhh using graphics processing units gpus to accelerate the hydrodynamic computations supports for simulations in a comparatively duration physical time on local off the shelf hardware janßen et al 2015 an open source open dynamics engine ode coupling to the lbm in a bidirectional explicit way geller et al 2011 was applied to simulate the motion of ice floes the ode is used to simulate the performance of multi rigid body dynamics including rigid friction collisions and constraints in real time the ship fluid rigid ice interactions were simulated based on the lattice boltzmann fluid solver for a three dimensional viscous and turbulent field the ice floe dynamics were performed using a physics engine taking into account the influences of inertia complicated geometry collisions and friction of multi rigid body systems mierke et al 2015 myland et al 2016 janßen et al 2017 see fig 17 10 other methods to include the methods related to this field as comprehensively as possible this part briefly introduces several other methods theoretical method based on observations the ultimate flexural failure of level ice is featured by producing wedge shaped broken ice blocks which has fostered the development of solutions to wedge plates beams on an elastic foundation nevel 1958 1961 sawamura et al 2008 2010 the elastic foundation is an alternative to simplify the role of water for example an analytical solution regarding an infinite wedge beam on the support of an elastic foundation was broadly employed in calculating the ice breaking load for level ice ship interactions numerically tabulated the results of an infinite ice wedge s flexural failure kotras 1983 lubbad and løset 2011 milano 1973 this continuous bending behavior creates an identifiable fragmentation pattern i e the consecutive arrangements of cusps or small blocks in shape of half moon and wedges along the waterline of ship stem naegle 1981 lu et al 2018b empirical formulae were used to estimate an ice wedge s flexural failure and to construct numerical tools to study level ice ship interactions su et al 2010a liu et al 2006 a 2d model based on empirical and analytical methods was used to simulate the interaction of level ice hull and the ice load was simplified during the process of submersion sliding and accumulation zhou et al 2012 2013 a semi numerical and semi analytical empirical approach was used to investigate the global splitting failure pattern capture failure processes of the ice sheet such as local crushing and breaking with the criterion of critical bending stress lubbad and løset 2011 and to present the fracturing of ice floes in random geometries and to simulate efficiently the fracturing events in a large structure scale lu et al 2018a with these semi analytical ice breaking approaches emphases were placed to model the process of collision among floating objects i e the structures and vessels the ice floes and the level ice using physics engines as presented in ref huisman et al 2016 the numerical simulation of ship maneuvering in ice fields was conducted by su et al with several publications su et al 2011a b 2010a the ship motions and instantaneous ice forces in both straight ahead and turning operations are also two significant issues needed to be concerned and have been calculated in ref su et al 2010b and a time domain prediction method to investigate the continuous icebreaking load and ship motion was introduced in ref chuan et al 2018 11 discussion each method has its own advantages and disadvantages the comparisons of different methods with respect to their key assumptions the application scenarios ice mechanics and computational cost are given in tables 1 and 2 the application of each method is largely dependent upon the simulation purpose and attention should be paid to each numerical methods pros and cons before implementation structural dynamics is a fundamental outcome directly from such simulations as well as collecting and analyzing ice loads such as force time history besides the qualitative results the visual presentation of ice fracture patterns ice fragmentation and ice rubble accumulations need to coincide with observations in nature the dem lacks a strict and generally excepted mathematical support and therefore often results in purpose built algorithms for a certain application and for certain idealized discrete element shapes most of the dem uses an explicit algorithm which brings about the problem of error transfer hourglass effect and there is no corresponding solution compared with the fem the accuracy of the dem is not improved except that it shows strength in dealing with the scattering and dynamic characteristics of the structure the computational demand of dem is also very noticeable which makes it not be widely used in the field of computational engineering as the continuum method fortunately due to the powerful data processing capacity of graphical processing units gpus dem simulation significantly tends to more energy efficient in reducing the program execution time the finite element framework is preferred owing to its strong mathematical robustness each approximate solution of the variational equations can rigorously be proven and there is numerous commercial software available that makes the fem widely used in various fields there are numerous alternative constitutive models for rock like materials which can employ to ice with modification and abundant research in terms of fluid structure interaction obviously the fem is a numerical method based on continuum mechanics although some improved models like xfem can tackle the singularity of the crack tip the complex numerical techniques and ad hoc assumptions make it not well applied in engineering further it has challenges to describe the whole failure process due to difficulties and restrictions in the processing of mixed propagating and interacting cracks and second interaction of broken off blocks or particles these challenges can be overcome by combining with czm and other fracture mechanics methods which will increase the cost of calculation the cohesive element cz strategy endures some limitations like its overestimation of the dissipative energy due to the distorted crack modes and its mesh dependency in numerical implementation other finite element fe techniques such as cracking particle method a form of element free galerkin efg method and the extended finite element method xfem have promising characteristics that can deal with these challenges the above presented cem and dem with cohesive elements manage to model the crack discretely i e the crack can only exist along discrete boundaries of the bulk discrete elements accordingly these methods are in their geometrical representation mesh dependent the structural stiffness softening is also observed with varying radial mesh size in the cem based simulation while the cem based simulation has an advantage over other methods in the way that the peak ice breaking loads stay rather stable with varying mesh size furthermore further remedies are needed in order to alleviate the mesh sensitivity issue the main advantage of sph method is to describe the details of fluid mechanics and to capture the phenomena observed of engineering applications sph solves the solutions to the fluid can capture enough details of the mechanical behavior in addition the use of open source code dualsphysics can meet the needs of large scale computing in terms of engineering problems however the ice mechanics modeled by dem is treated as a rigid body unbreakable which fails to perform the fracture behavior of ice and further study need to investigate the ice model however there are still some problems in simulating the mechanical behavior of ice for example the inherent first order accuracy of sph method makes it insufficient in simulating the microscopic problems of ice mechanics another common problem as a non local theoretical method is the low efficiency of numerical calculation which is particularly important with the help of a high performance computing framework the characteristics of peridynamics governing equations in integro differential form let it superior to the existing meshless approaches particularly the sph method bearing the tensile instability problem as taking derivative of the kernel peridynamics does not need any ad hoc strategy such as the artificial viscosity item in sph however further improvements need to be implemented in the numerical techniques such as some skills about the elimination of zero energy mode the correction of neighborhood particles missing in the horizon particle discretization and some non physical phenomena about the complete damage particles and development of the efficient computational algorithms under parallel programming environment such gpus lbm enables sophisticated algorithms and complex physics and the mesh generation and data preprocessing take up a small fraction of the whole simulation within the lbm this distinguished efficiency leads to a qualitatively novel level of recognition because it enables to solve problems that previously could not be addressed or approached in an insufficient accuracy way however the interactions between ships or marine structures and the surrounding unbroken level ice are absent which is still remaining challenges to be addressed in exiting the physical engine like elbe ode solver and it will be a significant breakthrough for ship ice interactions simulations of all scenarios the key challenges existing in ship ice interaction scenarios can be attributed to the modeling ice fluid ice interaction and ship ice interaction for modeling orthotropic ice it can be described based on functionally gradient material fgm for modeling ice considering the porosity of ice the gurson tvergaard needleman gtn model can be chosen the existing fracture damage constitutive model of sea ice is not enough to simulate all the behaviors of sea ice and the loading rate depended property of ice is still an open problem compared with other methods peridynamics can be a more acceptable candidate the fluid ice interaction actually is fluid structure interaction with lots of publications available and providing strategies for investigating the coupling of fluid and ice a more efficient way is to conduct the model using physical engines or coupling with other hydrodynamic numerical methods such as sph lbm numerical simulations with sph and lbm are very delicate work to make fancy scenarios however it needs to be verified by experimental data before further application to investigate the ship ice interaction is effectively to investigate the contact problems which is an interdisciplinary field spanning mechanics mathematics and materials to investigate more efficient and sturdy solution of contact problems the discretization of the contact interface and the implementation of the algorithm are main topics possible methods can be applied are rather diversified which have advantages and disadvantages in regard to different scenarios level ice ice breaking dominant as in liu et al 2018 floating ice floes ship advancement pushes floes away as in huang et al 2019b brash ice channel as in mucha 2019 open water ice channel as in huang et al 2020 ice ridge as in gong et al 2017 12 conclusions in this paper the numerical simulation methods used in ship ice interaction are reviewed and discussed the numerical model employs strong assumptions regarding ice geometry mechanical properties and hydrodynamics while the real environment has more natural variability particularly in ice ridge profile geometry however the numerical model provides control over the parameters and helps to capture the ice behavior which may be hard to observe in reality and to analyze various valuable performance associated with the physical phenomena behind ice loads and the behavior of sea ice as ice force is the result of ship ice collision and ice consecutive failure processes simulations of long enough interactions are essential with developing efficient numerical techniques and computing power ship ice interaction processes will be simulated in more detail and longer physical time periods in the future another challenge is to capture the dynamic characteristics of ship ice interaction in sufficient detail the ship is usually assumed to be a rigid body as continuous interacting against ice in most applications although ship ice interaction scenarios are dynamic however the system dynamics is more complex with a flexible structure than a rigid one to capture its dynamic characteristics due to the progressive ice fractures and the coupling dynamic effect on the ice fracture patterns the long term goal is to develop a multi physics simulation tool that can include fluid ship ice all in a single simulation which also can be performed within a reasonable time frame by harnessing the power of gpu computing this will help reducing downtime and risk to infrastructure the tool also can be used to develop an operator training simulator by creating complex physics based realistic environments declaration of competing interest the

21543,this paper represents the state of the art in the field of ice tank numerical simulation methods it gives a comprehensive review of existing commercial and prototype numerical methods in the ship ice interaction including aspects such as features capabilities and presents a discussion in terms of their characteristics the numerical simulation techniques are categorized as discrete element method finite element method cohesive element method smoothed particle hydrodynamics method peridynamics method lattice boltzmann method and some coupled models of these methods mainly depending on what the numerical methods are implemented to simulate the behavior of ice one purpose is to classify the chosen methods and evaluate their efficiency and accuracy and to enable potential readers to quickly grasp the main numerical methods and the development of their applications in the ship ice interaction scenarios we assess their practicability and validity from both perspectives of practice and physics and discuss challenges in existing numerical simulation methods we highlight the significance of interdisciplinary applications for developing the research in fluid structure interactions instead of elaborating on the numerical simulation techniques theoretically their applications in ship ice interaction scenarios are focused and presented keywords numerical simulation numerical ice tank ice loads ice going vessels ship ice interaction 1 introduction due to the shrinkage of ice cover there is an increasing interest in shipping activities in the arctic and antarctica which will also increase the demand for ice going vessels in these waters tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 xue and liu 2019 simulating the process of the ship ice interaction can be rather complex with large deformation and displacement of hulls fracture and fragmentation forming of ice as well as the motions of the ice fragments must be taken into consideration to optimize the design of ice going vessels the numerical method is necessary because of the high cost and long period of model tests although the complete data on ice loads is rather precious there are still limitations generally the range of parameters is very narrow and on some occasions it is difficult to obtain the definite data on the ice properties such as thickness strength and friction therefore to some extent it is difficult to figure out how the parameters influence ice loads by handling the full scale data a candidate data can be obtained with numerical simulations of ship ice interaction in a statistical study based on simulation all the parameters used are straightforward and can be adjusted in correspondence with requirements it is not difficult to do simulations where the parameters only change slightly and obtain the results on how sensitive the process can be to the changes in parameters ranta et al 2017 in most scenarios of ship ice interaction the nonlinearity could not be neglected due to the complex mechanical behavior of ice such as the elastoplastic deformation strain rate dependent properties fracture and friction generated among the ice fragments timco and weeks 2010 kuutti et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 1 the nonlinearities of the structure may further contribute to the complication konuk et al 2009a studies on ice constitutive model from the range of ductility to brittleness were started a few decades ago derradji aouat 2003 kolari et al 2007 as the most scenarios of ship ice interaction occur in a high range of interacting speed it means the elastic brittle failure of ice is dominant and the ductility and plasticity are neglect two main methods are adopted to investigate the ice constitutive model continuum methods such as the finite element method fem finite difference method fdm and particle in cell pic method particle methods such as the discrete element method dem the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method and peridynamics pd the advantages of fem are its robust theoretical support for simulating contact collision deformation damage etc which are focus of the interaction between the hull and the ice kuutti et al 2013 liu et al 2011b the particle method such as dem can well model and analyze the dynamic characteristics of floating ice and crushed ice with discrete characteristics and the navigation process of ships in the field of floating ice and small ice blocks yulmetov and løset 2017 yulmetov et al 2016 fem has been commonly used to simulate local ice pressure and global ice loads in ice fields such as level ice ice ridge and iceberg aksnes 2010 su et al 2011a sayed et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 however to describe the icebreaking characteristics in the process of ship ice interaction the advantages of dem are prominent dem can describe the discreteness of ice structure on the micro scale and simulate the ice fracture in the process of ship ice interaction on the macro scale which shows the inherent superiority in the estimation of ice load shen et al 1987 lepparanta et al 1990 hansen and løset 1999b a in most numerical models the fluid was simply treated as elastic foundations with constant hydrodynamic coefficients lubbad et al 2008 for more details of the fluid including hydrodynamic effects under the same numerical set up see lu et al 2012a studies on the hydrodynamic coupling between ship and ice and the coupling between floater and ice rubble were conducted and compared with the model test in a wave tank tsarau et al 2013 2014 mintu et al 2018 however the influence of the surface waves was not considered the numerical model and software platform based on computational fluid dynamics cfd is a promising candidate tool to capture the details of fluid but it leads to extreme computing time and highly depends on the physical hardware some applications based on this see refs gagnon 2007 and gagnon and wang 2012 investigated the collision characteristics between an iceberg and a loaded tanker a common weakness of the above models is most of them with a high computational cost which leads to difficulty in real time engineering applications fortunately a computational platform known as the physical engine satisfies the real time practical simulation physical engine is a software system specially used for fast physics correlated calculations such as rigid body dynamics the integration performance and contact detection accuracy of four common physical engines were compared including agx multiphysics open dynamics engine physx and vortex metrikin et al 2012 when it is applied in computer games speed may be considered prior to precision however it has been proved that physical engines can successfully describe the behavior of granular materials pytlos et al 2015 this largely promotes the validation and application of physical engines in ship ice interaction the real time simulation of ship navigation can be applied to sailors training and offshore operation preparation as one of these simulations general computing models based on physical engine and graphics processing unit gpu were introduced daley et al 2014 alawneh et al 2015 another effective scheme to simulate the ship ice interaction is to decide the geometry of the broken ice formed by bending failure with numerical computation store the calculation results in the database and then use the database to simulate the ship ice interaction sawamura 2012 however this strategy has a drawback that the fracture patterns preset in the database can be insufficient this paper reviews numerical simulation methods of the ship ice interaction the engineering application scenarios are significantly introduced and some representative figures are presented according to different methods i e the discrete element method dem finite element method fem cohesive element method cem the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method sph peridynamics method pd the lattice boltzmann method lbm and some derivative models coupled with these methods the paper begins with an introduction to the numerical simulation techniques in ship ice interaction then different numerical approaches and analyses on some details are given then a discussion about the selected numerical methods is presented and concludes with suggestions for the future 2 the discrete element method dem formulated by cundall 1971 and cundall and strack 1979 is especially useful when the discrete ice blocks play an important role tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 compared with other methods the dem features an advantage in calculating ice loads owing to its capability to depict the discreteness of ice on a micro scale and to reasonably model the phase of icebreaking during the ship ice interaction on a macro scale shen et al 1987 lepparanta et al 1990 hansen and løset 1999b a ji et al 2013 a comprehensive review studied ice structure interaction with emphasis on the lessons learned about the behavior of sea ice tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 different from that the current work focuses on the ship ice interaction four ice fields ice floe level ice ridges and iceberg ice will be discussed in this section to a certain extent other ship ice interaction scenarios can be studied by combining these four types 2 1 ice floe fields a relatively large part of the sea of our planet is scattered with broken ice made up of independent floes weeks 2010 recently ice floe fields have been considered appealing to us because a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of marginal ice zones is required moreover shipping business prefers sea regions with ice floes than pack ice the ship maneuvering performances turning circle and zig zag maneuvers were simulated with the ship maneuvering laboratory sml program and the dem model decice zhan et al 2010 sml is used to calculate ship hull hydrodynamics propulsion forces and rudder forces other topics including numerical modeling of ships in broken ice see zhan et al 2010 and lau and simões ré 2006 the work lau and simões ré 2006 defined practical performance measures for the totally enclosed motor propelled survival craft design in ice covered waters by experimentally investigating the hull s ice transiting resistance and its motions and validated a numerical model of lifeboat sail away a 3d expanded analysis on this topic was about a simulation of an arctic drill vessel interacting with pack ice ice concentration reached 90 to test ship s abilities of turning circle and zigzag maneuver zhan and molyneux 2013 more details about the ship maneuvering performances were investigated experimentally and numerically kim et al 2017 a moored ship in a floe field was simulated and the results gained just conform to experiments qualitatively hansen and løset 1999b a similar simulations were also conducted to compare the results karulin and karulina 2011 it was found that the differences presented were caused by the inherent limitation of 2d models and the neglect of the influence of hydrodynamics this is because when the concentration of the ice floes reached 79 the floe field compression changed from 2d drifting into 3d drifting and floe overturning thus unless it can be ensured that the floe concentration stays low the ice floe fields should be modeled in 3d much more 2d simulations have been conducted to study ships navigating in an ice floe field and the turning circle is showed to be smaller in a floe field than in open water according to the results zhan et al 2010 kim and sawamura 2016 exm004 is an integrated tug barge with twin azimuthing drives as its propulsion system and psm004 is a ferry with two conventional propellers as shown in fig 4 the turning circle in ice condition with ice concentration of 70 is smaller than that in open water one reason is that the ship s heading changed as the existence of ice however more ice concentration environments need to be conducted before obtaining a general conclusion the loads concerning the influence of ice floe follow a weibull distribution han and sawamura 2017 and the load on the turret mooring system increases with concentration karulin and karulina 2017 a study on the ice resistance for ship navigating in a brash ice channel found that the arrangement of ice pieces does not significantly affect the ship resistance but results suggested the importance of the size distribution of ice pieces konno 2009 konno et al 2011 before more cases need to be conducted we can guess that the ice load on a ship in the same ice concentration is dependent on the ice thickness ship s speed and independent on the redistribution of ice floes this conclusion can be verified by a series of experiments of a ship sailing in the field of unbreakable artificial ice floes see figs 2 5 3d processes like floe rafting and overturning however will affect the out of plane thickening which is the critical factor for deciding the horizontal strength of ice jam and ice floe field hopkins and tuhkuri 1999 mckenna et al 1997 3d dem was also adopted in simulations of ship interacting with ice floes lau et al 2011 vroegrijk 2012 ji et al 2013 in ref lau et al 2011 a ship maneuvering in ice floes the simulations from decice were compared with experimental data and found satisfactory in terms of accuracy and real time simulation capability and the simulation of a ship in an ice channel sorsimo et al 2014 in ref vroegrijk 2012 the practical application of the combined dem and cfd method to full scale problems showed the ability to simulate ice flows in nature and highlighted challenges encountered during post processing however the model would especially benefit from a validation study against full scale measured data sets in ref ji et al 2013 the pancake ice floes are modeled with 3 d dilated disk elements considering the buoyancy drag force and additional mass induced by the current the influences of ship maneuvering speeds and ice conditions current velocity and direction ice thicknesses floe sizes concentration on the global ice resistance were discussed the simulated results were compared qualitatively well with the existing field data and other numerical results the ice load increases with the increase of ship speed current velocity ice concentration and ice thickness but the influence of ice floe size is not obvious under constant concentration the results obtained are mainly about three aspects that is how the load generated by the influence of ice floes rises with the increase of ice concentration and ice thickness how the decrease of stiffness of mooring system correlates with the reducing of ice loads and how important the influence of wall constraints on the ice resistance is when the ice concentration exceeds 70 a novel non smooth discrete element model was adopted to perform a numerical multi body simulation of a series of model tests with a conceptual arctic drillship on dynamic positioning in managed ice using the commercial physics engine vortex to simulate the ice basin the dynamic positioning vessel the managed ice the surrounding fluid and their interactions metrikin et al 2013 a ship ice floes fluid coupling interaction was simulated embedding the dem within the framework of the star ccm software where fluid solutions are solved using the traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd model of a ship proceeding in open water and an array inject coupling method was used to simulate ice floes cover the water huang et al 2019a it shows that the total ship resistance is highly dictated by ship speed ice concentration and floe size more important it finds that the ship generated waves can reduce the ice resistance and the ice added resistance is more significant when the ship speed is relatively low in addition both ice concentration and ice floe size have a quasi linear relationship with the total ship resistance 2 2 ice ridges and rubble fields ice ridges are actually piles of ice blocks which are slender in shape and its thickness can reach tens of meters weeks 2010 rubble field is a general designation of the ice ridges field and the broad ridges the formation of the ice ridges mainly depends on the winds and currents to squeeze the ice sheet and break it up into blocks which pile up later pressure ridges are made up of ice fragments that are piled up in a line with the steep sloped ridge 5 to 10 ft or more above the adjacent level ice extension anon 2019 it is essential to understand the process of ridging and properties of ice ridges it has been found that the forces needed for ridging will constrain the global ice loads acting on marine structures and ridges causing high local ice loads should be seriously considered for shipping moreover the energy dissipates during the process of ridging which requires to be considered in large scale sea ice models see fig 6 in the early 2d dem simulations the ways of modeling ridges were to compress a layer of floating ice blocks hopkins and hibler 1991a or a layer of ice blocks laying on a frictionless surface evgin et al 1992 the significance of illustrating the angularity of ice blocks and that in the process of ridging energy actually dissipates much more than assumed were commonly demonstrated later the complete ice sheet was simulated and the process of breaking into discrete blocks has also been simulated hopkins et al 1999 hopkins 1994 hopkins and hibler 1991b the simulation results of ridge forming from thin lead ice compressed between two thick floes show that the energy dissipation declines with the rise of ice friction coefficient and increases with the increase of ice thickness hopkins 1994 in further studies the small scale results were upscaled to study pack ice dynamics hopkins 2004 1996 hopkins and thorndike 2006 and adopted to identify different phases of ridging process and the effects shown on ridging loads hopkins 1998 in fact only a part of ridges are formed by lead ice between thick ice floes and a part of ridges are formed by two ice sheets compressed together based on the model scale test tuhkuri and lensu 2002 the simulation of this process by 2d dem was verified and the parameters of whether ridging or drifting dominates the deformation of ice sheet were studied hopkins et al 1999 from these corresponding experiments and simulations it is found that rafting and ridging are not two independent physical processes rafting occurs before ridging which is considered to be the precursor of ridging a 3d study aiming at calculating the ice ridge resistance of a ship illustrated the correspondence between ridge width and resistance gong et al 2017 2019 the simulations were divided in two phases the ice rubble was piled up at the beginning and then the ship passed through the rubble the ice rubble was generated by releasing ice blocks underwater and by running the simulation till the viscous damping and frictional forces had run out of virtually all of the kinetic energy of the system polojärvi and tuhkuri 2009 see fig 7 rubble ice is a pile of crushed ice or small ice such as pancake ice which covers a wider area and is disordered compared with other ice types in antarctica the expansion of the ocean breaks down the newly formed ice and aggregates it into rubble ice sheets the surface characteristic height of rubble ice is often lower than that of ice ridge the scenarios on ship rubble ice is not yet available as an accurate representation of ice rubble is important in the modeling of ice ridges we introduce some representing investigations about rubble ice study on the shear box test of ice rubble model hopkins and hibler iii 1991 polojärvi et al 2015 study on the properties of rubble is the punch through test leppäranta and hakala 1992 karulin 2002 van den berg and lubbad 2015 polojärvi and tuhkuri 2009 2 3 ice sheets sheet ice is a region of ice with relatively uniform thickness also called level ice iso19906 2010 a 3d dem model of a floating plate was used to simulate the ship ice interaction which can fail along the element boundary or along a plane passing through the center of mass of the element to create a discrete element hocking 1992 with mohr coulomb failure criterion adopted in this model it prefers fractures through elements than fractures along element boundaries where fracture directions are set by the mesh hocking 1992 lawrence 2009 the model has been adopted in the simulation of ships turning in ice lau 2006 and the ice resistance of ships molyneux et al 2012b bonded particle models potyondy and cundall 2004 in which a solid is embodied by spheres bonded together have been applied to sea ice sheets jou et al 2019 which can be de bonded according to the bonding breaking criteria in this model the stiffness and strength of the spheres and the bonds correlate with the stiffness and strength of the ice sheet the size of the sphere has an influence on the mechanical behavior of the modeled ice sheet by simulating the bending and the compressive strength of the ice bonded particle models have been calibrated and applied to calculate ice resistance and local loads on ships ji 2016 although the implementation is quite simple the bonded particle models seem to require further development in order to better simulate particle rotation user specific counter torque is supplemented to the particles and the sliding of bonded particles is distinct from that of smooth particles which requires for adjustment morgan 2016 however the study showed that bonded particle models can give the ice loads similar to the theoretical di et al 2017 and experimental results feng et al 2015 the ice induced forces operating on the ship and the performance of a dynamically controlled vessel operating in level ice were also simulated lau et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 the numerical simulations conducted in this work include a 1 21 scale model of the canadian icebreaker terry fox advancing and turning in level ice conditions the physical experiments were carried out in the institute for ocean technology iot ice tank using a planar motion mechanism pmm analysis of the numerical results showed the effects of ice conditions and ship motions on the computed forces and moments comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data provided a validation of the numerical model see fig 8 3 dem coupling with sph most of the dem codes including decice molyneux et al 2012b and woo bailey dudley et al 2017 treat fluid water air as a static foundation molyneux et al 2012b a considering only the buoyancy and or approximating drag forces lubbad et al 2018 tsarau et al 2017 di et al 2017 yulmetov et al 2016 or simply neglecting them liu et al 2016 feng et al 2015 in the simulation these codes do not account for the dynamic effects of fluid structure interactions known as hydrodynamic effects added mass water drag wave damping some researchers integrated potential flow solvers in the dem code to predict the ice floe motion tsarau et al 2014 tsarau and løset 2015 huang et al 2019b the limitation of the potential flow method is that it assumes the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational however it was reported that viscosity plays an important role in floe kinematics bai et al 2017 the role of fluids water and air is necessary to investigate the influences of hydrodynamic forces on the ice interaction scenarios molyneux et al 2011 the importance of hydrodynamic effects in ship ice interaction has been reported by many researchers luo et al 2018 keijdener et al 2018 aarsæther et al 2018 strong hydrodynamic effects that are not possible to be captured accurately by approximation of drag forces are explained in refs yulmetov et al 2016 and alawneh et al 2016 in the scenario of pack ice simulations the significance of hydrodynamic effects was presented in the iceberg towing simulations hoving et al 2017 talimi et al 2016 some commercial codes can include the fluid water air in the simulations but the validation of those cases have not been reported for example a simplified ls dyna simulation for an ice ridge and a floating offshore structure interaction was studied in ref molyneux et al 2011 where the ice ridge was modeled by dem and the fluid domains water and air were defined by eulerian spaces to capture the free surface the buoyancy and the hydrodynamic characteristics the multi phase ls dyna simulation was implemented in ref millan and wang 2011 where it presented a preliminary pack ice ship simulation with no validation studies the sph formulated on computational fluid dynamics cfd is widely used in the fluid solid interaction coupling sph with the dem model considers the hydrodynamic effects nearby the interacting objects like the ice blocks in the coupled model the ice is modeled by dem which enables to calculate interacting forces according to contact laws the water foundation is modeled by smooth particles which are formulated with the naiver stokes equations mintu et al 2018 applications about these scenarios on fluid and solids interaction like the interaction between the fluid and solid computed using sph and interaction between blocks and the blocks and the tank walls computed using dem crespo et al 2011 an open source sph model named dualsphysics crespo et al 2011 originates from sphysics gómez gesteira et al 2010 which presents a coupled numerical solution to fluid solid interaction using dem and sph discretizations over a wide range of scales by virtue of the parallel power computing of graphics processing units gpus see fig 9 4 the finite element method as the fem is an alternative numerical technique for solving partial differential equations pde with approximate solutions by discretizing the whole computational domain into a series of subdomains with simple geometry named finite elements within the framework of the fem the pde problems can be transposed into a set of linear algebraic equations and some theoretical research such as contact problems wang et al 2008 matsui et al 2018 liu et al 2011b a scattering from layered sea ice with the action of multi frequency and multi incidence waves xu et al 2018 the finite element technique was adopted because of its superior mathematical robustness for model the constitutive model of rock like materials such as rate depended size depended models concerning numerical simulations of ship ice interaction the fem has been used widely to calculate local ice force and global ice load on the hull in the field of the ice ridge level ice and iceberg some researchers investigated the resistance of ice going vessels applying the fluid structure interaction fsi method during the process of the ship ice interactions and compared the results with those obtained by model scale ship tests performed in a towing tank covered with synthetic ice to analyze the practicability of the fem guo et al 2018 because the early fem cannot deal with the crack initiation and other failure behaviors all of the above referred investigations assumed that the maximum load to the structure occurred during the first instances of interaction to simulate the initial failure the erosion technique and sufficient mesh refinement were used to visualize initial failure in the continuum representation of the ice yu et al 2007 alternatively a transformation of state was introduced to change the constitutive properties of pack ice to that of broken ice rather than erode a distinct element however both approaches conflict with energy conservations sand and fransson 2008 as traditional fem may endure the mathematical stress singularity at the crack tip and the xfem method theoretically enables the simulation of arbitrary cracks within the framework of the xfem a heaviside enhancement term was introduced in the formulation to capture the displacement jump across the crack line belytschko and black 1999 moës et al 1999 and cracks allow to propagate through traditional finite elements based on enhancement functions which conversely generate a discontinuous displacement field several comprehensive reviews of this method are referred to karihaloo and xiao 2003 and abdelaziz and hamouine 2008 the ice failure is qualitatively investigated through full scale and model scale observations as well as a numerical simulation with xfem li et al 2020 and it found that the modulus gradient through thickness should not be simply neglected especially when the modulus at the top layer is over three times of the mean modulus the xfem was used to simulate a field test where an inclined landing craft bow impact on level ice in baltic sea xu et al 2020 and it found that the competition between the circumferential crack and the radial crack which is related with the impact speed and inclination of the landing craft bow the phenomena of ice sheet bending and deflection caused by a ship sailing in ice level were analyzed using fem based on euler and cantilever methods koto et al 2019 a realistic performance in both visual and theoretical aspects was developed based on the nonlinear finite element technique to demonstrate the complicated mechanical behavior of ice and to investigate the local ice forces and global ice loading on structures sand 2008 a one dimensional sea ice dynamics model was conducted accounting for the contribution of ice floe size wind and current to simulate the interaction of a vertically sided offshore structure and a drifting ice floe based on the nonlinear speed dependent brittle and ductile deformation and local crushing of ice phenomenologically hendrikse and nord 2019 to estimate the strain rate effects of ice on the process of ship ice interaction a strain rate dependent constitutive model that enables hardening behaviors and yield stress vary with strain rate was introduced to simulate the collision between ice and ship hull nho et al 2016 the fe analysis concerning fluid ice interaction was applied to study the dynamic effect of an ice plate bending failure on the ice breaking patterns of level ice sawamura et al 2009 the buoyancy effects of brash ice in water were investigated to estimate the resistance performance of a scaling model of the standard canadian icebreaker terry fox sailing in the brash ice field wang and derradji aouat 2010 although the numerical and analytical results were in relatively good agreement the results were not satisfactory in terms of the motion of ice pieces and the crack nucleation and propagation phenomenologically the potential factors leading to this according to them were the mesh dependency boundary effects the geometry of ice and rigid body kinematic mechanics see fig 10 to capture the ice abrasion characteristics as crashing of an ice floe against a structure the mixed eulerian lagrangian method of fem was proposed to simulate the bulbous bow ice interaction afrizal et al 2018 and the ice abrasion caused by unbreakable ice floes kim and kim 2017 2019 kim et al 2019 in these references ice floes were modeled with random distributions of shape size and thickness and an efficient numerical simulation technique for ice ice ice fluid and ice structure interactions was introduced to accelerate computation significant parameters were analyzed in detail such as the relationship of pressure and penetration and the drag force coefficient see fig 11 with the development of finite element software there are a lot of numerical applications by using the commercial software ls dyna for example numerical simulation of ship ice interaction using the fluid structure interaction fsi method wang and derradji aouat 2010 in this simulation the description and investigation of the ship ice contact is one of the significant challenges to investigate this an energy saving device of ice floes and the ice class ship was introduced to illuminate the characteristics of the structural response and ice force time history and the coupling effects between them matsui et al 2018 a user defined failure criterion embedded into ls dyna concerning the effect of the hydrostatic pressure the effective plastic strain and allow crack nucleation and damage evolution was introduced to the scenario of icebergs and the ice was considered to be isotropic strain rate dependent and temperature sensitive liu et al 2011b a 3d model concerning nonlinear viscoelasticity and shear stress and hydrostatic pressure dependent tsai wu type yield criterion was adopted xu et al 2019 in this scenario there are significant uncertainties about the properties of ice while crushing and interacting against a deformable structure like the hull of non ice going vessels the internal and external mechanics were explained for the characteristics of the fore ship and iceberg collision liu et al 2011a for the pack ice field a model mixed penalty based fluid structure interaction strategy and multi material arbitrary lagrangian eulerian approach was applied to estimate the hydrodynamic loads and the instantaneous ice force during the ship ice interaction yang et al 2018 similar numerical simulations were investigated for the crushable foam ice model gagnon and wang 2012 a more detailed investigation about the effect of waterline angles on the resistance performance of an ice going cargo ship was conducted numerically and experimentally three concentrations i e 90 80 and 60 of ice floe fields were produced concerning each waterline angle to compare the results from numerical simulation and experiment kim et al 2013 2014 5 fem coupling with dem in the scenarios of ship ice interaction dem used in conjunction with the fem has strong advantages in describing the ice mechanics at the microscale and reasonably modeling the ice breaking and ice clearing dynamics at the macro scale and thus obtaining a representation of the whole ice loading process ji and liu 2012 to cover the advantage of both fem and dem the combined finite discrete element method fem dem was employed to simulate ice rubbing munjiza 2004 the coupling of the dem and fem is based on the interface shared by two spatially separated domains liu and ji 2017 on which the contact forces obtained by the dem and deformations obtained by the fem are external loads of the fem and boundary conditions of the dem respectively chung and ooi 2012 in this framework the dem was used to model the ice rubble pile in a discontinuous way and the fem was used to model the ice sheet and its fracture in a continuous way paavilainen and tuhkuri 2012 more details about this approach were presented in ref munjiza et al 2009 the dem part followed the model in ref hopkins 1992 while the ice sheet was modeled using the fem dem timoshenko beam simulation of ridge keel punches through tests by modeling freeze bonds between ice blocks potyondy and cundall 2004 in these models the discrete elements were connected with beam elements following a cohesive law during the damage process an effective transportation strategy between the beam elements and the bonding breaking spherical elements was introduced in ref ji and wang 2018 in the dem simulations the explicit central difference method requires a very small time step to ensure computational stability on the other hand the fem which employs the implicit newmark scheme to obtain the dynamic responses of the structure can use a larger time step in the coupled fem dem analysis a constant small time step size is not recommended as it poses a huge disadvantage to the low computational efficiency a multiscale strategy with space and time can be helpful to efficiently solve this problem to do this the domain decomposition method ddm was introduced into the coupled fem dem with multiscale time steps and it decomposes the computational domain into subdomains that can be solved individually with different time steps the applications are referred to refs chantrait et al 2014 bettinotti et al 2014 combescure and gravouil 2002 and wang et al 2018d to analyze the dynamic responses of a conical jacket platform under the collisions of sea ice the gpu based parallel algorithm also was developed to improve the computation efficiency ji and wang 2018 however there is no published literature available concerning the ship ice interaction 6 the cohesive zone method cohesive zone model czm also called cohesive surface model barenblatt 1959 1962 dugdale 1960 kuutti et al 2013 was formed initially to account for the softening behavior as crack propagation and to estimate the nonlinear stress field nearby the crack tip hillerborg et al 1976 hillerborg 1983 in these models a traction separation law tsl was introduced to capture the softening behavior the tsl curve describes the endurance of material to cracking and employs one law to estimate both crack nucleation and propagation without any pre set variables the mode i fracture of sea ice was firstly investigated with employing a size independent tsl mulmule and dempsey 1997a the performance of tsl is mostly depended on the shape of the tsl curve fracture stress and fracture energy fracture energy is determined by the energy absorbed in creating a unit crack and fracture mechanics tests are used to obtain its value the czm being a local damage model overcomes several significant challenges in the application of the nonlocal damage models and the j integral strategies in terms of fracture problems one of the crucial unknowns of any initial boundary value problem concerning fracture is on how to determine the crack propagation surface konuk et al 2010 2009a b therefore it is crucially significant to have the traction separation curve some experimental testing methods and strategies were adopted to obtain the traction separation curve for concrete bazant 2019 for ice the only traction separation curve model i fracture energy of 15 n m available was estimated in refs mulmule and dempsey 1997b 1999 and mulmule and dempsey 2000 which were from the field experiment with the strengths of the weight function method viscoelastic fracture theory and the cohesive zone method dempsey et al 1999 for simplicity a linearly softening law was investigated together with cohesive fracture energy munjiza et al 2009 paavilainen et al 2010 2011 lu et al 2012b and a cohesive zone micromechanical model was used to simulate the compressive and tensile failure of polycrystalline ice gribanov et al 2018 the cohesive zone model has been performed by numerous numerical methods such as the cohesive element method gürtner et al 2010 gürtner 2009 meshless method zi and belytschko 2003 remmers et al 2003 and discrete element method paavilainen and tuhkuri 2012 paavilainen et al 2010 munjiza et al 2009 paavilainen et al 2006 2011 the strengths and weaknesses of employing various numerical approaches to perform the cohesive zone model on application of ice structure interaction are comprehensively reviewed in refs konuk et al 2010 and lu et al 2012b 6 1 fem coupling with czm the finite element framework is preferred owing to its strong mathematical robustness each approximate solution of the variational equations can rigorously be proven and there are a lot of commercial software available that makes the fem widely used in various fields gürtner 2009 investigation of czm within the framework of fem is called the cohesive element method cem ruiz et al 2000 xu and needleman 1994 to investigate the czm into the framework of fem if it is not sure whether there are cracks in advance the cohesive elements usually are embedded along the edges of all the bulk elements as the mesh generating or be adaptively embedded along boundaries of the mesh during the computation brocks et al 2003 pandolfi and ortiz 2002 paulino et al 2008 the cem has been successfully applied to solve complicated initial boundary value problems relevant to the ship and structure ice interaction scenarios see fig 12 the cem has been proved to be effective in explicitly simulating the crack nucleation propagation and fragmentation formation liu and wu 2012 lu et al 2014 since the applications of cem in ship ice interaction is rarely available and the failure mode of the ice interacting with the ship is similar to that of the ice and conical structure interaction where the bending failure leads to ice fracture a robust criterion for evaluation of whether an ice floe is subjected to only rigid body motions i e the ice floe is unbreakable or not in the process of ice structure interaction scenario was developed employing the cem in abaqus and the existing linear elastic fracture mechanics methods towards splitting were validated lindseth 2013 a defect model embedded in the framework of cem was used to investigate the initial defects within the ice sheet and the effects of the initial defects on the ice structure interaction wang et al 2019b an elastoplastic softening constitutive model was embedded into cem to simulate the consecutive icebreaking process of a ship sailing in level ice and the ice local crushing behavior was captured wang et al 2019a see figs 13 and 14 6 2 dem coupling with czm similar to the theoretical framework of cem simulating the ice fracturing and rubble accumulation the dem stands for a potential candidate to capture the ice accumulation and clearing process in the cem models the discrete elements are connected with beam elements following a cohesive law during the damage process motivated by this methodology a discrete element method together with a cohesive contact algorithm was proposed lu et al 2012b within this framework any two neighboring discrete elements are following a special contact algorithm this contact is hard contact under compression i e interelement penetration is not allowed in compression while in tension loads transferred through the contact are initially elastic however when the crack initiation criterion is reached the contact stiffness is weakened in such a way that the stress and separation follow the cohesive law applications of czm in the dem were conducted with a series of 2d numerical investigations on the ice fragments formation and accumulation process as interacting with an inclined structure munjiza et al 2009 paavilainen et al 2011 paavilainen and tuhkuri 2012 2013 however there is not yet any applications available concerning the ship ice interaction 7 sph method the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method as a particle or mesh free method has been widely implemented in computational fluid simulations morris et al 1997 shao and lo 2003 zheng et al 2014 gotoh and khayyer 2018 recently applications of sph method have further been expanded to fluid solid interaction scenario such as the interactions of fluid flow and saturated porous media khayyer et al 2017 the fracture of plates under the water impact considering both plastic and brittle behavior eghtesad et al 2012 the interactions of fluid and elastic solid khayyer et al 2018 and the fracture process of a flexible oil boom due to the interactions of both currents and waves shi et al 2018 in addition the sph can be efficiently applied to simulate the deformation in a large range and failure behavior of solids owing to its lagrangian nature libersky and petschek 1991 benz and asphaug 1995 randles and libersky 1996 bui et al 2008 deb and pramanik 2013 zhang et al 2017 for ice mechanics scenario the sph was used to study the failure process of ice beam in four point bending das et al 2017 das and holm 2018 and during the interaction of a ship and level ice zhang et al 2019 a more complex elastoplastic constitutive model with a failure model and the drucker prager yield criterion was introduced within the framework of the sph to capture the plastic failure behavior of ice zhang et al 2017 a comparison of fluid treated as the elastic foundation and the fluid solid coupling interaction was conducted to study the effect on ice resistance i e the ice breaking resistance and immersion resistance during the ice breaking process respectively liu et al 2019b see fig 15 8 peridynamics method as most of the ice mass models are developed with local continuum constitutive laws a natural inclination is to simulate the failure processes through embedding a nonlocal damage criterion into the constitutive model one of the significant challenges of the ice ship interaction problems is connected to the arbitrary branching and merging behavior of multiple cracks an ice sheet can fracture in various patterns as interacting with the ship hull for instance a local flexural failure or global splitting failure depends on the contact properties boundary conditions and geometry of the ice sheet capturing these different failure modes as an instinctual performance of numerical simulations based on traditional continuum mechanics is rather challenging it is primarily because the behavior of crack nucleation propagation branching multiple fracture patterns and final fragmentation in a solid material is still unknown to be explained in the computational mechanic field based on traditional continuum mechanics liu et al 2018 recently a nonlocal meshless approach termed peridynamics is treated as a reformulation of the traditional continuum mechanics and uses a nonlocal model to characterize material properties silling 1998 2000 silling and askari 2005 silling et al 2007 particles in a continuum body are assumed to interact across a finite distance and the equations are formulated in forms of integro differential instead of partial differential equations peridynamics has manifested its unique advantage in solving discontinuous problems and it has been introduced to estimate ice loads such as propeller ice interactions ye et al 2017 wang et al 2018a xiong and chao 2018 ye et al 2018a b xiong et al 2019 ye et al 2019a ship ice interactions liu et al 2018 xue et al 2019 ice sloping or cylindrical structure interactions liu et al 2017 lu et al 2018c jia et al 2019 nguyen and oterkus 2019 ice cover impact by an underwater explosion wang et al 2018c and others related to ice fracture vazic et al 2019 liu et al 2019a lu et al 2019 see fig 16 9 the lattice boltzmann method the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a relatively new numerical technique for simulating complex fluid dynamics and has drawn attention from researchers in computational physics different from the traditional cfd approaches e g particle based lagrangian methods e g sph or eulerian finite volume approaches which numerically solve the macroscopic properties including mass energy and momentum using the corresponding conservation equations lbm describes the fluid with fictitious particles and these particles perform the process of continuous propagation and collision within a discrete lattice mesh due to its unique characteristics and local dynamics lbm has numerous advantages than other traditional cfd approaches particularly in solving complex boundaries combining microscopic interactions data locality and parallelization of the algorithm wikipedia contributors 2019 the application of lbm solver elbe from tuhh using graphics processing units gpus to accelerate the hydrodynamic computations supports for simulations in a comparatively duration physical time on local off the shelf hardware janßen et al 2015 an open source open dynamics engine ode coupling to the lbm in a bidirectional explicit way geller et al 2011 was applied to simulate the motion of ice floes the ode is used to simulate the performance of multi rigid body dynamics including rigid friction collisions and constraints in real time the ship fluid rigid ice interactions were simulated based on the lattice boltzmann fluid solver for a three dimensional viscous and turbulent field the ice floe dynamics were performed using a physics engine taking into account the influences of inertia complicated geometry collisions and friction of multi rigid body systems mierke et al 2015 myland et al 2016 janßen et al 2017 see fig 17 10 other methods to include the methods related to this field as comprehensively as possible this part briefly introduces several other methods theoretical method based on observations the ultimate flexural failure of level ice is featured by producing wedge shaped broken ice blocks which has fostered the development of solutions to wedge plates beams on an elastic foundation nevel 1958 1961 sawamura et al 2008 2010 the elastic foundation is an alternative to simplify the role of water for example an analytical solution regarding an infinite wedge beam on the support of an elastic foundation was broadly employed in calculating the ice breaking load for level ice ship interactions numerically tabulated the results of an infinite ice wedge s flexural failure kotras 1983 lubbad and løset 2011 milano 1973 this continuous bending behavior creates an identifiable fragmentation pattern i e the consecutive arrangements of cusps or small blocks in shape of half moon and wedges along the waterline of ship stem naegle 1981 lu et al 2018b empirical formulae were used to estimate an ice wedge s flexural failure and to construct numerical tools to study level ice ship interactions su et al 2010a liu et al 2006 a 2d model based on empirical and analytical methods was used to simulate the interaction of level ice hull and the ice load was simplified during the process of submersion sliding and accumulation zhou et al 2012 2013 a semi numerical and semi analytical empirical approach was used to investigate the global splitting failure pattern capture failure processes of the ice sheet such as local crushing and breaking with the criterion of critical bending stress lubbad and løset 2011 and to present the fracturing of ice floes in random geometries and to simulate efficiently the fracturing events in a large structure scale lu et al 2018a with these semi analytical ice breaking approaches emphases were placed to model the process of collision among floating objects i e the structures and vessels the ice floes and the level ice using physics engines as presented in ref huisman et al 2016 the numerical simulation of ship maneuvering in ice fields was conducted by su et al with several publications su et al 2011a b 2010a the ship motions and instantaneous ice forces in both straight ahead and turning operations are also two significant issues needed to be concerned and have been calculated in ref su et al 2010b and a time domain prediction method to investigate the continuous icebreaking load and ship motion was introduced in ref chuan et al 2018 11 discussion each method has its own advantages and disadvantages the comparisons of different methods with respect to their key assumptions the application scenarios ice mechanics and computational cost are given in tables 1 and 2 the application of each method is largely dependent upon the simulation purpose and attention should be paid to each numerical methods pros and cons before implementation structural dynamics is a fundamental outcome directly from such simulations as well as collecting and analyzing ice loads such as force time history besides the qualitative results the visual presentation of ice fracture patterns ice fragmentation and ice rubble accumulations need to coincide with observations in nature the dem lacks a strict and generally excepted mathematical support and therefore often results in purpose built algorithms for a certain application and for certain idealized discrete element shapes most of the dem uses an explicit algorithm which brings about the problem of error transfer hourglass effect and there is no corresponding solution compared with the fem the accuracy of the dem is not improved except that it shows strength in dealing with the scattering and dynamic characteristics of the structure the computational demand of dem is also very noticeable which makes it not be widely used in the field of computational engineering as the continuum method fortunately due to the powerful data processing capacity of graphical processing units gpus dem simulation significantly tends to more energy efficient in reducing the program execution time the finite element framework is preferred owing to its strong mathematical robustness each approximate solution of the variational equations can rigorously be proven and there is numerous commercial software available that makes the fem widely used in various fields there are numerous alternative constitutive models for rock like materials which can employ to ice with modification and abundant research in terms of fluid structure interaction obviously the fem is a numerical method based on continuum mechanics although some improved models like xfem can tackle the singularity of the crack tip the complex numerical techniques and ad hoc assumptions make it not well applied in engineering further it has challenges to describe the whole failure process due to difficulties and restrictions in the processing of mixed propagating and interacting cracks and second interaction of broken off blocks or particles these challenges can be overcome by combining with czm and other fracture mechanics methods which will increase the cost of calculation the cohesive element cz strategy endures some limitations like its overestimation of the dissipative energy due to the distorted crack modes and its mesh dependency in numerical implementation other finite element fe techniques such as cracking particle method a form of element free galerkin efg method and the extended finite element method xfem have promising characteristics that can deal with these challenges the above presented cem and dem with cohesive elements manage to model the crack discretely i e the crack can only exist along discrete boundaries of the bulk discrete elements accordingly these methods are in their geometrical representation mesh dependent the structural stiffness softening is also observed with varying radial mesh size in the cem based simulation while the cem based simulation has an advantage over other methods in the way that the peak ice breaking loads stay rather stable with varying mesh size furthermore further remedies are needed in order to alleviate the mesh sensitivity issue the main advantage of sph method is to describe the details of fluid mechanics and to capture the phenomena observed of engineering applications sph solves the solutions to the fluid can capture enough details of the mechanical behavior in addition the use of open source code dualsphysics can meet the needs of large scale computing in terms of engineering problems however the ice mechanics modeled by dem is treated as a rigid body unbreakable which fails to perform the fracture behavior of ice and further study need to investigate the ice model however there are still some problems in simulating the mechanical behavior of ice for example the inherent first order accuracy of sph method makes it insufficient in simulating the microscopic problems of ice mechanics another common problem as a non local theoretical method is the low efficiency of numerical calculation which is particularly important with the help of a high performance computing framework the characteristics of peridynamics governing equations in integro differential form let it superior to the existing meshless approaches particularly the sph method bearing the tensile instability problem as taking derivative of the kernel peridynamics does not need any ad hoc strategy such as the artificial viscosity item in sph however further improvements need to be implemented in the numerical techniques such as some skills about the elimination of zero energy mode the correction of neighborhood particles missing in the horizon particle discretization and some non physical phenomena about the complete damage particles and development of the efficient computational algorithms under parallel programming environment such gpus lbm enables sophisticated algorithms and complex physics and the mesh generation and data preprocessing take up a small fraction of the whole simulation within the lbm this distinguished efficiency leads to a qualitatively novel level of recognition because it enables to solve problems that previously could not be addressed or approached in an insufficient accuracy way however the interactions between ships or marine structures and the surrounding unbroken level ice are absent which is still remaining challenges to be addressed in exiting the physical engine like elbe ode solver and it will be a significant breakthrough for ship ice interactions simulations of all scenarios the key challenges existing in ship ice interaction scenarios can be attributed to the modeling ice fluid ice interaction and ship ice interaction for modeling orthotropic ice it can be described based on functionally gradient material fgm for modeling ice considering the porosity of ice the gurson tvergaard needleman gtn model can be chosen the existing fracture damage constitutive model of sea ice is not enough to simulate all the behaviors of sea ice and the loading rate depended property of ice is still an open problem compared with other methods peridynamics can be a more acceptable candidate the fluid ice interaction actually is fluid structure interaction with lots of publications available and providing strategies for investigating the coupling of fluid and ice a more efficient way is to conduct the model using physical engines or coupling with other hydrodynamic numerical methods such as sph lbm numerical simulations with sph and lbm are very delicate work to make fancy scenarios however it needs to be verified by experimental data before further application to investigate the ship ice interaction is effectively to investigate the contact problems which is an interdisciplinary field spanning mechanics mathematics and materials to investigate more efficient and sturdy solution of contact problems the discretization of the contact interface and the implementation of the algorithm are main topics possible methods can be applied are rather diversified which have advantages and disadvantages in regard to different scenarios level ice ice breaking dominant as in liu et al 2018 floating ice floes ship advancement pushes floes away as in huang et al 2019b brash ice channel as in mucha 2019 open water ice channel as in huang et al 2020 ice ridge as in gong et al 2017 12 conclusions in this paper the numerical simulation methods used in ship ice interaction are reviewed and discussed the numerical model employs strong assumptions regarding ice geometry mechanical properties and hydrodynamics while the real environment has more natural variability particularly in ice ridge profile geometry however the numerical model provides control over the parameters and helps to capture the ice behavior which may be hard to observe in reality and to analyze various valuable performance associated with the physical phenomena behind ice loads and the behavior of sea ice as ice force is the result of ship ice collision and ice consecutive failure processes simulations of long enough interactions are essential with developing efficient numerical techniques and computing power ship ice interaction processes will be simulated in more detail and longer physical time periods in the future another challenge is to capture the dynamic characteristics of ship ice interaction in sufficient detail the ship is usually assumed to be a rigid body as continuous interacting against ice in most applications although ship ice interaction scenarios are dynamic however the system dynamics is more complex with a flexible structure than a rigid one to capture its dynamic characteristics due to the progressive ice fractures and the coupling dynamic effect on the ice fracture patterns the long term goal is to develop a multi physics simulation tool that can include fluid ship ice all in a single simulation which also can be performed within a reasonable time frame by harnessing the power of gpu computing this will help reducing downtime and risk to infrastructure the tool also can be used to develop an operator training simulator by creating complex physics based realistic environments declaration of competing interest the

21544,reasonably determining the fortification criterion is one of the important links in the design of breakwaters and flood walls and it is directly related to the construction cost and protection efficiency of these engineering works wave height is one of the most important element of the marine environment determined by the breakwater and flood protection standards based on the stochastic process theory this paper gives a mathematical description of the stochastic process that can reflect the deeper level of statistical characteristics regarding the wave heights by regarding the number of typhoons in a certain sea area as a poisson process this paper establishes a new model for the joint probability analysis of marine environmental elements the nested random composite distribution model and it gives the display expression of the new model we also take typhoon data wave height and water increase data under typhoon influence from weizhou hydrological station in western guangdong china from 1990 to 2016 as samples and use the gumbel pareto distribution as the edge distribution to apply the nested random composite distribution model to typhoon affected sea areas the joint recurrence period under different time combinations is calculated and the joint statistical characteristics of the same element or different elements in different periods are also given keywords stochastic process design criteria joint recurrence period wave height typhoon 1 research background the marine environment conditions for marine and coastal engineering are often very harsh and they are greatly affected by severe weather processes such as typhoons and cold waves in addition marine and coastal engineering are expensive to construct and the responsibility for protection is significant once damaged economic losses and casualties will be difficult to estimate the failure or even destruction of most engineering structures often does not depend on a certain environmental load value but is the result of the simultaneous application of several environmental load factors at present the research on the estimation model of marine environment design parameters has been expanded from a single environmental factor to a joint distribution model of two or more environmental factors however these studies treat them as random variables when discussing factors such as wind waves and water increase liu et al 2019a b c d e chen et al 2019 2020 b chen et al 2019 liang et al 2019 2020 in fact factors such as wind waves and water increase change with time therefore the use of wave height water increase and other distribution function models that ignore the time factor to estimate marine environmental parameters must have its limitations how to fully consider the influence of the time factor on the changes of various marine elements and use a more reasonable distribution function model to complete the inference of the multi element joint design standard for the marine environment and then come up with a more comprehensive and more instructive design standard for construction are very important in the safe and economical marine and coastal engineering these could greatly minimize the economic losses and casualties that people suffer when extreme marine environmental load combinations occur and avoid unnecessary engineering investment waste due to high unnecessary fortification criterion extreme sea conditions generally occur during storms such as typhoons hurricanes and cold waves considering the frequency of typhoons and their induced wave heights and storm surges liu tf and ma fs liu et al 1980 yan et al 2020 liang et al 2014 in the 1970s proposed poisson gumbel composite extreme value distributions suitable for china s waters and poisson weibull composite extreme value distribution suitable for the eastern coast of the united states and the gulf of mexico the composite extreme value distribution considering the frequency and intensity of typhoons can more fully reflect the changing characteristics of waves than using only the gumbel distribution and the weibull distribution and can make more use of valuable measured data therefore after the model was put forward it has received widespread attention in the engineering and scientific circles b y chen et al 2019 dong et al 2009 in 2005 wang lp wang et al 2012 liu et al 2019a b c d e and others established a multi dimensional composite extreme value distribution model the poisson nested logistic composite extreme value distribution was used to predict the joint probabilistic characteristics of wave height period and wind speed in the yellow sea area during the typhoon occurrence chinese scholars used poisson mixed gumbel poisson log normal and other two dimensional composite extreme value distributions to discuss the joint design parameters of the marine environment under various sea conditions shao et al 2018 wu et al 2018 liu et al 2019a b c d e wang et al 2016 liu et al 2006 in recent years some researchers have proposed the maximum entropy distribution of wave height based on the principle of maximum entropy to reduce the priori of the traditional extreme value distribution wang et al 2013 ha et al 2018 goda 1989 liang et al 2013 this is a very valuable theoretical improvement of the extreme value distribution function based on the principle of maximum entropy and multi dimensional composite extreme value distribution many scholars have constructed a series of probability distribution models that can reflect the extreme wave height and extreme water level of the typhoon chen et al 2007 ulrych et al 1975 zeng et al 2016 2017 2018 wang l p wang et al 2017a b used poisson maximum entropy distribution function to analyze the risk of storm surge and analyze the sequence of extreme wave heights in the sea area of chaolian island based on the stability of the theoretical solution of the two dimensional maximum entropy distribution function tao shanshan and others carried out a joint probability design of the annual extreme wave height and accompanying wind speed in the bohai sea and also the co occurrence probability analysis of sea ice in yingkou and huludao the multi dimensional composite extreme value distribution based on the principle of maximum entropy is not only a theoretical extension of the univariate composite extreme value distribution to the multivariate extreme value distribution it can more comprehensively describe the probability of marine environmental elements under extreme sea conditions than the existing extreme value distribution function the characteristics that are taken into account are not only the frequency of typhoons or the probability characteristics of data selection but also include the combined effects of multiple extreme environmental factors in summary the multi dimensional composite extreme value distribution model based on the principle of maximum entropy is a more advanced theoretical model for the estimation of joint design parameters of the marine environment this model can reflect the impact of multiple typhoon hazards on wave height and storm flooding however the above mentioned various distribution models include the most advanced multi dimensional composite maximum entropy distribution model are all based on moment constraints in the application wind wave and water increase are considered as random variables varying with specific problems these models only perform parallel replacement and upscaling of dimensions for example weibull distribution is used to replace gumbel pearson ⅲ type distribution binomial distribution is used to replace poisson distribution and copula function is used to replace two dimensional extreme value distribution chen et al 2017 escalante et al 2016 ponce lópez et al 2016 in fact elements such as wind waves and water increase are essentially dynamic with space and time previous studies based on the level of random variables could not show the deeper statistical characteristics of marine environmental elements with random characteristics under extreme sea conditions such as the impact of time and space changes stochastic processes are often defined as the dynamic part of probability theory the random variables corresponding to wave height and water increase in previous studies of the probabilistic characteristics of marine elements are only a function of sample points or a set of sample points and are independent of time such random phenomena are called static random phenomena in fact the statistical characteristics of wave height or water increase change with time a family of random variables is needed to fully characterize their statistical characteristics and to show the development and change process of the statistical characteristics of marine environmental elements in other words to study random waves that change over time a quantitative description of the dynamic relationship and the changing process between a series of random events is needed existing multi dimensional composite extreme value distribution models are based on the principle of maximum entropy in addition to the space factors that have been considered the factors that change the statistical characteristics of marine environmental elements with time must be further considered these contents can be completed with the help of stochastic process theory based on the stochastic process theory this paper constructs a nested stochastic compound distribution pattern which is a new model for joint design parameter estimation of the marine environment this model can reflect the interrelationships between different time scales of each marine environmental element itself as well as the relationships between various timescales of different elements in other words this derivation of subsequent statistical characteristics of marine environmental elements can be applied not only to the study of the statistical characteristics of a single marine environmental element but also to the correlation analysis of the interaction of multiple marine environmental elements and can be obtained in different time periods according to the needs of the actual project statistical results in various other fields as well fu et al 2019 2020 liu et al 2019 2020a b deng et al 2019 2020a 2020b xu et al 2019 wen et al 2019 w liu et al 2020a 2 nested random composite distribution 2 1 wave height based on stochastic processes the wave height at a specified time of the day at the observation point is a random variable and the wave height at the above point is a random function of time t at a specified period of time every day the following uses random process theory to study these random functions treat a certain marine environment element wave height as a random process to build its mathematical model wave heights are treated as random processes x t ς ς n t t that are actually binary functions of two variables one of the variables is ς in the sample space ω and the other is t in the parameter set t let the wave height be the deterministic function of the observation ς the independent variable is the element in the set ω and its domain is the sample space ω take a wave height observation every time t passes a series of observations obtained at the same time t constitute a set of random variables for each observation ς in the ω specifies a time t then the deterministic function for ς can be written as x t specify the time function in this way and repeat the measurement to get a family of functions x t ς this family of functions is a random process it is also a family of random variables that depend on the time parameter t the above is a description when the wave height is regarded as a random process and is written as x t ς ς n t t specifically expressed as the following four cases 1 when ς t are variables x t is a family of time functions which represents a random process 2 when ς is fixed t changes x t is a function of time t we call this function a stochastic process x t ς t t a sample function or an implementation corresponding to ς take a long measurement to get a wave height time curve x 1 t it is the sample curve run another experiment to get another sample curve x 2 t similarly get the sample curve for the nth experiment x n t the sample curve from one experiment is random the above test means that using a wave meter under the same conditions a long time recording of random waves can obtain a sample function x i t denotes the i th sample function that is x t ς 1 x t ς 2 x t ς n in which x t ς i x i t in the mathematical definition of a stochastic process the sample space ω can generally be understood as the entirety of the sample function and each sample curve as a basic event the entire sample function x t constitutes the sample space ω that is the entire x t ς i i 1 2 n constitutes the sample space ω 3 when t is fixed and ς changes x t is a random variable when t t i the value x t i would be examined the first experimental value is x 1 t i the second experimental value is x 2 t i and so on x t i ς 1 x t i ς 2 x t i ς k it means measuring by k wave meters under the same conditions at the same time t i the k wave measuring instruments with the same performance are recorded at the same time which is expressed as x t i obviously x t i is a random variable so when t is fixed the wave height is a random variable liu et al 2019a b c d e and when t changes x t t t is a family of random variables this x t i is called the state of stochastic process x t when t t i all possible values for a random variable x t t is fixed and t t form a real number set which is called the state space or range of the stochastic process each possible value is called a state and all states form a state space stochastic processes can be classified according to the parameters t and the state space 4 when both ς and t are given the wave height x t is a scalar or vector the difference between wave height as a random variable and as a random process is that the former is the test result at a fixed time t and is a set of time functions similarly water addition y as a stochastic process is also a deterministic function of observation ς which can be described by a family of functions y s ς specifying a time s for each observation ς the deterministic function can be written as y s for ς considering all the different observations ς water increase y s represents a family of functions the family of functions represented by this y s is also a stochastic process it is also a family of random variables that depend on the time parameter s which can be recorded as y s ς ς n s t 2 2 constructing distribution mode theorem let the joint distribution function of two stochastic processes x t y s at any time be g x y t s and its joint density function exists as g x y t s g x t is a one dimensional distribution function for x t at time t x t can be regarded as the wave height during the typhoon and y s is the water increase in the same period the wave height and water increase do not require or depend on synchronization the k th independent observation of the stochastic process x t at time t is recorded as ς k t k 1 2 n let ξ n t max 1 i n ς i t i 1 2 n it can be known from the probability theory that g x t n is the distribution function of ξ n t η k s is the observations for y s in the same period n t is an independent stochastic process to x t y s with non negative integers the probability distribution at time

which can be used to discuss the joint probability characteristics of the typhoon affecting the wave height and water increase at any time when n t is a poisson process the nested random composite

constructed nested random composite distribution pattern covers the probability distribution patterns of typhoon affecting wave height and water increase in the current research it can effectively analyze the deeper statistical mechanism and trajectory of data fluctuations comprehensively display the in depth statistical characteristics of the elements from the marine environment and the profound connections based on the essential patterns in engineering applications n t can be set based on engineering facts such as the number of typhoons that occur in the sea area or the number of threshold crossings after the set threshold x t y s can be taken as wave height water increase or other settings based on engineering facts the parameters to be determined in the equation will vary with the different stations in the study area and different measured data will yield different parameters 3 engineering application naozhou station is located on naozhou island in the leizhou bay sea area of china the eastern coastline of the leizhou peninsula is arc shaped and recessed westward naozhou station is right in the large scale bay mouth which is prone to long periods of storm surge of many occurrences and high intensity therefore this paper uses the typhoon historic data from naozhou hydrological station in western guangdong china from year 1990 2016 missing year 2004 and 2007 and its measured water increase and the corresponding maximum wave height data for analysis and calculation typhoon data is composed of wind speed data observed four times a day during the duration of typhoons passing through naozhou and wave height and water increase data are corresponding measured data during the typhoon period the measured wave height and water increase data from this station during the typhoon are random variables and the extreme wave height and accompanying water increase are also random variables through continuous observation continuous wave height and water increase observation values can be obtained they are a function of time all measured data of wave height and water increase constitute the observation sample space for research in this example fix time t and set a time interval δ t of one year that is the data is sampled every 12 months at this time a cluster of random variables of wave height is obtained with the same processing a cluster of water increase random variables can be obtained the following a sequence groups are wave height and water increase data sets of the same year and the b sequence groups are wave height and water increase data sets of different years 1 synchronous time data of wave height and water increase a1 is the sequence of wave height data sets from 1990 to 2016 a2 is the sequence of water increase data sets of synchronous time 2 asynchronous time data of wave height and water increase b1 is the sequence of wave height data set from 1990 to 2012 and b2 is the sequence of water increase data set from 1994 to 2016 the following is a joint probability analysis of wave height and water increase figs 1 and 2 are test diagnosis charts of wave height and water increase data sets b1 and b2 in the figure a is the probability distribution graph b is the quantile graph c is the reproduction level graph and d is the density histogram it can be seen from the figure that the two data sets b1 and b2 conform to the generalized extreme value distribution and can be used as samples for edge analysis the typhoon surges that occurred during the same period in the western guangdong waters were selected for discussion the number of typhoon occurrences in each of the time intervals discussed conforms to the poisson distribution kroese et al 2013 muhaisen et al 2010 jiang et al 2019 feng et al 2019 p k e λ λ 1 k k parameter λ is the most important parameter it indicates the average number of typhoons per year in the western guangdong waters whose moment estimation is λ n 1 i 1 n k i k i is the number of typhoons occur over a period of discussion fig 3a 3b and 3c are fitting graphs of the frequency of typhoons on weizhou island from 1990 to 2016 1994 to 2016 and 1990 to 2012 respectively the joint distribution function in the nested stochastic compound distribution model is linked by copula functions the statistical characteristics of each univariate and the correlation between univariate can be obtained by discussing the kendall rank correlation coefficient and also by the relationship between the parameters to be determined in the copula function and the kendall rank correlation coefficient in engineering applications the g u v t s function can be used for return level estimation with the help of the copula connection function that connects two edge distributions and determines the parameters in the model from the measured data this article uses the correlation index method liu et al 2018 song et al 2019 performed parameter estimation of functions by establishing a relationship of θ with kendall rank correlation coefficient τ the kendall rank correlation coefficient between the wave height and the water enhancement is calculated as τ a 0 4867 according to the relationship of θ with θ and the positive correlation between the two groups of variables the parameters of several copula functions are shown in table 1 by fitting the two groups of data in order to select the copula function with better fitting effect the square euclidean distance is used for the fit test when the copula function is determined the square euclidean distance method is used to obtain the distance between the empirical copula function and the fitted copula function the smaller the distance the better the fitting effect of the copula function the calculation results are shown in table 2 it can be seen from the table that the sum of squared deviations of the gumbel copula function is the smallest that is the gumbel copula function has the best fitting effect between water increase and wave height see table 3 when it is not possible to determine what kind of load the proposed platform is mainly subjected to usually two series of data of the maximum wave height and accompanying water increase can be used to estimate the wave height and corresponding water increase that occur once in a century researchers have different interpretations of the meaning of corresponding liu et al 2019a b c d e liu et al 2019a b c d e xu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 from the perspective of mathematical theoretical research the probability distribution curve can completely describe the statistical law of random variables but from a practical point of view due to the influence of various uncertain factors such as data quality and geographical location it is sometimes not convenient to use complete function form to explain random variables at this time one only needs to know some representative values to explain the main statistical characteristics of the random variable distribution some characteristic values that can explain the statistical law of random variables are thus termed as statistical parameters mode is such a position characteristic parameter it is the value of the group with the highest frequency of the sample observations in the frequency distribution table in the probability density curve it is the position value of the peak top value on the x coordinate recorded as m x for a discrete random variable x when p i p i 1 and p i p i 1 the corresponding x i values of p i on the x axis is the mode of the distribution for continuous random variables the mode is the value of x where the density function f x is at its maximum since mode is an important statistic for measuring the trend of the data set it represents the most likely value in the data space and can reflect the characteristics for the value of the data subject therefore in this paper under the condition of one hundred year wave height the mode of the probability density function of water increase is selected as the water increase corresponding to the wave height and the joint recurrence period of wave height and water increase is discussed figs 4 7 are the respective distribution function diagram density function diagram distribution function contour map and density function contour map of the wave height and water increase sequence from the nested random composite distribution patterns at a given moment the nested stochastic compound distribution pattern shown in eq 9 and the density function shown in eq 10 are binary functions when the wave height and water level take their respective values according to the expressions and related calculations you will get a corresponding probability p the coordinate values of the three variables of wave height water augmentation and probability in space to determine a point and so on all the coordinates formed in space to connect the values which constitutes the distribution function diagram and density function diagram of wave height and water augmentation sequences in figs 4 and 5 the distribution function and density function graphs shown in figs 4 and 5 giving different values of probability to get the distribution function and density function contour maps shown in figs 6 and 7 see table 4 the nested stochastic compound distribution model is used to calculate the data sets ⅰ and ⅱ under the condition of wave height of one hundred years table 5 data set ⅰ is the synchronous data of wave height and water increase from 1990 to 2016 for 25 years missing 2004 and 2007 typhoons occur on average 3 24 times a year in the western guangdong waters it is a combination of a1 and a2 data sets and their correlation coefficients and rank correlation coefficients are 0 7171 and 0 4867 respectively data group ⅱ is the synchronized data of wave height and water increase for 17 years from 1998 to 2016 missing 2004 and 2007 typhoon occurred at an annual average of 3 68 times it is part of the short data set of the a1 and a2 data sets the correlation coefficient and rank correlation coefficient are 0 8080 and 0 5221 the nested stochastic compound distribution pattern was used to calculate the sequence of b1 wave height data sets from 1990 to 2012 and the sequence of b2 water augmentation data sets delayed from 4 years from 1994 to 2016 while using the λ value of b1 time period λ 3 31 that is the average number of typhoons that occur in this sea area is 3 31 times per year and their correlation coefficients and kendall rank correlation coefficients are 0 0728 and 0 0524 respectively the calculation results are shown in table 6 the kendall rank correlation coefficient can be used instead of pearson when the data set does not satisfy the conditions of normal distribution and equal spacing the linear correlation coefficients were used to measure the strength of the association between the variables the pearson correlation coefficients for data group i and data group ii were 0 7171 and 0 8080 respectively and they had good of the linear correlation the distribution of the rank correlation coefficients is 0 4867 and 0 5221 which has a high degree of harmony the definition of the kendall rank correlation coefficient zhe et al 2018 wang et al 2017a b xu and wei 2019 xu and lei 2019 is based on the robust mahalanobis distance which measures the rank correlation between variables and in engineering practice the harmony measure demonstrates whether the magnitude of the change in the rank of two pairs compared before and after is in the same or opposite direction and for anomalous data the rank correlation coefficient will appear to increase the slope of the computed result therefore in the extreme value distribution which is appropriate for applying kendall rank and when the kendall rank correlation coefficient is equal to 0 4867 and 0 5221 it indicates the highly synchronous existence in other words the data are harmonious for the unsynchronized b1 and b2 data sets the person correlation coefficient is 0 0728 indicating that the two are barely formed in the linear relationship with a rank correlation coefficient of 0 0524 suggesting that other aspects of the two data sets are also weakly related and thus can be considered nearly independent the projection of the combined return period of wave height and water increase during a typhoon is the primary concern of project flood control the calculation uses measured data to determine the edge distribution at a given moment f x t f y s as well as the parameters f 0 x y t s to be determined in equation 9 and with the help of the relationship 13 t 1 p x t x y s y 1 1 f x t f y s f 0 x y t s determine the level of return of the wave height and water increase for the corresponding 50 100 200 and 500 year return periods for a given time and space of wave height or water increase and obtain their corresponding joint return periods the frequency of tropical storms has increased year by year due to global warming accordingly typhoons have hit the southeast coast of china more frequently and various disasters caused by typhoon surges have been shocking therefore in the calculation of the combined frequency two large return periods of 50 years and 100 years are used for storm surge and wave height apply the nested stochastic compound distribution model to the a series data and calculate the nested stochastic compound model to calculate different combinations the joint recurrence period of the product event of wave height and water increase under different return periods is shown in table 7 it can be seen from table 5 that as the frequency of typhoons increases the design water increase value is also increasing which is obviously in line with the actual project under the 50 year return period the design water increase value of data group ⅰis 3 62 lower than that of data group ii at the 500 year return period the design water increase value of data group ⅰ is 4 22 lower than that of data group ii the new model s calculated design parameters based on long term measured data are similar to those calculated with only short term measured data derivation of new model is based on rigorous mathematical theory in the case where the observation station only uses short term data the joint design parameters derived using the new model have certain reference value after calculation the water increase values calculated from the asynchronous data and the 50 100 200 500 and 1000 once in a hundred year wave heights simultaneously calculated from the synchronous 25 year data differ by 2 64 3 07 and 3 21 respectively 0 87 3 02 the results of the data are not much different from those of the synchronous data and the linear and grade correlations of the two sets of data are very weak in this case the new model can be used to derive a calculation result that is not much different from the synchronous data the new model has statistical characteristics different from any previous model it can make fuller use of the data and it is theoretically feasible the conditional probability calculated by the nested random composite distribution model can comprehensively characterize the statistical properties of asynchronous data which is advanced in theory table 7 uses the specific expressions of the nested random composite distribution to calculate the joint recurrence period of the combination of different moments in the typhoon affecting the sea dynamic changes of factors such as water increase can provide more reliable data for engineering applications which is a direction worthy of in depth research 4 conclusion this article gives a rigorous mathematical description of the elements of the marine environment such as wave heights as random processes by constructing a nested stochastic composite distribution model using the long term observation data of the 25 year effective wave height and water increase at weizhou station in the western guangdong waters as a sample a joint probability analysis of the effective wave height and water increase of the typhoon affected sea area was performed 1 correlation coefficients and kendall rank correlation coefficients of wave height and water increase synchronous data are 0 7171 and 0 4867 respectively correlation coefficients and kendall rank correlation coefficients of asynchronous data are 0 0728 and 0 0429 2 when the number of typhoons in a certain sea area is a poisson process an explicit expression of the nested random composite distribution pattern at a certain time is given which is convenient for engineering applications 3 the nested stochastic compound distribution model can appropriately reduce the length of the measured data in the case where the data is short but requires a large return period the calculated joint design parameters have a certain stability 4 the nested stochastic composite distribution model can reflect the relationship between marine environment elements at different time scales based on the auto correlation and cross correlation between waves and water increase and based on the statistical characteristics of the current marine environmental elements the statistical characteristics of the environmental elements at different subsequent moments are derived this kind of derivation of subsequent states based on a stochastic process can be applied not only to the study of the statistical characteristics of a single environmental element such as wave height or water increase but also to the study of the joint probabilistic characteristics of multiple elements that interact with each other and can be used across time according to the needs of the actual project

21544,reasonably determining the fortification criterion is one of the important links in the design of breakwaters and flood walls and it is directly related to the construction cost and protection efficiency of these engineering works wave height is one of the most important element of the marine environment determined by the breakwater and flood protection standards based on the stochastic process theory this paper gives a mathematical description of the stochastic process that can reflect the deeper level of statistical characteristics regarding the wave heights by regarding the number of typhoons in a certain sea area as a poisson process this paper establishes a new model for the joint probability analysis of marine environmental elements the nested random composite distribution model and it gives the display expression of the new model we also take typhoon data wave height and water increase data under typhoon influence from weizhou hydrological station in western guangdong china from 1990 to 2016 as samples and use the gumbel pareto distribution as the edge distribution to apply the nested random composite distribution model to typhoon affected sea areas the joint recurrence period under different time combinations is calculated and the joint statistical characteristics of the same element or different elements in different periods are also given keywords stochastic process design criteria joint recurrence period wave height typhoon 1 research background the marine environment conditions for marine and coastal engineering are often very harsh and they are greatly affected by severe weather processes such as typhoons and cold waves in addition marine and coastal engineering are expensive to construct and the responsibility for protection is significant once damaged economic losses and casualties will be difficult to estimate the failure or even destruction of most engineering structures often does not depend on a certain environmental load value but is the result of the simultaneous application of several environmental load factors at present the research on the estimation model of marine environment design parameters has been expanded from a single environmental factor to a joint distribution model of two or more environmental factors however these studies treat them as random variables when discussing factors such as wind waves and water increase liu et al 2019a b c d e chen et al 2019 2020 b chen et al 2019 liang et al 2019 2020 in fact factors such as wind waves and water increase change with time therefore the use of wave height water increase and other distribution function models that ignore the time factor to estimate marine environmental parameters must have its limitations how to fully consider the influence of the time factor on the changes of various marine elements and use a more reasonable distribution function model to complete the inference of the multi element joint design standard for the marine environment and then come up with a more comprehensive and more instructive design standard for construction are very important in the safe and economical marine and coastal engineering these could greatly minimize the economic losses and casualties that people suffer when extreme marine environmental load combinations occur and avoid unnecessary engineering investment waste due to high unnecessary fortification criterion extreme sea conditions generally occur during storms such as typhoons hurricanes and cold waves considering the frequency of typhoons and their induced wave heights and storm surges liu tf and ma fs liu et al 1980 yan et al 2020 liang et al 2014 in the 1970s proposed poisson gumbel composite extreme value distributions suitable for china s waters and poisson weibull composite extreme value distribution suitable for the eastern coast of the united states and the gulf of mexico the composite extreme value distribution considering the frequency and intensity of typhoons can more fully reflect the changing characteristics of waves than using only the gumbel distribution and the weibull distribution and can make more use of valuable measured data therefore after the model was put forward it has received widespread attention in the engineering and scientific circles b y chen et al 2019 dong et al 2009 in 2005 wang lp wang et al 2012 liu et al 2019a b c d e and others established a multi dimensional composite extreme value distribution model the poisson nested logistic composite extreme value distribution was used to predict the joint probabilistic characteristics of wave height period and wind speed in the yellow sea area during the typhoon occurrence chinese scholars used poisson mixed gumbel poisson log normal and other two dimensional composite extreme value distributions to discuss the joint design parameters of the marine environment under various sea conditions shao et al 2018 wu et al 2018 liu et al 2019a b c d e wang et al 2016 liu et al 2006 in recent years some researchers have proposed the maximum entropy distribution of wave height based on the principle of maximum entropy to reduce the priori of the traditional extreme value distribution wang et al 2013 ha et al 2018 goda 1989 liang et al 2013 this is a very valuable theoretical improvement of the extreme value distribution function based on the principle of maximum entropy and multi dimensional composite extreme value distribution many scholars have constructed a series of probability distribution models that can reflect the extreme wave height and extreme water level of the typhoon chen et al 2007 ulrych et al 1975 zeng et al 2016 2017 2018 wang l p wang et al 2017a b used poisson maximum entropy distribution function to analyze the risk of storm surge and analyze the sequence of extreme wave heights in the sea area of chaolian island based on the stability of the theoretical solution of the two dimensional maximum entropy distribution function tao shanshan and others carried out a joint probability design of the annual extreme wave height and accompanying wind speed in the bohai sea and also the co occurrence probability analysis of sea ice in yingkou and huludao the multi dimensional composite extreme value distribution based on the principle of maximum entropy is not only a theoretical extension of the univariate composite extreme value distribution to the multivariate extreme value distribution it can more comprehensively describe the probability of marine environmental elements under extreme sea conditions than the existing extreme value distribution function the characteristics that are taken into account are not only the frequency of typhoons or the probability characteristics of data selection but also include the combined effects of multiple extreme environmental factors in summary the multi dimensional composite extreme value distribution model based on the principle of maximum entropy is a more advanced theoretical model for the estimation of joint design parameters of the marine environment this model can reflect the impact of multiple typhoon hazards on wave height and storm flooding however the above mentioned various distribution models include the most advanced multi dimensional composite maximum entropy distribution model are all based on moment constraints in the application wind wave and water increase are considered as random variables varying with specific problems these models only perform parallel replacement and upscaling of dimensions for example weibull distribution is used to replace gumbel pearson ⅲ type distribution binomial distribution is used to replace poisson distribution and copula function is used to replace two dimensional extreme value distribution chen et al 2017 escalante et al 2016 ponce lópez et al 2016 in fact elements such as wind waves and water increase are essentially dynamic with space and time previous studies based on the level of random variables could not show the deeper statistical characteristics of marine environmental elements with random characteristics under extreme sea conditions such as the impact of time and space changes stochastic processes are often defined as the dynamic part of probability theory the random variables corresponding to wave height and water increase in previous studies of the probabilistic characteristics of marine elements are only a function of sample points or a set of sample points and are independent of time such random phenomena are called static random phenomena in fact the statistical characteristics of wave height or water increase change with time a family of random variables is needed to fully characterize their statistical characteristics and to show the development and change process of the statistical characteristics of marine environmental elements in other words to study random waves that change over time a quantitative description of the dynamic relationship and the changing process between a series of random events is needed existing multi dimensional composite extreme value distribution models are based on the principle of maximum entropy in addition to the space factors that have been considered the factors that change the statistical characteristics of marine environmental elements with time must be further considered these contents can be completed with the help of stochastic process theory based on the stochastic process theory this paper constructs a nested stochastic compound distribution pattern which is a new model for joint design parameter estimation of the marine environment this model can reflect the interrelationships between different time scales of each marine environmental element itself as well as the relationships between various timescales of different elements in other words this derivation of subsequent statistical characteristics of marine environmental elements can be applied not only to the study of the statistical characteristics of a single marine environmental element but also to the correlation analysis of the interaction of multiple marine environmental elements and can be obtained in different time periods according to the needs of the actual project statistical results in various other fields as well fu et al 2019 2020 liu et al 2019 2020a b deng et al 2019 2020a 2020b xu et al 2019 wen et al 2019 w liu et al 2020a 2 nested random composite distribution 2 1 wave height based on stochastic processes the wave height at a specified time of the day at the observation point is a random variable and the wave height at the above point is a random function of time t at a specified period of time every day the following uses random process theory to study these random functions treat a certain marine environment element wave height as a random process to build its mathematical model wave heights are treated as random processes x t ς ς n t t that are actually binary functions of two variables one of the variables is ς in the sample space ω and the other is t in the parameter set t let the wave height be the deterministic function of the observation ς the independent variable is the element in the set ω and its domain is the sample space ω take a wave height observation every time t passes a series of observations obtained at the same time t constitute a set of random variables for each observation ς in the ω specifies a time t then the deterministic function for ς can be written as x t specify the time function in this way and repeat the measurement to get a family of functions x t ς this family of functions is a random process it is also a family of random variables that depend on the time parameter t the above is a description when the wave height is regarded as a random process and is written as x t ς ς n t t specifically expressed as the following four cases 1 when ς t are variables x t is a family of time functions which represents a random process 2 when ς is fixed t changes x t is a function of time t we call this function a stochastic process x t ς t t a sample function or an implementation corresponding to ς take a long measurement to get a wave height time curve x 1 t it is the sample curve run another experiment to get another sample curve x 2 t similarly get the sample curve for the nth experiment x n t the sample curve from one experiment is random the above test means that using a wave meter under the same conditions a long time recording of random waves can obtain a sample function x i t denotes the i th sample function that is x t ς 1 x t ς 2 x t ς n in which x t ς i x i t in the mathematical definition of a stochastic process the sample space ω can generally be understood as the entirety of the sample function and each sample curve as a basic event the entire sample function x t constitutes the sample space ω that is the entire x t ς i i 1 2 n constitutes the sample space ω 3 when t is fixed and ς changes x t is a random variable when t t i the value x t i would be examined the first experimental value is x 1 t i the second experimental value is x 2 t i and so on x t i ς 1 x t i ς 2 x t i ς k it means measuring by k wave meters under the same conditions at the same time t i the k wave measuring instruments with the same performance are recorded at the same time which is expressed as x t i obviously x t i is a random variable so when t is fixed the wave height is a random variable liu et al 2019a b c d e and when t changes x t t t is a family of random variables this x t i is called the state of stochastic process x t when t t i all possible values for a random variable x t t is fixed and t t form a real number set which is called the state space or range of the stochastic process each possible value is called a state and all states form a state space stochastic processes can be classified according to the parameters t and the state space 4 when both ς and t are given the wave height x t is a scalar or vector the difference between wave height as a random variable and as a random process is that the former is the test result at a fixed time t and is a set of time functions similarly water addition y as a stochastic process is also a deterministic function of observation ς which can be described by a family of functions y s ς specifying a time s for each observation ς the deterministic function can be written as y s for ς considering all the different observations ς water increase y s represents a family of functions the family of functions represented by this y s is also a stochastic process it is also a family of random variables that depend on the time parameter s which can be recorded as y s ς ς n s t 2 2 constructing distribution mode theorem let the joint distribution function of two stochastic processes x t y s at any time be g x y t s and its joint density function exists as g x y t s g x t is a one dimensional distribution function for x t at time t x t can be regarded as the wave height during the typhoon and y s is the water increase in the same period the wave height and water increase do not require or depend on synchronization the k th independent observation of the stochastic process x t at time t is recorded as ς k t k 1 2 n let ξ n t max 1 i n ς i t i 1 2 n it can be known from the probability theory that g x t n is the distribution function of ξ n t η k s is the observations for y s in the same period n t is an independent stochastic process to x t y s with non negative integers the probability distribution at time

which can be used to discuss the joint probability characteristics of the typhoon affecting the wave height and water increase at any time when n t is a poisson process the nested random composite

constructed nested random composite distribution pattern covers the probability distribution patterns of typhoon affecting wave height and water increase in the current research it can effectively analyze the deeper statistical mechanism and trajectory of data fluctuations comprehensively display the in depth statistical characteristics of the elements from the marine environment and the profound connections based on the essential patterns in engineering applications n t can be set based on engineering facts such as the number of typhoons that occur in the sea area or the number of threshold crossings after the set threshold x t y s can be taken as wave height water increase or other settings based on engineering facts the parameters to be determined in the equation will vary with the different stations in the study area and different measured data will yield different parameters 3 engineering application naozhou station is located on naozhou island in the leizhou bay sea area of china the eastern coastline of the leizhou peninsula is arc shaped and recessed westward naozhou station is right in the large scale bay mouth which is prone to long periods of storm surge of many occurrences and high intensity therefore this paper uses the typhoon historic data from naozhou hydrological station in western guangdong china from year 1990 2016 missing year 2004 and 2007 and its measured water increase and the corresponding maximum wave height data for analysis and calculation typhoon data is composed of wind speed data observed four times a day during the duration of typhoons passing through naozhou and wave height and water increase data are corresponding measured data during the typhoon period the measured wave height and water increase data from this station during the typhoon are random variables and the extreme wave height and accompanying water increase are also random variables through continuous observation continuous wave height and water increase observation values can be obtained they are a function of time all measured data of wave height and water increase constitute the observation sample space for research in this example fix time t and set a time interval δ t of one year that is the data is sampled every 12 months at this time a cluster of random variables of wave height is obtained with the same processing a cluster of water increase random variables can be obtained the following a sequence groups are wave height and water increase data sets of the same year and the b sequence groups are wave height and water increase data sets of different years 1 synchronous time data of wave height and water increase a1 is the sequence of wave height data sets from 1990 to 2016 a2 is the sequence of water increase data sets of synchronous time 2 asynchronous time data of wave height and water increase b1 is the sequence of wave height data set from 1990 to 2012 and b2 is the sequence of water increase data set from 1994 to 2016 the following is a joint probability analysis of wave height and water increase figs 1 and 2 are test diagnosis charts of wave height and water increase data sets b1 and b2 in the figure a is the probability distribution graph b is the quantile graph c is the reproduction level graph and d is the density histogram it can be seen from the figure that the two data sets b1 and b2 conform to the generalized extreme value distribution and can be used as samples for edge analysis the typhoon surges that occurred during the same period in the western guangdong waters were selected for discussion the number of typhoon occurrences in each of the time intervals discussed conforms to the poisson distribution kroese et al 2013 muhaisen et al 2010 jiang et al 2019 feng et al 2019 p k e λ λ 1 k k parameter λ is the most important parameter it indicates the average number of typhoons per year in the western guangdong waters whose moment estimation is λ n 1 i 1 n k i k i is the number of typhoons occur over a period of discussion fig 3a 3b and 3c are fitting graphs of the frequency of typhoons on weizhou island from 1990 to 2016 1994 to 2016 and 1990 to 2012 respectively the joint distribution function in the nested stochastic compound distribution model is linked by copula functions the statistical characteristics of each univariate and the correlation between univariate can be obtained by discussing the kendall rank correlation coefficient and also by the relationship between the parameters to be determined in the copula function and the kendall rank correlation coefficient in engineering applications the g u v t s function can be used for return level estimation with the help of the copula connection function that connects two edge distributions and determines the parameters in the model from the measured data this article uses the correlation index method liu et al 2018 song et al 2019 performed parameter estimation of functions by establishing a relationship of θ with kendall rank correlation coefficient τ the kendall rank correlation coefficient between the wave height and the water enhancement is calculated as τ a 0 4867 according to the relationship of θ with θ and the positive correlation between the two groups of variables the parameters of several copula functions are shown in table 1 by fitting the two groups of data in order to select the copula function with better fitting effect the square euclidean distance is used for the fit test when the copula function is determined the square euclidean distance method is used to obtain the distance between the empirical copula function and the fitted copula function the smaller the distance the better the fitting effect of the copula function the calculation results are shown in table 2 it can be seen from the table that the sum of squared deviations of the gumbel copula function is the smallest that is the gumbel copula function has the best fitting effect between water increase and wave height see table 3 when it is not possible to determine what kind of load the proposed platform is mainly subjected to usually two series of data of the maximum wave height and accompanying water increase can be used to estimate the wave height and corresponding water increase that occur once in a century researchers have different interpretations of the meaning of corresponding liu et al 2019a b c d e liu et al 2019a b c d e xu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 from the perspective of mathematical theoretical research the probability distribution curve can completely describe the statistical law of random variables but from a practical point of view due to the influence of various uncertain factors such as data quality and geographical location it is sometimes not convenient to use complete function form to explain random variables at this time one only needs to know some representative values to explain the main statistical characteristics of the random variable distribution some characteristic values that can explain the statistical law of random variables are thus termed as statistical parameters mode is such a position characteristic parameter it is the value of the group with the highest frequency of the sample observations in the frequency distribution table in the probability density curve it is the position value of the peak top value on the x coordinate recorded as m x for a discrete random variable x when p i p i 1 and p i p i 1 the corresponding x i values of p i on the x axis is the mode of the distribution for continuous random variables the mode is the value of x where the density function f x is at its maximum since mode is an important statistic for measuring the trend of the data set it represents the most likely value in the data space and can reflect the characteristics for the value of the data subject therefore in this paper under the condition of one hundred year wave height the mode of the probability density function of water increase is selected as the water increase corresponding to the wave height and the joint recurrence period of wave height and water increase is discussed figs 4 7 are the respective distribution function diagram density function diagram distribution function contour map and density function contour map of the wave height and water increase sequence from the nested random composite distribution patterns at a given moment the nested stochastic compound distribution pattern shown in eq 9 and the density function shown in eq 10 are binary functions when the wave height and water level take their respective values according to the expressions and related calculations you will get a corresponding probability p the coordinate values of the three variables of wave height water augmentation and probability in space to determine a point and so on all the coordinates formed in space to connect the values which constitutes the distribution function diagram and density function diagram of wave height and water augmentation sequences in figs 4 and 5 the distribution function and density function graphs shown in figs 4 and 5 giving different values of probability to get the distribution function and density function contour maps shown in figs 6 and 7 see table 4 the nested stochastic compound distribution model is used to calculate the data sets ⅰ and ⅱ under the condition of wave height of one hundred years table 5 data set ⅰ is the synchronous data of wave height and water increase from 1990 to 2016 for 25 years missing 2004 and 2007 typhoons occur on average 3 24 times a year in the western guangdong waters it is a combination of a1 and a2 data sets and their correlation coefficients and rank correlation coefficients are 0 7171 and 0 4867 respectively data group ⅱ is the synchronized data of wave height and water increase for 17 years from 1998 to 2016 missing 2004 and 2007 typhoon occurred at an annual average of 3 68 times it is part of the short data set of the a1 and a2 data sets the correlation coefficient and rank correlation coefficient are 0 8080 and 0 5221 the nested stochastic compound distribution pattern was used to calculate the sequence of b1 wave height data sets from 1990 to 2012 and the sequence of b2 water augmentation data sets delayed from 4 years from 1994 to 2016 while using the λ value of b1 time period λ 3 31 that is the average number of typhoons that occur in this sea area is 3 31 times per year and their correlation coefficients and kendall rank correlation coefficients are 0 0728 and 0 0524 respectively the calculation results are shown in table 6 the kendall rank correlation coefficient can be used instead of pearson when the data set does not satisfy the conditions of normal distribution and equal spacing the linear correlation coefficients were used to measure the strength of the association between the variables the pearson correlation coefficients for data group i and data group ii were 0 7171 and 0 8080 respectively and they had good of the linear correlation the distribution of the rank correlation coefficients is 0 4867 and 0 5221 which has a high degree of harmony the definition of the kendall rank correlation coefficient zhe et al 2018 wang et al 2017a b xu and wei 2019 xu and lei 2019 is based on the robust mahalanobis distance which measures the rank correlation between variables and in engineering practice the harmony measure demonstrates whether the magnitude of the change in the rank of two pairs compared before and after is in the same or opposite direction and for anomalous data the rank correlation coefficient will appear to increase the slope of the computed result therefore in the extreme value distribution which is appropriate for applying kendall rank and when the kendall rank correlation coefficient is equal to 0 4867 and 0 5221 it indicates the highly synchronous existence in other words the data are harmonious for the unsynchronized b1 and b2 data sets the person correlation coefficient is 0 0728 indicating that the two are barely formed in the linear relationship with a rank correlation coefficient of 0 0524 suggesting that other aspects of the two data sets are also weakly related and thus can be considered nearly independent the projection of the combined return period of wave height and water increase during a typhoon is the primary concern of project flood control the calculation uses measured data to determine the edge distribution at a given moment f x t f y s as well as the parameters f 0 x y t s to be determined in equation 9 and with the help of the relationship 13 t 1 p x t x y s y 1 1 f x t f y s f 0 x y t s determine the level of return of the wave height and water increase for the corresponding 50 100 200 and 500 year return periods for a given time and space of wave height or water increase and obtain their corresponding joint return periods the frequency of tropical storms has increased year by year due to global warming accordingly typhoons have hit the southeast coast of china more frequently and various disasters caused by typhoon surges have been shocking therefore in the calculation of the combined frequency two large return periods of 50 years and 100 years are used for storm surge and wave height apply the nested stochastic compound distribution model to the a series data and calculate the nested stochastic compound model to calculate different combinations the joint recurrence period of the product event of wave height and water increase under different return periods is shown in table 7 it can be seen from table 5 that as the frequency of typhoons increases the design water increase value is also increasing which is obviously in line with the actual project under the 50 year return period the design water increase value of data group ⅰis 3 62 lower than that of data group ii at the 500 year return period the design water increase value of data group ⅰ is 4 22 lower than that of data group ii the new model s calculated design parameters based on long term measured data are similar to those calculated with only short term measured data derivation of new model is based on rigorous mathematical theory in the case where the observation station only uses short term data the joint design parameters derived using the new model have certain reference value after calculation the water increase values calculated from the asynchronous data and the 50 100 200 500 and 1000 once in a hundred year wave heights simultaneously calculated from the synchronous 25 year data differ by 2 64 3 07 and 3 21 respectively 0 87 3 02 the results of the data are not much different from those of the synchronous data and the linear and grade correlations of the two sets of data are very weak in this case the new model can be used to derive a calculation result that is not much different from the synchronous data the new model has statistical characteristics different from any previous model it can make fuller use of the data and it is theoretically feasible the conditional probability calculated by the nested random composite distribution model can comprehensively characterize the statistical properties of asynchronous data which is advanced in theory table 7 uses the specific expressions of the nested random composite distribution to calculate the joint recurrence period of the combination of different moments in the typhoon affecting the sea dynamic changes of factors such as water increase can provide more reliable data for engineering applications which is a direction worthy of in depth research 4 conclusion this article gives a rigorous mathematical description of the elements of the marine environment such as wave heights as random processes by constructing a nested stochastic composite distribution model using the long term observation data of the 25 year effective wave height and water increase at weizhou station in the western guangdong waters as a sample a joint probability analysis of the effective wave height and water increase of the typhoon affected sea area was performed 1 correlation coefficients and kendall rank correlation coefficients of wave height and water increase synchronous data are 0 7171 and 0 4867 respectively correlation coefficients and kendall rank correlation coefficients of asynchronous data are 0 0728 and 0 0429 2 when the number of typhoons in a certain sea area is a poisson process an explicit expression of the nested random composite distribution pattern at a certain time is given which is convenient for engineering applications 3 the nested stochastic compound distribution model can appropriately reduce the length of the measured data in the case where the data is short but requires a large return period the calculated joint design parameters have a certain stability 4 the nested stochastic composite distribution model can reflect the relationship between marine environment elements at different time scales based on the auto correlation and cross correlation between waves and water increase and based on the statistical characteristics of the current marine environmental elements the statistical characteristics of the environmental elements at different subsequent moments are derived this kind of derivation of subsequent states based on a stochastic process can be applied not only to the study of the statistical characteristics of a single environmental element such as wave height or water increase but also to the study of the joint probabilistic characteristics of multiple elements that interact with each other and can be used across time according to the needs of the actual project scale for statistical characteristics for modeling projects in other fields as well funding this research was funded by the natural science foundation of shandong province no zr2019mee050 credit
