sálopes and saldanha 2017 in particular wave energy silva et al 2018 2015 and wind energy salvação and guedes soares 2018 silva et al 2018 which have good levels of resource available portugal s national strategy for the sea 2013 2020 also considered marine renewable energies as a strategic opportunity for the country moreover the poem plano de ordenamento do espaço marítimo a study that spatially identified the different uses of the sea selected a vast area along the portuguese coast suitable for marine renewable energies deployment cunha e sálopes and saldanha 2017 to facilitate the expansion of renewable energies offshore portugal has a pilot zone with 400 km2 of offshore area and 30 m 90 m of water depth available for testing the technology this area is located off são pedro de moel in the centre of portugal and it is managed by ren redes energéticas nacionais the transmission system operator of portugal in addition there is a test area located in aguçadoura fig 1 in the central north of portugal that has 45 m of water depth whose distance to the shore is 4 miles and has grid connection capability the windfloat type of floating platform roddier et al 2010 is one of the few among the various existing prototypes bagbanci et al 2012 uzunoglu et al 2016 that have moved in the direction of commercialization and it was the one the portuguese electric company edp energias de portugal have chosen for its floating wind energy developments in 2011 a windfloat floating offshore wind turbine prototype with a capacity of 2 mw per unit was installed in aguçadoura with a budget of 19 million of euros it was built at lisnave to the south of lisbon and towed for 400 km to aguçadoura where it was finally installed edp 2019 this was a successful test period of 5 years in which the platform resisted waves with more than 17 m and winds above 111 km h the windfloat project generated and injected more than 17 gw h in the portuguese grid during the test phases corresponding to the electricity consumption of more than 1300 families the platform was decommissioned in 2016 and in the end of 2019 a farm composed of three larger platforms of the same type with a total capacity of 25 mw which is enough electricity to supply 16 000 homes is being installed in the same location the windfloat atlantic farm has three 8 4 mw wind turbines and the platforms are deployed in line all at the same latitude and at about 600 m from one another edp 2019 the development of the offshore wind energy sector can provide positive effects on the economy of a country regarding job creation industrial diversification varela vázquez and sánchez carreira 2017 and being energy independent of the price of fuels there are two main types of offshore wind turbines depending on the type of platform that supports the offshore wind turbine in this context the substructures can be fixed such as monopiles yeter et al 2019a tripods yeter et al 2015 jackets yeter et al 2019b or gravity based foundations myhr et al 2014 and floating such as spar karmakar et al 2016 semisubmersible raed et al 2019 tensioned leg platforms tlp uzunoglu and guedes soares 2019 2020 nowadays among all the offshore wind farm installed in the world the majority located in the north sea use fixed platforms where 90 are monopiles however the characteristics of the portuguese waters make the use of floating offshore wind platforms whose technology will be improved in the future the best option several floating offshore wind platforms have been tested during the last years but the first ones to be tested at sea as prototypes were the hywind spar platform initially in norway myhr et al 2014 and the semisubmersible platform windfloat roddier et al 2010 installed in portugal the viability of the various wind energy concepts are determined considering lifetime evaluations where the levelized cost has become the reference in this industry myhr et al 2014 weinzettel et al 2009 cavazzi and dutton 2016 have developed an offshore wind energy geographic information system to analyse the economics of offshore wind energy in the united kingdom rueda bayona et al 2019 analysed the opportunity of the offshore wind in colombia hoffmann et al 2019 centred their study in the electric system the feasibility of offshore wind was studied by mostafaeipour 2010 in iran kim et al 2013 in korea and al nassar et al 2019 in kuwait however they have not considered the detail of each of the costs involved in the procedure they have been considered for the case hybrid floating offshore renewable energy platforms castro santos et al 2016b and for floating offshore wind farms castro santos and diaz casas 2014 in previous studies but not for the case of portugal in this context castro santos et al also analysed the economic sensitivity of floating offshore wind farms castro santos and diaz casas 2015a the objective of this paper is to establish a methodology to calculate the economic feasibility of floating offshore wind farms in terms of their internal rate of return irr net present value npv and its levelized cost of energy lcoe at portugal continental coast the method proposed has three phases geographic phase economic phase and restrictions phase the purpose of the geographic phase is to obtain the input values which will be used in the economic phase the shape parameter of the offshore wind the scale parameter of the offshore wind the height of the waves the period of the waves the bathymetry the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the shore the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the shipyard and the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the port then the economic parameters are calculated considering the inputs provided in the previous phase finally the restriction of bathymetry will be added to the economic maps whose value will be different depending on the floating offshore wind platform selected the case of study is focused on portugal three floating offshore wind platforms are considered semisubmersible tlp and spar as well two scenarios for electric tariff have been taken into account results indicate what the best floating offshore wind platform is in terms of its lcoe irr and npv and where is located the best area location to install it 2 methodology the method proposed is composed by three phases fig 2 geographic phase economic phase and restrictions phase in the geographic phase the input values which will be used in the economic phase are calculated they are see table 1 the shape parameter of the offshore wind the scale parameter of the offshore wind the height of the waves the period of the waves the bathymetry the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the shore the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the shipyard and the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the port the wind data set used in this work were provided by era interim database in the form of transport vectors u v the absolute value of the wind or its intensity was found using the formula 1 1 w u 2 v 2 to obtain the shape and scale parameter of the wind a probability distribution function pdf was fit to the absolute value of wind calculated previously the pdf chosen was the weibull which is normally the one used for this parameter with the matlab function wblfit the parameter a which is the scale parameter and the parameter b which is the shape parameter were estimated by the maximum likelihood with 95 of confidence intervals the wave parameters hs significant wave height and tm wave period are from a hindcast study performed with two wave models coupled ww iii and swan silva et al 2015 2018 in terms of the size of the grid it is important that a floating offshore wind farm can be located inside the cell the distance between offshore wind turbines is 4 times the diameter d of the offshore wind turbine and the distance between lines of offshore wind turbines is 7 times the diameter d of the offshore wind turbine the bathymetry used for the restriction assessment and for the swan simulations were provided by gebco general bathymetric chart of the oceans to have the size recommended for a wind farm implementation the grid map of the bathymetry and the parameters mentioned above hs tm and w were interpolated from a resolution of 0 05 0 1 hs tm and bathymetry and 0 5 0 5 w to 0 15 0 3 to do that a linear interpolation using the function interp2 of matlab was applied to the data in the economic phase all the inputs provided by the geographic phase are taken into account to determine the costs of the life cycle of the floating offshore wind farm see table 2 and other economic results whose study will determine the economic feasibility of a floating offshore wind farm therefore all these inputs the shape parameter of the offshore wind the scale parameter of the offshore wind the height of the waves the period of the waves the bathymetry the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the shore the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the shipyard and the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the port will vary depending on the point k of the geography considered the consideration of all these points generates a map of the location of study c1 depends on the

the unitary power of each offshore wind turbine pa c3 and c4 depend on the cost of manufacturing and installing the offshore wind turbines c31 and c41 respectively the offshore wind platforms c32 and

the cost of cleaning the area c65 and the cost of removing the materials c66 in this sense the calculation of the life cycle cost of a floating offshore wind farm fowf has been developed in previous studies castro santos et al 2016c castro santos and diaz casas 2014 and it is calculated taken into consideration six phases the concept definition c1 the design and development c2 the manufacturing

the cash flows of the floating offshore wind farm taking into account its discount from the beginning of the investment short et al 1995 castro santos et al 2016a it is dependent on the cash flow on year t c f t the discount rate r and the initial investment g 0 as shown in equation 3 is shown irr is calculated when the npv is equal to zero hertenstein and mckinnon 1997 short et al 1995 as shown in equation 4 4 n p v g 0 t 1 n c f t 1 r t 5 g 0 t 1 n c f t 1 i r r t 0 the wacc weighted average cost of capital has been calculated taken into account equation 5 which depends on the total equity

economically feasible if the net present value is positive and the internal rate of return is higher than the wacc furthermore the lcoe should be as low as possible once the economic maps were calculated it is necessary to restrict the area where the floating offshore wind farm can be installed in this context it is important to know that you can have a very good region in economic terms but whose use is limited by some restrictions such as bathymetry in this paper the bathymetry restriction is from d c 20 being d c the draft of the floating offshore wind platform to 1000 m of depth which is considered such as an enough value to install this type of floating offshore wind farms therefore the type of floating offshore wind platform restricts the economic maps in addition due to the fact that there is not law about the distribution of the offshore territorial space for the specific issue of the offshore wind it is important to know the limit of the territorial waters which is established in 12 nautical miles or 22 2 km 3 case study the case study selected to develop the methodology is portugal this region is characterized by values of the offshore wind shape parameter up 2 65 and scale parameter up to 7 5 m s figs 3 and 4 and deep waters that can reach the five thousands of meters fig 5 maps of figs 3 figs 4 and 5 have been calculated using the developed software the farm in consideration here is composed of 21 floating offshore wind turbines of 5 075 mw of power a life cycle of 20 years and 16 km 33 km of grid size in this study three different floating offshore wind platforms are taken into consideration semisubmersible trifloater ecn et al 2002 mit tensioned leg platform tlp sclavounos et al 2010 and spar oc3 hywind jonkman 2010 their main characteristics are shown in table 3 furthermore the type of floating offshore wind platform will also determine the type of installation and other aspects such as the mooring material the disposition of the mooring and the type of anchoring in this sense the semisubmersible platform will have and onshore installation and wet transport of the offshore wind turbine while the floating platform and the tlp and the spar platforms will have a dry transport of the offshore wind turbine and dry transport of the floating platform in a barge and floating crane without storage for their offshore installation in terms of the mooring the material of the mooring for semisubmersible and spar platform is chain and the material of mooring for tlp is cable its disposition is using non tensioned mooring or catenary in the semisubmersible and spar platform and a tensioned mooring with 90 with the seabed for the tlp finally the type of anchoring is a drag embedment anchor for the semisubmersible and spar platforms and a pile for the tlp platform nowadays portugal does not have a specific electric tariff for floating offshore wind farms however the government has fixed some parameters for a specific floating offshore wind turbine that was installed in portugal diário da república 2011 therefore two electric tariffs have been taken into account and are presented in table 4 the restriction considered for bathymetry is dependent on the type of floating offshore wind platform as fig 6 a b and c is shown fig 6 a represents the bathymetry for the semisubmersible platform from 30 m to 1000 m fig 6 b represents the bathymetry for the semisubmersible platform from 64 9 m to 1000 m fig 6 c represents the bathymetry for the semisubmersible platform from 140 m to 1000 m 4 results the best lcoe has a value of 289 49 mwh for the spar platform fig 7 c and 303 97 mwh for the semisubmersible platform see fig 7 a they are followed by 325 64 mwh for the tlp platform fig 7 b these results are calculated considering the maximum value of the maps of results however it is important to notice that not all the grid points calculated and presented in the previous maps fig 7 are relevant this is due to the fact that the floating offshore wind platforms are deployed in a range of depths so restrictions in bathymetry are applied in this sense three different restrictions for bathymetry have been considered depending on the draft of the floating offshore wind platform generating one different map of lcoe with restrictions for each different floating offshore wind platform however in this case this limitation does not affect to the best values for the lcoe in all the three different floating offshore wind platforms the spatial distribution for this parameter with the bathymetry limitations is displayed in fig 8 considering scenario 1 with the 200 mwh of electric tariff all the results are not economically feasible in this context the best values for irr go from 0 37 for the spar platform to 0 90 for the semisubmersible platform and to 2 12 for the tlp platform being all of them less than the weighted average cost of capital in addition the best values for npv go from 193 75 m for the spar platform to 230 08 m for the semisubmersible platform and to 240 51 m for the tlp platform being all of them less than zero which indicates that the project will not be economically feasible with this proposed electric tariff however scenario 2 which takes into account a 300 mwh of electric tariff has best results than the previous one in this context the best values for irr go from 7 13 for the spar platform fig 9 c to 6 31 for the semisubmersible platform fig 9 a and to 5 03 for the tlp platform fig 9 b the value for wacc depends on the location because it changes depending on the total equity m v e and the total debt m v d which is dependent on the life cycle costs of each location in this sense values of wacc go from 6 to 7 therefore the spar platform would be economically feasible for scenario 2 in terms of npv the best values for scenario 2 go from 45 46 m for the spar platform fig 10 c to 20 30 m for the semisubmersible platform fig 10 a and to 29 03 m for the tlp platform fig 10 b therefore the project would be economically feasible for the case of the spar and the semisubmersible platforms the best area to the deployment of a wind farm is located in the north of portugal close to the border with the galician region north west of spain where the offshore wind resource is higher as you can see in all the economic maps without restrictions it has to be highlighted that it is important to reduce the costs involved in this type of farms because the economic results for a very high electric tariff 300 mwh are in the limit of the economic feasibility the adjacent area in the north of spain has been studied by castro santos et al 2020 5 conclusions the objective of this paper has been to establish a method to calculate the economic feasibility of floating offshore wind farms in terms of their internal rate of return irr net present value npv and its levelized cost of energy lcoe the method proposed has three phases geographic phase economic phase and restrictions phase in the geographic phase the input values which will be used in the economic phase have been calculated and those are the shape parameter of the offshore wind the scale parameter of the offshore wind the height of the waves the period of the waves the bathymetry the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the shore the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the shipyard and the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the port afterwards the economic parameters have been calculated considering the inputs provided in the previous phase finally the restriction of bathymetry has been added to the economic maps whose value will be different depending on the floating offshore wind platform selected the case study has been focused on portugal with three floating offshore wind platforms are considered semisubmersible tlp and spar and two scenarios for electric tariff have been taken into account results indicate what is the best floating offshore wind platform in terms of the economic parameters lcoe irr and npv and where is located the best area where floating offshore wind farms can be installed in the study region in this sense the best value for lcoe is 289 49 mwh for the spar platform followed by the semisubmersible platform 303 97 mwh and the tlp platform 325 64 mwh according the irr and the npv the electric tariff of 300 mwh only have economic values for the case of the spar and the semisubmersible platforms the best area to install a floating wind farm is located in the north of portugal close to the border with the galician region north west of spain where the offshore wind resource is higher it has to be noted that it is important to reduce the costs involved in this type of farms because the economic results for a very high electric tariff are in the limit of their economic feasibility and they are very far from the shore for the portuguese case of study obviously this paper has considered some particular platforms mooring lengths wind turbines and other data however the method can be applied to other cases of study of which costs can be calculated finally the proposed method is applicable to the sea areas of other countries for this purpose the user should introduce the input maps of the wanted location therefore this tool is very useful in order to analyse any kind of region where installing

economically feasible if the net present value is positive and the internal rate of return is higher than the wacc furthermore the lcoe should be as low as possible once the economic maps were calculated it is necessary to restrict the area where the floating offshore wind farm can be installed in this context it is important to know that you can have a very good region in economic terms but whose use is limited by some restrictions such as bathymetry in this paper the bathymetry restriction is from d c 20 being d c the draft of the floating offshore wind platform to 1000 m of depth which is considered such as an enough value to install this type of floating offshore wind farms therefore the type of floating offshore wind platform restricts the economic maps in addition due to the fact that there is not law about the distribution of the offshore territorial space for the specific issue of the offshore wind it is important to know the limit of the territorial waters which is established in 12 nautical miles or 22 2 km 3 case study the case study selected to develop the methodology is portugal this region is characterized by values of the offshore wind shape parameter up 2 65 and scale parameter up to 7 5 m s figs 3 and 4 and deep waters that can reach the five thousands of meters fig 5 maps of figs 3 figs 4 and 5 have been calculated using the developed software the farm in consideration here is composed of 21 floating offshore wind turbines of 5 075 mw of power a life cycle of 20 years and 16 km 33 km of grid size in this study three different floating offshore wind platforms are taken into consideration semisubmersible trifloater ecn et al 2002 mit tensioned leg platform tlp sclavounos et al 2010 and spar oc3 hywind jonkman 2010 their main characteristics are shown in table 3 furthermore the type of floating offshore wind platform will also determine the type of installation and other aspects such as the mooring material the disposition of the mooring and the type of anchoring in this sense the semisubmersible platform will have and onshore installation and wet transport of the offshore wind turbine while the floating platform and the tlp and the spar platforms will have a dry transport of the offshore wind turbine and dry transport of the floating platform in a barge and floating crane without storage for their offshore installation in terms of the mooring the material of the mooring for semisubmersible and spar platform is chain and the material of mooring for tlp is cable its disposition is using non tensioned mooring or catenary in the semisubmersible and spar platform and a tensioned mooring with 90 with the seabed for the tlp finally the type of anchoring is a drag embedment anchor for the semisubmersible and spar platforms and a pile for the tlp platform nowadays portugal does not have a specific electric tariff for floating offshore wind farms however the government has fixed some parameters for a specific floating offshore wind turbine that was installed in portugal diário da república 2011 therefore two electric tariffs have been taken into account and are presented in table 4 the restriction considered for bathymetry is dependent on the type of floating offshore wind platform as fig 6 a b and c is shown fig 6 a represents the bathymetry for the semisubmersible platform from 30 m to 1000 m fig 6 b represents the bathymetry for the semisubmersible platform from 64 9 m to 1000 m fig 6 c represents the bathymetry for the semisubmersible platform from 140 m to 1000 m 4 results the best lcoe has a value of 289 49 mwh for the spar platform fig 7 c and 303 97 mwh for the semisubmersible platform see fig 7 a they are followed by 325 64 mwh for the tlp platform fig 7 b these results are calculated considering the maximum value of the maps of results however it is important to notice that not all the grid points calculated and presented in the previous maps fig 7 are relevant this is due to the fact that the floating offshore wind platforms are deployed in a range of depths so restrictions in bathymetry are applied in this sense three different restrictions for bathymetry have been considered depending on the draft of the floating offshore wind platform generating one different map of lcoe with restrictions for each different floating offshore wind platform however in this case this limitation does not affect to the best values for the lcoe in all the three different floating offshore wind platforms the spatial distribution for this parameter with the bathymetry limitations is displayed in fig 8 considering scenario 1 with the 200 mwh of electric tariff all the results are not economically feasible in this context the best values for irr go from 0 37 for the spar platform to 0 90 for the semisubmersible platform and to 2 12 for the tlp platform being all of them less than the weighted average cost of capital in addition the best values for npv go from 193 75 m for the spar platform to 230 08 m for the semisubmersible platform and to 240 51 m for the tlp platform being all of them less than zero which indicates that the project will not be economically feasible with this proposed electric tariff however scenario 2 which takes into account a 300 mwh of electric tariff has best results than the previous one in this context the best values for irr go from 7 13 for the spar platform fig 9 c to 6 31 for the semisubmersible platform fig 9 a and to 5 03 for the tlp platform fig 9 b the value for wacc depends on the location because it changes depending on the total equity m v e and the total debt m v d which is dependent on the life cycle costs of each location in this sense values of wacc go from 6 to 7 therefore the spar platform would be economically feasible for scenario 2 in terms of npv the best values for scenario 2 go from 45 46 m for the spar platform fig 10 c to 20 30 m for the semisubmersible platform fig 10 a and to 29 03 m for the tlp platform fig 10 b therefore the project would be economically feasible for the case of the spar and the semisubmersible platforms the best area to the deployment of a wind farm is located in the north of portugal close to the border with the galician region north west of spain where the offshore wind resource is higher as you can see in all the economic maps without restrictions it has to be highlighted that it is important to reduce the costs involved in this type of farms because the economic results for a very high electric tariff 300 mwh are in the limit of the economic feasibility the adjacent area in the north of spain has been studied by castro santos et al 2020 5 conclusions the objective of this paper has been to establish a method to calculate the economic feasibility of floating offshore wind farms in terms of their internal rate of return irr net present value npv and its levelized cost of energy lcoe the method proposed has three phases geographic phase economic phase and restrictions phase in the geographic phase the input values which will be used in the economic phase have been calculated and those are the shape parameter of the offshore wind the scale parameter of the offshore wind the height of the waves the period of the waves the bathymetry the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the shore the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the shipyard and the distance from the floating offshore wind farm to the port afterwards the economic parameters have been calculated considering the inputs provided in the previous phase finally the restriction of bathymetry has been added to the economic maps whose value will be different depending on the floating offshore wind platform selected the case study has been focused on portugal with three floating offshore wind platforms are considered semisubmersible tlp and spar and two scenarios for electric tariff have been taken into account results indicate what is the best floating offshore wind platform in terms of the economic parameters lcoe irr and npv and where is located the best area where floating offshore wind farms can be installed in the study region in this sense the best value for lcoe is 289 49 mwh for the spar platform followed by the semisubmersible platform 303 97 mwh and the tlp platform 325 64 mwh according the irr and the npv the electric tariff of 300 mwh only have economic values for the case of the spar and the semisubmersible platforms the best area to install a floating wind farm is located in the north of portugal close to the border with the galician region north west of spain where the offshore wind resource is higher it has to be noted that it is important to reduce the costs involved in this type of farms because the economic results for a very high electric tariff are in the limit of their economic feasibility and they are very far from the shore for the portuguese case of study obviously this paper has considered some particular platforms mooring lengths wind turbines and other data however the method can be applied to other cases of study of which costs can be calculated finally the proposed method is applicable to the sea areas of other countries for this purpose the user should introduce the input maps of the wanted location therefore this tool is very useful in order to analyse any kind of region where installing

21836,hooking of anchors or trawling gear in submarine pipelines can cause catastrophic consequences on life and property to quantify the consequences of these events and thus to mitigate this risk and provide a reference for submarine pipeline safety design the failure mechanism and response of pipelines subjected to hooking loads is investigated experimentally and numerically the experiment is first carried out to give an initial insight into pipeline response and then is used for validation of the numerical approach then the validated numerical model is used for studying the effect of boundary conditions wall thickness and internal pressure on pipeline response and failure mechanism finally the pipe soil interaction is modeled and the pipeline response considering embedment depth soil properties and friction is studied the results show that the pipeline failure pattern differs under different boundary conditions with the increase in embedment depth the ultimate hooking force increases due to the restriction from the soils the soil strength and ultimate hooking force are in a nonlinear relationship the effect of friction is less significant for soft clays keywords submarine pipeline hooking loads boundary condition pipe soil interaction embedment depth cel method 1 introduction the submarine pipeline is the main medium for offshore oil and gas transportation which indicates its importance for the ever growing global energy demands meantime with the development of industrial fishing there are frequent interferences between the submerged fishing gear and the nearby pipelines which is a potential risk for pipelines based on the statistical data of submarine pipeline failure accidents third party damage is the main factor to cause pipeline failure mott macdonald ltd 2003 fang et al 2014 moreover the interference from industrial fishing is responsible for those third party damages once the pipeline fails it will bring catastrophic consequences both to the economy and the environment to mitigate the risks and ensure pipeline safety there is an urgent requirement to investigate the inner mechanisms of the interference between pipelines and fishing gears in the recommended practice dnv rp f111 2013 the interferences between pipeline and fishing gear are classified into three categories namely impact pull over and hooking impact refers to the scenario that a trawl board impacts on bare or free span pipes which usually causes a local dent or global deformation for small diameter pipes mellem et al 1996 fyriliev et al 1997 related theoretical models guedes soares and søreide 1983 wierzbicki and suh 1988 jones and shen 1992 sun et al 2019 experiments thomas et al 1976 theofanous et al 2009 kristoffersen et al 2013 aghdamy et al 2017 and numerical models arabzadeh and zeinoddini 2011 zeinoddini et al 2013 dou and liu 2015 can be found in the literature about the deformation of pipelines under impact pull over refers to the scenario when the trawl board is forced or pulled across the pipe which is expected to impose large horizontal and vertical forces on pipes for a relatively long duration through model tests kjeldsen and moshagen 1979 examined the effect of bottom trawl gear on fixed end pipelines furtherly the pipeline end flexibility was investigated experimentally in by marintek nygaard 1990 verley et al 1992 verley 1994 investigated the pull over force time history for trawl boards by experiments and theoretical analysis moreover numerical models guijt and horenberg 1987 longva et al 2013 were set up to investigate pipeline response and the influence factors including the seabed flexibility igland and søreide 2008 span flexibility maalø et al 2012 and hydrodynamic loadings longva et al 2011 hooking is a rare but severe event that the trawl equipment or trawling anchors are fully stuck by the pipeline until the warp line tension reaches its breaking strength or the pipeline collapses this indicates that the pipeline global structural integrity should be considered for large hooking loads dnv rp f111 2013 moreover the hooking accident will bring serious consequences for crew and pipelines it was reported that in 1997 a fishing vessel was capsized causing four casualties owing to the trawl gears hooked by a pipeline maib 1998 besides one offshore pipeline segment in china was reported destroyed by a hooked anchor yang et al 2017 unlike the research on impact or pull over there was very limited literature that investigated the hooking event moshagen et al 1980 discussed the possibility of hooking events for trawl doors and beam trawls a series of experiments aimed at pipeline overtrawl have recorded some hooking events details e g warp line tension test conditions nygaard 2002 wu et al 2013 developed a numerical model to describe the hooking events which shows a good ability to predict that whether hooking events will happen based on this numerical model and model tests a simplified method to estimate the probability of hooking events for otter board has been proposed wu et al 2015 it can be seen that those limited research mainly focused on the possibility or conditions of hooking events occurrence the failure mechanism as well as the response of pipelines subjected to the hooking loads is equally crucial and requires enough research efforts so that the effects of many influence factors on the pipeline failure could be investigated as this will supply an abundant reference for pipeline safety design and contribute to the supplementary research gaps besides during the trawling activities the towed demersal gears have a great impact on seabed sediments e g scouring or morphological changes of the seabed gilkinson et al 1998 paschen et al 2002 paschen 2005 the soil sediment could be penetrated by the trawl gears and produce lateral displacements and large deformations ivanović et al 2011 esmaeili and ivanović 2014 dingle et al 2008 the soil around the pipeline will form berms which may restrict the pipeline movement and influence the pipeline response during hooking events this effect of seabed flexibility and pipe soil interaction also needs to be investigated in this study a relatively comprehensive investigation on pipeline response due to hooking loads is carried out by experiment and numerical simulation which can give an insight into the pipeline failure mechanism and provide sufficient information for engineering design the objectives of the present effort are summarized as follows 1 a quasi static pipeline hooking experiment is carried out to examine the failure mechanism 2 a numerical model of the pipeline response is developed and verified with the experiment then the effect of boundary conditions ratio of diameter to the wall thickness and internal pressure on pipeline response and failure mechanism is examined 3 furthermore considerations of seabed flexibility and pipe soil interaction are included in the numerical model involving the soil plastic deformation and penetration a study of the effects of embedment depth soil properties and friction is conducted 2 experimental details the hooking phase is reproduced as a lateral quasi static loading procedure on the pipeline which is suggested in the recommended practice dnv rp f111 2013 a series of tests are carried out to investigate the pipeline failure mechanism and response with different conditions namely the ratio of length to diameter and the ratio of diameter to wall thickness 2 1 experimental set up the experimental system is illustrated in fig 1 a microcomputer controlled universal test machine with a capacity of 100 kn was employed to supply the quasi static loadings a wedge shaped indenter was used to simulate the effect of the trawl board force and displacement transducers are mounted in this machine to acquire the test data during the loading phase the pipeline was sustained by a couple of identical braced frames indicating that the relative positions of the pipeline ends are identical moreover lateral and vertical displacements of the pipeline two ends are restricted namely simply support end condition the distance between the frames can be flexible for pipelines with different lengths it should be noted that in the vertical direction the pipeline should be held at a suitable height underneath which enough space is kept for the subsequently loading process prior to the test in the horizontal direction the relative positions of the pipeline braced frames and indentor were adjusted to ensure that the pipeline midspan is perpendicular to the indentor moreover the height of the pipeline ends and midspan were measured and adjusted to the same height to ensure the pipeline straightness then by the control system a displacement control load was slowly applied to the pipeline accompanied by automatically recording the force f and the corresponding displacement u when the recorded force no longer increased it means that the pipeline structure reached collapse and then the applied load can be stopped 2 2 experimental results and discussion in this experiment several cases are designed considering different ratios of length to diameter ratios of diameter to wall thickness which are listed in table 1 the material of the pipeline specimen is q195 steel the yield strength young s modulus and poisson s ratio are 205 mpa 206 gpa and 0 3 respectively it should be noted that the geometric similarity principle was mainly considered in this experiment which is the common practice in the related research zeinoddini et al 2013 yu et al 2016 gao et al 2016 considering the loading capacity and the available space in the laboratory the scale ratio was determined as 1 10 jia et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 fig 2 shows some on scene photographs of the experiment global bending deformation during the hooking procedure and a permanent local plastic dent after loading can be seen to quantify the deformation response fig 3 shows the normalized local dent depth δ d as well as the global response of each case it should be noted that the global response is defined as u δ d which is suggested in the literature firouzsalari and showkati 2013 in case 3 the global response of 2 20 is significant however the local deformation of 0 15 is small by contrast a large local dent of 0 26 and a slight global response of 0 60 are produced in case 5 in otherwise identical conditions the local dent damage increases with the decrease in the ratio of diameter to wall thickness d t and decreases with the increase in the ratio of length to diameter l s d the load displacement curves of each case are depicted in fig 4 moreover the ultimate force and the corresponding critical displacement of each case extracted from the curves in fig 4 are presented in table 2 in general those curves show a similar changing tendency each curve consists of three stages 1 linear increase stage 2 nonlinear increase stage and 3 yield stage however the details of each curve are different for example the abscissa range for the linear increase stage of case 2 is from 0 to 0 23 while for case 3 this range is from 0 to 1 1 a similar trend can be seen when comparing case 1 and case 4 of which the range is from 0 to 0 07 and from 0 to 0 3 respectively this can be explained by the differences in the ratios of length to diameter l s d when comparing case 3 case 4 and case 5 the ultimate strength increases with the decrease in l s d especially in case 5 some improvement in ultimate strength may be caused by the local failure mode that the dent depth is 0 26 approximately 1 7 times that of case 3 this is consistent with the findings that the indenting force is inversely proportional to pipe length allan and marshall 1992 research has found that different l s d will cause a change in pipeline resistance and damage extent subjected to lateral loadings allan and marshall 1992 zeinoddini et al 1998 the comparison between the euler bernoulli beam theory and the timoshenko beam theory han et al 1999 may account for this phenomenon when the l s d is large the shear deformation is less significant indicating that the pipeline presents a global collapse mode for cases with small l s d a pipeline local damage is mainly imposed presenting a local buckling failure mode this phenomenon is significant when comparing the response of case 1 and case 4 the normalized ultimate force and local dent depth of case 1 and case 4 are 4 13 and 0 38 2 71 and 0 26 respectively it seems that the failure mode of the former is dominated by local damage while the failure mode of the latter is dominated by global collapse this is supported by the above analysis that the key factor influencing the pipeline response is the ratio of l s d besides as a result of the largest l s d for case 3 the critical displacement is 2 8 times those of case 2 showing an evident global response 3 numerical model description the pipeline response subjected to hooking loads is simulated with the general purpose 3d finite element method software abaqus dassault systemes 2016 as shown in fig 5 there are three parts in this model namely pipeline trawl board and seabed soil geometry and material nonlinearities for both pipeline and seabed soil are considered meantime considering the pipe soil interaction and soil large deformation coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method is employed to establish this numerical model 3 1 numerical method the cel method has proved to solve large deformation problems and has been applied widely in geotechnical simulation qiu et al 2011 zhao and liu 2015 the present model when considering pipe soil interaction is set up with cel method both the traditional lagrangian element and eulerian element are employed and coupled the eulerian meshes are fixed in space and keep undeformed the material can move through those meshes and be traced by calculating its eulerian volume fraction evf in the present model the seabed is modeled as the eulerian domain which consists of two regions material region and void region shown in fig 5 the material region is filled with soil material while the void region is set to trace potential soil movement on the seabed surface furthermore the pipeline and the trawl board are modeled in the lagrangian domain the interaction between the two domains structures and soil is described with a penalty contact algorithm 3 2 numerical setup pipeline geometry and material properties in the numerical model are in common range for the offshore oil and gas industry pipeline outer diameter d is 0 35 m wall thickness t is 0 02 m pipeline material is x65 steel density is 7850 kg m3 yield strength σ y is 448 mpa elastic modules is 206 gpa poisson s ratio μ is 0 3 linear isotropic strain hardening model is employed to describe the plasticity model of the steel pipeline material which proves to be more suitable for quasi static monotonic loadings zeinoddini et al 2013 the pipeline is modeled with shell elements s4r the number of circumferential elements is 32 the longitudinal element size is 0 12d in the lateral loading areas and gradually increases for other areas fixed end and simply support boundary conditions are considered in the following analysis the rectangular trawl board is simulated of which the length is 4 5 m height 3 5 m and mass is 4500 kg with a hydrodynamic added mass of 2 14 times the trawl board mass longva 2014 this type of trawl board has been found to give the highest loads on pipelines dnv rp f111 2013 to account for the hydrodynamic loadings an equivalent density including the added mass are employed and no deformation is considered for the trawl board which is modeled as a rigid body with a reference node the seabed is discretized with ec3d8r elements the soil material is clay it is prevalent in the regions of underwater hydrocarbon development dingle et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 ivanović and o neill 2015 and widely spread in bohai sea areas liu et al 2013 2015 jiang et al 2019 where the pipeline system is well developed mohr coulomb m c model is applied to describe the elastic plastic behavior of clay which is efficient and widely used jiang and xie 2011 the poisson s ratio of clay is 0 49 the elastic stiffness is set equal to 500 times the undrained shear strength s u tian et al 2014 considering the boundary effects and calculation resources the seabed dimensions are set to 100 m 283d in length 8 m 23d in width and 3 3 m 9d in height 3d is for the void region based on a preliminary study and results from other researchers zeinoddini et al 2013 ivanović et al 2011 the element size is 0 15d 0 15d in the lateral loading areas and gradually increase to the boundaries fixed end and lateral confinement conditions are set for seabed bottom surface and other lateral surfaces respectively the contact between structures and seabed is described by the penalty function algorithm a geostatic step is first set up to gain an initial converged stress state for seabed soil which is in balance with the gravity and seawater pressures and could influence the soil behavior and the subsequent pipeline response pike and kenny 2016 then the trawl board gradually applied the hooking loads on the pipeline in a quasi static step 3 3 numerical validation with the same material geometry mechanical properties and boundary conditions the experiment is reproduced by the numerical model illustrated above it should be noted that the effect of seabed soil is excluded in this model comparisons of the numerical results and experiments are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 generally both the load displacement curves and the pipeline deformation response were in good agreement with those of the experiments for the comparison of load displacement curves the results of the two methods are close in the linear stage however in the nonlinear and yield stage some small discrepancies can be observed especially in case 1 and case 5 meantime those discrepancies can be also found in the comparison of deformation response this is probably caused by the omission of the stress strain gradient for shell elements in the numerical model for case 1 and case 5 the normalized dent depth is 0 38 and 0 26 respectively however the normalized global response is pretty small of approximately 0 15 and 0 30 it indicates that the local response is mainly imposed as a result of the small l s d zeinoddini et al 1998 han et al 1999 which generates large local deformation and intense strain and stress gradient in the shell thickness direction that is not considered in the numerical model for the cases with large l s d the discrepancies are relatively small nevertheless the numerical model shows a good ability to reproduce the simulations of hooking loading on pipelines 4 numerical analysis with the verified numerical model pipeline response due to hooking loads and the effects from various influences are analyzed including the boundary conditions wall thickness and internal pressure subsequently considering the pipe soil interaction a preliminary analysis on embedment depth soil properties and friction is conducted and the results are discussed 4 1 boundary condition the response of pipelines with two boundary conditions fixed end and simply support are described and compared it is noted that the pipelines rest on the rigid seabed with no internal pressures the load displacement curves are plotted in fig 8 it shows that the force increases dramatically with the pipeline lateral displacement and then drops suddenly when the pipeline ends are fixed while under the simple support condition the increasing trend between the force and lateral displacement firstly keeps stable then gradually decreases and finally the force drops which falls into the same patterns of the experiment results namely linear increase stage nonlinear increase stage and yield stage besides the ultimate force under the fixed end condition is much larger than that under the simple support condition however the corresponding critical lateral displacement presents the opposite rule for example when the pipeline diameter d is 350 mm under the fixed end condition the ultimate force and the corresponding critical lateral displacement are approximately 1400 knand 3 6 m however those values change to 70 knand 20 m under the simple support condition this phenomenon can be explained by soreide and kavlie 1985 zeinoddini et al 1998 which pointed out that the limit load under fixed end condition is significantly enhanced owing to the membrane action caused by the restriction from the fixed end fig 9 shows the pipeline circumferential profiles with different lateral displacement u under the two boundary conditions a significant deformation with the lateral displacement increasing can be observed when the ends are fixed which eventually forms a half round shape however when the ends are simply supported the deformation keeps small even though the lateral displacement reaches 15 m after which the deformation becomes evident and finally forms an elliptical shape fig 10 gives the equivalent plastic strains for the circumferential profiles it should be noted that under the fixed end conditions the whole profile is fully yielded with large and uniformed plastic strain which seems to belong to a longitudinal tensile failure pattern while under the simple support condition plastic strains in the hooked side and the opposite side are crucial than ones on the other two sides which presents in an 8 shape in general the plasticity is smaller than that under the fixed end condition maximum equivalent plastic strain is about 0 2 and 1 0 respectively which may belong to a lateral bending failure pattern to give an insight on the pipeline global response and failure mechanism lateral displacement along the longitudinal axis is shown in fig 11 under the fixed end condition the lateral displacement distribution shape is sharper and gradually becomes triangular but under the simple support condition the distribution curve is more smooth and shows an arch shape besides the maximum lateral displacement under the simple support condition is much larger than that under the fixed end condition 20 m 4 m respectively indicating that the global response is more significant owing to the strict fixed condition the pipeline is not as flexible as that under simple support condition which limits the lateral movement and the expansion of pipeline ends therefore membrane action arises and longitudinal membrane force is gradually developed allan and marshall 1992 it is believed that pipeline ultimate strength is enhanced and dominated by the longitudinal extension while under the simple support condition lateral movement is relatively flexible and global bending response is triggered belonging to a bending failure pattern the bending moment distribution depicted in fig 12 can support the above discussion it shows that in the fixed end condition the moment is merely concentrated in the hooking central area and the ends with the increase in the lateral displacement the bending moment firstly increases and then keeps decreasing when the displacement reaches 2 5 m which means the pipeline failure is less associated with the bending moment while under the simple support condition the bending moment is larger and distributes more widely along the longitudinal axis the structure bending capacity is supplied by each pipeline element which determines the ultimate strength large hooking force and serious local buckling will cause catastrophic damage to both pipeline and trawl vessels maib 1998 dnv rp f107 2010 as a result to avoid non conservative assessment the fixed end boundary condition is applied to the following simulations 4 2 wall thickness the load displacement curves of pipelines with different wall thicknesses are depicted in fig 13 with the increase in wall thickness the structure s ultimate strength is improved but the corresponding critical lateral displacement decreases for example the critical displacement is 3 76 m with a wall thickness of 5 mm however it changes to 3 58 mm with a wall thickness of 20 mm it is believed that increasing wall thickness can enhance the pipeline stiffness consequently the ultimate strength subjected to hooking loads is improved which is more significant when the wall thickness is larger than 7 mm fig 14 gives the deformations of pipelines with different wall thicknesses in the circumferential profile it shows that local buckling is more severe with thinner wall thickness due to the lower capacity pipeline local deformation is prone to occur for example with the wall thickness of 7 mm when the lateral displacement is 2 m a significant dent can be seen however the pipeline with a wall thickness of 15 mm hardly deforms plastic strain distributions in the circumferential profile are plotted in fig 15 to facilitate the comparison only the distribution before the structure s ultimate bearing capacity stage is depicted the distribution characteristics are different with the wall thickness of 7 mm plastic strain firstly occurs in the hooked central area then spreads to the whole hooked side at that time u 2 5 m there is less deformation opposite to the hooked side finally with the bending and tensile loading the plastic strain gradually spreads to the whole circumferential profile the maximum plastic strain appears on the two inclined sides approximately 30 of the hooked area when the wall thickness is 15 mm significant plastic strain mainly concentrates on the centre of the hooked area similarly plastic deformation occurs all over the profile with the tensile loading the research of zhang et al 2016 can further support this conclusion that with the increase in wall thickness the maximum plastic strain position moves from the two sides to the centre of the impacted area in general the damage in the circumferential profile is the combination of the local indent and the global tensile the final failure characteristics are determined according to the related information such as the pipeline geometry or material parameters 4 3 internal pressures pipelines with different internal pressures subjected to hooking loads are simulated fig 16 shows the relationships between force and lateral displacement it shows that with the internal pressure increases both the structure ultimate strength and the corresponding critical lateral displacement decreases for example the ultimate force and the corresponding critical lateral displacement decrease from 1275 knand 3 57 m to 1030 knand 3 35 m when the internal pressure increases from 5 mpa to 20 mpa the highly pressurized pipeline is prone to suffer hooking damage it is believed that internal pressure improves the pipeline global and radial stiffness which causes higher stress yang et al 2011 chen et al 1998 fig 17 gives the geometries of the circumferential profiles for pipelines with the internal pressure of 5 mpa and 20 mpa it shows that the deformation decreases significantly with the increasing pressure serious local buckling occurs when the internal pressure is 5 mpa however under the pressure of 20 mpa only the pipeline hooked side becomes indented while other sides in the circumferential profile maintain the original shape fig 18 shows the plastic strain distributions of pipelines with internal pressure of 5 mpa and 20 mpa to facilitate the comparison the distributions after structure s ultimate bearing capacity stage are excluded when the pressure is 5 mpa the plastic strain focuses mainly on the central area in the hooked side and distributes evenly opposite to the hooked side the maximum plastic strain appears in the hooked central area while under the pressure of 20 mpa only small plastic strain can be found in the central area of the hooked side the plastic strain distributes mostly opposite to the hooked side owing to the bending and tensile loadings it is believed that the pipeline profile is stiff enough to prevent the local indent by trawl board most energy is converted to pipeline global deformation and causes failure this finding can be explained by the conclusions of chen et al 1998 who performed a series of impact experiments on pipes and found out that pipeline tensile failure is prone to be caused by the global effects from the internal pressure 4 4 seabed flexibility 4 4 1 embedment depth offshore pipelines will penetrate into the seabed to some degree though they are usually installed unburied the responses of pipelines with different embedment depths during hooking loads are studied fig 19 shows the load displacement curves where the undrained shear strength is 12 kpa it shows that with the increase in embedment depth e the ultimate force increases which is significant when the results with e 0 3d and e 0 1d are compared the lateral movement of the embedded pipeline is depicted in fig 20 it shows that seabed soil ahead of the embedded pipeline is penetrated and form soil berms with the hooking loading the pipeline gradually climbs up to the seabed surface along the longitudinal axis the lateral penetrated degree of the soil is different the formed soil berms are forced to slip on the soil surface which is consistent with the berm sliding mechanism observed from the centrifugal test dingle et al 2008 what is important is that the deformed soil berms will obstruct the pipeline movement and therefore influence the pipeline response besides large deformation of soil is triggered implying that part of the energy is absorbed in the soil plastic deformation the above phenomenon is investigated and discussed in the following fig 21 shows the pipeline vertical displacement along the longitudinal axis it should be noticed that the displacement distribution appears a m shape vertical displacement is lower in the middle where is the pipeline hooked area with the distance increases from the hooked area the vertical displacement gradually increases moreover when the distance reaches 20 m the vertical displacement begins to decline it is believed that the hooked centre area where the hooking load applies directly is forced to penetrate the ahead soil and to climb upwards accompanied by driving the soil berms to slip however as the distance from the centre area increases the driving force and penetration process gradually attenuates owing to the resistance from the embedded soil the pipeline tends to climb upwards to the seabed surface with less penetration this phenomenon is obvious around the peak region approximately 20 m in the abscissa and the corresponding vertical position is roughly at the seabed surface 4 4 2 soil mechanics properties soil mechanical properties are important to the response of embedded pipelines owing to the relationship between the load and the soil resistance pipelines with different soil properties subjected to hooking load are simulated fig 22 depicts the load displacement curves a non linear relationship between the undrained shear strength s u and the ultimate force can be observed with the increase of s u the ultimate force increases moreover it begins to decrease when s u is larger than 12 kpa for example the ultimate force is 1476 kn with s u of 8 kpa however with s u of 24 kpa the ultimate force decreases to 1290 kn in addition the load displacement curve is almost the same as that of the pipeline with no embedment depth e 0 except for the peak at the very beginning lateral displacement 1 m it seems that the obstruction from stiffer soil is not significant fig 23 shows the pipeline vertical displacements with different undrained shear strengths a typical m shaped distribution can be observed when s u is 4 kpa which is similar to the result in fig 21 furthermore the lowest displacement in the middle part is less than 6 mm indicating that the soil is almost fully penetrated by the pipeline lateral movement and only small upward climbing movement of the pipeline can be observed it is believed that the pipeline in the hooked area is prone to penetrate laterally owing to the low residual resistance from the soft soil berms when s u is 24 kpa the distribution pattern changes presenting a unimodal distribution the biggest peak region is in the middle which is contrary to the m shaped distribution in the hooked centre area small soil berms are formed due the pipeline lateral penetration driven by the relatively large hooking load the soil lateral resistance is large to an extent that the pipeline tends to climb upwards along the soil rather than laterally penetrate the soil let alone the pipeline segments far from the centre area where the load is attenuated significantly that is believed to explain that why a small peak appears in the curve e 0 2d s u 24 kpa in fig 22 fig 24 gives the total plastic strain of the seabed soils with different strengths the results agree with the above discussion with the increase in undrained shear strength the soil plastic strain decreases in general the vertical responses of pipelines is associated with soil resistance and hooking loads because stiffer soil is hard to be penetrated pipelines prone to climb upwards on the soil driven by the hooking loads and vice versa large plastic deformation is triggered when the soil is soft coming back to the load displacement curves the plastic deformations can also account for the changing trend between ultimate force and soil properties for example when s u is less than 12 kpa the soil is relatively soft large plastic deformation indicates a sufficient penetration process with the increase in undrained shear strength the resistance from soil becomes large and an increased force is required to drive the pipeline movement however when the soil strength keeps increasing most part of the hooking loads are used to drive the pipeline to climb upwards along with the soil rather than penetrate the soil laterally therefore soil resistance is less from the limited plastic deformation which causes a drop in ultimate force 4 4 3 soil friction the friction of the interface between pipeline and soil seems to influence the pipeline response which is discussed in this section a series of cases are simulated including the variation in friction coefficient f 0 2 0 6 and soil undrained shear strength s u 4 12 kpa the load displacement curves of those cases are shown in fig 25 for otherwise identical conditions with the increase in f the ultimate force also increases however the increasing trend is different for various soil properties when s u is 4 kpa there is a limited improvement while when s u is 12 kpa a significant increase in ultimate force can be observed with s u of 8 kpa the ultimate force increases slowly when f is larger than 0 4 some reasons can be found when the soil plastic strain is investigated which is shown in fig 26 the dashed lines show the relationship between the plastic strains and the friction coefficients with different soil properties the increasing trend of the curve with s u of 4 kpa is more stable due to the softer soil large plastic deformation is triggered even for a small f of 0 2 in this situation the effect of friction is not significant however the curves under the other two conditions have a bigger growth trend the plastic strain increases rapidly from a small value it shows that when the soil becomes stiff the friction becomes important for soil plastic deformation which influences the pipeline response fig 27 depicts the pipeline vertical displacements along the longitudinal axis the results exhibit two different distribution patterns for the cases with f of 0 2 and 0 6 when f is 0 2 the vertical displacement presents a unimodal distribution and with the lateral movement of the pipeline the peak in the middle gradually becomes flat the final vertical displacement of the flat peak maintains at about 70 mm which is the position of the original seabed surface indicating that nearly no penetration occurs it is believed that lateral penetration with small soil berms only occurs in the hooked area at the very beginning owing to the lower friction between soil and pipeline soil lateral resistance is hard to be overcome and the penetration process attenuates dramatically as a consequence the pipeline is prone to climb up from the initial embedment gap and move laterally with hardly any penetration on the soil that is the reason for the small peak for the corresponding curve e 0 2d f 0 6 in fig 25 c when f increases to 0 6 a m shaped distribution can be observed indicating that a sufficient lateral penetration process occurs during the hooking phase in such situations the effect of friction is important for pipeline response which is in accordance with the above analysis 5 conclusions pipeline response subjected to hooking loads is crucial but not much studied in this article experiments and numerical simulations are used to give the insight to pipeline failure mechanism by hooking loads besides the effects of seabed flexibility and pipe soil interaction are considered in an exploratory study the main conclusions are as follows 1 experiments of hooking simulation of pipelines showed that the load displacement response consists of three stages linear increase stage nonlinear increase stage and yield stage the ratio of length to diameter l s d is a key factor to govern a global or local response of the pipeline specimen 2 both the simple support and fixed end boundary conditions of the pipelines are considered in numerical simulation under the simple support condition the pipeline response shows the same changing tendency of the experiment results and the pipeline failure is mainly caused by the global bending under the fixed end condition the longitudinal tension is responsible for the pipeline failure owing to the membrane action the ultimate strength in the fixed end condition is larger than the other one and the corresponding lateral displacement is smaller 3 with the increase in wall thickness the pipeline s ultimate strength is improved the plastic strain distribution also differs the position of maximum plastic strain moves from the two sides to the centre of the hooked area highly pressurized pipelines are prone to suffer hooking damage owing to the enhanced stiffness and stress the plastic strain is distributed mainly opposite the hooked area 4 pipeline embedment and soil pipe interaction are considered in cel numerical model during the hooking phase large plastic deformation of the soil is triggered and more energy is dissipated soil berms are formed to restrict the pipeline lateral movement causing an increase in the ultimate force and influencing the pipeline response the relationship between the soil mechanical strength and the ultimate force is nonlinear the pipeline movement pattern also differs with the increase in soil strength the pipeline is prone to climb upwards along the soil rather than lateral penetrate on the soil with the increase in friction between pipeline and soil the ultimate force also increases this effect is less significant when s u is 4 kpa in which large soil plastic deformation is produced even with a lower friction

21836,hooking of anchors or trawling gear in submarine pipelines can cause catastrophic consequences on life and property to quantify the consequences of these events and thus to mitigate this risk and provide a reference for submarine pipeline safety design the failure mechanism and response of pipelines subjected to hooking loads is investigated experimentally and numerically the experiment is first carried out to give an initial insight into pipeline response and then is used for validation of the numerical approach then the validated numerical model is used for studying the effect of boundary conditions wall thickness and internal pressure on pipeline response and failure mechanism finally the pipe soil interaction is modeled and the pipeline response considering embedment depth soil properties and friction is studied the results show that the pipeline failure pattern differs under different boundary conditions with the increase in embedment depth the ultimate hooking force increases due to the restriction from the soils the soil strength and ultimate hooking force are in a nonlinear relationship the effect of friction is less significant for soft clays keywords submarine pipeline hooking loads boundary condition pipe soil interaction embedment depth cel method 1 introduction the submarine pipeline is the main medium for offshore oil and gas transportation which indicates its importance for the ever growing global energy demands meantime with the development of industrial fishing there are frequent interferences between the submerged fishing gear and the nearby pipelines which is a potential risk for pipelines based on the statistical data of submarine pipeline failure accidents third party damage is the main factor to cause pipeline failure mott macdonald ltd 2003 fang et al 2014 moreover the interference from industrial fishing is responsible for those third party damages once the pipeline fails it will bring catastrophic consequences both to the economy and the environment to mitigate the risks and ensure pipeline safety there is an urgent requirement to investigate the inner mechanisms of the interference between pipelines and fishing gears in the recommended practice dnv rp f111 2013 the interferences between pipeline and fishing gear are classified into three categories namely impact pull over and hooking impact refers to the scenario that a trawl board impacts on bare or free span pipes which usually causes a local dent or global deformation for small diameter pipes mellem et al 1996 fyriliev et al 1997 related theoretical models guedes soares and søreide 1983 wierzbicki and suh 1988 jones and shen 1992 sun et al 2019 experiments thomas et al 1976 theofanous et al 2009 kristoffersen et al 2013 aghdamy et al 2017 and numerical models arabzadeh and zeinoddini 2011 zeinoddini et al 2013 dou and liu 2015 can be found in the literature about the deformation of pipelines under impact pull over refers to the scenario when the trawl board is forced or pulled across the pipe which is expected to impose large horizontal and vertical forces on pipes for a relatively long duration through model tests kjeldsen and moshagen 1979 examined the effect of bottom trawl gear on fixed end pipelines furtherly the pipeline end flexibility was investigated experimentally in by marintek nygaard 1990 verley et al 1992 verley 1994 investigated the pull over force time history for trawl boards by experiments and theoretical analysis moreover numerical models guijt and horenberg 1987 longva et al 2013 were set up to investigate pipeline response and the influence factors including the seabed flexibility igland and søreide 2008 span flexibility maalø et al 2012 and hydrodynamic loadings longva et al 2011 hooking is a rare but severe event that the trawl equipment or trawling anchors are fully stuck by the pipeline until the warp line tension reaches its breaking strength or the pipeline collapses this indicates that the pipeline global structural integrity should be considered for large hooking loads dnv rp f111 2013 moreover the hooking accident will bring serious consequences for crew and pipelines it was reported that in 1997 a fishing vessel was capsized causing four casualties owing to the trawl gears hooked by a pipeline maib 1998 besides one offshore pipeline segment in china was reported destroyed by a hooked anchor yang et al 2017 unlike the research on impact or pull over there was very limited literature that investigated the hooking event moshagen et al 1980 discussed the possibility of hooking events for trawl doors and beam trawls a series of experiments aimed at pipeline overtrawl have recorded some hooking events details e g warp line tension test conditions nygaard 2002 wu et al 2013 developed a numerical model to describe the hooking events which shows a good ability to predict that whether hooking events will happen based on this numerical model and model tests a simplified method to estimate the probability of hooking events for otter board has been proposed wu et al 2015 it can be seen that those limited research mainly focused on the possibility or conditions of hooking events occurrence the failure mechanism as well as the response of pipelines subjected to the hooking loads is equally crucial and requires enough research efforts so that the effects of many influence factors on the pipeline failure could be investigated as this will supply an abundant reference for pipeline safety design and contribute to the supplementary research gaps besides during the trawling activities the towed demersal gears have a great impact on seabed sediments e g scouring or morphological changes of the seabed gilkinson et al 1998 paschen et al 2002 paschen 2005 the soil sediment could be penetrated by the trawl gears and produce lateral displacements and large deformations ivanović et al 2011 esmaeili and ivanović 2014 dingle et al 2008 the soil around the pipeline will form berms which may restrict the pipeline movement and influence the pipeline response during hooking events this effect of seabed flexibility and pipe soil interaction also needs to be investigated in this study a relatively comprehensive investigation on pipeline response due to hooking loads is carried out by experiment and numerical simulation which can give an insight into the pipeline failure mechanism and provide sufficient information for engineering design the objectives of the present effort are summarized as follows 1 a quasi static pipeline hooking experiment is carried out to examine the failure mechanism 2 a numerical model of the pipeline response is developed and verified with the experiment then the effect of boundary conditions ratio of diameter to the wall thickness and internal pressure on pipeline response and failure mechanism is examined 3 furthermore considerations of seabed flexibility and pipe soil interaction are included in the numerical model involving the soil plastic deformation and penetration a study of the effects of embedment depth soil properties and friction is conducted 2 experimental details the hooking phase is reproduced as a lateral quasi static loading procedure on the pipeline which is suggested in the recommended practice dnv rp f111 2013 a series of tests are carried out to investigate the pipeline failure mechanism and response with different conditions namely the ratio of length to diameter and the ratio of diameter to wall thickness 2 1 experimental set up the experimental system is illustrated in fig 1 a microcomputer controlled universal test machine with a capacity of 100 kn was employed to supply the quasi static loadings a wedge shaped indenter was used to simulate the effect of the trawl board force and displacement transducers are mounted in this machine to acquire the test data during the loading phase the pipeline was sustained by a couple of identical braced frames indicating that the relative positions of the pipeline ends are identical moreover lateral and vertical displacements of the pipeline two ends are restricted namely simply support end condition the distance between the frames can be flexible for pipelines with different lengths it should be noted that in the vertical direction the pipeline should be held at a suitable height underneath which enough space is kept for the subsequently loading process prior to the test in the horizontal direction the relative positions of the pipeline braced frames and indentor were adjusted to ensure that the pipeline midspan is perpendicular to the indentor moreover the height of the pipeline ends and midspan were measured and adjusted to the same height to ensure the pipeline straightness then by the control system a displacement control load was slowly applied to the pipeline accompanied by automatically recording the force f and the corresponding displacement u when the recorded force no longer increased it means that the pipeline structure reached collapse and then the applied load can be stopped 2 2 experimental results and discussion in this experiment several cases are designed considering different ratios of length to diameter ratios of diameter to wall thickness which are listed in table 1 the material of the pipeline specimen is q195 steel the yield strength young s modulus and poisson s ratio are 205 mpa 206 gpa and 0 3 respectively it should be noted that the geometric similarity principle was mainly considered in this experiment which is the common practice in the related research zeinoddini et al 2013 yu et al 2016 gao et al 2016 considering the loading capacity and the available space in the laboratory the scale ratio was determined as 1 10 jia et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 fig 2 shows some on scene photographs of the experiment global bending deformation during the hooking procedure and a permanent local plastic dent after loading can be seen to quantify the deformation response fig 3 shows the normalized local dent depth δ d as well as the global response of each case it should be noted that the global response is defined as u δ d which is suggested in the literature firouzsalari and showkati 2013 in case 3 the global response of 2 20 is significant however the local deformation of 0 15 is small by contrast a large local dent of 0 26 and a slight global response of 0 60 are produced in case 5 in otherwise identical conditions the local dent damage increases with the decrease in the ratio of diameter to wall thickness d t and decreases with the increase in the ratio of length to diameter l s d the load displacement curves of each case are depicted in fig 4 moreover the ultimate force and the corresponding critical displacement of each case extracted from the curves in fig 4 are presented in table 2 in general those curves show a similar changing tendency each curve consists of three stages 1 linear increase stage 2 nonlinear increase stage and 3 yield stage however the details of each curve are different for example the abscissa range for the linear increase stage of case 2 is from 0 to 0 23 while for case 3 this range is from 0 to 1 1 a similar trend can be seen when comparing case 1 and case 4 of which the range is from 0 to 0 07 and from 0 to 0 3 respectively this can be explained by the differences in the ratios of length to diameter l s d when comparing case 3 case 4 and case 5 the ultimate strength increases with the decrease in l s d especially in case 5 some improvement in ultimate strength may be caused by the local failure mode that the dent depth is 0 26 approximately 1 7 times that of case 3 this is consistent with the findings that the indenting force is inversely proportional to pipe length allan and marshall 1992 research has found that different l s d will cause a change in pipeline resistance and damage extent subjected to lateral loadings allan and marshall 1992 zeinoddini et al 1998 the comparison between the euler bernoulli beam theory and the timoshenko beam theory han et al 1999 may account for this phenomenon when the l s d is large the shear deformation is less significant indicating that the pipeline presents a global collapse mode for cases with small l s d a pipeline local damage is mainly imposed presenting a local buckling failure mode this phenomenon is significant when comparing the response of case 1 and case 4 the normalized ultimate force and local dent depth of case 1 and case 4 are 4 13 and 0 38 2 71 and 0 26 respectively it seems that the failure mode of the former is dominated by local damage while the failure mode of the latter is dominated by global collapse this is supported by the above analysis that the key factor influencing the pipeline response is the ratio of l s d besides as a result of the largest l s d for case 3 the critical displacement is 2 8 times those of case 2 showing an evident global response 3 numerical model description the pipeline response subjected to hooking loads is simulated with the general purpose 3d finite element method software abaqus dassault systemes 2016 as shown in fig 5 there are three parts in this model namely pipeline trawl board and seabed soil geometry and material nonlinearities for both pipeline and seabed soil are considered meantime considering the pipe soil interaction and soil large deformation coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method is employed to establish this numerical model 3 1 numerical method the cel method has proved to solve large deformation problems and has been applied widely in geotechnical simulation qiu et al 2011 zhao and liu 2015 the present model when considering pipe soil interaction is set up with cel method both the traditional lagrangian element and eulerian element are employed and coupled the eulerian meshes are fixed in space and keep undeformed the material can move through those meshes and be traced by calculating its eulerian volume fraction evf in the present model the seabed is modeled as the eulerian domain which consists of two regions material region and void region shown in fig 5 the material region is filled with soil material while the void region is set to trace potential soil movement on the seabed surface furthermore the pipeline and the trawl board are modeled in the lagrangian domain the interaction between the two domains structures and soil is described with a penalty contact algorithm 3 2 numerical setup pipeline geometry and material properties in the numerical model are in common range for the offshore oil and gas industry pipeline outer diameter d is 0 35 m wall thickness t is 0 02 m pipeline material is x65 steel density is 7850 kg m3 yield strength σ y is 448 mpa elastic modules is 206 gpa poisson s ratio μ is 0 3 linear isotropic strain hardening model is employed to describe the plasticity model of the steel pipeline material which proves to be more suitable for quasi static monotonic loadings zeinoddini et al 2013 the pipeline is modeled with shell elements s4r the number of circumferential elements is 32 the longitudinal element size is 0 12d in the lateral loading areas and gradually increases for other areas fixed end and simply support boundary conditions are considered in the following analysis the rectangular trawl board is simulated of which the length is 4 5 m height 3 5 m and mass is 4500 kg with a hydrodynamic added mass of 2 14 times the trawl board mass longva 2014 this type of trawl board has been found to give the highest loads on pipelines dnv rp f111 2013 to account for the hydrodynamic loadings an equivalent density including the added mass are employed and no deformation is considered for the trawl board which is modeled as a rigid body with a reference node the seabed is discretized with ec3d8r elements the soil material is clay it is prevalent in the regions of underwater hydrocarbon development dingle et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 ivanović and o neill 2015 and widely spread in bohai sea areas liu et al 2013 2015 jiang et al 2019 where the pipeline system is well developed mohr coulomb m c model is applied to describe the elastic plastic behavior of clay which is efficient and widely used jiang and xie 2011 the poisson s ratio of clay is 0 49 the elastic stiffness is set equal to 500 times the undrained shear strength s u tian et al 2014 considering the boundary effects and calculation resources the seabed dimensions are set to 100 m 283d in length 8 m 23d in width and 3 3 m 9d in height 3d is for the void region based on a preliminary study and results from other researchers zeinoddini et al 2013 ivanović et al 2011 the element size is 0 15d 0 15d in the lateral loading areas and gradually increase to the boundaries fixed end and lateral confinement conditions are set for seabed bottom surface and other lateral surfaces respectively the contact between structures and seabed is described by the penalty function algorithm a geostatic step is first set up to gain an initial converged stress state for seabed soil which is in balance with the gravity and seawater pressures and could influence the soil behavior and the subsequent pipeline response pike and kenny 2016 then the trawl board gradually applied the hooking loads on the pipeline in a quasi static step 3 3 numerical validation with the same material geometry mechanical properties and boundary conditions the experiment is reproduced by the numerical model illustrated above it should be noted that the effect of seabed soil is excluded in this model comparisons of the numerical results and experiments are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 generally both the load displacement curves and the pipeline deformation response were in good agreement with those of the experiments for the comparison of load displacement curves the results of the two methods are close in the linear stage however in the nonlinear and yield stage some small discrepancies can be observed especially in case 1 and case 5 meantime those discrepancies can be also found in the comparison of deformation response this is probably caused by the omission of the stress strain gradient for shell elements in the numerical model for case 1 and case 5 the normalized dent depth is 0 38 and 0 26 respectively however the normalized global response is pretty small of approximately 0 15 and 0 30 it indicates that the local response is mainly imposed as a result of the small l s d zeinoddini et al 1998 han et al 1999 which generates large local deformation and intense strain and stress gradient in the shell thickness direction that is not considered in the numerical model for the cases with large l s d the discrepancies are relatively small nevertheless the numerical model shows a good ability to reproduce the simulations of hooking loading on pipelines 4 numerical analysis with the verified numerical model pipeline response due to hooking loads and the effects from various influences are analyzed including the boundary conditions wall thickness and internal pressure subsequently considering the pipe soil interaction a preliminary analysis on embedment depth soil properties and friction is conducted and the results are discussed 4 1 boundary condition the response of pipelines with two boundary conditions fixed end and simply support are described and compared it is noted that the pipelines rest on the rigid seabed with no internal pressures the load displacement curves are plotted in fig 8 it shows that the force increases dramatically with the pipeline lateral displacement and then drops suddenly when the pipeline ends are fixed while under the simple support condition the increasing trend between the force and lateral displacement firstly keeps stable then gradually decreases and finally the force drops which falls into the same patterns of the experiment results namely linear increase stage nonlinear increase stage and yield stage besides the ultimate force under the fixed end condition is much larger than that under the simple support condition however the corresponding critical lateral displacement presents the opposite rule for example when the pipeline diameter d is 350 mm under the fixed end condition the ultimate force and the corresponding critical lateral displacement are approximately 1400 knand 3 6 m however those values change to 70 knand 20 m under the simple support condition this phenomenon can be explained by soreide and kavlie 1985 zeinoddini et al 1998 which pointed out that the limit load under fixed end condition is significantly enhanced owing to the membrane action caused by the restriction from the fixed end fig 9 shows the pipeline circumferential profiles with different lateral displacement u under the two boundary conditions a significant deformation with the lateral displacement increasing can be observed when the ends are fixed which eventually forms a half round shape however when the ends are simply supported the deformation keeps small even though the lateral displacement reaches 15 m after which the deformation becomes evident and finally forms an elliptical shape fig 10 gives the equivalent plastic strains for the circumferential profiles it should be noted that under the fixed end conditions the whole profile is fully yielded with large and uniformed plastic strain which seems to belong to a longitudinal tensile failure pattern while under the simple support condition plastic strains in the hooked side and the opposite side are crucial than ones on the other two sides which presents in an 8 shape in general the plasticity is smaller than that under the fixed end condition maximum equivalent plastic strain is about 0 2 and 1 0 respectively which may belong to a lateral bending failure pattern to give an insight on the pipeline global response and failure mechanism lateral displacement along the longitudinal axis is shown in fig 11 under the fixed end condition the lateral displacement distribution shape is sharper and gradually becomes triangular but under the simple support condition the distribution curve is more smooth and shows an arch shape besides the maximum lateral displacement under the simple support condition is much larger than that under the fixed end condition 20 m 4 m respectively indicating that the global response is more significant owing to the strict fixed condition the pipeline is not as flexible as that under simple support condition which limits the lateral movement and the expansion of pipeline ends therefore membrane action arises and longitudinal membrane force is gradually developed allan and marshall 1992 it is believed that pipeline ultimate strength is enhanced and dominated by the longitudinal extension while under the simple support condition lateral movement is relatively flexible and global bending response is triggered belonging to a bending failure pattern the bending moment distribution depicted in fig 12 can support the above discussion it shows that in the fixed end condition the moment is merely concentrated in the hooking central area and the ends with the increase in the lateral displacement the bending moment firstly increases and then keeps decreasing when the displacement reaches 2 5 m which means the pipeline failure is less associated with the bending moment while under the simple support condition the bending moment is larger and distributes more widely along the longitudinal axis the structure bending capacity is supplied by each pipeline element which determines the ultimate strength large hooking force and serious local buckling will cause catastrophic damage to both pipeline and trawl vessels maib 1998 dnv rp f107 2010 as a result to avoid non conservative assessment the fixed end boundary condition is applied to the following simulations 4 2 wall thickness the load displacement curves of pipelines with different wall thicknesses are depicted in fig 13 with the increase in wall thickness the structure s ultimate strength is improved but the corresponding critical lateral displacement decreases for example the critical displacement is 3 76 m with a wall thickness of 5 mm however it changes to 3 58 mm with a wall thickness of 20 mm it is believed that increasing wall thickness can enhance the pipeline stiffness consequently the ultimate strength subjected to hooking loads is improved which is more significant when the wall thickness is larger than 7 mm fig 14 gives the deformations of pipelines with different wall thicknesses in the circumferential profile it shows that local buckling is more severe with thinner wall thickness due to the lower capacity pipeline local deformation is prone to occur for example with the wall thickness of 7 mm when the lateral displacement is 2 m a significant dent can be seen however the pipeline with a wall thickness of 15 mm hardly deforms plastic strain distributions in the circumferential profile are plotted in fig 15 to facilitate the comparison only the distribution before the structure s ultimate bearing capacity stage is depicted the distribution characteristics are different with the wall thickness of 7 mm plastic strain firstly occurs in the hooked central area then spreads to the whole hooked side at that time u 2 5 m there is less deformation opposite to the hooked side finally with the bending and tensile loading the plastic strain gradually spreads to the whole circumferential profile the maximum plastic strain appears on the two inclined sides approximately 30 of the hooked area when the wall thickness is 15 mm significant plastic strain mainly concentrates on the centre of the hooked area similarly plastic deformation occurs all over the profile with the tensile loading the research of zhang et al 2016 can further support this conclusion that with the increase in wall thickness the maximum plastic strain position moves from the two sides to the centre of the impacted area in general the damage in the circumferential profile is the combination of the local indent and the global tensile the final failure characteristics are determined according to the related information such as the pipeline geometry or material parameters 4 3 internal pressures pipelines with different internal pressures subjected to hooking loads are simulated fig 16 shows the relationships between force and lateral displacement it shows that with the internal pressure increases both the structure ultimate strength and the corresponding critical lateral displacement decreases for example the ultimate force and the corresponding critical lateral displacement decrease from 1275 knand 3 57 m to 1030 knand 3 35 m when the internal pressure increases from 5 mpa to 20 mpa the highly pressurized pipeline is prone to suffer hooking damage it is believed that internal pressure improves the pipeline global and radial stiffness which causes higher stress yang et al 2011 chen et al 1998 fig 17 gives the geometries of the circumferential profiles for pipelines with the internal pressure of 5 mpa and 20 mpa it shows that the deformation decreases significantly with the increasing pressure serious local buckling occurs when the internal pressure is 5 mpa however under the pressure of 20 mpa only the pipeline hooked side becomes indented while other sides in the circumferential profile maintain the original shape fig 18 shows the plastic strain distributions of pipelines with internal pressure of 5 mpa and 20 mpa to facilitate the comparison the distributions after structure s ultimate bearing capacity stage are excluded when the pressure is 5 mpa the plastic strain focuses mainly on the central area in the hooked side and distributes evenly opposite to the hooked side the maximum plastic strain appears in the hooked central area while under the pressure of 20 mpa only small plastic strain can be found in the central area of the hooked side the plastic strain distributes mostly opposite to the hooked side owing to the bending and tensile loadings it is believed that the pipeline profile is stiff enough to prevent the local indent by trawl board most energy is converted to pipeline global deformation and causes failure this finding can be explained by the conclusions of chen et al 1998 who performed a series of impact experiments on pipes and found out that pipeline tensile failure is prone to be caused by the global effects from the internal pressure 4 4 seabed flexibility 4 4 1 embedment depth offshore pipelines will penetrate into the seabed to some degree though they are usually installed unburied the responses of pipelines with different embedment depths during hooking loads are studied fig 19 shows the load displacement curves where the undrained shear strength is 12 kpa it shows that with the increase in embedment depth e the ultimate force increases which is significant when the results with e 0 3d and e 0 1d are compared the lateral movement of the embedded pipeline is depicted in fig 20 it shows that seabed soil ahead of the embedded pipeline is penetrated and form soil berms with the hooking loading the pipeline gradually climbs up to the seabed surface along the longitudinal axis the lateral penetrated degree of the soil is different the formed soil berms are forced to slip on the soil surface which is consistent with the berm sliding mechanism observed from the centrifugal test dingle et al 2008 what is important is that the deformed soil berms will obstruct the pipeline movement and therefore influence the pipeline response besides large deformation of soil is triggered implying that part of the energy is absorbed in the soil plastic deformation the above phenomenon is investigated and discussed in the following fig 21 shows the pipeline vertical displacement along the longitudinal axis it should be noticed that the displacement distribution appears a m shape vertical displacement is lower in the middle where is the pipeline hooked area with the distance increases from the hooked area the vertical displacement gradually increases moreover when the distance reaches 20 m the vertical displacement begins to decline it is believed that the hooked centre area where the hooking load applies directly is forced to penetrate the ahead soil and to climb upwards accompanied by driving the soil berms to slip however as the distance from the centre area increases the driving force and penetration process gradually attenuates owing to the resistance from the embedded soil the pipeline tends to climb upwards to the seabed surface with less penetration this phenomenon is obvious around the peak region approximately 20 m in the abscissa and the corresponding vertical position is roughly at the seabed surface 4 4 2 soil mechanics properties soil mechanical properties are important to the response of embedded pipelines owing to the relationship between the load and the soil resistance pipelines with different soil properties subjected to hooking load are simulated fig 22 depicts the load displacement curves a non linear relationship between the undrained shear strength s u and the ultimate force can be observed with the increase of s u the ultimate force increases moreover it begins to decrease when s u is larger than 12 kpa for example the ultimate force is 1476 kn with s u of 8 kpa however with s u of 24 kpa the ultimate force decreases to 1290 kn in addition the load displacement curve is almost the same as that of the pipeline with no embedment depth e 0 except for the peak at the very beginning lateral displacement 1 m it seems that the obstruction from stiffer soil is not significant fig 23 shows the pipeline vertical displacements with different undrained shear strengths a typical m shaped distribution can be observed when s u is 4 kpa which is similar to the result in fig 21 furthermore the lowest displacement in the middle part is less than 6 mm indicating that the soil is almost fully penetrated by the pipeline lateral movement and only small upward climbing movement of the pipeline can be observed it is believed that the pipeline in the hooked area is prone to penetrate laterally owing to the low residual resistance from the soft soil berms when s u is 24 kpa the distribution pattern changes presenting a unimodal distribution the biggest peak region is in the middle which is contrary to the m shaped distribution in the hooked centre area small soil berms are formed due the pipeline lateral penetration driven by the relatively large hooking load the soil lateral resistance is large to an extent that the pipeline tends to climb upwards along the soil rather than laterally penetrate the soil let alone the pipeline segments far from the centre area where the load is attenuated significantly that is believed to explain that why a small peak appears in the curve e 0 2d s u 24 kpa in fig 22 fig 24 gives the total plastic strain of the seabed soils with different strengths the results agree with the above discussion with the increase in undrained shear strength the soil plastic strain decreases in general the vertical responses of pipelines is associated with soil resistance and hooking loads because stiffer soil is hard to be penetrated pipelines prone to climb upwards on the soil driven by the hooking loads and vice versa large plastic deformation is triggered when the soil is soft coming back to the load displacement curves the plastic deformations can also account for the changing trend between ultimate force and soil properties for example when s u is less than 12 kpa the soil is relatively soft large plastic deformation indicates a sufficient penetration process with the increase in undrained shear strength the resistance from soil becomes large and an increased force is required to drive the pipeline movement however when the soil strength keeps increasing most part of the hooking loads are used to drive the pipeline to climb upwards along with the soil rather than penetrate the soil laterally therefore soil resistance is less from the limited plastic deformation which causes a drop in ultimate force 4 4 3 soil friction the friction of the interface between pipeline and soil seems to influence the pipeline response which is discussed in this section a series of cases are simulated including the variation in friction coefficient f 0 2 0 6 and soil undrained shear strength s u 4 12 kpa the load displacement curves of those cases are shown in fig 25 for otherwise identical conditions with the increase in f the ultimate force also increases however the increasing trend is different for various soil properties when s u is 4 kpa there is a limited improvement while when s u is 12 kpa a significant increase in ultimate force can be observed with s u of 8 kpa the ultimate force increases slowly when f is larger than 0 4 some reasons can be found when the soil plastic strain is investigated which is shown in fig 26 the dashed lines show the relationship between the plastic strains and the friction coefficients with different soil properties the increasing trend of the curve with s u of 4 kpa is more stable due to the softer soil large plastic deformation is triggered even for a small f of 0 2 in this situation the effect of friction is not significant however the curves under the other two conditions have a bigger growth trend the plastic strain increases rapidly from a small value it shows that when the soil becomes stiff the friction becomes important for soil plastic deformation which influences the pipeline response fig 27 depicts the pipeline vertical displacements along the longitudinal axis the results exhibit two different distribution patterns for the cases with f of 0 2 and 0 6 when f is 0 2 the vertical displacement presents a unimodal distribution and with the lateral movement of the pipeline the peak in the middle gradually becomes flat the final vertical displacement of the flat peak maintains at about 70 mm which is the position of the original seabed surface indicating that nearly no penetration occurs it is believed that lateral penetration with small soil berms only occurs in the hooked area at the very beginning owing to the lower friction between soil and pipeline soil lateral resistance is hard to be overcome and the penetration process attenuates dramatically as a consequence the pipeline is prone to climb up from the initial embedment gap and move laterally with hardly any penetration on the soil that is the reason for the small peak for the corresponding curve e 0 2d f 0 6 in fig 25 c when f increases to 0 6 a m shaped distribution can be observed indicating that a sufficient lateral penetration process occurs during the hooking phase in such situations the effect of friction is important for pipeline response which is in accordance with the above analysis 5 conclusions pipeline response subjected to hooking loads is crucial but not much studied in this article experiments and numerical simulations are used to give the insight to pipeline failure mechanism by hooking loads besides the effects of seabed flexibility and pipe soil interaction are considered in an exploratory study the main conclusions are as follows 1 experiments of hooking simulation of pipelines showed that the load displacement response consists of three stages linear increase stage nonlinear increase stage and yield stage the ratio of length to diameter l s d is a key factor to govern a global or local response of the pipeline specimen 2 both the simple support and fixed end boundary conditions of the pipelines are considered in numerical simulation under the simple support condition the pipeline response shows the same changing tendency of the experiment results and the pipeline failure is mainly caused by the global bending under the fixed end condition the longitudinal tension is responsible for the pipeline failure owing to the membrane action the ultimate strength in the fixed end condition is larger than the other one and the corresponding lateral displacement is smaller 3 with the increase in wall thickness the pipeline s ultimate strength is improved the plastic strain distribution also differs the position of maximum plastic strain moves from the two sides to the centre of the hooked area highly pressurized pipelines are prone to suffer hooking damage owing to the enhanced stiffness and stress the plastic strain is distributed mainly opposite the hooked area 4 pipeline embedment and soil pipe interaction are considered in cel numerical model during the hooking phase large plastic deformation of the soil is triggered and more energy is dissipated soil berms are formed to restrict the pipeline lateral movement causing an increase in the ultimate force and influencing the pipeline response the relationship between the soil mechanical strength and the ultimate force is nonlinear the pipeline movement pattern also differs with the increase in soil strength the pipeline is prone to climb upwards along the soil rather than lateral penetrate on the soil with the increase in friction between pipeline and soil the ultimate force also increases this effect is less significant when s u is 4 kpa in which large soil plastic deformation is produced even with a lower friction

21837,the muscle contraction model of pre strains is employed to study the intermittent swimming gait of a 2d freely swimming fish the fluid structure interaction problem of fish swimming is solved with the finite elements method benefits of the intermittent swimming and the effects of the duty cycle and the tail swing number in a burst phase are emphasized the results show that compared to the steady swimming a huge energy saving for swimming can be achieved by sacrificing a little speed during the intermittent swimming moreover the fish swimming can be gradually transited from an intermittent mode to the continuous mode by increasing the duty cycle with a smaller duty cycle the fish can save more energy to obtain the same swimming velocity a smaller tail swing number in a burst phase is more helpful to improve the energy utilization rate under the condition of r duty 0 5 in addition the intermittent swimming will have more benefits at the lower and the higher average swimming speeds and it is very important to have a proper proportion of the velocity bounds for the performance improvement of the intermittent swimming these conclusions may have direct meanings for the development of biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles keywords intermittent swimming active distortions energy saving biomechanics fluid structure interaction 1 introduction many ﬂying and swimming animals exhibit an intermittent locomotion behavior compared to the continuous locomotion in the aquatic environment the burst and coast swimming is widely used by fishes and marine mammals such as salmons tetras and seals calovi et al 2017 williams 2001 in addition birds use the interspersed periods of ﬂapping and gliding known as the undulating ﬂight mode rayner et al 2001 ribak et al 2005 tobalske 2001 tobalske et al 2010 the diversity and convergence are coexisting in the locomotion strategies of animals scaradozzi et al 2017 reviewed the classification of fish locomotion modes and the biological propulsion principles for the development of biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles auvs the strategy of intermittent locomotion was regarded as a result of the convergent evolution under the great pressure for efficient locomotion gleiss et al 2011 specifically the intermittent locomotion consists of the active burst ﬂying or swimming and the inactive gliding in which the body is kept straight and motionless videler and weihs 1982 in the past decades researchers have been intrigued by the intermittent locomotion behavior of animals especially the burst and coast swimming theoretically an analysis of the mechanics of burst and coast swimming showed a large energy saving of more than 50 compared with the steady swimming weihs 1974 wu et al 2007 examined the body kinematics and the flow in the wakes of koi carps swimming in a burst and coast mode by experiment an energy saving of about 45 was estimated for the burst and coast swimming of the koi carps compared with the steady swimming at the same mean speed a comparative study on the flow fields of fish larvae and adults in the burst and coast swimming was conducted by müller et al 2000 mwaffo et al 2017 studied the burst and cruise swimming movements of zebrafish using particle image velocimetry obviously it is difficult to conduct experiments directly on live fishes due to the complexity and uncontrollability of the fish behaviors experimental and numerical simulation methods of bio inspired robots have been widely applied to study the mechanics principles underlying biological swimming costa et al 2019 2018 2017 chan et al 2007 floryan et al 2017 studied the intermittent swimming motions of a rigid pitching foil in a recirculating free surface water channel in general the intermittent locomotion is often accompanied by the changes in depth for marine animals these species show an undulating ﬂight behavior like birds by using their negative buoyancy the fish sink down into the deeper water by gliding and then actively swim upwards to the original depth gleiss et al 2011 a transformation of the potential energy into kinetic energy is made during the gliding which is considered to provide a saving of mechanical power on the other hand many fish species who are neutrally buoyant still tend to adopt an intermittent locomotion style iosilevskii 2016 weihs 1974 this indicates that the intermittent locomotion is generally used by swimming animals and is bound to have significant advantages compared to the continuous locomotion however up to now most of existing studies are focused on the continuous locomotion style especially in the aspect of numerical simulation numerical studies are helpful to shed lights on the mechanisms of fish steady swimming borazjani and sotiropoulos 2008 chang et al 2012 xia et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2002 in contrast numerical studies of the intermittent locomotion are relatively few akoz and moored 2017 takagi et al 2013 xia et al 2018 in this paper we consider a neutrally buoyant fish that performs a burst and coast swimming at a constant depth and thus a 2d numerical study is feasible the fish swimming was widely studied by the 2d numerical simulations bao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 deng et al 2006 karbasian esfahani 2017 sun et al 2018 xiao and liao 2010 zhang and zheng 2009 essentially the mechanical power needed by a swimming fish is generated by the muscles rome et al 1993 and the process of swimming is a typical problem of fluid structure interaction fsi therefore a proper modeling of the muscle contraction and an effective solving scheme of the fsi problem are vital to the simulation of fish swimming for the past few years the notion of active distortions also known as the pre strains has been successfully applied to model the muscle functioning evangelista et al 2011 nardinocchi et al 2013 nardinocchi et al 2013 2007 shaw et al 2015 curatolo and teresi 2016 creatively adopted the muscle contraction model of pre strains to study the steady swimming of a virtual carangiform fish following curatolo and teresi 2016 we will model the intermittent swimming gait of a carangiform fish with the muscle contraction model of pre strains the remaining of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the details of the fish model and the adopted simulation method will be introduced in section 3 a comparative study on the intermittent swimming gait of the virtual fish with the continuous swimming mode will be performed then the effects of the duty cycle and the tail swing number in a burst phase on the propulsive performance will be investigated in addition the results of present study will be compared with the previous researches finally we will summarize the conclusions of this work and will outline the future research directions in section 4 2 material and methods as previously mentioned a neutrally buoyant fish swimming at a constant depth is considered in view of the absence of up and down motion a 2d simplification is possible to grasp the key features of fish swimming the fsi problem of swimming is solved with the finite elements method fem by using the commercial software of comsol multiphysics version 5 4 the surrounding fluid of the fish is set as the liquid water modeled with the navier stokes equations the fish body is modeled as an isotropic and linear elastic material whose bending motion is stimulated by a time varying field of pre strains 2 1 fish model as shown in fig 1 a 2d streamlined fish model is mainly made up of a naca 64012 foil whose chord length is c 0 1 m the trailing edge of the foil is truncated at the 95 chord length point then a caudal fin with a uniform width of about 0 0051c is attached to the caudal peduncle the length of the caudal fin is 0 1c and a chamfering is made at the tip of caudal fin ultimately this bilaterally symmetrical fish model has a total length of l 0 105 m apart from the caudal fin the rest part of the fish model is divided into four parts with a relatively inflexible anterior body section the fish head is modeled as a rigid domain with an axial length of 0 2c the muscles of the fish body are divided into the right and the left halves by the backbone in the middle portion of the fish body we do not perform a functional segmentation of the fish muscles in spite of that the muscles may have two principal types the slow twitch or red muscles and the fast twitch or white muscles altringham and ellerby 2000 jayne and lauder 1994 rome et al 1988 different muscle types may have different mechanical and energetic properties and this issue is beyond the scope of this study the backbone has a uniform width of 0 001c in this fish model only the right and left muscles are actively stimulated to produce the contraction and relaxation that means the movements and deformations of the backbone and the caudal fin are entirely passive although previous studies have shown that the fins of fish are actively controlled by the musculoskeletal or musculo vascular systems flammang and lauder 2009 pavlov et al 2017 ren et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the fish model is defined in a cartesian coordinate system o e 1 e 2 with the origin o at the tip of caudal fin and e 1 passes through the axis of symmetry of the fish model two coordinate variables of x and y are corresponding to the coordinate axes e 1 and e 2 therefore the tip of caudal fin and the tip of nose can be represented as 0 0 and l 0 respectively fig 2 gives the mesh details of the fish model used in this paper triangular meshes are generated in both the fluid domain and the solid domain and finer quadrilateral meshes are adopted near the fluid solid boundary between the fish model and the surrounding fluid 2 2 numerical method the swimming of the fish is simulated by using the fsi interface of comsol multiphysics the interface models both the fluid domain and the solid domain and includes a predefined condition for the interactions at the fluid solid boundary using a time dependent study the fsi interface considers the two way coupling effects between the deformable solid fish model and the surrounding fluid liquid water in order to track the path of long distance swimming both moving mesh and automatic re meshing technologies are applied fig 3 shows the change of meshes during the swimming indicating a successful simulation of the undulation movement of fish usually the lateral undulating motion of the fish midline is assigned as a backward traveling wave in the fish swimming simulations gao and triantafyllou 2018 li et al 2017 sun et al 2018 in fact however what we observed in the swimming of a live fish is a result of the interactions between the muscle actions and the water resistances therefore the fsi effects are vital for the simulation of fish swimming following curatolo and teresi 2016 we model the muscle contraction and relaxation through the notion of active distortions pre strains and simulate the fish swimming by solving the two way fsi problem in contrast we put emphasis on the intermittent swimming gait instead of the steady swimming firstly we make the fish muscles contract and relax alternately by applying the time varying pre strains then forces will arise in the muscles when the motion is hampered by the surrounding water resulting in the desired fish swimming movement the computational domain ω consists of a solid domain fish model ω s and a fluid domain liquid water ω f the interface between the solid domain and the fluid domain the fsi boundary is represented as ω s t state variables of the problem include the solid displacement field u u 1 u 2 describing the displacement of the fish model the fluid velocity field v v 1 v 2 representing the velocity distribution of the surrounding water the equations describing the fluid domain are the navier stokes equation for conservation of momentum and the continuity equation for conservation of mass 1 ρ f v t ρ f v v p i k f 2 ρ f v 0 the equation describing the balance of forces on the solid domain can be expressed as 3 ρ s 2 u t 2 s f v in these equations ρ f and ρ s are the mass density of the fluid and the solid respectively p is the pressure of the fluid and i denotes the unit diagonal matrix f is the external forces applied to the fluid and f v is the volumetric force exerted on the solid moreover the fluid is assumed to be incompressible ρ f constant the stress of the fluid is γ p i k where k μ v v t represents the viscous part of the fluid stress here μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid the deformation gradient of the solid is f i u and a multiplicative decomposition of f f e f 0 is made here f e and f 0 are the elastic deformation and a time varying distortions field respectively correspondingly the non linear strain measures are defined as 4 e 1 2 f t f i e 0 1 2 f 0 t f 0 i where the superscript t denotes the matrix transpose consequently the elastic strain can be represented as e e e e 0 the reference stress of the solid is given by 5 s f e s e f 0 6 s e y 1 ν e e ν y 1 ν 1 2 ν t r e e i where y and ν are the young s modulus and the poisson modulus of the solid respectively and f 0 det f 0 f 0 1 t as mentioned above the muscles function is modeled by the active distortions pre strains of e 0 e 0 x y t in addition the system of eqs 1 3 is subject to the fsi boundary conditions 7 tn p i k n v u where t s f 1 denotes the actual stress in the solid and n is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary the force exerted on the boundary of the fish body is the fluid reaction force induced by the movements of fish moreover the fluid velocity on the fsi boundary equals to the movement speed of the fish body it should be noted that the computational domain is a rectangular virtual aquarium with a length of 6 m and a width of 1 m all the four boundaries of the aquarium are set as no slip walls for more details about the simulation method see the literature curatolo and teresi 2016 and the help files of comsol multiphysics comsol inc 2018 2 3 swimming modes as mentioned above the research of burst and coast swimming mode is the emphasis in this paper for comparing the steady swimming mode is also considered in order to imitate the swimming of a carangiform fish the muscular movements are modeled by the time varying distortions with the following forms curatolo and teresi 2016 8 e 0 l x y t ε max sin ω t γ x 2 2 h x s t 9 e 0 r x y t ε max sin ω t γ x π 2 2 h x s t the superscripts l and r denote the left halve and the right halve of the fish muscles respectively based on this model the fish swims with an angular frequency of ω 2 π f and a wave number of γ 2 π λ here f and λ represent the tail beat frequency and the wavelength of the fish undulation respectively the parameter ε max is the maximum contraction amplitude of the fish muscles 10 h x x 2 l 2 l 2 11 s 1 t s t e p t 12 s 2 t s t e p t t r d u t y t inter 1 s t e p t r d u t y t inter t r d u t y t inter the function h x describes an increasing contraction amplitude of the fish muscles from the head to the tail to facilitate a smooth transition between the different swimming states a step function of s t e p t is applied where both the first and second continuous derivatives exist as shown in fig 4 a this step function makes a smooth transition from 0 to 1 over a period of time of t a and the reverse process can be achieved with the function of 1 s t e p t consequently the function s t s 1 t initiates the swimming from the rest to a steady swimming mode and the burst and coast swimming mode is achieved with the function of s t s 2 t see fig 4 b it should be noted that a periodic extension is made for the function s 2 t within the time interval of simulation for the function s 2 t the active muscle contractions begin to gradually reduce to 0 at the moment of t 1 enabling a smooth transition from the burst phase to the coast phase in the equations above t inter is the time period of the intermittent behavior which contains a burst phase and a followed coast phase r d u t y t 1 t inter is the duty cycle of the intermittent swimming the grey shaded areas showed in fig 4 b denote the coast phases of the swimming for clarity the key parameters of the simulation model are listed in table 1 the mass density of the fish model is slightly larger than that of fluid in our fish model the fish head is totally rigid and the majority area of the fish body is covered with muscles we set y m 0 7 mpa an nearly optimum stiffness value reported in tytell et al 2010 as the young s modulus of fish muscles the authors are not aware of any direct stiffness measurements for the fish backbone we choose the fish model of mchenry et al 1995 as a reference and set y b 0 2 mpa as the young s modulus of the fish backbone in addition we suppose a softer caudal fin with a young s modulus of y f 0 2 mpa compared with the fish muscles although salumae and kruusmaa 2011 have found that the fin seems to be stiffer than flesh this is due to the fact that in general many carangiform fishes possess elastic membranaceous fins and the muscle stiffness can increase with the muscle activities like curatolo and teresi 2016 we set ε max 0 12 in accordance with the fact that the superficial fibers of a swimming fish may shorten by about 10 of their resting length in addition each intermittent swimming period consists of an integral number of tail beat cycles of time which means a condition of t inter n t where n is an integer 3 results and discussion 3 1 grid independence test prior to conducting a detailed simulation study the tests of grid and time resolution independence are conducted a steady swimming case with f 4 hz λ l n 10 and r d u t y 0 5 is considered as shown in table 2 three different mesh densities are selected two temporal resolutions are chosen as δ t 1 t 500 and δ t 2 t 800 to catch the swimming details more accurately the finest mesh elements are close to the fish boundary for all the three mesh cases fig 5 a shows the comparison of the transient swimming velocity of fish v during the whole duration of simulation in addition it is generally acknowledged that the caudal fin has a great effect on the swimming performance of fish therefore we also compare the motion trajectories of the caudal fin tip fig 5 b gives the variations of y fintip the y coordinate of the caudal fin tip with time for all the cases there are no significant differences between the results of the medium mesh mesh b and the fine mesh mesh c under the condition of δ t 1 in addition for the mesh b the results of the two temporal resolutions are in good agreement eventually the mesh b and the time resolution δ t 1 t 500 500 steps per tail beat period are adopted in the following simulations 3 2 post processing we will examine and compare the swimming hydrodynamic forces and the energy expenditures of the two swimming modes by integrating the components of normal stress on the fsi boundary we can get the net forces exerted by the fish on the fluid 13 f j n e t ω s t p i k n e j d s j 1 2 in this equation the values of subscript j 1 2 represent the components in x and y directions respectively the parameter e j denotes the unit vectors in the direction of coordinate axes we decompose the net forces as follows borazjani and sotiropoulos 2008 14 f t j 1 2 f j n e t f j f d j 1 2 f j n e t f j 15 f j ω s t p n e j d s ω s t kn e j d s where f t j and f d j are the thrust and drag components respectively the swimming direction is assessed by computing the average horizontal component of fluid velocity v 1 on the fsi boundary 16 θ 1 l b ω s t a cos v 1 v d s where l b is the fish contour length therefore the net force f n e t the thrust force f t and the drag force f d along the swimming direction can be calculated as follows 17 f n e t f 1 n e t cos θ f 2 n e t cos π 2 θ f t f t 1 cos θ f t 2 cos π 2 θ f d f d 1 cos θ f d 2 cos π 2 θ obviously these three forces have the following relationship 18 f n e t f t f d the energy expenditure over a burst and coast swimming cycle is calculated as fish et al 1991 19 w b c w b w c where w b and w c are the energy expended during the burst phase and the coast phase respectively the rate of energy expended for a body moving through water is equal to the product of the drag force and the velocity fish et al 1991 the equation 19 can be rewritten as 20 w b c t 0 r d u t y t inter f d v d t r d u t y t inter t inter f d v d t where t 0 is the starting time of a burst phase and v is the fish swimming velocity three non dimensional parameters related to the fish swimming are the reynolds number re the swimming number sw and the strouhal number st which are defined as follows 21 re v s w i m l ρ f μ sw a ω l ρ f μ st a f v s w i m where v s w i m is the average swimming velocity of the fish over a tail beat cycle and a is the total excursion of the caudal fin from one side to the other over a tail beat cycle to compare the two swimming modes three parameters are introduced the ratio of the total energy expenditure c w the ratio of the average swimming velocity and the ratio of c v to c w δ which are defined as follows 22 c w w b c w s t e a d y c v v b c v s t e a d y δ c v c w where w b c and w s t e a d y are the total energy expenditures of the burst and coast swimming mode and the relevant steady swimming mode over the whole simulation process respectively v b c and v s t e a d y are the average swimming velocities of the two swimming modes over the whole simulation process in general the coast swimming will result in a velocity loss and an energy saving compared with the steady swimming consequently a higher value of c v indicates a less velocity loss and a smaller value of c w means a less energy expenditure for the burst and coast swimming while δ is a comprehensive parameter including the two aspects 3 3 benefits of intermittent swimming before going further we first take a quick look at the result of the intermittent swimming simulation fig 6 shows the instantaneous vorticity fields of a burst and coast swimming case with f 4 hz λ l t inter 10 t and r d u t y 0 5 the related animations of the burst and coast swimming simulation and the relevant steady swimming simulation can be found on line in the supplementary movies as movie s1 and movie s2 respectively in fig 6 a the fish starts to undulate its body and tail from the resting state consequently with the active undulations the fish swims forward successfully see fig 6 b after a burst phase down the fish begin to coast in fig 6 c fish straightens its body and glides forward without muscle activities in the coast phase see fig 6 d then the fish enters into a new burst phase and continues to swim forward see fig 6 e and f as shown in fig 6 the vorticity field is depicted and the motion trajectory of the caudal fin tip is also plotted with a black solid line the clockwise and counterclockwise vorticity values are plotted in blue and red respectively a typical reversed von karman vortex pattern can be clearly observed only in the wake of the burst phases compared with the steady swimming the main feature of the burst and coast swimming is that the reversed von karman vortex pattern appears intermittently fish strives to propel itself forward by undulating its body and caudal fin to push the adjacent water downward at the burst phases and then glides forward relying on inertia at the coast phases it should be noted that the swimming of the fish model is not perfectly horizontal from the left to right this is because the influences of the initial disturbances and the mesh asymmetries are inevitable and there is no any direction control scheme in the present simulations supplementary data related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2020 107391 the following are the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 multimedia component 2 multimedia component 2 to evaluate the potential benefits of intermittent swimming a comparative study of the intermittent swimming and the steady swimming is conducted in the tail beat frequency range of f 2 hz 4 hz each simulation trial consists of 30 tail beat cycles with λ l t inter 10 t and r d u t y 0 5 fig 7 shows the time histories of the swimming velocity of the intermittent swimming and the relevant steady swimming a similar change tendency of the swimming velocity is showed for all the three tail beat frequencies for the steady swimming mode the fish accelerates to swim forward and eventually reaches a constant average velocity in spite of the fluctuation in each tail beat cycle in contrast for the intermittent swimming mode a deceleration process can be observed in the coast phase and then an acceleration process is followed during the next burst phase this variation pattern of the swimming velocity coincides with the description of videler and weihs 1982 and the simulation results of akoz and moored 2017 moreover with the tail beat frequency increase both the acceleration and the final average swimming velocity of the steady mode are increased fig 8 gives the time histories of the instant thrust force and drag force for the three tail beat frequencies for clarity only the data of the last two time periods of intermittent swimming are plotted compared with the steady swimming mode with the absence of active muscle movements the thrust force reduces to zero during the coast phases at the same time the drag force is significantly less than that of the steady swimming mode and it decreases with the drop of swimming velocity this result conforms to the reality that the drag of an undulating fish body is greater than the drag of a coasting fish lighthill 1971 on the other hand the thrust force of the burst phase is much greater than the drag force resulting in the acceleration process see fig 7 during the burst phase with the increase of swimming velocity the drag force increases and the thrust force decreases furthermore the bar graphs seen in fig 9 show the comparison of the average thrust the average drag the average velocity and the total energy expended of the two swimming modes over the whole simulation process for each value the proportion of the result of intermittent swimming to that of the steady swimming is given as shown in fig 9 a and b the average thrust force and drag force for the two swimming modes are both increased with the tail beat frequency compared with the steady mode a same percentage of nearly 37 decrease in the average thrust and drag forces can be found by the intermittent swimming in addition we calculate the average swimming velocity based on the total swimming displacement and give the total energy expended over the whole simulation process the average swimming velocity almost scale linearly with the tail beat frequency see fig 9 c it is reasonable to assume that the fish tries to get a higher swimming speed with a less energy expenditure however the energy saving and the speed increase are often in conflict with each other as a consequence we have reasons to believe that there will be a tradeoff between these two aspects this may partly explain why the fish have to develop so many swimming patterns and switch freely between them as can be seen from fig 9 c and d a nearly 46 energy saving can be achieved by the intermittent swimming over the whole simulation process at the same time the energy saving is accompanied by a nearly 14 of speed droop in general if the swimming speed is not a priority it will pay to sacrifice a little speed for the huge energy saving 3 4 effect of the duty cycle in this subsection the effect of the duty cycle r d u t y on the performance of intermittent swimming will be investigated the duty cycle is varied from 0 3 to 0 7 every 0 1 and all other simulation conditions remain unchanged with that of the previous subsection it is worth noting that the steady swimming can be regarded as a special case of intermittent swimming with r d u t y 1 the effects of duty cycle on the parameters c w c v and δ are presented in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 a and b both the energy expenditure and the average swimming velocity of the intermittent swimming are increased with the increase of duty cycle as can be seen the fish swimming can be gradually transited from an intermittent mode to the continuous mode by increasing the duty cycle as shown in fig 10 c the parameter δ the ratio of c v to c w decreases with the duty cycle a higher value of δ is considered beneficial in improving the energy utilization rate which means less energy consumption up to a certain swimming velocity a smaller duty cycle means a longer glide time as a result the fish can save more energy to obtain the same swimming velocity this is in accordance with the simulation results of xia et al 2018 in a word if the swimming speed is not a priority a smaller duty cycle will be a better choice to save more energy by coasting more time moreover for the different values of duty cycle the change curves of δ accompanied with the tail beat frequency are drawn in fig 10 d compared with the higher and the lower frequencies the values of δ are smaller at the moderate frequencies this phenomenon is more obvious at the smaller duty cycle 3 5 effect of the tail swing number in a burst phase in this paper the intermittent swimming of fish is considered as a cyclical behavior with a time period of t inter n t all the simulation results showed above are based on the condition of t inter 10 t and that means each intermittent swimming period consists of 10 tail beat cycles of time wu et al 2007 have found that the carps have two burst modes the multiple tail beat mode mt mode and the half tail beat mode ht mode for the first mode the fish tail beats for at least one cycle in the burst phase by contrast the tail beats for only a half cycle for the second mode obviously the present simulations of the intermittent swimming are belong to the mt mode in order to investigate the effect of the tail swing number in a burst phase on the swimming performance four different values of the coefficient n i e n 6 10 15 and 30 are considered under the conditions of λ l and r d u t y 0 5 consequently the fish swings its tail for 3 5 7 5 and 15 times in each burst phase respectively as shown in fig 11 a the energy expenditures increase monotonically with n for the higher tail beat frequencies a further increase of n actually reduces the energy expenditures for the lower tail beat frequencies in contrast the average swimming velocities decrease with n and the change curve of c v has an anti clockwise rotation with the increase of tail beat frequency see fig 11 b as shown in fig 11 c the parameter δ decreases with n for all the tail beat frequencies therefore in the range considered the smaller value of n is the higher energy utilization rate is compared with the figs 10 d fig 11 d shows a same phenomenon that the moderate tail beat frequencies may result in a lower energy utilization rate as described above the average swimming velocity almost scale linearly with the tail beat frequency an assumption can be inferred that the intermittent swimming will have more benefits at the lower and the higher swimming speeds 3 6 comparison with the real swimmers in this subsection the results of present swimming simulation will be compared with that of the previous studies for the steady swimming the values of the strouhal number st the reynolds number re and the swimming number sw for some pairs of f λ are listed in table 3 and table 4 all the values are calculated when the acceleration period has terminated as shown in table 3 higher values of wavelength λ seem to produce a greater strouhal number which is in accordance with the result of curatolo and teresi 2016 as for the reynolds number re and the swimming number sw both parameters are increased with the tail beat frequency the reynolds number for the swimmers can be assumed to be proportional to the swimming number gazzola et al 2014 as shown in fig 12 the dashed line represents the proportional relation of re sw proposed by gazzola et al 2014 the ranges of re and sw for the four different genera of swimmer in the turbulent regime are depicted based on the measurements of gazzola et al 2014 the results of re and sw showed in table 4 are also plotted which show a good agreement with the proportional relation for the intermittent swimming we consider a water tunnel experiment on a nominally two dimensional pitching foil conducted by floryan et al 2017 they investigated the intermittent propulsion of a rigid pitching foil to understand the fish intermittent swimming behavior fig 13 shows the qualitative comparison of the computed energy expended ratio c w with the experimental data of floryan et al 2017 as shown in fig 13 the varying trend of computed c w is consistent with the experimental data according to the literature videler and weihs 1982 the cod frequently use the steady swimming at velocities between 1 4 bl s i e body lengths per second and 2 bl s and an intermittent swimming below 1 4 bl s at average velocities higher than 2 5 bl s the intermittent swimming is again the usual mode and the steady swimming is occasionally observed saithe exhibit a similar behavior under the same circumstances the proposed assumption that the intermittent swimming have more benefits at the lower and the higher swimming speeds illustrated above may partly explain this phenomenon for the effect of the coefficient n fig 14 a shows the time histories of the transient swimming velocity under the condition of f 4 h z within the same amount of simulation time the number of intermittent swimming cycles is decreased with the increase of n the transient swimming velocity has two bounds the lower bound u l represents the initial velocity of a burst phase e g point a and c and the upper bound u h represents the final velocity of a burst phase e g point b and d as shown in fig 14 a with the increase of n u h increases while u l decreases fig 14 b gives the measured data of u l bl s and u h bl s for the cod and saithe videler and weihs 1982 through the linear regression analysis we obtain a fitted curve u h 1 071 u l 1 328 giving a pearson correlation coefficient value of 0 897 and an r square value of 0 786 therefore u h is almost linear with u l in the intermittent swimming of live fish the results of u l and u h for the simulations showed in fig 11 are also plotted for the five clusters correspond to different frequencies the biases of the results from the fitted curve are increased with the increase of n from left to right combined with the previous content it can be concluded that a proper proportion of the velocity bounds is very important for the performance improvement of the intermittent swimming 4 conclusions in this work we have modeled and studied the intermittent swimming gait of a 2d carangiform fish with the muscle contraction model of pre strains a comparative study of the intermittent swimming and the steady swimming was conducted to evaluate the potential benefits of the intermittent swimming we compared the hydrodynamic forces swimming velocities and the energy expended of these two swimming modes during the whole simulation process we assumed that the fish tries to get a higher swimming speed with a less energy expenditure however simulation results showed that the energy saving and the speed increase are often in conflict with each other fish can reduce the energy consumption for swimming by using the intermittent gait at the same time however the average swimming velocity is inevitably reduced so we proposed an assumption that fish have to make a tradeoff between the energy saving and the gain of swimming speed this may partly explain why fish have to develop so many swimming patterns and switch freely between them we studied the effects of the duty cycle of intermittent swimming on the swimming performance the results showed that both the energy expenditure and the average swimming velocity are increased with the increase of duty cycle the fish swimming can be gradually transited from an intermittent mode to the continuous mode by increasing the duty cycle in addition we also considered the effect of the tail swing number in a burst phase on the swimming performance we found that a smaller tail swing number in a burst phase is more helpful to improve the energy utilization rate under the condition of r d u t y 0 5 moreover the intermittent swimming will have more benefits at the lower and the higher swimming speeds a proper proportion of the velocity bounds is very important for the performance improvement of the intermittent swimming these conclusions may have direct meanings for the development of auvs it should be noted that there are limitations to this 2d simulation study the muscles of fish may have two principal types the red muscles and the white muscles we did not perform a functional segmentation of the fish muscles however different muscle types may have different mechanical and energetic properties and thus affect the swimming performance in addition the three dimensional effects of the fish body

21837,the muscle contraction model of pre strains is employed to study the intermittent swimming gait of a 2d freely swimming fish the fluid structure interaction problem of fish swimming is solved with the finite elements method benefits of the intermittent swimming and the effects of the duty cycle and the tail swing number in a burst phase are emphasized the results show that compared to the steady swimming a huge energy saving for swimming can be achieved by sacrificing a little speed during the intermittent swimming moreover the fish swimming can be gradually transited from an intermittent mode to the continuous mode by increasing the duty cycle with a smaller duty cycle the fish can save more energy to obtain the same swimming velocity a smaller tail swing number in a burst phase is more helpful to improve the energy utilization rate under the condition of r duty 0 5 in addition the intermittent swimming will have more benefits at the lower and the higher average swimming speeds and it is very important to have a proper proportion of the velocity bounds for the performance improvement of the intermittent swimming these conclusions may have direct meanings for the development of biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles keywords intermittent swimming active distortions energy saving biomechanics fluid structure interaction 1 introduction many ﬂying and swimming animals exhibit an intermittent locomotion behavior compared to the continuous locomotion in the aquatic environment the burst and coast swimming is widely used by fishes and marine mammals such as salmons tetras and seals calovi et al 2017 williams 2001 in addition birds use the interspersed periods of ﬂapping and gliding known as the undulating ﬂight mode rayner et al 2001 ribak et al 2005 tobalske 2001 tobalske et al 2010 the diversity and convergence are coexisting in the locomotion strategies of animals scaradozzi et al 2017 reviewed the classification of fish locomotion modes and the biological propulsion principles for the development of biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles auvs the strategy of intermittent locomotion was regarded as a result of the convergent evolution under the great pressure for efficient locomotion gleiss et al 2011 specifically the intermittent locomotion consists of the active burst ﬂying or swimming and the inactive gliding in which the body is kept straight and motionless videler and weihs 1982 in the past decades researchers have been intrigued by the intermittent locomotion behavior of animals especially the burst and coast swimming theoretically an analysis of the mechanics of burst and coast swimming showed a large energy saving of more than 50 compared with the steady swimming weihs 1974 wu et al 2007 examined the body kinematics and the flow in the wakes of koi carps swimming in a burst and coast mode by experiment an energy saving of about 45 was estimated for the burst and coast swimming of the koi carps compared with the steady swimming at the same mean speed a comparative study on the flow fields of fish larvae and adults in the burst and coast swimming was conducted by müller et al 2000 mwaffo et al 2017 studied the burst and cruise swimming movements of zebrafish using particle image velocimetry obviously it is difficult to conduct experiments directly on live fishes due to the complexity and uncontrollability of the fish behaviors experimental and numerical simulation methods of bio inspired robots have been widely applied to study the mechanics principles underlying biological swimming costa et al 2019 2018 2017 chan et al 2007 floryan et al 2017 studied the intermittent swimming motions of a rigid pitching foil in a recirculating free surface water channel in general the intermittent locomotion is often accompanied by the changes in depth for marine animals these species show an undulating ﬂight behavior like birds by using their negative buoyancy the fish sink down into the deeper water by gliding and then actively swim upwards to the original depth gleiss et al 2011 a transformation of the potential energy into kinetic energy is made during the gliding which is considered to provide a saving of mechanical power on the other hand many fish species who are neutrally buoyant still tend to adopt an intermittent locomotion style iosilevskii 2016 weihs 1974 this indicates that the intermittent locomotion is generally used by swimming animals and is bound to have significant advantages compared to the continuous locomotion however up to now most of existing studies are focused on the continuous locomotion style especially in the aspect of numerical simulation numerical studies are helpful to shed lights on the mechanisms of fish steady swimming borazjani and sotiropoulos 2008 chang et al 2012 xia et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2002 in contrast numerical studies of the intermittent locomotion are relatively few akoz and moored 2017 takagi et al 2013 xia et al 2018 in this paper we consider a neutrally buoyant fish that performs a burst and coast swimming at a constant depth and thus a 2d numerical study is feasible the fish swimming was widely studied by the 2d numerical simulations bao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 deng et al 2006 karbasian esfahani 2017 sun et al 2018 xiao and liao 2010 zhang and zheng 2009 essentially the mechanical power needed by a swimming fish is generated by the muscles rome et al 1993 and the process of swimming is a typical problem of fluid structure interaction fsi therefore a proper modeling of the muscle contraction and an effective solving scheme of the fsi problem are vital to the simulation of fish swimming for the past few years the notion of active distortions also known as the pre strains has been successfully applied to model the muscle functioning evangelista et al 2011 nardinocchi et al 2013 nardinocchi et al 2013 2007 shaw et al 2015 curatolo and teresi 2016 creatively adopted the muscle contraction model of pre strains to study the steady swimming of a virtual carangiform fish following curatolo and teresi 2016 we will model the intermittent swimming gait of a carangiform fish with the muscle contraction model of pre strains the remaining of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the details of the fish model and the adopted simulation method will be introduced in section 3 a comparative study on the intermittent swimming gait of the virtual fish with the continuous swimming mode will be performed then the effects of the duty cycle and the tail swing number in a burst phase on the propulsive performance will be investigated in addition the results of present study will be compared with the previous researches finally we will summarize the conclusions of this work and will outline the future research directions in section 4 2 material and methods as previously mentioned a neutrally buoyant fish swimming at a constant depth is considered in view of the absence of up and down motion a 2d simplification is possible to grasp the key features of fish swimming the fsi problem of swimming is solved with the finite elements method fem by using the commercial software of comsol multiphysics version 5 4 the surrounding fluid of the fish is set as the liquid water modeled with the navier stokes equations the fish body is modeled as an isotropic and linear elastic material whose bending motion is stimulated by a time varying field of pre strains 2 1 fish model as shown in fig 1 a 2d streamlined fish model is mainly made up of a naca 64012 foil whose chord length is c 0 1 m the trailing edge of the foil is truncated at the 95 chord length point then a caudal fin with a uniform width of about 0 0051c is attached to the caudal peduncle the length of the caudal fin is 0 1c and a chamfering is made at the tip of caudal fin ultimately this bilaterally symmetrical fish model has a total length of l 0 105 m apart from the caudal fin the rest part of the fish model is divided into four parts with a relatively inflexible anterior body section the fish head is modeled as a rigid domain with an axial length of 0 2c the muscles of the fish body are divided into the right and the left halves by the backbone in the middle portion of the fish body we do not perform a functional segmentation of the fish muscles in spite of that the muscles may have two principal types the slow twitch or red muscles and the fast twitch or white muscles altringham and ellerby 2000 jayne and lauder 1994 rome et al 1988 different muscle types may have different mechanical and energetic properties and this issue is beyond the scope of this study the backbone has a uniform width of 0 001c in this fish model only the right and left muscles are actively stimulated to produce the contraction and relaxation that means the movements and deformations of the backbone and the caudal fin are entirely passive although previous studies have shown that the fins of fish are actively controlled by the musculoskeletal or musculo vascular systems flammang and lauder 2009 pavlov et al 2017 ren et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the fish model is defined in a cartesian coordinate system o e 1 e 2 with the origin o at the tip of caudal fin and e 1 passes through the axis of symmetry of the fish model two coordinate variables of x and y are corresponding to the coordinate axes e 1 and e 2 therefore the tip of caudal fin and the tip of nose can be represented as 0 0 and l 0 respectively fig 2 gives the mesh details of the fish model used in this paper triangular meshes are generated in both the fluid domain and the solid domain and finer quadrilateral meshes are adopted near the fluid solid boundary between the fish model and the surrounding fluid 2 2 numerical method the swimming of the fish is simulated by using the fsi interface of comsol multiphysics the interface models both the fluid domain and the solid domain and includes a predefined condition for the interactions at the fluid solid boundary using a time dependent study the fsi interface considers the two way coupling effects between the deformable solid fish model and the surrounding fluid liquid water in order to track the path of long distance swimming both moving mesh and automatic re meshing technologies are applied fig 3 shows the change of meshes during the swimming indicating a successful simulation of the undulation movement of fish usually the lateral undulating motion of the fish midline is assigned as a backward traveling wave in the fish swimming simulations gao and triantafyllou 2018 li et al 2017 sun et al 2018 in fact however what we observed in the swimming of a live fish is a result of the interactions between the muscle actions and the water resistances therefore the fsi effects are vital for the simulation of fish swimming following curatolo and teresi 2016 we model the muscle contraction and relaxation through the notion of active distortions pre strains and simulate the fish swimming by solving the two way fsi problem in contrast we put emphasis on the intermittent swimming gait instead of the steady swimming firstly we make the fish muscles contract and relax alternately by applying the time varying pre strains then forces will arise in the muscles when the motion is hampered by the surrounding water resulting in the desired fish swimming movement the computational domain ω consists of a solid domain fish model ω s and a fluid domain liquid water ω f the interface between the solid domain and the fluid domain the fsi boundary is represented as ω s t state variables of the problem include the solid displacement field u u 1 u 2 describing the displacement of the fish model the fluid velocity field v v 1 v 2 representing the velocity distribution of the surrounding water the equations describing the fluid domain are the navier stokes equation for conservation of momentum and the continuity equation for conservation of mass 1 ρ f v t ρ f v v p i k f 2 ρ f v 0 the equation describing the balance of forces on the solid domain can be expressed as 3 ρ s 2 u t 2 s f v in these equations ρ f and ρ s are the mass density of the fluid and the solid respectively p is the pressure of the fluid and i denotes the unit diagonal matrix f is the external forces applied to the fluid and f v is the volumetric force exerted on the solid moreover the fluid is assumed to be incompressible ρ f constant the stress of the fluid is γ p i k where k μ v v t represents the viscous part of the fluid stress here μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid the deformation gradient of the solid is f i u and a multiplicative decomposition of f f e f 0 is made here f e and f 0 are the elastic deformation and a time varying distortions field respectively correspondingly the non linear strain measures are defined as 4 e 1 2 f t f i e 0 1 2 f 0 t f 0 i where the superscript t denotes the matrix transpose consequently the elastic strain can be represented as e e e e 0 the reference stress of the solid is given by 5 s f e s e f 0 6 s e y 1 ν e e ν y 1 ν 1 2 ν t r e e i where y and ν are the young s modulus and the poisson modulus of the solid respectively and f 0 det f 0 f 0 1 t as mentioned above the muscles function is modeled by the active distortions pre strains of e 0 e 0 x y t in addition the system of eqs 1 3 is subject to the fsi boundary conditions 7 tn p i k n v u where t s f 1 denotes the actual stress in the solid and n is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary the force exerted on the boundary of the fish body is the fluid reaction force induced by the movements of fish moreover the fluid velocity on the fsi boundary equals to the movement speed of the fish body it should be noted that the computational domain is a rectangular virtual aquarium with a length of 6 m and a width of 1 m all the four boundaries of the aquarium are set as no slip walls for more details about the simulation method see the literature curatolo and teresi 2016 and the help files of comsol multiphysics comsol inc 2018 2 3 swimming modes as mentioned above the research of burst and coast swimming mode is the emphasis in this paper for comparing the steady swimming mode is also considered in order to imitate the swimming of a carangiform fish the muscular movements are modeled by the time varying distortions with the following forms curatolo and teresi 2016 8 e 0 l x y t ε max sin ω t γ x 2 2 h x s t 9 e 0 r x y t ε max sin ω t γ x π 2 2 h x s t the superscripts l and r denote the left halve and the right halve of the fish muscles respectively based on this model the fish swims with an angular frequency of ω 2 π f and a wave number of γ 2 π λ here f and λ represent the tail beat frequency and the wavelength of the fish undulation respectively the parameter ε max is the maximum contraction amplitude of the fish muscles 10 h x x 2 l 2 l 2 11 s 1 t s t e p t 12 s 2 t s t e p t t r d u t y t inter 1 s t e p t r d u t y t inter t r d u t y t inter the function h x describes an increasing contraction amplitude of the fish muscles from the head to the tail to facilitate a smooth transition between the different swimming states a step function of s t e p t is applied where both the first and second continuous derivatives exist as shown in fig 4 a this step function makes a smooth transition from 0 to 1 over a period of time of t a and the reverse process can be achieved with the function of 1 s t e p t consequently the function s t s 1 t initiates the swimming from the rest to a steady swimming mode and the burst and coast swimming mode is achieved with the function of s t s 2 t see fig 4 b it should be noted that a periodic extension is made for the function s 2 t within the time interval of simulation for the function s 2 t the active muscle contractions begin to gradually reduce to 0 at the moment of t 1 enabling a smooth transition from the burst phase to the coast phase in the equations above t inter is the time period of the intermittent behavior which contains a burst phase and a followed coast phase r d u t y t 1 t inter is the duty cycle of the intermittent swimming the grey shaded areas showed in fig 4 b denote the coast phases of the swimming for clarity the key parameters of the simulation model are listed in table 1 the mass density of the fish model is slightly larger than that of fluid in our fish model the fish head is totally rigid and the majority area of the fish body is covered with muscles we set y m 0 7 mpa an nearly optimum stiffness value reported in tytell et al 2010 as the young s modulus of fish muscles the authors are not aware of any direct stiffness measurements for the fish backbone we choose the fish model of mchenry et al 1995 as a reference and set y b 0 2 mpa as the young s modulus of the fish backbone in addition we suppose a softer caudal fin with a young s modulus of y f 0 2 mpa compared with the fish muscles although salumae and kruusmaa 2011 have found that the fin seems to be stiffer than flesh this is due to the fact that in general many carangiform fishes possess elastic membranaceous fins and the muscle stiffness can increase with the muscle activities like curatolo and teresi 2016 we set ε max 0 12 in accordance with the fact that the superficial fibers of a swimming fish may shorten by about 10 of their resting length in addition each intermittent swimming period consists of an integral number of tail beat cycles of time which means a condition of t inter n t where n is an integer 3 results and discussion 3 1 grid independence test prior to conducting a detailed simulation study the tests of grid and time resolution independence are conducted a steady swimming case with f 4 hz λ l n 10 and r d u t y 0 5 is considered as shown in table 2 three different mesh densities are selected two temporal resolutions are chosen as δ t 1 t 500 and δ t 2 t 800 to catch the swimming details more accurately the finest mesh elements are close to the fish boundary for all the three mesh cases fig 5 a shows the comparison of the transient swimming velocity of fish v during the whole duration of simulation in addition it is generally acknowledged that the caudal fin has a great effect on the swimming performance of fish therefore we also compare the motion trajectories of the caudal fin tip fig 5 b gives the variations of y fintip the y coordinate of the caudal fin tip with time for all the cases there are no significant differences between the results of the medium mesh mesh b and the fine mesh mesh c under the condition of δ t 1 in addition for the mesh b the results of the two temporal resolutions are in good agreement eventually the mesh b and the time resolution δ t 1 t 500 500 steps per tail beat period are adopted in the following simulations 3 2 post processing we will examine and compare the swimming hydrodynamic forces and the energy expenditures of the two swimming modes by integrating the components of normal stress on the fsi boundary we can get the net forces exerted by the fish on the fluid 13 f j n e t ω s t p i k n e j d s j 1 2 in this equation the values of subscript j 1 2 represent the components in x and y directions respectively the parameter e j denotes the unit vectors in the direction of coordinate axes we decompose the net forces as follows borazjani and sotiropoulos 2008 14 f t j 1 2 f j n e t f j f d j 1 2 f j n e t f j 15 f j ω s t p n e j d s ω s t kn e j d s where f t j and f d j are the thrust and drag components respectively the swimming direction is assessed by computing the average horizontal component of fluid velocity v 1 on the fsi boundary 16 θ 1 l b ω s t a cos v 1 v d s where l b is the fish contour length therefore the net force f n e t the thrust force f t and the drag force f d along the swimming direction can be calculated as follows 17 f n e t f 1 n e t cos θ f 2 n e t cos π 2 θ f t f t 1 cos θ f t 2 cos π 2 θ f d f d 1 cos θ f d 2 cos π 2 θ obviously these three forces have the following relationship 18 f n e t f t f d the energy expenditure over a burst and coast swimming cycle is calculated as fish et al 1991 19 w b c w b w c where w b and w c are the energy expended during the burst phase and the coast phase respectively the rate of energy expended for a body moving through water is equal to the product of the drag force and the velocity fish et al 1991 the equation 19 can be rewritten as 20 w b c t 0 r d u t y t inter f d v d t r d u t y t inter t inter f d v d t where t 0 is the starting time of a burst phase and v is the fish swimming velocity three non dimensional parameters related to the fish swimming are the reynolds number re the swimming number sw and the strouhal number st which are defined as follows 21 re v s w i m l ρ f μ sw a ω l ρ f μ st a f v s w i m where v s w i m is the average swimming velocity of the fish over a tail beat cycle and a is the total excursion of the caudal fin from one side to the other over a tail beat cycle to compare the two swimming modes three parameters are introduced the ratio of the total energy expenditure c w the ratio of the average swimming velocity and the ratio of c v to c w δ which are defined as follows 22 c w w b c w s t e a d y c v v b c v s t e a d y δ c v c w where w b c and w s t e a d y are the total energy expenditures of the burst and coast swimming mode and the relevant steady swimming mode over the whole simulation process respectively v b c and v s t e a d y are the average swimming velocities of the two swimming modes over the whole simulation process in general the coast swimming will result in a velocity loss and an energy saving compared with the steady swimming consequently a higher value of c v indicates a less velocity loss and a smaller value of c w means a less energy expenditure for the burst and coast swimming while δ is a comprehensive parameter including the two aspects 3 3 benefits of intermittent swimming before going further we first take a quick look at the result of the intermittent swimming simulation fig 6 shows the instantaneous vorticity fields of a burst and coast swimming case with f 4 hz λ l t inter 10 t and r d u t y 0 5 the related animations of the burst and coast swimming simulation and the relevant steady swimming simulation can be found on line in the supplementary movies as movie s1 and movie s2 respectively in fig 6 a the fish starts to undulate its body and tail from the resting state consequently with the active undulations the fish swims forward successfully see fig 6 b after a burst phase down the fish begin to coast in fig 6 c fish straightens its body and glides forward without muscle activities in the coast phase see fig 6 d then the fish enters into a new burst phase and continues to swim forward see fig 6 e and f as shown in fig 6 the vorticity field is depicted and the motion trajectory of the caudal fin tip is also plotted with a black solid line the clockwise and counterclockwise vorticity values are plotted in blue and red respectively a typical reversed von karman vortex pattern can be clearly observed only in the wake of the burst phases compared with the steady swimming the main feature of the burst and coast swimming is that the reversed von karman vortex pattern appears intermittently fish strives to propel itself forward by undulating its body and caudal fin to push the adjacent water downward at the burst phases and then glides forward relying on inertia at the coast phases it should be noted that the swimming of the fish model is not perfectly horizontal from the left to right this is because the influences of the initial disturbances and the mesh asymmetries are inevitable and there is no any direction control scheme in the present simulations supplementary data related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2020 107391 the following are the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 multimedia component 2 multimedia component 2 to evaluate the potential benefits of intermittent swimming a comparative study of the intermittent swimming and the steady swimming is conducted in the tail beat frequency range of f 2 hz 4 hz each simulation trial consists of 30 tail beat cycles with λ l t inter 10 t and r d u t y 0 5 fig 7 shows the time histories of the swimming velocity of the intermittent swimming and the relevant steady swimming a similar change tendency of the swimming velocity is showed for all the three tail beat frequencies for the steady swimming mode the fish accelerates to swim forward and eventually reaches a constant average velocity in spite of the fluctuation in each tail beat cycle in contrast for the intermittent swimming mode a deceleration process can be observed in the coast phase and then an acceleration process is followed during the next burst phase this variation pattern of the swimming velocity coincides with the description of videler and weihs 1982 and the simulation results of akoz and moored 2017 moreover with the tail beat frequency increase both the acceleration and the final average swimming velocity of the steady mode are increased fig 8 gives the time histories of the instant thrust force and drag force for the three tail beat frequencies for clarity only the data of the last two time periods of intermittent swimming are plotted compared with the steady swimming mode with the absence of active muscle movements the thrust force reduces to zero during the coast phases at the same time the drag force is significantly less than that of the steady swimming mode and it decreases with the drop of swimming velocity this result conforms to the reality that the drag of an undulating fish body is greater than the drag of a coasting fish lighthill 1971 on the other hand the thrust force of the burst phase is much greater than the drag force resulting in the acceleration process see fig 7 during the burst phase with the increase of swimming velocity the drag force increases and the thrust force decreases furthermore the bar graphs seen in fig 9 show the comparison of the average thrust the average drag the average velocity and the total energy expended of the two swimming modes over the whole simulation process for each value the proportion of the result of intermittent swimming to that of the steady swimming is given as shown in fig 9 a and b the average thrust force and drag force for the two swimming modes are both increased with the tail beat frequency compared with the steady mode a same percentage of nearly 37 decrease in the average thrust and drag forces can be found by the intermittent swimming in addition we calculate the average swimming velocity based on the total swimming displacement and give the total energy expended over the whole simulation process the average swimming velocity almost scale linearly with the tail beat frequency see fig 9 c it is reasonable to assume that the fish tries to get a higher swimming speed with a less energy expenditure however the energy saving and the speed increase are often in conflict with each other as a consequence we have reasons to believe that there will be a tradeoff between these two aspects this may partly explain why the fish have to develop so many swimming patterns and switch freely between them as can be seen from fig 9 c and d a nearly 46 energy saving can be achieved by the intermittent swimming over the whole simulation process at the same time the energy saving is accompanied by a nearly 14 of speed droop in general if the swimming speed is not a priority it will pay to sacrifice a little speed for the huge energy saving 3 4 effect of the duty cycle in this subsection the effect of the duty cycle r d u t y on the performance of intermittent swimming will be investigated the duty cycle is varied from 0 3 to 0 7 every 0 1 and all other simulation conditions remain unchanged with that of the previous subsection it is worth noting that the steady swimming can be regarded as a special case of intermittent swimming with r d u t y 1 the effects of duty cycle on the parameters c w c v and δ are presented in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 a and b both the energy expenditure and the average swimming velocity of the intermittent swimming are increased with the increase of duty cycle as can be seen the fish swimming can be gradually transited from an intermittent mode to the continuous mode by increasing the duty cycle as shown in fig 10 c the parameter δ the ratio of c v to c w decreases with the duty cycle a higher value of δ is considered beneficial in improving the energy utilization rate which means less energy consumption up to a certain swimming velocity a smaller duty cycle means a longer glide time as a result the fish can save more energy to obtain the same swimming velocity this is in accordance with the simulation results of xia et al 2018 in a word if the swimming speed is not a priority a smaller duty cycle will be a better choice to save more energy by coasting more time moreover for the different values of duty cycle the change curves of δ accompanied with the tail beat frequency are drawn in fig 10 d compared with the higher and the lower frequencies the values of δ are smaller at the moderate frequencies this phenomenon is more obvious at the smaller duty cycle 3 5 effect of the tail swing number in a burst phase in this paper the intermittent swimming of fish is considered as a cyclical behavior with a time period of t inter n t all the simulation results showed above are based on the condition of t inter 10 t and that means each intermittent swimming period consists of 10 tail beat cycles of time wu et al 2007 have found that the carps have two burst modes the multiple tail beat mode mt mode and the half tail beat mode ht mode for the first mode the fish tail beats for at least one cycle in the burst phase by contrast the tail beats for only a half cycle for the second mode obviously the present simulations of the intermittent swimming are belong to the mt mode in order to investigate the effect of the tail swing number in a burst phase on the swimming performance four different values of the coefficient n i e n 6 10 15 and 30 are considered under the conditions of λ l and r d u t y 0 5 consequently the fish swings its tail for 3 5 7 5 and 15 times in each burst phase respectively as shown in fig 11 a the energy expenditures increase monotonically with n for the higher tail beat frequencies a further increase of n actually reduces the energy expenditures for the lower tail beat frequencies in contrast the average swimming velocities decrease with n and the change curve of c v has an anti clockwise rotation with the increase of tail beat frequency see fig 11 b as shown in fig 11 c the parameter δ decreases with n for all the tail beat frequencies therefore in the range considered the smaller value of n is the higher energy utilization rate is compared with the figs 10 d fig 11 d shows a same phenomenon that the moderate tail beat frequencies may result in a lower energy utilization rate as described above the average swimming velocity almost scale linearly with the tail beat frequency an assumption can be inferred that the intermittent swimming will have more benefits at the lower and the higher swimming speeds 3 6 comparison with the real swimmers in this subsection the results of present swimming simulation will be compared with that of the previous studies for the steady swimming the values of the strouhal number st the reynolds number re and the swimming number sw for some pairs of f λ are listed in table 3 and table 4 all the values are calculated when the acceleration period has terminated as shown in table 3 higher values of wavelength λ seem to produce a greater strouhal number which is in accordance with the result of curatolo and teresi 2016 as for the reynolds number re and the swimming number sw both parameters are increased with the tail beat frequency the reynolds number for the swimmers can be assumed to be proportional to the swimming number gazzola et al 2014 as shown in fig 12 the dashed line represents the proportional relation of re sw proposed by gazzola et al 2014 the ranges of re and sw for the four different genera of swimmer in the turbulent regime are depicted based on the measurements of gazzola et al 2014 the results of re and sw showed in table 4 are also plotted which show a good agreement with the proportional relation for the intermittent swimming we consider a water tunnel experiment on a nominally two dimensional pitching foil conducted by floryan et al 2017 they investigated the intermittent propulsion of a rigid pitching foil to understand the fish intermittent swimming behavior fig 13 shows the qualitative comparison of the computed energy expended ratio c w with the experimental data of floryan et al 2017 as shown in fig 13 the varying trend of computed c w is consistent with the experimental data according to the literature videler and weihs 1982 the cod frequently use the steady swimming at velocities between 1 4 bl s i e body lengths per second and 2 bl s and an intermittent swimming below 1 4 bl s at average velocities higher than 2 5 bl s the intermittent swimming is again the usual mode and the steady swimming is occasionally observed saithe exhibit a similar behavior under the same circumstances the proposed assumption that the intermittent swimming have more benefits at the lower and the higher swimming speeds illustrated above may partly explain this phenomenon for the effect of the coefficient n fig 14 a shows the time histories of the transient swimming velocity under the condition of f 4 h z within the same amount of simulation time the number of intermittent swimming cycles is decreased with the increase of n the transient swimming velocity has two bounds the lower bound u l represents the initial velocity of a burst phase e g point a and c and the upper bound u h represents the final velocity of a burst phase e g point b and d as shown in fig 14 a with the increase of n u h increases while u l decreases fig 14 b gives the measured data of u l bl s and u h bl s for the cod and saithe videler and weihs 1982 through the linear regression analysis we obtain a fitted curve u h 1 071 u l 1 328 giving a pearson correlation coefficient value of 0 897 and an r square value of 0 786 therefore u h is almost linear with u l in the intermittent swimming of live fish the results of u l and u h for the simulations showed in fig 11 are also plotted for the five clusters correspond to different frequencies the biases of the results from the fitted curve are increased with the increase of n from left to right combined with the previous content it can be concluded that a proper proportion of the velocity bounds is very important for the performance improvement of the intermittent swimming 4 conclusions in this work we have modeled and studied the intermittent swimming gait of a 2d carangiform fish with the muscle contraction model of pre strains a comparative study of the intermittent swimming and the steady swimming was conducted to evaluate the potential benefits of the intermittent swimming we compared the hydrodynamic forces swimming velocities and the energy expended of these two swimming modes during the whole simulation process we assumed that the fish tries to get a higher swimming speed with a less energy expenditure however simulation results showed that the energy saving and the speed increase are often in conflict with each other fish can reduce the energy consumption for swimming by using the intermittent gait at the same time however the average swimming velocity is inevitably reduced so we proposed an assumption that fish have to make a tradeoff between the energy saving and the gain of swimming speed this may partly explain why fish have to develop so many swimming patterns and switch freely between them we studied the effects of the duty cycle of intermittent swimming on the swimming performance the results showed that both the energy expenditure and the average swimming velocity are increased with the increase of duty cycle the fish swimming can be gradually transited from an intermittent mode to the continuous mode by increasing the duty cycle in addition we also considered the effect of the tail swing number in a burst phase on the swimming performance we found that a smaller tail swing number in a burst phase is more helpful to improve the energy utilization rate under the condition of r d u t y 0 5 moreover the intermittent swimming will have more benefits at the lower and the higher swimming speeds a proper proportion of the velocity bounds is very important for the performance improvement of the intermittent swimming these conclusions may have direct meanings for the development of auvs it should be noted that there are limitations to this 2d simulation study the muscles of fish may have two principal types the red muscles and the white muscles we did not perform a functional segmentation of the fish muscles however different muscle types may have different mechanical and energetic properties and thus affect the swimming performance in addition the three dimensional effects of the fish body

stacking integrating these base learners is firstly proposed to identify the usv s dynamics the results demonstrate that the el method has more accuracy in identifying the dynamic models than base learners keywords unmanned surface vehicle usv system identification support vector machine svm backpropagation neural network bpnn stacking zigzag test 1 introduction over the last few decades the unmanned surface vehicles usvs research and designs have attracted considerable attention compared to the traditional manned vehicles the advantages of the usvs can reduce the human intervention which means they can operate in dangerous and extreme environments in addition the usvs also plays a significant role in commercial and military fields such as resource exploration majohr and buch 2006 shipping levander 2017 mine countermeasures bertram 2008 and reconnaissance maguer et al 2005 to guarantee that the usvs can operate good performance in these fields the robust and effective maneuvering controllers appear to be particularly important a prerequisite for regarding the usv s controller design is to understand the vehicle s dynamic behavior fossen 2011 described the 6 dof of dynamic equations derived by the newton euler or lagrange method the experiments about motions of a marine craft exposed to wind wave and ocean currents were utilized to validate the rationality of the dynamic models zwierzewicz 2013 linearized the nonlinear ship model of norrbin type and utilized the adaptive control method to identify the course keeping control system sonnenburg et al 2013 adopted the first order linear nomoto model with the linear sideslip model and simplified speed model to track the usv s trajectories system identification is always to be adopted to handle the system s dynamic model the system identification approach builds up a model that best depict the relationship between input data and output data several conventional system identification methods such as the maximum likelihood method aström and källström 1976 the kalman filter method yoon and rhee 2003 the extended kalman filter method the recursive least square method nguyen 2008 and the least square method xu et al 2014 have been applied to predict the ship s dynamic models however there are some certain limitations in traditional system identification methods for instance the large errors between predict data and output data the long convergency speeds and the bad generalization abilities etc during the recent decade the artificial intelligent ai approaches based on the developing of the computing technology have been applied in system identification of ship s dynamics such as neural network nn support vector machine svm and other optimization algorithms backpropagation neural networks recursive neural networks and feed forward neural networks were wildly applied to identify the ship s dynamics moreira and guedes soares 2003 rajesh and bhattacharyya 2008 pan et al 2013 luo et al 2017 nevertheless the nn method sometimes also has some drawbacks such as poor generalization and local optima svm which enjoys high generalization capability achieves the globally optimal solution and overcomes the curse of dimensionality has been applied to model the ship manoeuvring motions luo and zou 2009 applied least square svm lssvm to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives of abkowitz model from the simulated free running model to further optimize the results in lssvm the hyper parameters such as regularization coefficients and kernel functions coefficients were selected by particle swarm optimization pso luo et al 2016 and artificial bee colony algorithm abc zhu et al 2017 moreover zhang and zhou 2011 utilized the ε svm to identify the abkowitz model by simulation data without noise wang et al 2019 proposed nu svm based on identification method to establish a predictive model of ship manoeuvring motions owing to it can automatically determine parameter ε and predetermine the number of svs which is better than the ε svm method according to the above literatures the nn and svm methods have their own advantages and disadvantages in predicting the ship s dynamics therefore it is can be trusted that combine these two methods called ensemble learning el may have a better prediction performance some literatures also demonstrated that the el method has better performance than single base learner in regressor problems ribeiro and coelho 2019 demiriz et al 2008 friedman et al 2000 so el method is firstly to be proposed to identify the usv s dynamics in this research the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follow first the equations of motions for usv with a different thruster in 3 degree of freedoms are derived and utilized to system identification second the bpnn and lssvm with different kernel functions optimized by cross validation cv genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso and cuckoo search algorithm cs are utilized to identify the usv s dynamics and the best hyper parameters are selected furthermore to date the el is the first time to be used to identify the usv s models which demonstrates this method is better than any single base learners this boosts the application of ai in marine research field the structure of this paper can be viewed as follows section 2 introduces the base information of dw uboat and describes the dynamic models of this usv in section 3 the bpnn svm and el method are described and the hyper parameters are determined the experiments of the usv are carried out and used in section 4 as training samples and validation samples for system identifications of usv dynamic models and comparisons among bpnn svm and el section 5 concludes all work in this paper 2 usv dynamic system generally ships motions are described in six degrees of freedom the notations of six freedom are surge sway heave roll yaw and pitch which was enacted by sname two reference frames a body fixed frame and an earth fixed frame are always operated to depict the motion of the ship fossen 2011 for the usv the three degrees of freedom surge sway and yaw in the horizontal planar motion are always considered 2 1 deepsea warrior dw uboat the dw uboat is produced by the institute of marine vehicle and underwater technology which can be viewed in fig 1 the length of the dw uboat is 1 8m and that of the beam overall is 0 7m the hull is installed with two electric propulsion modules at each stern side the maximum speed of the vehicle is 2 5 knots moreover there is no rudder or gimbaled thruster equipped in this vehicle the steering motion can be generated by operating rpm revolution per minute difference in the two main thrusters the sway force action on the vehicle is also produced by the difference thrusters various sensors are equipped in dw uboat as well two differential gps are installed in the bow and stern respectively combined with electronic compass which can obtain the position velocity and heading angle information all above information and data are transformed into the computer during the experiments 2 2 usv dynamic model in order to describe the dynamics of the dw uboat the equations of motion for rigid hull with differential thrusters have been derived three degrees of freedom surge sway and yaw in horizontal plan are considered in this paper fig 2 describes the schematic description of the differential thrust of dw uboat x i and y i denote the north and east directions of the vehicle in the inertial frame respectively u v and v represent the surge sway ang total speed in body fixed frame ψ is defined as the heading angle of the vehicle while the β and x denote the slide angle and course angle respectively for describing the motion of usv the kinematic model can be expressed as follow 1 η r η v where v denotes the velocity vector η the position vector r η the rotation matrix that maps vectors from a body fixed frame to an inertial

including rigid mass and added mass c the coriolis and centripetal matrix d the damping matrix f the control forces and moment since the propulsion system of the dw uboat is differential thruster type woo et al 2018 described the f as a function of t p o r t and t s t b d which can be expressed as following equations 6 f τ x τ y τ n t p o r t t s t b d 0 t p o r t t s t b d b 2 where t p o r t and t s t b d denote the thruster force of the port side thruster and the starboard side thruster respectively b the beam of dw uboat combining above equations the 3dof nonlinear dynamic model of the usv can be expressed as follow 7 m x u u m x g r 2 v r y v v r y r n v 2 r 2 x u u x u u u u τ x 8 m y v v m x g y r r m x u u r y v v y r r y v v v v y r r r r y r v r v y v r v r τ y 9 m x g n v v i z z

acquiring a simplified speed dynamic model the eq 7 is linearized according to the linearization point below 10 u u 0 m s v 0 m s r 0 d e g s τ x τ x 0 n τ n 0 n m therefore the eq 7 can be rewritten as 11 u x u u m x u u u x u m x u u 1 m x u τ x 2 2 2 steering model the remaining steering model can describe the sway and yaw motions obtained by eq 8 and eq 9 based on the constant surge velocity

learning ensemble learning method finishes the learning tasks via combining the multi learners also called multi classifier system or multi regressor system the process of the ensemble learning is first a set of individual learners is produced and then combined with a certain strategy individual learners are generated by weak learners training data if all the individual learners are same the ensemble algorithm is homogeneous otherwise it is heterogenous at present the ensemble learning is always utilized for classifier problems and shows a good performance for the regressor problems according to allende and valle 2017 the advantage of ensemble method for time series forecasting can be credited to three facts namely 1 it increases overall forecast accuracy to a large extent by using appropriate aggregation techniques 2 it is tested that there is often a great uncertainty about the optimal forecast model and in such situations combination strategies are the most appropriate alternatives and 3 the combination of multiple forecasts can efficiently reduce errors in addition utilizing ensemble learning to operate forecasting can be adjusted in different ways mendes moreira et al 2012 pointed out that ensemble learning enjoys a greater ability to generalize results reduced model variance and better tolerance to data noise therefore regression ensemble techniques for time series system identification with forecasting must be explored in this section the stacking method which is a heterogenous ensemble learning algorithm is proposed to identify the usv s dynamics according to the literatures the bpnn svm rbf and svm linear are adopted as the individual learners for stacking method the specific methods can be described as following 3 1 bpnn back propagation neural network bpnn was firstly proposed by the rumelhart and mcclelland 1986 in fig 3 the structure of the bpnn consists the input layer hidden layer and output layer respectively the relation of the number of the input layer hidden layer and output layer can be followed as li et al 2017 14 m n k ϕ where m denotes the unit number of hidden layers n the unit number of input layers k the unit number of output layer and ϕ a constant value which lying in the range 1 10 ϕ is set to 5 bpnn includes two processes in the work forward propagation and back propagation the input data is propagated from the input layer to the output layer the output can be obtained in this process and compared with the expected data the difference between the predicted and the desired data which is viewed as error is utilized to formulate the loss function in the back propagation the link weights and threshold can be adjusted by optimization methods to minimize the loss function by this structure the predicted output can be calculated as follow 15 y j f i 1 n w i j x i θ j where w i j denotes the weight coefficient θ j the threshold of the neural unit f an activation function and the sigmoid function is adopted in this paper which can be shown as follow 16 f x 1 1 e x p x substitute eq 12 into eq 11 and the output can be expressed as following 17 y j 1 1 e x p i 1 n w i j x i θ j the i t h output value from the neural network is compared with the real value and the difference between those can be called the unit error of the output layer its error function e i is shown as below 18 e i 1 2 k 1 k y d k y k 2 where y d k and y k denote expected value and real value of neural unit k respectively 3 2 svm support vector machines svm a novel method of modern artificial intelligence technology was proposed in 1990s vapnik 2000 svm is a statistical learning method based on vc dimension theory and structural risk minimization principle the procedure of the svm can be viewed in fig 4 svm method includes ε svm ν svm and least square svm lssvm etc suykens et al 1999 proposed that the lssvm was able to synchronously decrease estimation error in the input output data the empirical risk and the model complexity the structural risk for regression issues and classification issues therefore the lssvm is selected and the equation can be viewed as follow 19 y x ω t ε x b x r n y r where x denotes the input data y the output data ω the matrix of weights ε the mapping to a high dimensional hilbert space and b the bias the training set was utilized to optimize weight space ω 20 min w b e j ω e 1

the infinite dimension the lagrange multipliers are selected to solve the problem in the primal weight space 22 j ω b e α j ω e i 1 n s α i ω t ε x i b e i y i where α i i 1 2 n denotes the lagrange multipliers then the derivatives of ω b e i α i are computed and set to be zero which can be expressed as follow 23 j ω b e α ω 0 ω i 1 n s α i ε x i j ω b e α b 0 i 1 n s α i 0 j ω b e α e i 0 α i c e i j ω b e α α i 0 ω t ε x i b e i y i 0 then the kernel trick is applied to solve in high dimensional feature spaces and the function can be rewritten as follow 24 y x i 1 n s α i k x x i b k x x i is the kernel function kernel functions include the linear kernel radial basis function rbf kernel exponential kernel and dot product kernel etc in this paper the linear kernel and rbf kernel are selected and can be calculated in eq 25 and eq 26 respectively 25 k x i x j x i x j 26 k x i x j e x p x i x j 2 2 σ 2 3 3 stacking method stacking method stands as perfect example of ensemble learning which combines different individual learners wolpert 1992 breiman 1996 the individual learner is known as base learner while the combined learner is called meta learner the pseudocode of stacking method can be viewed as fig 5 and the frame of stacking method can be viewed in fig 6 the base learner is trained from the initial training set and then viewed as new input is applied for training meta learner in this new data set the output from base learner is regarded as sample input for meta learner in this paper the bpnn svm rbf and svm linear are selected to represent the base learners in the training phase meta learner is generated by the base learners if the prediction results predicted by base learners are directly applied to generate the training set for meta learner the probability of the overfitting risk is too large the cross validation cv method is always utilized to solve this problem for example five fold cross validation is explained and can be viewed in fig 7 the initial training set d is divided randomly to five equal sets d 1 d 2 d 5 given by t learning algorithms d j and d j d d j are assumed as j th testing set and training set base learner h t j is given by t th learning algorithm in d j the prediction results can be calculated as 27 z i t h t j x i the input samples for meta learners are generated by x i which can be viewed as 28 z i z i 1 z i 2 z i t the meta learning algorithm has a large influence on stacking method s generalization ability seewald 2002 demonstrated that the multi response linear regression mlr is always adopted as meta learning algorithm and takes a good effect the function of the mlr can be viewed as follow 29 y m x β m ω m n n x β m σ 2 i n m 1 m where y y 1 y m is a response matrix of observations x is the fixed design matrix β m is the coefficient vector for the m th response vector y m ω m is the error term σ 2 i n denotes the covariance matrix 4 identification results 4 1 data preprocessing in this section the usv s experiment is carried out in the qing huai river which can be viewed in fig 8 due to the external environment the wind wave current and other random disturbances are not ignored in this problem therefore the gaussian filtering method is utilized to remove the noise the data collected by the receiver per 0 25 s and the 1000 s data is adopted to train the dynamic model of the usv two straight lines with varying rpm of differential thruster for estimating the speed model while two different zigzag trajectories are designed for training and testing the steering model for system identification of the usv s dynamics the data utilized for learning and validation are produced by eqs 11 13 furthermore the normalization technique is used to guarantee the accurate forecast results due to the large range among each dimension of input data the min max normalization is selected and can be viewed in eq 30 30 x x x m a x x m a x x m i n according to the eq 11 13 the forward difference approximation of eulers stepping method is utilized and the input output relations can be obtained the specific method can be viewed in literature zhu et al 2017 the inputs can be expressed as x δ u k δ u 3 k δ τ x k t y v k v k v k r k v k r k v k r k r k r k τ y k τ n k t z v k v k v k r k v k r k v k r k r k r k τ y k τ n k t the output can be expressed u k 1 v k 1 r k 1 python a high level scripting language that combines interpretability compilation interactivity and object oriented is selected to build up the ensemble learning structure it is trusted that the python is a strong tool to handle the artificial intelligent problems 4 2 optimal methods for base learners to build up a strong stacking learner the performances of the base learners play a significant role the initial weights in bpnn method while the regularization parameter and sensitive parameter also called hyper parameter in svm method are very important factors to determine these methods behaviors how to find these parameters is a momentous problem in machine learning therefore some optimal methods are utilized to optimize the bpnn svm rbf and svm linear the several optimal approaches cv ga pso and cs are selected to find the ideal solutions for quantitatively analyzing and comparing the performance of these optimal methods the mean square error mse and convergency time are viewed as indexes one straight line and testing zigzag maneuver are selected to verify these methods figs 9 11 show the optimal methods for svm rbf svm linear and bpnn in predicting the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw velocity it is obvious that these methods all operate good optimization effects in mse the cs is slightly superior to the other three methods in all base learners however based on the lower value of mse the cs method has a fast convergency speed the convergency speed of cv is the largest while that of the cs is the smallest in all situations the ga and pso have the different performance in all situations from the optimal simulation research the different characteristics of these optimization methods are observed and explained cv as trail and error is a little time consuming to find the suitable values in the present work however the core of the cv just uses the method of average errors to optimize the problem the best parameters is difficult to search ga is a computational model simulating the natural selection and genetic mechanism of darwinian biological evolution and it is a method to search the optimal solution by simulating the natural evolution while pso is a random search algorithm based on group cooperation which is developed by simulating the foraging behavior of birds ga and pso can find the global optimum for bpnn and svm but sometimes it fails to obtain the globally optimal solutions instead of locally optimal results cs algorithm is a population intelligent optimization algorithm which is also a new meta heuristic search algorithm due to the two strategies nest parasitism of cuckoo and levy flight mechanism an efficient optimization mode can be more easily achieved relatively cs demonstrates strong robustness global optimization capacity and faster convergency speed during the search of initial weights in bpnn and hyper parameters in svm procedures therefore the base learners optimized by cs method are utilized to combine the structure of the stacking it is worth mentioning that the cs method optimizing bpnn and svm is firstly proposed to identify the usv s dynamic models 4 3 testing and validation for stacking method the base learners with best parameters have been determined and furthermore the stacking structure is generated fig 12 demonstrates the performance of el algorithm stacking method for training the 3 dof dynamic models

learners keywords unmanned surface vehicle usv system identification support vector machine svm backpropagation neural network bpnn stacking zigzag test 1 introduction over the last few decades the unmanned surface vehicles usvs research and designs have attracted considerable attention compared to the traditional manned vehicles the advantages of the usvs can reduce the human intervention which means they can operate in dangerous and extreme environments in addition the usvs also plays a significant role in commercial and military fields such as resource exploration majohr and buch 2006 shipping levander 2017 mine countermeasures bertram 2008 and reconnaissance maguer et al 2005 to guarantee that the usvs can operate good performance in these fields the robust and effective maneuvering controllers appear to be particularly important a prerequisite for regarding the usv s controller design is to understand the vehicle s dynamic behavior fossen 2011 described the 6 dof of dynamic equations derived by the newton euler or lagrange method the experiments about motions of a marine craft exposed to wind wave and ocean currents were utilized to validate the rationality of the dynamic models zwierzewicz 2013 linearized the nonlinear ship model of norrbin type and utilized the adaptive control method to identify the course keeping control system sonnenburg et al 2013 adopted the first order linear nomoto model with the linear sideslip model and simplified speed model to track the usv s trajectories system identification is always to be adopted to handle the system s dynamic model the system identification approach builds up a model that best depict the relationship between input data and output data several conventional system identification methods such as the maximum likelihood method aström and källström 1976 the kalman filter method yoon and rhee 2003 the extended kalman filter method the recursive least square method nguyen 2008 and the least square method xu et al 2014 have been applied to predict the ship s dynamic models however there are some certain limitations in traditional system identification methods for instance the large errors between predict data and output data the long convergency speeds and the bad generalization abilities etc during the recent decade the artificial intelligent ai approaches based on the developing of the computing technology have been applied in system identification of ship s dynamics such as neural network nn support vector machine svm and other optimization algorithms backpropagation neural networks recursive neural networks and feed forward neural networks were wildly applied to identify the ship s dynamics moreira and guedes soares 2003 rajesh and bhattacharyya 2008 pan et al 2013 luo et al 2017 nevertheless the nn method sometimes also has some drawbacks such as poor generalization and local optima svm which enjoys high generalization capability achieves the globally optimal solution and overcomes the curse of dimensionality has been applied to model the ship manoeuvring motions luo and zou 2009 applied least square svm lssvm to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives of abkowitz model from the simulated free running model to further optimize the results in lssvm the hyper parameters such as regularization coefficients and kernel functions coefficients were selected by particle swarm optimization pso luo et al 2016 and artificial bee colony algorithm abc zhu et al 2017 moreover zhang and zhou 2011 utilized the ε svm to identify the abkowitz model by simulation data without noise wang et al 2019 proposed nu svm based on identification method to establish a predictive model of ship manoeuvring motions owing to it can automatically determine parameter ε and predetermine the number of svs which is better than the ε svm method according to the above literatures the nn and svm methods have their own advantages and disadvantages in predicting the ship s dynamics therefore it is can be trusted that combine these two methods called ensemble learning el may have a better prediction performance some literatures also demonstrated that the el method has better performance than single base learner in regressor problems ribeiro and coelho 2019 demiriz et al 2008 friedman et al 2000 so el method is firstly to be proposed to identify the usv s dynamics

utilized to identify the usv s dynamics and the best hyper parameters are selected furthermore to date the el is the first time to be used to identify the usv s models which demonstrates this method is better than any single base learners this boosts the application of ai in marine research field the structure of this paper can be viewed as follows section 2 introduces the base information of dw uboat and describes the dynamic models of this usv in section 3 the bpnn svm and el method are described and the hyper parameters are determined the experiments of the usv are carried out and used in section 4 as training samples and validation samples for system identifications of usv dynamic models and comparisons among bpnn svm and el section 5 concludes all work in this paper 2 usv dynamic system generally ships motions are described in six degrees of freedom the notations of six freedom are surge sway heave roll yaw and pitch which was enacted by sname two reference frames a body fixed frame and an earth fixed frame are always operated to depict the motion of the ship fossen 2011 for the usv the three degrees of freedom surge sway and yaw in the horizontal planar motion are always considered 2 1 deepsea warrior dw uboat the dw uboat is produced by the institute of marine vehicle and underwater technology which can be viewed in fig 1 the length of the dw uboat is 1 8m and that of the beam overall is 0 7m the hull is installed with two electric propulsion modules at each stern side the maximum speed of the vehicle is 2 5 knots moreover there is no rudder or gimbaled thruster equipped in this vehicle the steering motion can be generated by operating rpm revolution per minute difference in the two main thrusters the sway force action on the vehicle is also produced by the difference thrusters various sensors are equipped in dw uboat as well two differential gps are installed in the bow and stern respectively combined with electronic compass which can obtain the position velocity and heading angle information all above information and data are transformed into the computer during the experiments 2 2 usv dynamic model in order to describe the dynamics of the

woo et al 2018 described the f as a function of t p o r t and t s t b d which can be expressed as following equations 6 f τ x τ y τ n t p o r t t s t b d 0 t p o r t t s t b d b 2 where t p o r t and t s t b d denote the thruster force of the port side thruster and the starboard side thruster respectively b the beam of dw uboat combining above equations the 3dof nonlinear dynamic model of the usv can be expressed as follow 7 m x u u m x g r 2 v r y v v r y r n v 2 r 2 x u u x u u u u τ x 8 m y v v m x g y r r m x u u r y v v y r r y v v v v y r r r r y r v r v y v r v r τ y 9 m x g n v v i z z

learning ensemble learning method finishes the learning tasks via combining the multi learners also called multi classifier system or multi regressor system the process of the ensemble learning is first a set of individual learners is produced and then combined with a certain strategy individual learners are generated by weak learners training data if all the individual learners are same the ensemble algorithm is homogeneous otherwise it is heterogenous at present the ensemble learning is always utilized for classifier problems and shows a good performance for the regressor problems according to allende and valle 2017 the advantage of ensemble method for time series forecasting can be credited to three facts namely 1 it increases overall forecast accuracy to a large extent by using appropriate aggregation techniques 2 it is tested that there is often a great uncertainty about the optimal forecast model and in such situations combination strategies are the most appropriate alternatives and 3 the combination of multiple forecasts can efficiently reduce errors in addition utilizing ensemble learning to operate forecasting can be adjusted in different ways mendes moreira et al 2012 pointed out that ensemble learning enjoys a greater ability to generalize results reduced model variance and better tolerance to data noise therefore regression ensemble techniques for time series system identification with forecasting must be explored in this section the stacking method which is a heterogenous ensemble learning algorithm is proposed to identify the usv s dynamics according to the literatures the bpnn svm rbf and svm linear are adopted as the individual learners for stacking method the specific methods can be described as following 3 1 bpnn back propagation neural network bpnn was firstly proposed by the rumelhart and mcclelland 1986 in fig 3 the structure of the bpnn consists the input layer hidden layer and output layer respectively the relation of the number of the input layer hidden layer and output layer can be followed as li et al 2017 14 m n k ϕ where m denotes the unit number of hidden layers n the unit number of input layers k the unit number of output layer and ϕ a constant value which lying in the range 1 10 ϕ is set to 5 bpnn includes two processes in the work forward propagation and back propagation the input data is propagated from the input layer to the output layer the output can be obtained in this process and compared with the expected data the difference between the predicted and the desired data which is viewed as error is utilized to formulate the loss function in the back propagation the link weights and threshold can be adjusted by optimization methods to minimize the loss function by this structure the predicted output can be calculated as follow 15 y j f i 1 n w i j x i θ j where w i j denotes the weight coefficient θ j the threshold of the neural unit f an activation function and the sigmoid function is adopted in this paper which can be shown as follow 16 f x 1 1 e x p x substitute eq 12 into eq 11 and the output can be expressed as following 17 y j 1 1 e x p i 1 n w i j x i θ j the i t h output value from the neural network is compared with the real value and the difference between those can be called the unit error of the output layer its error function e i is shown as below 18 e i 1 2 k 1 k y d k y k 2 where y d k and y k denote expected value and real value of neural unit k respectively 3 2 svm support vector machines svm a novel method of modern artificial intelligence technology was proposed in 1990s vapnik 2000 svm is a statistical learning method based on vc dimension theory and structural risk minimization principle the procedure of the svm can be viewed in fig 4 svm method includes ε svm ν svm and least square svm lssvm etc suykens et al 1999 proposed that the lssvm was able to synchronously decrease estimation error in the input output data the empirical risk and the model complexity the structural risk for regression issues and classification issues therefore the lssvm is selected and the equation can be viewed as follow 19 y x ω t ε x b x r n y r where x denotes the input data y the output data ω the matrix of weights ε the mapping to a high dimensional hilbert space and b the bias the training set was utilized to optimize weight space ω 20 min w b e j ω e 1

the infinite dimension the lagrange multipliers are selected to solve the problem in the primal weight space 22 j ω b e α j ω e i 1 n s α i ω t ε x i b e i y i where α i i 1 2 n denotes the lagrange multipliers then the derivatives of ω b e i α i are computed and set to be zero which can be expressed as follow 23 j ω b e α ω 0 ω i 1 n s α i ε x i j ω b e α b 0 i 1 n s α i 0 j ω b e α e i 0 α i c e i j ω b e α α i 0 ω t ε x i b e i y i 0 then the kernel trick is applied to solve in high dimensional feature spaces and the function can be rewritten as follow 24 y x i 1 n s α i k x x i b k x x i is the kernel function kernel functions include the linear kernel radial basis function rbf kernel exponential kernel and dot product kernel etc in this paper the linear kernel and rbf kernel are selected and can be calculated in eq 25 and eq 26 respectively 25 k x i x j x i x j 26 k x i x j e x p x i x j 2 2 σ 2 3 3 stacking method stacking method stands as perfect example of ensemble learning which combines different individual learners wolpert 1992 breiman 1996 the individual learner is known as base learner while the combined learner is called meta learner the pseudocode of stacking method can be viewed as fig 5 and the frame of stacking method can be viewed in fig 6 the base learner is trained from the initial training set and then viewed as new input is applied for training meta learner in this new data set the output from base learner is regarded as sample input for meta learner in this paper the bpnn svm rbf and svm linear are selected to represent the base learners in the training phase meta learner is generated by the base learners if the prediction results predicted by base learners are directly applied to generate the training set for meta learner the probability of the overfitting risk is too large the cross validation cv method is always utilized to solve this problem for example five fold cross validation is explained and can be viewed in fig 7 the initial training set d is divided randomly to five equal sets d 1 d 2 d 5 given by t learning algorithms d j and d j d d j are assumed as j th testing set and training set base learner h t j is given by t th learning algorithm in d j the prediction results can be calculated as 27 z i t h t j x i the input samples for meta learners are generated by x i which can be viewed as 28 z i z i 1 z i 2 z i t the meta learning algorithm has a large influence on stacking method s generalization ability seewald 2002 demonstrated that the multi response linear regression mlr is always adopted as meta learning algorithm and takes a good effect the function of the mlr can be viewed as follow 29 y m x β m ω m n n x β m σ 2 i n m 1 m where y y 1 y m is a response matrix of observations x is the fixed design matrix β m is the coefficient vector for the m th response vector y m ω m is the error term σ 2 i n denotes the covariance matrix 4 identification results 4 1 data preprocessing in this section the usv s experiment is carried out in the qing huai river which can be viewed in fig 8 due to the external environment the wind wave current and other random disturbances are not ignored in this problem therefore the gaussian filtering method is utilized to remove the noise the data collected by the receiver per 0 25 s and the 1000 s data is adopted to train the dynamic model of the usv two straight lines with varying rpm of differential thruster for estimating the speed model while two different zigzag trajectories are designed for training and testing the steering model for system identification of the usv s dynamics the data utilized for learning and validation are produced by eqs 11 13 furthermore the normalization technique is used to guarantee the accurate forecast results due to the large range among each dimension of input data the min max normalization is selected and can be viewed in eq 30 30 x x x m a x x m a x x m i n according to the eq 11 13 the forward difference approximation of eulers stepping method is utilized and the input output relations can be obtained the specific method can be viewed in literature zhu et al 2017 the inputs can be expressed

level scripting language that combines interpretability compilation interactivity and object oriented is selected to build up the ensemble learning structure it is trusted that the python is a strong tool to handle the artificial intelligent problems 4 2 optimal methods for base learners to build up a strong stacking learner the performances of the base learners play a significant role the initial weights in bpnn method while the regularization parameter and sensitive parameter also called hyper parameter in svm method are very important factors to determine these methods behaviors how to find these parameters is a momentous problem in machine learning therefore some optimal methods are utilized to optimize the bpnn svm rbf and svm linear the several optimal approaches cv ga pso and cs are selected to find the ideal solutions for quantitatively analyzing and comparing the performance of these optimal methods the mean square error mse and convergency time are viewed as indexes one straight line and testing zigzag maneuver are selected to verify these methods figs 9 11 show the optimal methods for svm rbf svm linear and bpnn in predicting the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw velocity it is obvious that these methods all operate good optimization effects in mse the cs is slightly superior to the other three methods in all base learners however based on the lower value of mse the cs method has a fast convergency speed the convergency speed of cv is the largest while that of the cs is the smallest in all situations the ga and pso have the different performance in all situations from the optimal simulation research the different characteristics of these optimization methods are observed and explained cv as trail and error is a little time consuming to find the suitable values in the present work however the core of the cv just uses the method of average errors to optimize the problem the best parameters is difficult to search ga is a computational model simulating the natural selection and genetic mechanism of darwinian biological evolution and it is a method to search the optimal solution by simulating the natural evolution while pso is a random search algorithm based on group cooperation which is developed by simulating the foraging behavior of birds ga and pso can find the global optimum for bpnn and svm but sometimes it fails to obtain the globally optimal solutions instead of locally optimal results cs algorithm is a population intelligent optimization algorithm which is also a new meta heuristic search algorithm due to the two strategies nest parasitism of cuckoo and levy flight mechanism an efficient optimization mode can be more easily achieved relatively cs demonstrates strong robustness global optimization capacity and faster convergency speed during the search of initial weights in bpnn and hyper parameters in svm procedures therefore the base learners optimized by cs method are utilized to combine the structure of the stacking it is worth mentioning that the cs method optimizing bpnn and svm is firstly proposed to identify the usv s dynamic models 4 3 testing and validation for stacking method the base learners with best parameters have been determined and furthermore the stacking structure is generated fig 12 demonstrates the performance of el algorithm stacking method for training the 3 dof dynamic models

21839,with the advent of deep learning artificial intelligence ai has attracted the attention of researchers in various fields including ocean engineering this paper applies ai to forecasting a water surface wave train recurrent neural networks rnn are used to forecast both actual wave trains and numerically reproduced irregular wave trains the specific type of network used here is the long short term memory lstm model which is known to have good properties for time series prediction the methodology is extended to forecasting the motion responses of a floating body in an irregular wave train the lstm is found to generate reasonably accurate forecasts despite the nonlinearity of the data keywords artificial intelligence neural networks lstm forecasting time series forecasting ocean waves forecasting motions 1 introduction with the advent of deep learning artificial intelligence ai has attracted renewed interest from researchers in various fields there should be a vast potential in the application of ai to ocean engineering a recent example is the use of ai in autonomous ship maneuvering e g gcaptain 2018 rolls royce 2018 the present work investigates the use of ai to forecast a water surface wave train specifically artificial neural networks ann are used to predict both actual irregular wave trains measured in the ocean and numerically reproduced irregular wave trains it is understood that while wave trains exhibit nonlinear variability they are not random and can be predicted to within a given threshold of accuracy in this respect it is common practice to model ocean waves using a linear superposition of sinusoidal waves of different amplitudes in principle if ocean waves could be represented by a linear superposition of sinusoidal waves it should be possible to forecast the next coming waves by decomposing the preceding wave train into component waves however this may take some time and may not predict rapidly enough for practical purposes moreover highly nonlinear large waves such as rogue waves e g dean 1990 clauss and marco 2009 cannot be predicted by linear superposition of component waves in applying artificial neural networks ann for the prediction of time series it is known that simple feedforward neural networks do not work well because they cannot take account of long term dependence in order to overcome this drawback recurrent neural networks rnn have been developed these can store the information from past values and use it in predicting the future williams and zipser 1989 connor et al 1994 using synthetic and real data have shown the superiority of rnn over the feedforward neural networks in predicting time series among a variety of rnn approaches the present study uses long short term memory lstm which can store information from the remote past as well as the recent past hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 application of deep learning methods in time series forecasting has been seen in fields ranging from energy consumption e g ruiz et al 2018 traffic flow e g ma et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 and rainfall mishra et al 2018 to stock prices e g nelson et al 2017 the literature on forecasting ocean waves consists primarily of two categories one is large scale physics based models which simulate ocean waves by solving physics based equations e g molteni et al 1996 rogers et al 2007 tolman 2009 reikard et al 2011 the other is time series and statistical models abraham and ledolter 2009 physics based models are known to be effective for forecasting over longer time horizons while statistical models work well for short term prediction reikard and rogers 2011 ai and machine learning methods are closer to the time series approach in this respect several prior works have used neural networks deo and naidu 1998 jain and deo 2008 günaydin 2008 gopinath and dwarakish 2015 james et al 2018 most of these works focused on forecasting wave parameters significant wave heights average periods etc over horizons of several hours to several days as for the prediction of individual wave heights mase et al 2011 investigated real time prediction of each water surface level in a tsunami train surging into osaka bay in japan using a neural net in the present work the goal is to predict the next wave height in a wind driven fully developed wave train if the next wave height can be predicted this should have many practical applications for example it would be useful in securing the safety of ships and offshore structures such as oil drilling platforms it is clearly relevant to wave farms 2 method of analyses 2 1 the wave trains subjected to the analyses as the wave trains subjected to the present analyses the following two kinds of irregular wave trains were provided 1 numerically produced irregular wave trains 2 irregular wave trains measured in a real sea 2 1 1 numerically produced irregular wave trains in numerically producing irregular wave trains in the present study it is assumed that the waves have the following power spectrum s ω which is known as modified pierson moskowitz spectrum proposed by issc international ship and offshore structures congress 1 s ω 0 11 h 1 3 2 ω 1 ω ω 0 5 exp 0 44 ω ω 0 4 where h 1 3 t 0 represent respectively the significant wave height the average period of the corresponding irregular wave train and ω 0 2 π t 0 the concrete values of h 1 3 t 0 assumed in the present work are 2 6 m and 6 0 sec respectively these specific values of h 1 3 t 0 were selected so that the values were about the same as those of the waves measured in a real sea which will appear later in this paper the power spectrum s ω given by eq 1 with these values of h 1 3 t 0 is shown in fig 1 based on the power spectrum given by eq 1 the irregular wave train that possesses the power spectrum is produced numerically in a computer in the following process 1 the power spectrum is approximated as the summation of n slender vertical strips as shown in fig 2 n 60 was used for the present analyses the width of each strip is not set to be of equal value but of unequal value using random numbers so that the same pattern of an irregular wave train does not appear periodically in the produced irregular wave train 2 using the unequally divided ω i i 1 2 n where n represents the number of segmentation of the corresponding power spectrum see fig 2 the irregular wave train ζ t x progressing in positive x direction is produced numerically by the following equation 2 ζ t x i 1 n ζ i cos k i x ω i t ε i where ζ t x stands for the instantaneous free surface displacement at time t and at point x x ζ i represents the amplitude of the i th component wave which is related to the segmented power spectrum as follows 3 ζ i 2 s ω i δ ω i here δ ω i is the width of the i t h slender vertical strip and k i in eq 2 represents the wave number of the i th component wave which is related to ω i in the case of large water depth as follows 4 k i ω i 2 g where g is the gravitational acceleration assuming the water depth is large the relationship given by eq 4 was used for the present analyses the phase ε i in eq 2 is chosen randomly in the range 0 2 π 2 1 2 irregular wave trains measured in a real sea as the irregular wave trains measured in a real sea subjected to the present analyses those provided by courtesy of professor takuji waseda of the university of tokyo were used the wave data were measured off kozu island one of the izu seven islands lined up in the pacific ocean south of tokyo japan at 34 o 1 5 4 6 n 139 o 0 7 57 1 e for the measurement a floating buoy equipped with gps global positioning system moored by catenary mooring lines was used since the diameter of the buoy was much smaller than the wavelengths of relevant ambient waves the vertical displacement of the buoy itself was used in the present study as the free surface displacement at the corresponding point 2 2 mechanical learning and forecasting by rnn among machine learning methods long short term memory lstm networks which are known to be effective for time series analyses were adopted using open source tensorflow software provided by google the algorithms are available through the keras library 2 2 1 mechanical learning by rnn mechanical learning by rnn was carried out in the following way the time series of waves is divided into two parts as shown in fig 3 the initial section is used as training data while the remainder of the data set is used as test data the data consists of the peak values maximal values and minimal values when the lstm is trained it analyzes a sequence of n peak heights and predicts the next peak as shown in fig 4 a this process is repeated by shifting the sequence of n peaks by one peak as shown in fig 4 b this iterative training process was repeated up to the end of the training data 2 2 2 forecasting by rnn the same process mentioned in 2 2 1 is used in forecasting the lstm forecasts the height of the next peak from the previous n peaks as shown in fig 5 a and fig 5 b to be more specific 40 501th 540th peaks were used as test data the forecasting process were conducted as follows first the lstm forecasts the 521st peak height from the 501st 520th peak heights second the lstm forecasts the 522nd peak height from the 502nd 521st peak heights third the lstm forecasts the 523rd peak height from the 503rd 522nd peak heights finally the lstm forecasts the 540th peak height from the 520th 539th peak heights in effect an adaptive learning of rolling window forecasting methodology is used the literature on rolling window forecasting provides rigorous criteria as to the number of prior data points that should be used in each window inoue et al 2017 the number of data points used here n 20 worked well empirically although the time duration in which 20 peaks appeared varies depending on the location in the data sets used here it was about 50 s on average which in turn was about 2 times the relevant longest wave period some results of parametric studies conducted in order to examine the appropriate window size while varying the window size n will be shown later in section 3 1 a part of the code used in the analyses which provides a better sense of the architecture is shown in the appendix 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerically produced wave train first the numerically produced wave trains shown in fig 6 a were analyzed in the analyses 500 peaks were used for training hereafter this is referred to as case 1 table 1 shows the correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights predicted by the lstm and the real peak heights in table 1 four different results based on four runs of the model are reported in table 1 3 out of 4 correlation coefficients r are 0 65 0 80 considering that roughly speaking when the correlation coefficient is higher than 0 7 it can be said that there is a strong correlation between the corresponding two values it is rather impressive that the peak heights can actually be predicted fairly well by this method among the four results shown in table 1 picking up the result that achieved the highest correlation coefficient r 0 811 the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are compared and correlated in fig 7 a 1 and figs 7 a 2 in the figure as is a common practice in applying lstm both the predicted values and the real values of peak heights are normalized so that they fall in the range 0 1 in figs 7 a 1 the time sequences of the real values and the predicted values are compared while in figs 7 a 2 correlations between the predicted values and the real values are shown in figs 7 a 1 triangle marks indicate the real peak heights of the 521th 540th peaks in the time series of the irregular wave train shown in fig 6 a while circle marks indicate the corresponding peak heights predicted by the rnn as can be observed in the figure the circle and triangle marks are respectively joined by smooth lines to give the geometrical visual images of the predicted wave train and that of the real one the spatial distance between adjacent peaks is not accounted for in the figure but set to be equal again in fig 7 we can reconfirm the numerical fact that the peak heights can be predicted fairly well by rnn another possibility is to sort the wave heights into discrete classes as shown in table 2 instead of letting the rnn learn and predict the exact values of peak heights themselves we let the rnn learn and predict which class the corresponding peak belonged to predicting actual peak values may be more difficult for the neural net than predicting ranges or classes for instance if instead of 500 different peak heights the rnn is required to lean and predict just dozens of classes the author speculated that it might be easier for the rnn both to learn and to predict from a practical viewpoint also in many cases forecasting ballpark values instead of exact values may be enough subjecting the two time series of wave trains shown in fig 6 a and b the above mentioned attempt was conducted the two different time series of wave trains shown in fig 6 a and b have the same power spectrum but different phases ε i see eq 2 hereafter the analyses conducted while subjecting the wave trains shown in fig 6 a and in fig 6 b are called as case 2 and case 3 respectively in table 3 correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are shown in the two cases the averaged correlation coefficients are 0 698 and 0 746 respectively which suggest peak heights can be predicted by rnn fairly well although contrary to the expectation of the author distinct improvement of the prediction accuracy is not attained compared to case 1 hereafter as in case 2 and case 3 results obtained while classifying the peak heights into classes are shown as for the comparison of prediction accuracies in case 2 and those in case 3 no distinct differences are observed which suggests regardless of the differences of the time series of wave trains subjected to the analyses about the same good prediction accuracies can be attained picking up the attempts in table 3 that achieved the highest accuracies in case 2 r 0 782 and in case 3 r 0 830 the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are compared and correlated in fig 8 a and fig 8 b in order to examine the appropriate window size that is the number of n learning and prediction by rnn was conducted while varying the window size n systematically as n 5 10 20 40 the results are summarized in table 4 as in table 3 four attempts were carried out for each window size n in the table the correlation coefficient and the root mean squared error between peak heights predicted by rnn and real peak heights obtained in each attempt and the averaged values of those of the four attempts are shown in terms of both the correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors no distinct differences among the results obtained with various n are observed even with the window size as small as n 5 the numerical facts suggest that fairly good predictions could already be attained with the window size n 20 the correlation coefficient is actually the lowest with the average value r 0 698 although it still suggests quite high correlation but on the other hand the root mean squared error is the lowest overall no distinct conclusion can be drawn as to which window size should be used but the window size n 20 was used throughout the calculations conducted in the present study in order to examine the effect of the number of training data two cases case 4 case 5 were compared fig 9 shows the time series of wave trains subjected to these analyses as specified in the caption of fig 9 time series of 3000 s duration which is twice the time duration of the time series shown in fig 6 was subjected to the analyses in case 4 1000 peak heights were used for the mechanical learning of rnn while in case 5 500 out of the 1000 peak heights were used for the mechanical learning in both cases the same test data were subjected to the prediction of peak heights by the rnn in table 5 correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights obtained in case 4 and in case 5 are shown from the table slight improvements in both the correlation coefficients and the root mean squared errors seem to be achieved by increasing the number of training data which is consistent with our intuition although the improvements are not distinct since from practical viewpoint even if you can forecast that a large wave is coming next there may be no time or no ways to prepare for the incoming large wave an attempt was made in which the height of the n 5 t h peak instead of the height of the n 1 t h peak was forecasted by rnn from the peak heights of the preceding n peaks this attempt was carried out while using the numerically produced wave train shown in fig 6 a and hereafter it is called as case 6 in table 6 correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are shown it is observed that the correlation coefficients in the 4 attempts conducted could still be higher than 0 6 in one of the four attempts shown in the table correlation coefficient is as low as 0 382 which is markedly lower than the other three values if this value is omitted in calculating the average value average correlation coefficient is 0 700 picking up the attempt that resulted in the highest correlation coefficient r 0 786 the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are compared and correlated in fig 10 although this is just an example calculation conducted for a particular case it is interesting that the height of the n 5 t h peak instead of the height of the n 1 t h peak could be forecasted by rnn fairly well from the peak heights of the preceding n peaks 3 2 wave trains measured in a real sea as mentioned in 3 1 the results of the analyses conducted using the numerically produced wave trains suggest that the immediate next wave peak height could actually be predicted fairly accurately by rnn however there exist certain differences between wave trains in a real sea and those numerically produced in a computer in this study to name a few 1 wave trains in a real sea are not necessarily unidirectional ones that are expressed by eq 2 or rather they more or less consist of multidirectional wave trains 2 even if the wave train is unidirectional it is dubious if the wave train in a real sea can be expressed as a linear superposition of regular wave trains as in eq 2 3 even if the wave train can be expressed as in eq 2 there is no guarantee that the sea state expressed by eq 2 remains to be the same while the rnn is mechanically learning 4 waves in a real sea are not necessarily those produced by wind but they can be produced by other causes such as seaquakes landslides astronomical tide and so on these are just a few possible differences between numerically produced wave trains expressed in eq 2 and wave trains in a real sea which the author could come up with there could be other differences between the two wave trains therefore although the results obtained in 3 1 using numerically produced wave trains suggest that the immediate future wave peak height could be forecasted fairy accurately by rnn there is no guarantee that it is also the case in wave trains in a real sea under these concerns the same analyses as those conducted in 3 1 were carried out while subjecting the wave trains measured in a real sea to the analyses measured wave time series subjected to the present analyses are shown in fig 11 and the statistical values that are significant wave height h 1 3 and average period t 0 of these wave trains are summarized in table 7 the specific values of h 1 3 2 6 m t 0 6 0 s assumed in numerically producing wave trains were selected so that the values were about the same as those of the waves measured in a real sea shown in table 7 the analyses conducted while using each of the 3 different wave time series shown in fig 11 a b c are hereafter called as real 1 real 2 real 3 respectively in table 8 correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights in the three cases real 1 real 2 real 3 are shown as can be observed in the table it turned out that the correlation coefficients could still be fairly high even in wave trains in a real sea particularly in the case real 3 all the correlation coefficients obtained in the four attempts are quite as high as around 0 8 picking up the result that showed the highest correlation coefficient in table 8 that is r 0 857 obtained in real 3 the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are compared and correlated in fig 12 a 1 and figs 12 a 2 other than the fact that even the wave trains in a real sea could be predicted fairly well by rnn another interesting fact known from the results shown in table 8 is that in terms of correlation coefficients the wave trains measured at 22 00 22 20 that is real 3 are apparently more predictable than the other two wave trains measured at 00 00 00 20 and at 12 00 12 20 in the same day which may be suggesting that the structure of the wave trains has somehow changed distinctively by 22 00 on the other hand it is also noticeable that in terms of root mean squared errors the corresponding values in the case real 3 are not as good as the correlation coefficients or the root mean squared errors in the case real 3 are even quite larger than those of the case real 2 although the correlation coefficients of the case real 3 are significantly higher than those of the case real 2 4 forecasting motion responses of a floating structure in an irregular wave train so far forecasting of an irregular wave train has been dealt with but here the feasibility of forecasting motion responses in an irregular wave train is examined in some practical purposes forecasting motions rather than forecasting waves may be preferable to name a few if you want to control motions of an ocean energy harvesting device for effective extraction of ocean energy or if you want to control relative motions between a maintenance ship and a floating offshore wind power generator direct forecasting of motions themselves rather than forecasting waves may be more preferable besides accurate on board measurement of ambient waves is quite difficult for moving ships or other floating structures while accurate on board measurement of motions of the corresponding ship or the corresponding floating structure will be relatively easy in order to investigate the feasibility of forecasting motion responses of a floating structure in an irregular wave train a 2 d floating structure of rectangular cross section shown in fig 13 was subjected to the present study 4 1 calculation of motions 4 1 1 equations of motions the equations of motions used in the present calculations are as follows 5 j 1 3 m ℓ j a ℓ j x j n ℓ j x j k ℓ j x j f w ℓ ℓ 1 3 here ℓ 1 2 represent translational motions in x direction surge z direction heave respectively ℓ 3 represents rotational motion around y axis pitch as for the definition of axes see fig 13 and x j motion displacement in j th direction m ℓ j mass or mass moment of inertia in ℓ th motion m 11 m 22 m ℓ j 0 i f ℓ j a ℓ j added mass or added mass moment of inertia in ℓ th motion due to j th motion n ℓ j damping coefficient in ℓ th motion due to j th motion k ℓ j restoring force moment coefficient in ℓ th motion due to j th motion f w ℓ wave force moment in ℓ th direction in principle the equations of motions that describe the time domain motions should be expressed with convolution integral accounting for the memory effect due to the waves induced by the motions cummins 1962 in the present computations however for the sake of simplicity we assume that the equations of motions can be expressed by eq 5 in which hydrodynamic coefficients a ℓ j n ℓ j at certain representative motion period are taken in the present study the average period t 0 of the irregular wave train was chosen as the representative motion period as for the irregular wave train used in the present calculations the same one as that expressed by eq 2 was used in waves expressed by eq 2 the wave force moment f w ℓ t are written as follows 6 f w ℓ t i 1 n h w ℓ ω i ζ i cos k i x ω i t ε w ℓ ε i here h w ℓ ω i ε w ℓ ω i represent respectively the amplitude and the phase of the ℓ t h mode wave force moment in regular waves of unit amplitude and frequency ω i 4 1 2 numerical time integration time series of motions x 1 x 2 x 3 are obtained by numerically integrating the set of the three simultaneous differential equations eq 5 in time among various existing numerical time wise integration methods newmark β method with β 1 6 was used in the present study 4 2 mechanical learning and forecasting by rnn in fig 14 b the numerically obtained time series of heaving motions of the 2 d floating body in the irregular wave train depicted in fig 14 a is shown 500 peaks in the time series of the heave motions were used for mechanical learning of rnn and the immediately following 40 peaks were subjected to the examination of the predictability of heave motion peaks the procedures of mechanical learning and prediction by rnn are the same as those described in section 2 2 4 3 results and discussion in table 9 correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights of heave motions predicted by rnn and the real peak heights of heave motions are shown hereafter this case is called as motion 1 apparently the correlation coefficients shown in the table are higher than those obtained in forecasting waves 3 out of 4 correlation coefficients shown in the table are higher than 0 9 and even the remaining one is close to 0 9 the average value of the 4 correlation coefficients is as high as 0 899 as for the root mean squared errors they are consistently as low as 0 07 0 08 in the four attempts as well picking up the attempt in table 9 that achieved the highest correlation coefficient r 0 915 the peak heights of heave motions predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are compared and correlated in fig 15 a 1 and figs 15 a 2 the reason why the rnn could forecast heave notions better than waves may be interpreted as follows fig 16 a and fig 16 b show the fourier spectra of the wave train and that of heaving motions obtained by analyzing the corresponding time series depicted in fig 14 a and b respectively the fourier analyses were conducted while using the statistical analysis tools equipped in microsoft excel the number of data used in the present analyses was 4096 in fig 16 a b we can observe that the fourier spectrum of the heave motions is distinctively narrower banded than that of waves since as shown in fig 17 the frequency range in which relevant heave motions take place is distinctively narrower than that of waves the fourier spectrum of the corresponding heave motions which is the product of rao response amplitude operator of the heave motions and the fourier spectrum of the waves results in narrower banded rao is the motion amplitude in regular waves of unit amplitude this fact should not be the case only in the particular case dealt with in the present study because in general motions induced by regular waves diminish quite rapidly as the wave frequency increases if the corresponding time series are narrow banded the number of relevant regular motions waves composing the time series are fewer than those of time series of wider banded and this in turn implies the irregularity of the corresponding time series is simpler and thus should be easier for rnn to decipher the hidden regularity of the time series actually the author once examined the predictability of an irregular wave train composed of only 3 regular waves of different frequencies with rnn and found that the rnn could forecast the next coming waves almost perfectly 5 conclusions in the present study feasibility of forecasting the peak heights of next coming waves from the known peak heights of a preceding wave train by use of recurrent neural networks has been investigated the investigation was carried out using both irregular wave trains produced in a computer and those measured in a real sea other than forecasting waves the present study was further extended to the feasibility of forecasting next motions of a floating body in an irregular wave train although the results here are preliminary they are encouraging even the peak heights of a wave train in a real sea turned out to be reasonably predictable by the rnn perhaps surprisingly the rnn could forecast motions with even higher accuracy than waves some plausible reasons why motions can be predicted with higher accuracy than waves were examined since the process of mechanical learning in the rnn is based on exploring regularities in the wave train data sets the methodology may also be applicable to predicting such highly nonlinear phenomena as freak waves or rogue waves e g clauss and marco 2009 predicting anomalous or extreme events using machine learning has been seen in some other fields närhi et al 2018 since results of many cases are shown

21839,with the advent of deep learning artificial intelligence ai has attracted the attention of researchers in various fields including ocean engineering this paper applies ai to forecasting a water surface wave train recurrent neural networks rnn are used to forecast both actual wave trains and numerically reproduced irregular wave trains the specific type of network used here is the long short term memory lstm model which is known to have good properties for time series prediction the methodology is extended to forecasting the motion responses of a floating body in an irregular wave train the lstm is found to generate reasonably accurate forecasts despite the nonlinearity of the data keywords artificial intelligence neural networks lstm forecasting time series forecasting ocean waves forecasting motions 1 introduction with the advent of deep learning artificial intelligence ai has attracted renewed interest from researchers in various fields there should be a vast potential in the application of ai to ocean engineering a recent example is the use of ai in autonomous ship maneuvering e g gcaptain 2018 rolls royce 2018 the present work investigates the use of ai to forecast a water surface wave train specifically artificial neural networks ann are used to predict both actual irregular wave trains measured in the ocean and numerically reproduced irregular wave trains it is understood that while wave trains exhibit nonlinear variability they are not random and can be predicted to within a given threshold of accuracy in this respect it is common practice to model ocean waves using a linear superposition of sinusoidal waves of different amplitudes in principle if ocean waves could be represented by a linear superposition of sinusoidal waves it should be possible to forecast the next coming waves by decomposing the preceding wave train into component waves however this may take some time and may not predict rapidly enough for practical purposes moreover highly nonlinear large waves such as rogue waves e g dean 1990 clauss and marco 2009 cannot be predicted by linear superposition of component waves in applying artificial neural networks ann for the prediction of time series it is known that simple feedforward neural networks do not work well because they cannot take account of long term dependence in order to overcome this drawback recurrent neural networks rnn have been developed these can store the information from past values and use it in predicting the future williams and zipser 1989 connor et al 1994 using synthetic and real data have shown the superiority of rnn over the feedforward neural networks in predicting time series among a variety of rnn approaches the present study uses long short term memory lstm which can store information from the remote past as well as the recent past hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 application of deep learning methods in time series forecasting has been seen in fields ranging from energy consumption e g ruiz et al 2018 traffic flow e g ma et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 and rainfall mishra et al 2018 to stock prices e g nelson et al 2017 the literature on forecasting ocean waves consists primarily of two categories one is large scale physics based models which simulate ocean waves by solving physics based equations e g molteni et al 1996 rogers et al 2007 tolman 2009 reikard et al 2011 the other is time series and statistical models abraham and ledolter 2009 physics based models are known to be effective for forecasting over longer time horizons while statistical models work well for short term prediction reikard and rogers 2011 ai and machine learning methods are closer to the time series approach in this respect several prior works have used neural networks deo and naidu 1998 jain and deo 2008 günaydin 2008 gopinath and dwarakish 2015 james et al 2018 most of these works focused on forecasting wave parameters significant wave heights average periods etc over horizons of several hours to several days as for the prediction of individual wave heights mase et al 2011 investigated real time prediction of each water surface level in a tsunami train surging into osaka bay in japan using a neural net in the present work the goal is to predict the next wave height in a wind driven fully developed wave train if the next wave height can be predicted this should have many practical applications for example it would be useful in securing the safety of ships and offshore structures such as oil drilling platforms it is clearly relevant to wave farms 2 method of analyses 2 1 the wave trains subjected to the analyses as the wave trains subjected to the present analyses the following two kinds of irregular wave trains were provided 1 numerically produced irregular wave trains 2 irregular wave trains measured in a real sea 2 1 1 numerically produced irregular wave trains in numerically producing irregular wave trains in the present study it is assumed that the waves have the following power spectrum s ω which is known as modified pierson moskowitz spectrum proposed by issc international ship and offshore structures congress 1 s ω 0 11 h 1 3 2 ω 1 ω ω 0 5 exp 0 44 ω ω 0 4 where h 1 3 t 0 represent respectively the significant wave height the average period of the corresponding irregular wave train and ω 0 2 π t 0 the concrete values of h 1 3 t 0 assumed in the present work are 2 6 m and 6 0 sec respectively these specific values of h 1 3 t 0 were selected so that the values were about the same as those of the waves measured in a real sea which will appear later in this paper the power spectrum s ω given by eq 1 with these values of h 1 3 t 0 is shown in fig 1 based on the power spectrum given by eq 1 the irregular wave train that possesses the power spectrum is produced numerically in a computer in the following process 1 the power spectrum is approximated as the summation of n slender vertical strips as shown in fig 2 n 60 was used for the present analyses the width of each strip is not set to be of equal value but of unequal value using random numbers so that the same pattern of an irregular wave train does not appear periodically in the produced irregular wave train 2 using the unequally divided ω i i 1 2 n where n represents the number of segmentation of the corresponding power spectrum see fig 2 the irregular wave train ζ t x progressing in positive x direction is produced numerically by the following equation 2 ζ t x i 1 n ζ i cos k i x ω i t ε i where ζ t x stands for the instantaneous free surface displacement at time t and at point x x ζ i represents the amplitude of the i th component wave which is related to the segmented power spectrum as follows 3 ζ i 2 s ω i δ ω i here δ ω i is the width of the i t h slender vertical strip and k i in eq 2 represents the wave number of the i th component wave which is related to ω i in the case of large water depth as follows 4 k i ω i 2 g where g is the gravitational acceleration assuming the water depth is large the relationship given by eq 4 was used for the present analyses the phase ε i in eq 2 is chosen randomly in the range 0 2 π 2 1 2 irregular wave trains measured in a real sea as the irregular wave trains measured in a real sea subjected to the present analyses those provided by courtesy of professor takuji waseda of the university of tokyo were used the wave data were measured off kozu island one of the izu seven islands lined up in the pacific ocean south of tokyo japan at 34 o 1 5 4 6 n 139 o 0 7 57 1 e for the measurement a floating buoy equipped with gps global positioning system moored by catenary mooring lines was used since the diameter of the buoy was much smaller than the wavelengths of relevant ambient waves the vertical displacement of the buoy itself was used in the present study as the free surface displacement at the corresponding point 2 2 mechanical learning and forecasting by rnn among machine learning methods long short term memory lstm networks which are known to be effective for time series analyses were adopted using open source tensorflow software provided by google the algorithms are available through the keras library 2 2 1 mechanical learning by rnn mechanical learning by rnn was carried out in the following way the time series of waves is divided into two parts as shown in fig 3 the initial section is used as training data while the remainder of the data set is used as test data the data consists of the peak values maximal values and minimal values when the lstm is trained it analyzes a sequence of n peak heights and predicts the next peak as shown in fig 4 a this process is repeated by shifting the sequence of n peaks by one peak as shown in fig 4 b this iterative training process was repeated up to the end of the training data 2 2 2 forecasting by rnn the same process mentioned in 2 2 1 is used in forecasting the lstm forecasts the height of the next peak from the previous n peaks as shown in fig 5 a and fig 5 b to be more specific 40 501th 540th peaks were used as test data the forecasting process were conducted as follows first the lstm forecasts the 521st peak height from the 501st 520th peak heights second the lstm forecasts the 522nd peak height from the 502nd 521st peak heights third the lstm forecasts the 523rd peak height from the 503rd 522nd peak heights finally the lstm forecasts the 540th peak height from the 520th 539th peak heights in effect an adaptive learning of rolling window forecasting methodology is used the literature on rolling window forecasting provides rigorous criteria as to the number of prior data points that should be used in each window inoue et al 2017 the number of data points used here n 20 worked well empirically although the time duration in which 20 peaks appeared varies depending on the location in the data sets used here it was about 50 s on average which in turn was about 2 times the relevant longest wave period some results of parametric studies conducted in order to examine the appropriate window size while varying the window size n will be shown later in section 3 1 a part of the code used in the analyses which provides a better sense of the architecture is shown in the appendix 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerically produced wave train first the numerically produced wave trains shown in fig 6 a were analyzed in the analyses 500 peaks were used for training hereafter this is referred to as case 1 table 1 shows the correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights predicted by the lstm and the real peak heights in table 1 four different results based on four runs of the model are reported in table 1 3 out of 4 correlation coefficients r are 0 65 0 80 considering that roughly speaking when the correlation coefficient is higher than 0 7 it can be said that there is a strong correlation between the corresponding two values it is rather impressive that the peak heights can actually be predicted fairly well by this method among the four results shown in table 1 picking up the result that achieved the highest correlation coefficient r 0 811 the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are compared and correlated in fig 7 a 1 and figs 7 a 2 in the figure as is a common practice in applying lstm both the predicted values and the real values of peak heights are normalized so that they fall in the range 0 1 in figs 7 a 1 the time sequences of the real values and the predicted values are compared while in figs 7 a 2 correlations between the predicted values and the real values are shown in figs 7 a 1 triangle marks indicate the real peak heights of the 521th 540th peaks in the time series of the irregular wave train shown in fig 6 a while circle marks indicate the corresponding peak heights predicted by the rnn as can be observed in the figure the circle and triangle marks are respectively joined by smooth lines to give the geometrical visual images of the predicted wave train and that of the real one the spatial distance between adjacent peaks is not accounted for in the figure but set to be equal again in fig 7 we can reconfirm the numerical fact that the peak heights can be predicted fairly well by rnn another possibility is to sort the wave heights into discrete classes as shown in table 2 instead of letting the rnn learn and predict the exact values of peak heights themselves we let the rnn learn and predict which class the corresponding peak belonged to predicting actual peak values may be more difficult for the neural net than predicting ranges or classes for instance if instead of 500 different peak heights the rnn is required to lean and predict just dozens of classes the author speculated that it might be easier for the rnn both to learn and to predict from a practical viewpoint also in many cases forecasting ballpark values instead of exact values may be enough subjecting the two time series of wave trains shown in fig 6 a and b the above mentioned attempt was conducted the two different time series of wave trains shown in fig 6 a and b have the same power spectrum but different phases ε i see eq 2 hereafter the analyses conducted while subjecting the wave trains shown in fig 6 a and in fig 6 b are called as case 2 and case 3 respectively in table 3 correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are shown in the two cases the averaged correlation coefficients are 0 698 and 0 746 respectively which suggest peak heights can be predicted by rnn fairly well although contrary to the expectation of the author distinct improvement of the prediction accuracy is not attained compared to case 1 hereafter as in case 2 and case 3 results obtained while classifying the peak heights into classes are shown as for the comparison of prediction accuracies in case 2 and those in case 3 no distinct differences are observed which suggests regardless of the differences of the time series of wave trains subjected to the analyses about the same good prediction accuracies can be attained picking up the attempts in table 3 that achieved the highest accuracies in case 2 r 0 782 and in case 3 r 0 830 the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are compared and correlated in fig 8 a and fig 8 b in order to examine the appropriate window size that is the number of n learning and prediction by rnn was conducted while varying the window size n systematically as n 5 10 20 40 the results are summarized in table 4 as in table 3 four attempts were carried out for each window size n in the table the correlation coefficient and the root mean squared error between peak heights predicted by rnn and real peak heights obtained in each attempt and the averaged values of those of the four attempts are shown in terms of both the correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors no distinct differences among the results obtained with various n are observed even with the window size as small as n 5 the numerical facts suggest that fairly good predictions could already be attained with the window size n 20 the correlation coefficient is actually the lowest with the average value r 0 698 although it still suggests quite high correlation but on the other hand the root mean squared error is the lowest overall no distinct conclusion can be drawn as to which window size should be used but the window size n 20 was used throughout the calculations conducted in the present study in order to examine the effect of the number of training data two cases case 4 case 5 were compared fig 9 shows the time series of wave trains subjected to these analyses as specified in the caption of fig 9 time series of 3000 s duration which is twice the time duration of the time series shown in fig 6 was subjected to the analyses in case 4 1000 peak heights were used for the mechanical learning of rnn while in case 5 500 out of the 1000 peak heights were used for the mechanical learning in both cases the same test data were subjected to the prediction of peak heights by the rnn in table 5 correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights obtained in case 4 and in case 5 are shown from the table slight improvements in both the correlation coefficients and the root mean squared errors seem to be achieved by increasing the number of training data which is consistent with our intuition although the improvements are not distinct since from practical viewpoint even if you can forecast that a large wave is coming next there may be no time or no ways to prepare for the incoming large wave an attempt was made in which the height of the n 5 t h peak instead of the height of the n 1 t h peak was forecasted by rnn from the peak heights of the preceding n peaks this attempt was carried out while using the numerically produced wave train shown in fig 6 a and hereafter it is called as case 6 in table 6 correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are shown it is observed that the correlation coefficients in the 4 attempts conducted could still be higher than 0 6 in one of the four attempts shown in the table correlation coefficient is as low as 0 382 which is markedly lower than the other three values if this value is omitted in calculating the average value average correlation coefficient is 0 700 picking up the attempt that resulted in the highest correlation coefficient r 0 786 the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are compared and correlated in fig 10 although this is just an example calculation conducted for a particular case it is interesting that the height of the n 5 t h peak instead of the height of the n 1 t h peak could be forecasted by rnn fairly well from the peak heights of the preceding n peaks 3 2 wave trains measured in a real sea as mentioned in 3 1 the results of the analyses conducted using the numerically produced wave trains suggest that the immediate next wave peak height could actually be predicted fairly accurately by rnn however there exist certain differences between wave trains in a real sea and those numerically produced in a computer in this study to name a few 1 wave trains in a real sea are not necessarily unidirectional ones that are expressed by eq 2 or rather they more or less consist of multidirectional wave trains 2 even if the wave train is unidirectional it is dubious if the wave train in a real sea can be expressed as a linear superposition of regular wave trains as in eq 2 3 even if the wave train can be expressed as in eq 2 there is no guarantee that the sea state expressed by eq 2 remains to be the same while the rnn is mechanically learning 4 waves in a real sea are not necessarily those produced by wind but they can be produced by other causes such as seaquakes landslides astronomical tide and so on these are just a few possible differences between numerically produced wave trains expressed in eq 2 and wave trains in a real sea which the author could come up with there could be other differences between the two wave trains therefore although the results obtained in 3 1 using numerically produced wave trains suggest that the immediate future wave peak height could be forecasted fairy accurately by rnn there is no guarantee that it is also the case in wave trains in a real sea under these concerns the same analyses as those conducted in 3 1 were carried out while subjecting the wave trains measured in a real sea to the analyses measured wave time series subjected to the present analyses are shown in fig 11 and the statistical values that are significant wave height h 1 3 and average period t 0 of these wave trains are summarized in table 7 the specific values of h 1 3 2 6 m t 0 6 0 s assumed in numerically producing wave trains were selected so that the values were about the same as those of the waves measured in a real sea shown in table 7 the analyses conducted while using each of the 3 different wave time series shown in fig 11 a b c are hereafter called as real 1 real 2 real 3 respectively in table 8 correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights in the three cases real 1 real 2 real 3 are shown as can be observed in the table it turned out that the correlation coefficients could still be fairly high even in wave trains in a real sea particularly in the case real 3 all the correlation coefficients obtained in the four attempts are quite as high as around 0 8 picking up the result that showed the highest correlation coefficient in table 8 that is r 0 857 obtained in real 3 the peak heights predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are compared and correlated in fig 12 a 1 and figs 12 a 2 other than the fact that even the wave trains in a real sea could be predicted fairly well by rnn another interesting fact known from the results shown in table 8 is that in terms of correlation coefficients the wave trains measured at 22 00 22 20 that is real 3 are apparently more predictable than the other two wave trains measured at 00 00 00 20 and at 12 00 12 20 in the same day which may be suggesting that the structure of the wave trains has somehow changed distinctively by 22 00 on the other hand it is also noticeable that in terms of root mean squared errors the corresponding values in the case real 3 are not as good as the correlation coefficients or the root mean squared errors in the case real 3 are even quite larger than those of the case real 2 although the correlation coefficients of the case real 3 are significantly higher than those of the case real 2 4 forecasting motion responses of a floating structure in an irregular wave train so far forecasting of an irregular wave train has been dealt with but here the feasibility of forecasting motion responses in an irregular wave train is examined in some practical purposes forecasting motions rather than forecasting waves may be preferable to name a few if you want to control motions of an ocean energy harvesting device for effective extraction of ocean energy or if you want to control relative motions between a maintenance ship and a floating offshore wind power generator direct forecasting of motions themselves rather than forecasting waves may be more preferable besides accurate on board measurement of ambient waves is quite difficult for moving ships or other floating structures while accurate on board measurement of motions of the corresponding ship or the corresponding floating structure will be relatively easy in order to investigate the feasibility of forecasting motion responses of a floating structure in an irregular wave train a 2 d floating structure of rectangular cross section shown in fig 13 was subjected to the present study 4 1 calculation of motions 4 1 1 equations of motions the equations of motions used in the present calculations are as follows 5 j 1 3 m ℓ j a ℓ j x j n ℓ j x j k ℓ j x j f w ℓ ℓ 1 3 here ℓ 1 2 represent translational motions in x direction surge z direction heave respectively ℓ 3 represents rotational motion around y axis pitch as for the definition of axes see fig 13 and x j motion displacement in j th direction m ℓ j mass or mass moment of inertia in ℓ th motion m 11 m 22 m ℓ j 0 i f ℓ j a ℓ j added mass or added mass moment of inertia in ℓ th motion due to j th motion n ℓ j damping coefficient in ℓ th motion due to j th motion k ℓ j restoring force moment coefficient in ℓ th motion due to j th motion f w ℓ wave force moment in ℓ th direction in principle the equations of motions that describe the time domain motions should be expressed with convolution integral accounting for the memory effect due to the waves induced by the motions cummins 1962 in the present computations however for the sake of simplicity we assume that the equations of motions can be expressed by eq 5 in which hydrodynamic coefficients a ℓ j n ℓ j at certain representative motion period are taken in the present study the average period t 0 of the irregular wave train was chosen as the representative motion period as for the irregular wave train used in the present calculations the same one as that expressed by eq 2 was used in waves expressed by eq 2 the wave force moment f w ℓ t are written as follows 6 f w ℓ t i 1 n h w ℓ ω i ζ i cos k i x ω i t ε w ℓ ε i here h w ℓ ω i ε w ℓ ω i represent respectively the amplitude and the phase of the ℓ t h mode wave force moment in regular waves of unit amplitude and frequency ω i 4 1 2 numerical time integration time series of motions x 1 x 2 x 3 are obtained by numerically integrating the set of the three simultaneous differential equations eq 5 in time among various existing numerical time wise integration methods newmark β method with β 1 6 was used in the present study 4 2 mechanical learning and forecasting by rnn in fig 14 b the numerically obtained time series of heaving motions of the 2 d floating body in the irregular wave train depicted in fig 14 a is shown 500 peaks in the time series of the heave motions were used for mechanical learning of rnn and the immediately following 40 peaks were subjected to the examination of the predictability of heave motion peaks the procedures of mechanical learning and prediction by rnn are the same as those described in section 2 2 4 3 results and discussion in table 9 correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors between the peak heights of heave motions predicted by rnn and the real peak heights of heave motions are shown hereafter this case is called as motion 1 apparently the correlation coefficients shown in the table are higher than those obtained in forecasting waves 3 out of 4 correlation coefficients shown in the table are higher than 0 9 and even the remaining one is close to 0 9 the average value of the 4 correlation coefficients is as high as 0 899 as for the root mean squared errors they are consistently as low as 0 07 0 08 in the four attempts as well picking up the attempt in table 9 that achieved the highest correlation coefficient r 0 915 the peak heights of heave motions predicted by rnn and the real peak heights are compared and correlated in fig 15 a 1 and figs 15 a 2 the reason why the rnn could forecast heave notions better than waves may be interpreted as follows fig 16 a and fig 16 b show the fourier spectra of the wave train and that of heaving motions obtained by analyzing the corresponding time series depicted in fig 14 a and b respectively the fourier analyses were conducted while using the statistical analysis tools equipped in microsoft excel the number of data used in the present analyses was 4096 in fig 16 a b we can observe that the fourier spectrum of the heave motions is distinctively narrower banded than that of waves since as shown in fig 17 the frequency range in which relevant heave motions take place is distinctively narrower than that of waves the fourier spectrum of the corresponding heave motions which is the product of rao response amplitude operator of the heave motions and the fourier spectrum of the waves results in narrower banded rao is the motion amplitude in regular waves of unit amplitude this fact should not be the case only in the particular case dealt with in the present study because in general motions induced by regular waves diminish quite rapidly as the wave frequency increases if the corresponding time series are narrow banded the number of relevant regular motions waves composing the time series are fewer than those of time series of wider banded and this in turn implies the irregularity of the corresponding time series is simpler and thus should be easier for rnn to decipher the hidden regularity of the time series actually the author once examined the predictability of an irregular wave train composed of only 3 regular waves of different frequencies with rnn and found that the rnn could forecast the next coming waves almost perfectly 5 conclusions in the present study feasibility of forecasting the peak heights of next coming waves from the known peak heights of a preceding wave train by use of recurrent neural networks has been investigated the investigation was carried out using both irregular wave trains produced in a computer and those measured in a real sea other than forecasting waves the present study was further extended to the feasibility of forecasting next motions of a floating body in an irregular wave train although the results here are preliminary they are encouraging even the peak heights of a wave train in a real sea turned out to be reasonably predictable by the rnn perhaps surprisingly the rnn could forecast motions with even higher accuracy than waves some plausible reasons why motions can be predicted with higher accuracy than waves were examined since the process of mechanical learning in the rnn is based on exploring regularities in the wave train data sets the methodology may also be applicable to predicting such highly nonlinear phenomena as freak waves or rogue waves e g clauss and marco 2009 predicting anomalous or extreme events using machine learning has been seen in some other fields närhi et al 2018 since results of many cases are shown
