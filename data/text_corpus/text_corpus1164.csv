5820,the effects of vegetation restoration on the hydraulic processes of steep colluvial deposits at collapsing gullies in south china have rarely been evaluated this study quantified the influences of canopy biocrusts and roots on 30 deposit slopes planted with melinis minutifora and chrysopogon zizanioides via rainfall simulation experiments intact m minutifora and c zizanioides effectively decreased flow velocities v by 35 3 and 29 5 and increased darcy weisbach friction coefficients f by 239 6 and 130 8 compared to that of the control treatments respectively the roots of m minutifora contributed most to the decrease of v and the increase of f while roots and canopy of c zizanioides decreased v and increased f to the greatest extents respectively biocrusts increased f and decreased v for all rain intensities when they were combined with roots however when they grew on bare slopes these positive effects were only observed in response to 60 mm h 1 rain events but were reversed for 120 and 180 mm h 1 rain events canopy decreased flow shear stress τ and stream power ω while roots showed a contrasting result and the effects of biocrusts varied on different slopes the influences of plants and components also varied with rain intensities sediment yield rates showed significant relationships with v re τ and ω and could be predicted using linear regression of τ or ω this study highlights the effects of canopies roots of different vegetation types and biocrusts on the hydraulic process on steep colluvial deposit the presented results aid the decision making and management of vegetation restoration of collapsing gullies keywords hydraulic process hydrodynamic root canopy biocrusts colluvial deposit 1 introduction colluvial deposits are key components of collapsing gullies jiang et al 2014 and refer to a chair shaped geomorphology with collapsing cliff in the headwater catchment of gullies in hilly areas zhang and liu 2014 collapsing gullies are a special type of soil erosion which intensively couples gravity erosion and hydraulic erosion xu 1996 wang et al 2015a similar geomorphology and soil erosion types have been reported for the lavakas gullies in madagascar voarintsoa et al 2012 and the vocorocas gullies in brazil de ap bacellar et al 2005 gully erosion still causes landscape changes and soil degradation worldwide bennett and wells 2019 it has an important effect on sediment production as well as carbon and nitrogen redistribution in hilly regions liu et al 2018 wu et al 2018 causes hillslope incisions dissects and fragments landscape amiri et al 2019 bennett and wells 2019 and increases the geo environmental hazard onyelowe 2017 collapsing gullies are a widespread phenomenon on the deep granite weathering crusts in tropical and subtropical south china and have caused severe eco environmental social and economic concerns xu 1996 wang et al 2015a mass movement is very active at the head of the collapsing gullies and results in loose and extremely erosive deposit at its foot zhang and zhong 1990 the soil erosion rate of collapsing gullies exceeds 5 9 104 t km 2 yr 1 liang et al 2009 the material is directly transported from the colluvial deposits to the surroundings where it can damage farmland houses roads bridges reservoirs and ponds zhong et al 2013 the rapid erosion empties the colluvial deposit within a rather short period adds to the instability of the collapsing wall and promotes the recurrence of the mass movement zhang and zhong 1990 slope erosion of the colluvial deposit is a key procedure for the quasi continual development of collapsing gullies xu 1996 research about slope erosion on colluvial deposits helps to understand the process of collapsing gullies and to control this type of soil erosion runoff is the dominant factor in slope erosion and the degree of erosion depends on the hydrodynamic characteristics of flow zhu et al 2018 velocity resistance characteristics shear stress τ and stream power ω are commonly used indicators to characterize overland flow wu 2012 the soil detachment rate forms strong relationships with both τ and ω lyle and smerdon 1965 mcisaac et al 1992 the resistance coefficient is also an important eigenvalue that reflects the hydraulic characteristics of the slope surface tian et al 2018 hydraulic parameters are required in most erosion models τ and unit stream power are used in the water erosion prediction project wepp nearing et al 1989 and in the european soil erosion model eurosem morgan et al 2015 respectively zhao et al 2015 and liang et al 2015 reported the mean flow velocity v flow depth h froude number fr reynolds number re darcy weisbach friction coefficient f and manning roughness coefficient on a red soil slope with different rain intensities and slope gradients zhang et al 2016 and guo et al 2017 investigated the relationships between hydraulic parameters and sediment yield rates sr on red soil slopes however hydraulic parameters and their relationships on steep slopes differed from the results for gentle slopes peng et al 2015 consequently the relationships of steep and loose red soil colluvial deposits under high intensity rainfall are still not fully understood hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters are mainly affected by soil types surface morphology land use patterns rainfall characteristics discharge characteristics sediment content and the near surface characteristics of soil zhao et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 zhang 2017 vegetation and biocrusts play important roles in controlling slope erosion marques et al 2007 liu et al 2014 and greatly influence the hydraulic parameters of overland flow wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b different types of plants exert different effects on overland flow characteristics and sediment yield mohammad and adam 2010 fattet et al 2011 wang et al 2015b chen et al 2018 vegetation stems and roots increase the roughness of slopes and the hydraulic resistance they offer and decrease v zhao et al 2016 slope gradients soil types rain intensities and flow characteristics also affect the performance of the near soil surface components wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 for example when τ exceeded 11 pa biocrusts could not protect the soil from denudation but tended to accelerate soil erosion wang et al 2014 the flow resistance coefficient of partly submerged vegetation increased with flow depth zhang et al 2017 hydraulic resistance on vegetated slopes was found to be positively related with re yang et al 2017a b however the effects of different types of plants on the hydraulic process still need to be assessed for steep red soil colluvial deposits under high intensity rainfall chen et al 2018 furthermore different near soil surface components such as canopy litter roots and biocrusts exert different effects on the hydraulic dynamics and erosion process wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b the aboveground parts of vegetation increase flow resistance by intercepting runoff knapen et al 2009 while plant roots increase soil resistance to the concentrated flow scouring burylo et al 2012 vannoppen et al 2015 the components that are close to or affixed to the ground surface such as short grass litter layers and roots perform better than the canopy layer and contribute more to erosion control wen et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 these differences should be considered when choosing vegetation management willoughby and mcdonald 1999 durán zuazo and rodríguez pleguezuelo 2008 labrière et al 2015 wu et al 2016 how different near soil surface components influence the hydraulic and erosive process on steep red soil colluvial deposits still remains rarely studied although many restoration efforts have been applied to collapsing gullies zhong et al 2013 in summary there are still gaps in the understanding of the hydraulic and hydrodynamic mechanisms of different plants and their components for the reduction of erosion on steep colluvial deposits in subtropical regions therefore the objective of this study was to 1 investigate the hydraulic influences of two plants with different canopy and root structures on the steep granite red soil colluvial deposit through high intensity simulated rainfall 2 quantify the contributions of canopies biocrusts and roots to changing hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters this study clarifies the mechanisms with which plants decrease sheet erosion in the subtropical red soil region and helps to improve the optimization of soil conservation and management practices for steep colluvial deposits 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and vegetation the granite red soil was collected from a typical collapsing gully in wuhua county guangdong province south china fig 1 a in may 2016 the soil was packed in soil flumes without compaction but was subjected to levelling the soil flumes were 3 m long 0 75 wide and 0 5 m deep with a 5 cm sand layer on the bottom sixteen packed soil flumes were left in the open and the soil layer settled freely until march 2017 then m minutifora and c zizanioides were planted on a total of 12 soil flumes six flumes for each plant fig 1b and c two other bare flumes were left without any planting to let biocrusts develop fig 1b while two further flumes were left to freely settle without the establishment of plants and biocrusts for the control treatment all treatments are listed in table 1 weeds in all flumes and biocrusts on t0 flumes were cleared timely for treatments t1 and t4 intact flumes with canopy root and biocrusts were used in rainfall simulation experiments for treatments t2 and t5 the aboveground biomass of the flumes was cleared prior to rainfall simulation experiments for treatments t3 and t6 the biocrusts were carefully cleared with minimum disturbance of the underlying soil and 30 min of rain at 30 mm h 1 was applied to compact the floating soil without generating runoff and erosion a few days before rainfall simulation experiments the canopies were cleared prior to rainfall simulation experiments soil plant and biocrust characteristics of different treatments were reported by zhang et al 2019 bulk densities were 119 4 3 9 121 7 3 1 125 9 1 5 and 132 7 1 0 mg m 3 at slopes for biocrusts m minutifora c zizanioides and bare slopes respectively the aboveground dry biomasses of m minutifora and c zizanioides were 515 4 172 1 and 847 0 161 6 g m 2 respectively their canopy heights were 118 3 7 6 and 266 7 41 6 cm respectively with coverages of 88 3 and 50 10 respectively the root volumes of m minutifora and c zizanioides were 2 040 8 423 8 and 2 476 9 898 8 cm3 m 3 respectively with 1 963 5 435 2 and 1 666 6 651 5 cm3 m 3 of fine roots respectively the coverages of total biocrusts were 93 and 76 under canopies of m minutifora and c zizanioides respectively and 88 on slopes without plants the biocrusts were composed of cyanobacteria microcolus vaginatus and moss barbula tectorum c muell which represented 70 and 50 of the coverage of the biocrusts respectively 2 2 rainfall simulation experiments rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in the rainfall simulation hall of the laboratory of red soil erosion and flow hydraulic in guangzhou guangdong province china using a down sprinkle rainfall simulator xi an university of technology xi an china the rainfall simulator has a height of 13 4 m which allows all raindrops to reach 95 of their terminal speed ran et al 2012 and its uniformity exceeds 90 zhao et al 2015 rainfall simulation experiments were conducted as described in the following 1 pretreatment rainfall a 30 min pretreatment rainfall was applied at 30 mm h 1 intensity to the slopes 12 h before the formal rainfall simulation experiments consequently this resulted in similar antecedent soil moisture which was 0 298 0 008 kg kg 1 for all experiments 2 formal rainfall experiments rain intensities were set at 60 120 and 180 mm h 1 and the duration was 1 h after runoff generation during rainfall simulation experiments both runoff and sediment samples were collected using plastic containers at 2 4 6 8 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min after runoff generation after the rainfall simulation the sediment was separated from the water and oven dried to a constant mass at 105 c followed by weighting the surface velocity v0 of overland flow was measured by using the kmno4 0 8 w w coloration method during rainfall simulation experiments the time the dye tracer needed to travel across the flume was recorded by a stopwatch according to the color front propagation v0 was determined as the ratio of the length of the flume to the time required the profile mean flow velocity v was calculated as 0 67v0 assuming that the vertical velocity distribution followed a quadratic function of water depth in laminar flow li et al 1996 zhao et al 2015 the mean flow depth h m was difficult to measure but can be calculated as zhao et al 2015 1 h q bvt where q represents the total flow volume m3 during time t s and b represents the width of water crossing section m which was 0 75 m in this experiment fr is calculated as the ratio of inertia to gravitational forces wu et al 2011 2 fr v gh where g represents the mean acceleration of gravity m s 2 fr 1 and fr 1 indicate overland flow to be subcritical flow or supercritical flow respectively reichert and norton 2013 re is determined as the ratio of inertia to viscous forces wu et al 2011 3 re vh u where u represents the kinematical viscosity m2 s 1 re 500 and re 500 indicate the overland flow to be laminar or turbulent respectively planchon et al 2005 f characterizes the friction to overland flow from soil and can be calculated as wu et al 2011 4 f 8 g h j v 2 where j represents the surface slope m m 1 τ pa and ω j m 2 s 1 can be calculated as ali et al 2012 wang et al 2014 5 τ ρ g h j 6 ω τ v where ρ represents the water density kg m 3 2 3 effects and contribution rates of different near soil surface factors the effect ei of a near soil surface factor i was defined as the ratio of the hydraulic parameter changes caused by i to the hydraulic parameters of baseline conditions table 2 the contribution rates cri of factor i for decreasing v or increasing f can be calculated following the method of wang et al 2014 7 c r i e i e i e intact where cri represents the contribution rate of factor i canopy biocrusts or roots and eintact represents the effect of an intact plant m minutifora or c zizanioides 3 results and discussion 3 1 runoff rates the runoff rates are shown in fig 2 the mean runoff rate was 0 60 ranging from 0 39 to 0 78 at a rain intensity of 60 mm h 1 when the rain intensities were 120 and 180 mm h 1 the mean runoff coefficients were 0 90 with a minimum of 0 82 the slopes with roots biocrusts or both treatments t2 t3 t5 and t6 had relatively higher runoff rates while the runoff rates of bare slopes treatment t0 were intermediate and the runoff rates of treatments t1 t4 and t7 were lowest treatment t1 had significantly lower runoff rates than treatments t2 and t3 while the runoff rates of treatments t2 and t3 showed no significant differences the same results were also found between the runoff rates of treatment t4 and those of treatments t5 and t6 with the exception that runoff rates of t5 were significantly higher than those of treatment t6 during 180 mm h 1 rain events the results showed that the canopy reduced runoff rates while biocrusts did not reduce runoff rates on rooted slopes this is because the grass canopy prevented surface sealing by reducing the kinetic energy of raindrops abrahams et al 2003 while the stemflow would increase infiltration li et al 2009 thus the intact vegetation increased soil infiltration and reduced runoff wu et al 2011 li and pan 2018 while without the protection of a canopy the infiltration capacity decreased bhark and small 2003 the runoff rates of treatment t7 were significantly lower than those of the control treatment t0 fig 2 indicating that biocrusts affected runoff rates on vegetated slopes however as shown above the effects of biocrusts were not found on rooted slopes treatments t2 vs t3 t5 vs t6 biocrusts increased infiltration and reduced runoff xiao et al 2015 however the present results showed that roots compensated for the effects of biocrusts for reducing runoff no significant differences were found between the runoff rates of treatments t1 and t4 nor between those of t2 and t5 as well as t3 and t6 fig 2 thus different plants exerted no significant effects on runoff rates at such rain intensities and neither did the same components of different vegetation types this is because the rain intensities were relatively higher and the rain duration was only 1 h therefore the proportion of vegetation interception was low zhang et al 2018a soil properties of slopes with different plants showed no significant differences zhang et al 2019 and affected the runoff generation little 3 2 hydraulic parameters v ranged from 2 32 10 2 m s 1 to 8 18 10 2 m s 1 and was the lowest on slopes of treatment t1 when the rain intensity was 60 mm h 1 and the highest on slopes of treatment t7 when rain intensity was 180 mm h 1 these v were lower than the velocities of 9 70 10 2 m s 1 to 1 73 10 1 m s 1 measured by jiang et al 2018 in a 5 m long rill on colluvial deposits on slopes with the same components of different plants treatments t1 vs t4 t2 vs t5 and t3 vs t6 v did not differ significantly with the exception that v of treatment t2 was significantly lower than treatment t5 at a rain intensity of 120 mm h 1 fig 3 a at a rain intensity of 60 mm h 1 v on slopes with intact plants treatments t1 and t4 were significantly lower than those of slopes with biocrusts or roots treatments t2 t3 t5 t6 and t7 fig 3a at a rain intensity of 60 mm h 1 v of treatment t0 was slightly higher than that of treatment t7 and was significantly higher than that of other slopes fig 3a when the rain intensities were 120 and 180 mm h 1 the differences between the v of slopes with different near soil surface components treatments t1 vs t2 vs t3 and t4 vs t5 vs t6 were not significant and lower than that of treatment t0 fig 3a under high rain intensities 120 and 180 mm h 1 v of t7 were the highest the effects of different near soil surface components are shown in fig 4 on slopes planted with m minutifora the effects of canopy roots and biocrusts on v decreased with increasing rain intensities when the rain intensity was 60 mm h 1 canopy roots and biocrusts reduced v by about 18 fig 4a however canopy roots and biocrusts only reduced v by 4 4 11 2 and 15 9 respectively when the rain intensity was 180 mm h 1 on slopes planted with c zizanioides canopy and roots showed stronger effects on reducing v than biocrusts fig 4a the average effect of the canopy of c zizanioides for reducing v was 15 6 and decreased from 20 7 to 13 8 when the rain intensities increased from 60 mm h 1 to 180 mm h 1 the average effect of roots was 14 3 and decreased from 19 5 to 9 3 when the rain intensities increased from 60 mm h 1 to 180 mm h 1 the effects of biocrusts were only 2 7 on average on slopes with biocrusts only biocrusts decreased v when the rain intensity was 60 mm h 1 however contrasting and increasing effects were found when rain intensities increased from 120 to 180 mm h 1 fig 4a the contribution rates of different components for reducing v are shown in fig 5 a the contribution rates of the canopies of m minutifora were lower than those of its roots while the contribution rates of the canopies of c zizanioides were higher than those of its roots this is because the stems of c zizanioides are centered and form large stem clusters furthermore c zizanioides had rigid stems while m minutifora had relatively flexible stems consequently c zizanioides exerted stronger obstruction effects on reducing v because rigid vegetation and vegetation with a larger stem diameter exerted a much stronger friction effect on the water flow and exerted a better effect on reducing convection v al hamdan et al 2012 yang et al 2017a b zhang et al 2018b the roots and biocrusts on slopes planted with m minutifora contributed more to the reduction of v fig 5a partly because m minutifora had a higher fine root volume m minutifora developed many aerial roots which grow on the surface of slopes where they could greatly affect overland flow this is consistent with the ability of plant roots to increase the resistance of soil to flowing water erosion which mainly depends on the number of lateral roots 1 mm in diameter li et al 1991 de baets et al 2007 the coverage of biocrusts under canopies of m minutifora was higher than that under canopies of c zizanioides zhang et al 2019 resulting in higher contribution rates than the former this result was consistent with previous results which showed that biocrust coverage could effectively reduce v liu et al 2016 gao et al 2017 the re of different experiments increased with rain intensities and with more near soil surface components however it was much less than 500 fig 3c therefore all flows were laminar flows fr did not change strongly with rain intensities but increased when fewer near soil surface components remained on slopes and ranged from 0 12 to 0 41 fig 3d all fr were far lower than 1 which indicated that all overland flows were subcritical flows these prospective results are similar to those of zhao et al 2015 who reported that the surface flows on red soil slopes were laminar and subcritical flow even under rain events of 270 mm h 1 f differed among different treatments slopes with more near soil surface components had higher f i e f t1 f t2 f t3 f t0 and f t4 f t5 f t6 f t0 fig 3b in summary slopes with m minutifora components showed higher f than corresponding slopes with c zizanioides components f t1 f t4 f t2 f t5 and f t3 f t6 fig 3b f t1 f t2 and f t7 showed decreasing trends with increasing rain intensities while f t0 showed the opposite trends treatments t3 and t4 had lower f while treatments t5 and t6 had higher f in 60 mm h 1 rain events compared to 180 mm h 1 rain events f t7 was higher than f t0 when the rain intensity was 60 mm h 1 but this size relationship changed when rain intensities were 120 and 180 mm h 1 this indicates that the biocrusts did not increase f during rain events exceeding 120 mm h 1 on average f t1 increased by 239 6 compared with f t0 while f t4 increased by 130 8 the canopy of m minutifora showed a weak effect on this increase of f 7 5 in average while the effects of m minutifora roots were relatively high and stable ranging from 62 3 to 81 8 fig 4b the effects of biocrusts on slopes planted with m minutifora were highest 161 2 for 60 mm h 1 rain events but strongly decreased to 52 1 and 47 8 for 120 and 180 mm h 1 rain events respectively fig 4b on slopes planted with c zizanioides roots exerted the highest effects and increased f by an average of 58 1 while biocrusts and canopy notably increased f by 23 0 and 20 4 on average respectively fig 4b the effects of canopies on increasing f increased with increasing rain intensities and the canopies of c zizanioides achieved higher effects than those of m minutifora fig 4b in contrast the effects on increasing f of the roots of m minutifora were higher than those of the c zizanioides and did not change strongly for the three rain intensities while the effects of c zizanioides roots decreased with increasing rain intensities the effects on increasing f of biocrusts on slopes planted with m minutifora decreased with increasing rain intensities but were much higher than those of biocrusts on slopes with c zizanioides according to the effects of different components their contribution rates toward increasing f are shown in fig 5b similar to the contribution rates for reducing v the total contribution rate on increasing f decreased with increasing rain intensities and the total contribution rates of m minutifora exceeded those of c zizanioides the biocrusts provided major contributions toward increasing f in slopes planted with m minutifora at a rain intensity of 60 mm h 1 however the roots contributed more when rain intensities were 120 and 180 mm h 1 on slopes planted with c zizanioides roots always contributed most toward increasing f for all three rain intensities intact plants and different near soil surface components generally decreased v and increased f compared with control bare slopes fig 3a and b the more components remained on slopes the lower v was and the higher f was this was consistent with the results of li and pan 2018 the canopy of c zizanioides contributed more to increase f than its roots fig 4a b and fig 5 which was consistent with the results of pan et al 2016 and li and pan 2018 who reported that canopy played a more important role in increasing f however the roots of m minutifora exerted stronger effects and contribution rates for reducing v and increasing f than its canopy this difference could be because there were more roots on the surface soil on slopes planted with m minutifora which were exposed on the ground surface after intense erosion under heavy rain intensities compared to slopes planted with c zizanioides fig 6 the effects of biocrusts on v and f were stronger on slopes with m minutifora than on slopes with c zizanioides which is partly because more mosses developed under the canopies of m minutifora than under the canopies of c zizanioides the effects of reducing v and increasing f decreased with increasing rain intensities because higher rain intensities generated more runoff and also increased overland flow depth which weakened the effects of plants temple 1982 kervroedan et al 2018 when overland flow depth increased f v and re increased and fr decreased järvelä 2002 zhang et al 2017 2018b yi et al 2015 also reported that the v reduction effect from biocrusts decreased when the overland flow increased and reached threshold 3 3 hydrodynamic parameters τ and ω varied with rain intensities and treatments fig 3e and f τ and ω both increased with rain intensities treatment t2 had higher τ than treatments t1 and t3 during 60 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall events but treatment t1 had the highest τ in 180 mm h 1 rainfall events treatment t5 had the highest τ among all three treatments with c zizanioides treatments t4 t5 and t6 treatment t7 always had the lowest τ in all treatments and all rain events τ of treatment t0 was higher than that of treatment t7 but lower than that of treatments t1 t6 except that of treatment t4 in 60 mm h 1 rain events the results of ω were similar to those of τ but showed several differences fig 3e and f unlike τ of treatments t1 or t2 which was the highest ω of treatment t3 was the highest among the three treatments with m minutifora treatments t1 t2 and t3 ω of treatment t0 was higher than that of treatments t1 t4 and t6 in 60 mm h 1 rain events and that of treatments t1 and t4 in 120 mm h 1 rain events compared with treatment t0 intact m minutifora and c zizanioides increased τ by 37 1 11 7 and 17 5 19 6 respectively and decreased ω by 10 5 21 2 and 15 6 22 5 respectively both intact plants increased τ more considerably in higher rain intensities and decreased ω more considerably in lower rain intensities the biocrusts in treatment t7 decreased both τ and ω by 15 2 and 10 7 respectively the effects of biocrusts in treatment t7 on decreasing τ increased with increasing rain intensities while the effects on decreasing ω weakened fig 4c and d the effects of different near soil surface components on τ and ω are shown in fig 4c and d canopies of both plants decreased τ by about 11 on average but the reducing effects weakened as rain intensities increased or even reversed to increase τ in 180 mm h 1 rain events for the canopy of m minutifora both biocrusts and roots on slopes with plants increased τ the effects of biocrusts decreased while the effects of roots remained relatively steady for different rain intensities biocrusts and roots on slopes planted with m minutifora increased τ by 21 1 and 30 4 respectively and exerted stronger effects than that on slopes planted with c zizanioides where results were 10 0 and 19 9 respectively the effects of canopies of both plants on ω were similar to that on τ with average effects of 18 3 and 23 6 for canopies of m minutifora and c zizanioides respectively fig 4d opposite effects on ω were found for biocrusts on different slopes on slopes planted with m minutifora biocrusts decreased ω with a mean effect of 3 2 which became stronger as rain intensities increased however on slopes planted with c zizanioides biocrusts increased ω and these effects remained relatively steady under different rain intensities with a mean effect of 6 5 roots generally increased ω and showed a decreasing trend for roots of m minutifora 14 0 on average and an increasing trend for roots of c zizanioides 2 8 on average 3 4 the relationships between sediment yield rate and hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters as shown in table 3 significantly positive correlations between sr and v re τ and ω and both insignificantly positive and negative relationships between sr and f and fr were found the correlation coefficients decreased in the following order τ re ω v f fr with regard to all hydrodynamic parameters the most sensitive parameter was τ since slope erosion was mainly sheet erosion during these short time simulated rainfall experiments the slope morphology remained relatively stable and these correlations were also found by other researchers howard and kerby 1983 whipple and tucker 1999 sun et al 2018 many soil erosion models e g wepp and universal soil loss equation usle predict the sediment yield rate using either τ or ω reichert and norton 2013 kinnell et al 2018 many previous studies have proven that there was a linear relationship between soil sr and τ around the world ghebreiyessus et al 1994 yan et al 2008 wang et al 2018 the predictions of sr based on τ and ω are shown in fig 7 and table 4 the regression interception was set to the same as t0 since they were the same soils the slopes of regressions decreased in the following order t0 t7 t6 t3 t5 t4 t2 t1 the slopes of regressions between sediment yield rate and τ could be regarded as the till erodibility according to wang et al 2014 the results showed that different components greatly affected the resistance of soil to overland flow the erodibility of different treatments also confirmed the effects of different plants and different components i e m minutifora and its components performed better than c zizanioides and its components respectively 4 conclusions the effects of m minutifora c zizanioides and biocrusts on the hydraulic parameters of steep colluvial deposits were explored under simulated rainfall with intensities of 60 120 and 180 mm h 1 the obtained results showed that runoff rates were mostly influenced by the canopies of planted slopes v was mostly decreased by roots and f was mostly increased by roots on slopes planted with m minutifora moreover v was decreased by canopies on slopes planted with c zizanioides biocrusts increased f and reduced v in all rain intensities along with roots however they exerted positive hydraulic effects only in low rain intensity and negative effects in high rain intensities when they were on bare slope τ and ω were decreased by canopies while they were increased by roots and the effects of biocrusts on τ and ω varied on different slopes the influences of plants and their components decreased with increasing rain intensities sr had significant relationships with v re τ and ω and could be well predicted using linear equations of τ or ω the results of this study help to clarify the mechanisms with which plants decrease sheet erosion which is useful for the selection and use of suitable plants to control soil erosion however this study was conducted on repackaged flumes under artificial rainfall and these effects still need to be tested and verified in the field the characteristics of different plants and their effects on the hydraulic of concentrated flows in rills should be studied to comprehensively evaluate their effects more plant species should be tested in the future to enable selection of the best plants for soil and water conservation in this region credit authorship

5820,the effects of vegetation restoration on the hydraulic processes of steep colluvial deposits at collapsing gullies in south china have rarely been evaluated this study quantified the influences of canopy biocrusts and roots on 30 deposit slopes planted with melinis minutifora and chrysopogon zizanioides via rainfall simulation experiments intact m minutifora and c zizanioides effectively decreased flow velocities v by 35 3 and 29 5 and increased darcy weisbach friction coefficients f by 239 6 and 130 8 compared to that of the control treatments respectively the roots of m minutifora contributed most to the decrease of v and the increase of f while roots and canopy of c zizanioides decreased v and increased f to the greatest extents respectively biocrusts increased f and decreased v for all rain intensities when they were combined with roots however when they grew on bare slopes these positive effects were only observed in response to 60 mm h 1 rain events but were reversed for 120 and 180 mm h 1 rain events canopy decreased flow shear stress τ and stream power ω while roots showed a contrasting result and the effects of biocrusts varied on different slopes the influences of plants and components also varied with rain intensities sediment yield rates showed significant relationships with v re τ and ω and could be predicted using linear regression of τ or ω this study highlights the effects of canopies roots of different vegetation types and biocrusts on the hydraulic process on steep colluvial deposit the presented results aid the decision making and management of vegetation restoration of collapsing gullies keywords hydraulic process hydrodynamic root canopy biocrusts colluvial deposit 1 introduction colluvial deposits are key components of collapsing gullies jiang et al 2014 and refer to a chair shaped geomorphology with collapsing cliff in the headwater catchment of gullies in hilly areas zhang and liu 2014 collapsing gullies are a special type of soil erosion which intensively couples gravity erosion and hydraulic erosion xu 1996 wang et al 2015a similar geomorphology and soil erosion types have been reported for the lavakas gullies in madagascar voarintsoa et al 2012 and the vocorocas gullies in brazil de ap bacellar et al 2005 gully erosion still causes landscape changes and soil degradation worldwide bennett and wells 2019 it has an important effect on sediment production as well as carbon and nitrogen redistribution in hilly regions liu et al 2018 wu et al 2018 causes hillslope incisions dissects and fragments landscape amiri et al 2019 bennett and wells 2019 and increases the geo environmental hazard onyelowe 2017 collapsing gullies are a widespread phenomenon on the deep granite weathering crusts in tropical and subtropical south china and have caused severe eco environmental social and economic concerns xu 1996 wang et al 2015a mass movement is very active at the head of the collapsing gullies and results in loose and extremely erosive deposit at its foot zhang and zhong 1990 the soil erosion rate of collapsing gullies exceeds 5 9 104 t km 2 yr 1 liang et al 2009 the material is directly transported from the colluvial deposits to the surroundings where it can damage farmland houses roads bridges reservoirs and ponds zhong et al 2013 the rapid erosion empties the colluvial deposit within a rather short period adds to the instability of the collapsing wall and promotes the recurrence of the mass movement zhang and zhong 1990 slope erosion of the colluvial deposit is a key procedure for the quasi continual development of collapsing gullies xu 1996 research about slope erosion on colluvial deposits helps to understand the process of collapsing gullies and to control this type of soil erosion runoff is the dominant factor in slope erosion and the degree of erosion depends on the hydrodynamic characteristics of flow zhu et al 2018 velocity resistance characteristics shear stress τ and stream power ω are commonly used indicators to characterize overland flow wu 2012 the soil detachment rate forms strong relationships with both τ and ω lyle and smerdon 1965 mcisaac et al 1992 the resistance coefficient is also an important eigenvalue that reflects the hydraulic characteristics of the slope surface tian et al 2018 hydraulic parameters are required in most erosion models τ and unit stream power are used in the water erosion prediction project wepp nearing et al 1989 and in the european soil erosion model eurosem morgan et al 2015 respectively zhao et al 2015 and liang et al 2015 reported the mean flow velocity v flow depth h froude number fr reynolds number re darcy weisbach friction coefficient f and manning roughness coefficient on a red soil slope with different rain intensities and slope gradients zhang et al 2016 and guo et al 2017 investigated the relationships between hydraulic parameters and sediment yield rates sr on red soil slopes however hydraulic parameters and their relationships on steep slopes differed from the results for gentle slopes peng et al 2015 consequently the relationships of steep and loose red soil colluvial deposits under high intensity rainfall are still not fully understood hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters are mainly affected by soil types surface morphology land use patterns rainfall characteristics discharge characteristics sediment content and the near surface characteristics of soil zhao et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 zhang 2017 vegetation and biocrusts play important roles in controlling slope erosion marques et al 2007 liu et al 2014 and greatly influence the hydraulic parameters of overland flow wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b different types of plants exert different effects on overland flow characteristics and sediment yield mohammad and adam 2010 fattet et al 2011 wang et al 2015b chen et al 2018 vegetation stems and roots increase the roughness of slopes and the hydraulic resistance they offer and decrease v zhao et al 2016 slope gradients soil types rain intensities and flow characteristics also affect the performance of the near soil surface components wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 for example when τ exceeded 11 pa biocrusts could not protect the soil from denudation but tended to accelerate soil erosion wang et al 2014 the flow resistance coefficient of partly submerged vegetation increased with flow depth zhang et al 2017 hydraulic resistance on vegetated slopes was found to be positively related with re yang et al 2017a b however the effects of different types of plants on the hydraulic process still need to be assessed for steep red soil colluvial deposits under high intensity rainfall chen et al 2018 furthermore different near soil surface components such as canopy litter roots and biocrusts exert different effects on the hydraulic dynamics and erosion process wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b the aboveground parts of vegetation increase flow resistance by intercepting runoff knapen et al 2009 while plant roots increase soil resistance to the concentrated flow scouring burylo et al 2012 vannoppen et al 2015 the components that are close to or affixed to the ground surface such as short grass litter layers and roots perform better than the canopy layer and contribute more to erosion control wen et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 these differences should be considered when choosing vegetation management willoughby and mcdonald 1999 durán zuazo and rodríguez pleguezuelo 2008 labrière et al 2015 wu et al 2016 how different near soil surface components influence the hydraulic and erosive process on steep red soil colluvial deposits still remains rarely studied although many restoration efforts have been applied to collapsing gullies zhong et al 2013 in summary there are still gaps in the understanding of the hydraulic and hydrodynamic mechanisms of different plants and their components for the reduction of erosion on steep colluvial deposits in subtropical regions therefore the objective of this study was to 1 investigate the hydraulic influences of two plants with different canopy and root structures on the steep granite red soil colluvial deposit through high intensity simulated rainfall 2 quantify the contributions of canopies biocrusts and roots to changing hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters this study clarifies the mechanisms with which plants decrease sheet erosion in the subtropical red soil region and helps to improve the optimization of soil conservation and management practices for steep colluvial deposits 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and vegetation the granite red soil was collected from a typical collapsing gully in wuhua county guangdong province south china fig 1 a in may 2016 the soil was packed in soil flumes without compaction but was subjected to levelling the soil flumes were 3 m long 0 75 wide and 0 5 m deep with a 5 cm sand layer on the bottom sixteen packed soil flumes were left in the open and the soil layer settled freely until march 2017 then m minutifora and c zizanioides were planted on a total of 12 soil flumes six flumes for each plant fig 1b and c two other bare flumes were left without any planting to let biocrusts develop fig 1b while two further flumes were left to freely settle without the establishment of plants and biocrusts for the control treatment all treatments are listed in table 1 weeds in all flumes and biocrusts on t0 flumes were cleared timely for treatments t1 and t4 intact flumes with canopy root and biocrusts were used in rainfall simulation experiments for treatments t2 and t5 the aboveground biomass of the flumes was cleared prior to rainfall simulation experiments for treatments t3 and t6 the biocrusts were carefully cleared with minimum disturbance of the underlying soil and 30 min of rain at 30 mm h 1 was applied to compact the floating soil without generating runoff and erosion a few days before rainfall simulation experiments the canopies were cleared prior to rainfall simulation experiments soil plant and biocrust characteristics of different treatments were reported by zhang et al 2019 bulk densities were 119 4 3 9 121 7 3 1 125 9 1 5 and 132 7 1 0 mg m 3 at slopes for biocrusts m minutifora c zizanioides and bare slopes respectively the aboveground dry biomasses of m minutifora and c zizanioides were 515 4 172 1 and 847 0 161 6 g m 2 respectively their canopy heights were 118 3 7 6 and 266 7 41 6 cm respectively with coverages of 88 3 and 50 10 respectively the root volumes of m minutifora and c zizanioides were 2 040 8 423 8 and 2 476 9 898 8 cm3 m 3 respectively with 1 963 5 435 2 and 1 666 6 651 5 cm3 m 3 of fine roots respectively the coverages of total biocrusts were 93 and 76 under canopies of m minutifora and c zizanioides respectively and 88 on slopes without plants the biocrusts were composed of cyanobacteria microcolus vaginatus and moss barbula tectorum c muell which represented 70 and 50 of the coverage of the biocrusts respectively 2 2 rainfall simulation experiments rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in the rainfall simulation hall of the laboratory of red soil erosion and flow hydraulic in guangzhou guangdong province china using a down sprinkle rainfall simulator xi an university of technology xi an china the rainfall simulator has a height of 13 4 m which allows all raindrops to reach 95 of their terminal speed ran et al 2012 and its uniformity exceeds 90 zhao et al 2015 rainfall simulation experiments were conducted as described in the following 1 pretreatment rainfall a 30 min pretreatment rainfall was applied at 30 mm h 1 intensity to the slopes 12 h before the formal rainfall simulation experiments consequently this resulted in similar antecedent soil moisture which was 0 298 0 008 kg kg 1 for all experiments 2 formal rainfall experiments rain intensities were set at 60 120 and 180 mm h 1 and the duration was 1 h after runoff generation during rainfall simulation experiments both runoff and sediment samples were collected using plastic containers at 2 4 6 8 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min after runoff generation after the rainfall simulation the sediment was separated from the water and oven dried to a constant mass at 105 c followed by weighting the surface velocity v0 of overland flow was measured by using the kmno4 0 8 w w coloration method during rainfall simulation experiments the time the dye tracer needed to travel across the flume was recorded by a stopwatch according to the color front propagation v0 was determined as the ratio of the length of the flume to the time required the profile mean flow velocity v was calculated as 0 67v0 assuming that the vertical velocity distribution followed a quadratic function of water depth in laminar flow li et al 1996 zhao et al 2015 the mean flow depth h m was difficult to measure but can be calculated as zhao et al 2015 1 h q bvt where q represents the total flow volume m3 during time t s and b represents the width of water crossing section m which was 0 75 m in this experiment fr is calculated as the ratio of inertia to gravitational forces wu et al 2011 2 fr v gh where g represents the mean acceleration of gravity m s 2 fr 1 and fr 1 indicate overland flow to be subcritical flow or supercritical flow respectively reichert and norton 2013 re is determined as the ratio of inertia to viscous forces wu et al 2011 3 re vh u where u represents the kinematical viscosity m2 s 1 re 500 and re 500 indicate the overland flow to be laminar or turbulent respectively planchon et al 2005 f characterizes the friction to overland flow from soil and can be calculated as wu et al 2011 4 f 8 g h j v 2 where j represents the surface slope m m 1 τ pa and ω j m 2 s 1 can be calculated as ali et al 2012 wang et al 2014 5 τ ρ g h j 6 ω τ v where ρ represents the water density kg m 3 2 3 effects and contribution rates of different near soil surface factors the effect ei of a near soil surface factor i was defined as the ratio of the hydraulic parameter changes caused by i to the hydraulic parameters of baseline conditions table 2 the contribution rates cri of factor i for decreasing v or increasing f can be calculated following the method of wang et al 2014 7 c r i e i e i e intact where cri represents the contribution rate of factor i canopy biocrusts or roots and eintact represents the effect of an intact plant m minutifora or c zizanioides 3 results and discussion 3 1 runoff rates the runoff rates are shown in fig 2 the mean runoff rate was 0 60 ranging from 0 39 to 0 78 at a rain intensity of 60 mm h 1 when the rain intensities were 120 and 180 mm h 1 the mean runoff coefficients were 0 90 with a minimum of 0 82 the slopes with roots biocrusts or both treatments t2 t3 t5 and t6 had relatively higher runoff rates while the runoff rates of bare slopes treatment t0 were intermediate and the runoff rates of treatments t1 t4 and t7 were lowest treatment t1 had significantly lower runoff rates than treatments t2 and t3 while the runoff rates of treatments t2 and t3 showed no significant differences the same results were also found between the runoff rates of treatment t4 and those of treatments t5 and t6 with the exception that runoff rates of t5 were significantly higher than those of treatment t6 during 180 mm h 1 rain events the results showed that the canopy reduced runoff rates while biocrusts did not reduce runoff rates on rooted slopes this is because the grass canopy prevented surface sealing by reducing the kinetic energy of raindrops abrahams et al 2003 while the stemflow would increase infiltration li et al 2009 thus the intact vegetation increased soil infiltration and reduced runoff wu et al 2011 li and pan 2018 while without the protection of a canopy the infiltration capacity decreased bhark and small 2003 the runoff rates of treatment t7 were significantly lower than those of the control treatment t0 fig 2 indicating that biocrusts affected runoff rates on vegetated slopes however as shown above the effects of biocrusts were not found on rooted slopes treatments t2 vs t3 t5 vs t6 biocrusts increased infiltration and reduced runoff xiao et al 2015 however the present results showed that roots compensated for the effects of biocrusts for reducing runoff no significant differences were found between the runoff rates of treatments t1 and t4 nor between those of t2 and t5 as well as t3 and t6 fig 2 thus different plants exerted no significant effects on runoff rates at such rain intensities and neither did the same components of different vegetation types this is because the rain intensities were relatively higher and the rain duration was only 1 h therefore the proportion of vegetation interception was low zhang et al 2018a soil properties of slopes with different plants showed no significant differences zhang et al 2019 and affected the runoff generation little 3 2 hydraulic parameters v ranged from 2 32 10 2 m s 1 to 8 18 10 2 m s 1 and was the lowest on slopes of treatment t1 when the rain intensity was 60 mm h 1 and the highest on slopes of treatment t7 when rain intensity was 180 mm h 1 these v were lower than the velocities of 9 70 10 2 m s 1 to 1 73 10 1 m s 1 measured by jiang et al 2018 in a 5 m long rill on colluvial deposits on slopes with the same components of different plants treatments t1 vs t4 t2 vs t5 and t3 vs t6 v did not differ significantly with the exception that v of treatment t2 was significantly lower than treatment t5 at a rain intensity of 120 mm h 1 fig 3 a at a rain intensity of 60 mm h 1 v on slopes with intact plants treatments t1 and t4 were significantly lower than those of slopes with biocrusts or roots treatments t2 t3 t5 t6 and t7 fig 3a at a rain intensity of 60 mm h 1 v of treatment t0 was slightly higher than that of treatment t7 and was significantly higher than that of other slopes fig 3a when the rain intensities were 120 and 180 mm h 1 the differences between the v of slopes with different near soil surface components treatments t1 vs t2 vs t3 and t4 vs t5 vs t6 were not significant and lower than that of treatment t0 fig 3a under high rain intensities 120 and 180 mm h 1 v of t7 were the highest the effects of different near soil surface components are shown in fig 4 on slopes planted with m minutifora the effects of canopy roots and biocrusts on v decreased with increasing rain intensities when the rain intensity was 60 mm h 1 canopy roots and biocrusts reduced v by about 18 fig 4a however canopy roots and biocrusts only reduced v by 4 4 11 2 and 15 9 respectively when the rain intensity was 180 mm h 1 on slopes planted with c zizanioides canopy and roots showed stronger effects on reducing v than biocrusts fig 4a the average effect of the canopy of c zizanioides for reducing v was 15 6 and decreased from 20 7 to 13 8 when the rain intensities increased from 60 mm h 1 to 180 mm h 1 the average effect of roots was 14 3 and decreased from 19 5 to 9 3 when the rain intensities increased from 60 mm h 1 to 180 mm h 1 the effects of biocrusts were only 2 7 on average on slopes with biocrusts only biocrusts decreased v when the rain intensity was 60 mm h 1 however contrasting and increasing effects were found when rain intensities increased from 120 to 180 mm h 1 fig 4a the contribution rates of different components for reducing v are shown in fig 5 a the contribution rates of the canopies of m minutifora were lower than those of its roots while the contribution rates of the canopies of c zizanioides were higher than those of its roots this is because the stems of c zizanioides are centered and form large stem clusters furthermore c zizanioides had rigid stems while m minutifora had relatively flexible stems consequently c zizanioides exerted stronger obstruction effects on reducing v because rigid vegetation and vegetation with a larger stem diameter exerted a much stronger friction effect on the water flow and exerted a better effect on reducing convection v al hamdan et al 2012 yang et al 2017a b zhang et al 2018b the roots and biocrusts on slopes planted with m minutifora contributed more to the reduction of v fig 5a partly because m minutifora had a higher fine root volume m minutifora developed many aerial roots which grow on the surface of slopes where they could greatly affect overland flow this is consistent with the ability of plant roots to increase the resistance of soil to flowing water erosion which mainly depends on the number of lateral roots 1 mm in diameter li et al 1991 de baets et al 2007 the coverage of biocrusts under canopies of m minutifora was higher than that under canopies of c zizanioides zhang et al 2019 resulting in higher contribution rates than the former this result was consistent with previous results which showed that biocrust coverage could effectively reduce v liu et al 2016 gao et al 2017 the re of different experiments increased with rain intensities and with more near soil surface components however it was much less than 500 fig 3c therefore all flows were laminar flows fr did not change strongly with rain intensities but increased when fewer near soil surface components remained on slopes and ranged from 0 12 to 0 41 fig 3d all fr were far lower than 1 which indicated that all overland flows were subcritical flows these prospective results are similar to those of zhao et al 2015 who reported that the surface flows on red soil slopes were laminar and subcritical flow even under rain events of 270 mm h 1 f differed among different treatments slopes with more near soil surface components had higher f i e f t1 f t2 f t3 f t0 and f t4 f t5 f t6 f t0 fig 3b in summary slopes with m minutifora components showed higher f than corresponding slopes with c zizanioides components f t1 f t4 f t2 f t5 and f t3 f t6 fig 3b f t1 f t2 and f t7 showed decreasing trends with increasing rain intensities while f t0 showed the opposite trends treatments t3 and t4 had lower f while treatments t5 and t6 had higher f in 60 mm h 1 rain events compared to 180 mm h 1 rain events f t7 was higher than f t0 when the rain intensity was 60 mm h 1 but this size relationship changed when rain intensities were 120 and 180 mm h 1 this indicates that the biocrusts did not increase f during rain events exceeding 120 mm h 1 on average f t1 increased by 239 6 compared with f t0 while f t4 increased by 130 8 the canopy of m minutifora showed a weak effect on this increase of f 7 5 in average while the effects of m minutifora roots were relatively high and stable ranging from 62 3 to 81 8 fig 4b the effects of biocrusts on slopes planted with m minutifora were highest 161 2 for 60 mm h 1 rain events but strongly decreased to 52 1 and 47 8 for 120 and 180 mm h 1 rain events respectively fig 4b on slopes planted with c zizanioides roots exerted the highest effects and increased f by an average of 58 1 while biocrusts and canopy notably increased f by 23 0 and 20 4 on average respectively fig 4b the effects of canopies on increasing f increased with increasing rain intensities and the canopies of c zizanioides achieved higher effects than those of m minutifora fig 4b in contrast the effects on increasing f of the roots of m minutifora were higher than those of the c zizanioides and did not change strongly for the three rain intensities while the effects of c zizanioides roots decreased with increasing rain intensities the effects on increasing f of biocrusts on slopes planted with m minutifora decreased with increasing rain intensities but were much higher than those of biocrusts on slopes with c zizanioides according to the effects of different components their contribution rates toward increasing f are shown in fig 5b similar to the contribution rates for reducing v the total contribution rate on increasing f decreased with increasing rain intensities and the total contribution rates of m minutifora exceeded those of c zizanioides the biocrusts provided major contributions toward increasing f in slopes planted with m minutifora at a rain intensity of 60 mm h 1 however the roots contributed more when rain intensities were 120 and 180 mm h 1 on slopes planted with c zizanioides roots always contributed most toward increasing f for all three rain intensities intact plants and different near soil surface components generally decreased v and increased f compared with control bare slopes fig 3a and b the more components remained on slopes the lower v was and the higher f was this was consistent with the results of li and pan 2018 the canopy of c zizanioides contributed more to increase f than its roots fig 4a b and fig 5 which was consistent with the results of pan et al 2016 and li and pan 2018 who reported that canopy played a more important role in increasing f however the roots of m minutifora exerted stronger effects and contribution rates for reducing v and increasing f than its canopy this difference could be because there were more roots on the surface soil on slopes planted with m minutifora which were exposed on the ground surface after intense erosion under heavy rain intensities compared to slopes planted with c zizanioides fig 6 the effects of biocrusts on v and f were stronger on slopes with m minutifora than on slopes with c zizanioides which is partly because more mosses developed under the canopies of m minutifora than under the canopies of c zizanioides the effects of reducing v and increasing f decreased with increasing rain intensities because higher rain intensities generated more runoff and also increased overland flow depth which weakened the effects of plants temple 1982 kervroedan et al 2018 when overland flow depth increased f v and re increased and fr decreased järvelä 2002 zhang et al 2017 2018b yi et al 2015 also reported that the v reduction effect from biocrusts decreased when the overland flow increased and reached threshold 3 3 hydrodynamic parameters τ and ω varied with rain intensities and treatments fig 3e and f τ and ω both increased with rain intensities treatment t2 had higher τ than treatments t1 and t3 during 60 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall events but treatment t1 had the highest τ in 180 mm h 1 rainfall events treatment t5 had the highest τ among all three treatments with c zizanioides treatments t4 t5 and t6 treatment t7 always had the lowest τ in all treatments and all rain events τ of treatment t0 was higher than that of treatment t7 but lower than that of treatments t1 t6 except that of treatment t4 in 60 mm h 1 rain events the results of ω were similar to those of τ but showed several differences fig 3e and f unlike τ of treatments t1 or t2 which was the highest ω of treatment t3 was the highest among the three treatments with m minutifora treatments t1 t2 and t3 ω of treatment t0 was higher than that of treatments t1 t4 and t6 in 60 mm h 1 rain events and that of treatments t1 and t4 in 120 mm h 1 rain events compared with treatment t0 intact m minutifora and c zizanioides increased τ by 37 1 11 7 and 17 5 19 6 respectively and decreased ω by 10 5 21 2 and 15 6 22 5 respectively both intact plants increased τ more considerably in higher rain intensities and decreased ω more considerably in lower rain intensities the biocrusts in treatment t7 decreased both τ and ω by 15 2 and 10 7 respectively the effects of biocrusts in treatment t7 on decreasing τ increased with increasing rain intensities while the effects on decreasing ω weakened fig 4c and d the effects of different near soil surface components on τ and ω are shown in fig 4c and d canopies of both plants decreased τ by about 11 on average but the reducing effects weakened as rain intensities increased or even reversed to increase τ in 180 mm h 1 rain events for the canopy of m minutifora both biocrusts and roots on slopes with plants increased τ the effects of biocrusts decreased while the effects of roots remained relatively steady for different rain intensities biocrusts and roots on slopes planted with m minutifora increased τ by 21 1 and 30 4 respectively and exerted stronger effects than that on slopes planted with c zizanioides where results were 10 0 and 19 9 respectively the effects of canopies of both plants on ω were similar to that on τ with average effects of 18 3 and 23 6 for canopies of m minutifora and c zizanioides respectively fig 4d opposite effects on ω were found for biocrusts on different slopes on slopes planted with m minutifora biocrusts decreased ω with a mean effect of 3 2 which became stronger as rain intensities increased however on slopes planted with c zizanioides biocrusts increased ω and these effects remained relatively steady under different rain intensities with a mean effect of 6 5 roots generally increased ω and showed a decreasing trend for roots of m minutifora 14 0 on average and an increasing trend for roots of c zizanioides 2 8 on average 3 4 the relationships between sediment yield rate and hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters as shown in table 3 significantly positive correlations between sr and v re τ and ω and both insignificantly positive and negative relationships between sr and f and fr were found the correlation coefficients decreased in the following order τ re ω v f fr with regard to all hydrodynamic parameters the most sensitive parameter was τ since slope erosion was mainly sheet erosion during these short time simulated rainfall experiments the slope morphology remained relatively stable and these correlations were also found by other researchers howard and kerby 1983 whipple and tucker 1999 sun et al 2018 many soil erosion models e g wepp and universal soil loss equation usle predict the sediment yield rate using either τ or ω reichert and norton 2013 kinnell et al 2018 many previous studies have proven that there was a linear relationship between soil sr and τ around the world ghebreiyessus et al 1994 yan et al 2008 wang et al 2018 the predictions of sr based on τ and ω are shown in fig 7 and table 4 the regression interception was set to the same as t0 since they were the same soils the slopes of regressions decreased in the following order t0 t7 t6 t3 t5 t4 t2 t1 the slopes of regressions between sediment yield rate and τ could be regarded as the till erodibility according to wang et al 2014 the results showed that different components greatly affected the resistance of soil to overland flow the erodibility of different treatments also confirmed the effects of different plants and different components i e m minutifora and its components performed better than c zizanioides and its components respectively 4 conclusions the effects of m minutifora c zizanioides and biocrusts on the hydraulic parameters of steep colluvial deposits were explored under simulated rainfall with intensities of 60 120 and 180 mm h 1 the obtained results showed that runoff rates were mostly influenced by the canopies of planted slopes v was mostly decreased by roots and f was mostly increased by roots on slopes planted with m minutifora moreover v was decreased by canopies on slopes planted with c zizanioides biocrusts increased f and reduced v in all rain intensities along with roots however they exerted positive hydraulic effects only in low rain intensity and negative effects in high rain intensities when they were on bare slope τ and ω were decreased by canopies while they were increased by roots and the effects of biocrusts on τ and ω varied on different slopes the influences of plants and their components decreased with increasing rain intensities sr had significant relationships with v re τ and ω and could be well predicted using linear equations of τ or ω the results of this study help to clarify the mechanisms with which plants decrease sheet erosion which is useful for the selection and use of suitable plants to control soil erosion however this study was conducted on repackaged flumes under artificial rainfall and these effects still need to be tested and verified in the field the characteristics of different plants and their effects on the hydraulic of concentrated flows in rills should be studied to comprehensively evaluate their effects more plant species should be tested in the future to enable selection of the best plants for soil and water conservation in this region credit authorship

5821,developing tailored management strategies to ensure the sustainability of groundwater resource under climatic and demographic changes is critical for tropical karst catchment where relatively small watershed and highly porous soil make this natural resource highly susceptible and thus very sensitive to those changes in this study long term impacts of climate variability on groundwater recharge and discharge at oemau spring rote island indonesia were selected and investigated following calibration and validation of groundwater model using modflow code groundwater flow was simulated for the period of 2020 2090 under hadcm3 global climate model gcm scenarios using input data of weather variables downscaled by statistical downscaling model sdsm the reported analysis suggests that the sustainability of groundwater resources which was evaluated by assessing the ability of the spring to supply water demand from irrigation requirement and domestic consumption generally varies over the period and will be adversely affected by climate change during dry periods when the area is projected to variably experience supply shortage of around 29 67 l s as a result of 5 24 23 63 decrease of rainfall 2 48 24 57 reduction of recharge and 2 53 22 80 decrease of spring discharge under hadcm3 gcm scenarios a subsequent comprehensive set of management strategies as palliative and adaptive efforts was proposed to be implemented by relevant stakeholders to assist the community dealing with water deficit during the dry periods three main adaptive strategies namely socio cultural technical and ecological measures were proposed by incorporating physical and socio economic characteristics of the area this study presents a blueprint for assessing groundwater sustainability under climate change scenarios and developing tailored management strategies to cope with adverse impacts of climate change which may become fundamental guidelines across other karst islands in the future keywords climate change groundwater sustainability management strategies tropical karst island indonesia 1 introduction groundwater in karst area characterised by secondary drainage system of soluble carbonate rocks is notably important to sustain the living of approximately 20 25 of world population as suggested by ford and williams 2007 karst landscapes which cover around 7 12 of the earth s land surface drew 1999 are in particularly important and were considered to be more prone to adverse impacts of climate change due to insignificant watershed size in addition to the absence of continuous supply of surface water due to porous soil and increasing water consumption due to population growth white and falkland 2011 compared to other non granular soil type groundwater flow travelling faster in karst environment through its extensive heterogeneity of porous nature of soil dictated by larger matrix and secondary porosity e g fissures channels conduits fractures and sinkholes therefore karst landscapes whose system is governed by either diffuse laminar or conduit turbulent flow in both autogenic and allogenic karst kiraly 1998 shuster and white 1971 are highly susceptible to environmental stresses such as soil and water contamination schiperski et al 2015 vallejos et al 2015 du preez et al 2016 prolonged drought due to limited precipitation steiakakis et al 2016 and seawater intrusion bonacci and roje bonacci 1997 menning et al 2015 rote island situated in indonesia archipelago is not immune to potential negative impact of climate change particularly on freshwater availability the island geologically characterised by carbonate formations is already under high pressure by increasing number of population due to migration as a result of decentralisation policy in indonesia klaas and imteaz 2016 hydro climatological change and discharge rate alteration at oemau spring a sole water supplier to the capital and nearby agriculture farmlands were observed klaas et al 2017a b on regional scale hydro climatological impacts attributed to climate change such as spatial and seasonal changing of regional rainfall patterns and temperature trends portmann et al 2009 shiu et al 2012 and prolonged drought hisdal et al 2001 kruse and eslamian 2017 could threaten the ability of groundwater resources in karst islands to continuously provide freshwater for the community several studies loáiciga et al 2000 žganec 2012 dirnböck et al 2016 liu et al 2016 have shown that karst areas are highly susceptible to climate change related stressors consequently evaluation of the impact climate change on the sustainability of groundwater in small karst island is important to serve as a robust basis for developing recommendation towards water security for the community assessment of the magnitude and temporal components of the climate change impacts on the sustainability of groundwater resources in tropical karst island in different regions of the world have been addressed by numerous authors using various methodologies swat models arnold et al 1998 were employed by nikolaidis et al 2013 and leta et al 2017 for crete island greece and nuuanu area watersheds oahu hawaii respectively five climate models echam5 bca racmo2 rca and remo were used in the first study while the later exercised two scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 sutra models voss and provost 2003 were utilised by bailey et al 2014 and mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 for atoll islands maldives and kish island iran respectively while chenda and bailey 2017 incorporated 26 global circulation models gcms to determine impacts of climate change on groundwater availability on atoll islands of maldives bryan et al 2016 applied a combination of phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 a hydrogeochemical code and isotopic analyses for rottnest island australia whereas kanakoudis et al 2017 applied a tailored risk assessment rra method and three regional circulation models rcms of regcm3 aladin and promes on corfu island greece however none of the mentioned studies have proposed a comprehensive set of management strategies as palliative and adaptive efforts to climate change sequentially after investigating the effects of climate change on spring discharge in a small karst island and their implications on the sustainability of freshwater resources hence there is an exigency to develop tailored management strategies to carefully manage groundwater resources and ensure their sustainability in the future while taking into consideration the increasing and variability of stresses from regional stressors such as population growth and agricultural demands the mitigating plans are designed based on the model of potential climatic variability over the long term evaluation of the physical functionality of the sub surface system in the area in term of spring discharge and incorporation of local socio economic characteristics considering the current situation and taking into account the aforementioned remarks the aims of this study are 1 to calibrate and validate a physically based groundwater model for the catchment area of oemau spring in rote island indonesia 2 to generate a dataset of climate variables rainfall and temperature using statistical downscaling technique sdsm for the projected period of 2010 2020 as an input data for simulating groundwater model for the future years 3 to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources under two hadcm3 gcm scenarios and 4 to propose regional tailored management strategies to adapt to climate change and to mitigate its adverse impacts in term of water deficit 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 locality and topography the study area is the catchment of oemau spring cos lying between latitudes 10 46 42 17 s 10 43 36 91 s and longitudes 123 3 14 84 e 123 9 17 64 e and situated in rote island indonesia fig 1 having a drainage area of 20 11 km2 oemau spring is domestically and culturally significant for the community living around it fig 2 a water from the spring is essentially used for agriculture purposes irrigating paddy oryza sativa rice farms downstream fig 2b and domestic water supply for around 1400 inhabitants of ba a municipality located around 3 km from the spring bps 2016 the forest mainly situated next to the spring and intermittent stream is considered sacred by the local community as its social economic and cultural values manifest in various aspects of the local community s livelihood living klaas 2008 cos is covered by four main land use covers i e savanna grass bush plantation rain fed farm and settlements fig 2c topographically surface elevation varies highly from 98 m to 340 above sea level areas of low and medium slopes 10 dominates the downstream part 89 in where the settlements and rice paddies are situated klaas and imteaz 2017 2 1 2 hydro climate characteristics the average annual precipitation in the area is between 1000 and 2300 mm characterising monsoonal season of two distinct periods dry may november and wet december april in wet periods the humidity increases to over 90 and gradually falls to around 75 in dry period average temperature varies moderately throughout the year with the lowest temperature of around 25 c in august and the highest of about 32 c in november recorded temperature and precipitation data of over 31 years 1982 2015 from lekunik station located within the catchment of the spring has shown a shift of hydro climatological variables with an increasing trend of temperature 0 06 and rainfall 0 15 observed during the period 2 1 3 hydrogeological setting geologically cos is dominated by carbonate formations featuring a karst landscape the catchment under study is covered by unconfined holocene permeable coralline limestones 63 93 bobonaro formation 27 83 consisting of a mixture of carbonate rocks and scaly clay covers the middle area the alluvium sediments 8 25 patchily cover the areas around the stream holocene carbonate formations which was developed in a much younger period than that of other karst regions in indonesia such as miocene gunung sewu kegelkarst in java island haryono and day 2004 and miocene maros karst in sulawesi island arsyad et al 2015 is typified by low degree of karstification i e less developed secondary drainage and porosity as evident by petrologic studies in the study area harris 2011 fig 2d shows representative carbonate soil stratum characterised by extensive coralline limestone layer and thin top soils 0 30 m in the study area visual examination during field study confirms an inexistence of mature karst morphology i e underground cave river and major sinkholes analyses of bore samples at three locations within the catchment and five pumping sites nearby the catchments verifies a domination of homogenous carbonate layers in the study area pat 1992 a comparable analytical analysis using modified boussinesq approach of recession curve malik 2015 confirmed a typical eogenetic karst characterised by under developed conduits and low karstification degree vacher and mylroie 2002 based on analysis of temporal discharge data at oemau spring klaas et al 2017c as shown in fig 3 a further analysis on discharge timeseries data shows that the spring produces a smooth and less structured hydrograph fig 3b suggesting a diffuse infiltration characterised by less developed and interconnected karst network bonacci 1993 white 2002 fig 3b shows that in general the spring discharge is correlated to rainfall intensity and period the rising limb of spring discharge begins from january to peak on middle april parallel to intensive rainfall which provide sufficient recharge into the aquifer during the period the discharge starts to decline right after the dry season begins characterised by a period of no rainfall middle may to november the curve immediately begins to rise on december following intensified rainfall events on november an indicative recharge discharge time lag of around one month as displayed between the rainfall peak and curve crest from fig 3b signifies that the aquifer is primarily not controlled by quick flow gunn 1986 padilla et al 1994 2 1 4 present and anticipated groundwater resources and management rote island has been experienced a substantial demographic change since 2002 when government at regional level became more financially and legislatively independent as a result of decentralization policy implemented over indonesia the change which results in increased population corresponds to rapid land use change for settlement in the expense of about 4 of the total area of bush grass forest and plantation in the recharge area of the oemau spring occurred klaas et al 2017d considered sacred due to its social and economic functions this karst spring is the most important source of drinking water for the capital and irrigation for the rice paddy farms downstream klaas 2008 between the period 2002 2012 a 2 61 decrease of total water supply in the capital was reported due to a decrease in the flow rate of the springs in spite of 8 32 increase of customers during the same period klaas and imteaz 2016 the change of climatic characteristics in rote island apparently can alter the recharge pattern of the hydrological system of the oemau spring resulting in potential change of spring discharge in the future furthermore increased evapotranspiration due to temperature rise can increase irrigation water requirement thus it gives additional stress in addition to increased water demand for domestic purpose due to projected population growth and possible lifestyle change during the dry periods of the year 2 2 downscaling input data 2 2 1 local observed climatic data predictands data series of four meteorological elements i e daily precipitation and minimum average and maximum temperatures referred as weather model variables wmvs were obtained from lekunik station located in the middle of cos the station has consistent data series from 1982 to the present wmvs were chosen to feed the hargreaves equation applied in the recharge calculation explained in section 2 3 2 the dataset has been controlled and checked for missing values and consistency to ensure random error free and correct input data for the calibration purpose the first 17 years 1982 1998 data series as predictands to calibrate the sdsm model and the subsequent 17 years 1999 2015 for calibrating the model were used fig 4 shows the hydro meteorological data used as predictands in sdsm for the period 1982 2015 2 2 2 large scale atmospheric variables predictors atmospheric variables predictors input were extracted from the canadian climate change scenarios network cccsn reanalysis large scale dataset from the national center for environmental prediction ncep kalnay et al 1996 were derived for the calibration and validation steps of the sdsm model for the climate scenario periods the modelled predictor input was obtained from the hadcm3 hadley centre coupled model ver 3 a hybrid of atmosphere ocean gcm pope et al 2000 hadcm3 model was used mainly due its proficiency in incorporating dynamical and physical processes that governs weather and climate and its accessibility and successful application over areas adjacent to the study area martin et al 2000 inness et al 2003 ringer et al 2006 lasco and boer 2006 lachlan cope et al 2007 kirono et al 2016 loh et al 2016 mcgregor et al 2016 although the model application is questionable due to error on mean sea level pressure around antartica lachlan cope et al 2007 and relatively coarse horizontal grid resolution of 2 5 hadcm3 model has been extensively used for different application in different region in the world attributable to its ability in providing robust and realistic simulation signified with low prediction error for some substantial global variables i e ocean surface temperature and wind stress field gordon et al 2000 megann et al 2010 in the dataset potential predictors from 26 variables are available to be chosen from the corresponding grid for the study area at a 2 5 longitude 3 75 latitude horizontal resolution and 19 vertical levels using a hybrid vertical co ordinate in 30 minute time step gordon et al 2000 covering historical time series data from 1961 to 2001 ncep re analysis data and 1961 2099 hadcm3 gcm data to simulate future climate projection for the period 2020 2090 two scenarios were adopted h3a2a and h3b2a established by the special report on emission scenarios sres ipcc 2007 the two scenarios were forced with a2 and b2 emission scenarios respectively and selected to represent current demographic and development characteristics of the study area a2 for continuous population and economic growths and b2 for a slower population growth and moderate level of economic development houghton et al 2001 the predictor dataset was downloaded from http www cccsn ec gc ca page pred hadcm3 parameters used in the climate model are presented in table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 downscaling of climate variables although gcms are capable of globally simulating potential response of climate to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions the outputs from gcm simulations at local scale oftentimes unrealistic due to uncertainty range of regional projections inherited from its coarse resolution which limits its ability to resolve reduced scale climate features due to hadcm3 s coarse resolution which restricts its ability to spatially acquire regional climate dynamic at a finer scale sdsm ver 4 2 wilby et al 2002 a composite of multi linear regression technique and stochastic weather generator was employed for downscaling climate variables sdsm is a freely available tool that mainly assist modellers to significantly reduce projection resolution of gcms weather data for local or regional modelling purposes by extracting statistical parameters from observed data series several routines i e input data examination screening of predictors generation of weather variables calibration and validation and weather generation for future projections were sequentially involved in the overall downscaling procedure wilby and dawson 2007 overall the objective of the procedure is to assess the suitability of the downscaled dataset for climate scenario purpose by analysing statistical correlation between local observed climatic data predictands and historical large scale atmospheric variables predictors wilby et al 2002 following input data quality control all atmospheric predictors from the ncep re analysis large scale dataset were assessed but only a few were selected as the most suitable predictors using a combination of partial correlation coefficients p 0 05 histograms and scatter plots as suggested by khan et al 2006 and wilby et al 2004 the selected atmospheric predictors were then paired with the predictands in the calibration step to establish statistical relationships and construct synthetic downscaled weather series of the wmvs for the period 1982 1991 using ordinary least square optimization method upon obtaining satisfactory results in the calibration step the wmvs were then modelled for the period of 1992 2001 in the validation step in this step a comparison between the mean of the ensemble simulations and observed values of the wmvs for the equivalent period was then performed having obtained a statistically acceptable calibrated and validated result the downscaled dataset of the wmvs was modelled in the scenario generator using the hadcm3 gcm predictor variables for the h3a2a and h3b2a climate scenarios the generated meteorological timeseries were the inputs for the groundwater simulations to establish forecasted discharge for period 2020 2090 as explained in sections 2 3 2 and 3 3 2 3 2 groundwater model development and analysis selection of sub surface hydrogeological characteristics is conceptually important in order to accurately represent the behaviour of groundwater flow in groundwater models in our study based the examinations on geological period karstification degree bore sample hydraulic properties spring hydrograph and visual field assessment as explained in section 2 1 3 a conceptual model consisting of one horizontal layer which assumes a continuum representation of unconfined carbonate aquifer was employed this rather modest representation is methodically compliant to the dominant eogenetic carbonate aquifer in the geologic stratum and assumed diffuse flow application of continuum approach on unconfined system however poses limitation as it would not represent potential conduit or preferential flow and spatial subsurface heterogeneity painter et al 2008 however the assumed generalization is adequate in study area with relatively low hydraulic gradients and large storage ford and williams 2007 moreover to offset the simplification of using single layer unconfined aquifer incorporate parameter values from local field investigation and thus increase model accuracy voss 2011 a geostatistical tool parameter estimation pest method doherty 2004 was carried using a detailed spatial rendering and optimisation of the values of sub surface properties in this method the pilot point method ppm was used by dispersing a number of pilot points onto which the values of the hydraulic properties were estimated de marsily 1984 a superposition principle of kriging was employed in ppm to accommodate variability of subsurface properties between pilot points by interpolating distributed values between points using the geostatistical software library gslib routine deutsch and journel 1992 the implementation of ppm was due to its robust ability to accommodate heterogeneity into a continuum domain zhou et al 2014 capability in include prior and expert knowledge doherty 2003 and producing a coherently smooth transition of aquifer properties enhance the representation of the model domain christensen and doherty 2008 in performing pest pcg2 preconditioned conjugate gradient 2 hill 1990 was utilised to efficiently increase iterative calculation tikhonov regularisation doherty 2003 and value decomposition svd doherty 2004 were applied to stabilise the mathematical approximation the groundwater flow under both steady state and transient conditions was simulated using modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 the code was run and visualised within the groundwater modelling system gms ver 9 2 9 byu 2014 using finite different method modflow solves the following equation for three dimensional groundwater flow through an unconfined porous medium 1 x k x h h x y k y h h y z k z h h z w s y h t where kx y z is the hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinates m day w is the volumetric flux that represents sources or sinks of water l s h is the hydraulic head m s y is the specific yield and x y and z are coordinate directions and t is time d the model domain was discretised in the layer property flow package lpf harbaugh 2005 resulting in 201 139 active cells 530 rows and 1050 columns in a homogenous horizontal model of 10 m 10 m grid cells fig 5 b this refined grid resolution together with ppm method in the pest application as explained above was chosen to offset the limitation of continuum approach for model domain and thus to improve model performance given the fact that smaller grid cells would likely to increase model accuracy painter et al 2008 klaas et al 2017a a no flow boundary along the catchment boundary was defined using arcgis esri 1999 and 2 m resolution digital elevation model dem data provided by the local bureau of regional spatial planning and development bappeda 2009 fig 5a a specified head boundary dirichlet using time variant specified head chd harbaugh et al 2000 was assigned to the stream downstream of the oemau spring to simulate the drains on the aquifer within the model domain the drain package drn harbaugh et al 2000 was applied see fig 5a for the drainage network the drain conductance of the streams was assigned accordingly between 2 700 and 8 125 m day with respect to the stream dimension and hydraulic conductivity values derived from local pumping test analysis using the boulton method boulton 1963 the recharge package rch harbaugh et al 2000 was used to model recharge process which was mainly characterised by atmospheric stresses i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and the surface i e land use type water balance method bras 1990 was employed to calculate the net recharge values assigned to each land use zone shown in fig 5c surface runoff component was estimated using the scs cn viessman and lewis 2003 to calculate potential evapotranspiration modified hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 hargreaves 1994 droogers and allen 2002 was applied aiming to reduce total head residual in the transient simulation and assist a smooth model convergence knowling et al 2015 steady state simulation was initially performed the highest recharge of the period and the corresponding observed heads at the seven observation wells were used as initial inputs in the steady state simulation values of horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h were calibrated and then used as initial values for transient simulation woessner and anderson 1992 in the transient simulation the model was calibrated and validated each for the period of eight months with each comprising of 10 time steps using observed data from january 2010 to april 2011 considering the typical tropical hydrograph of the study area with of one crest and one recession a periodic cycle aldrian and susanto 2003 the distinct response of spring discharge to rainfall event represented by a one month recharge discharge time lag as explained in section 2 1 3 and the less inaccessibility of study area the sixteen month groundwater simulation period is considered sufficient to accommodate the overall karst spring hydrogeologic regimes atmosphere subsurface connectivity and hence the groundwater flow in the area in the calibration and validation steps the values of subsurface properties k h and sy the pilot points were calibrated and spatially distributed using 1000x1000 m grid across the model domain using a distance area ratio of 0 05 as suggested by klaas and imteaz 2017 to avoid model overfitting fienen et al 2009 klaas et al 2017e f prior information of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield values at three pumping test locations within the catchment were pat 1992 used as preferred values resulting in a total of 26 pilot points the k h values were assigned to range between 0 1 and 250 m day to accommodate the analysis of bore samples at three locations within oemau catchment and five other pumping test locations adjacent to the catchment pat 1992 1995 and represent karst limestone davis 1969 freeze and cherry 1979 vertical anisotropy of 0 2 and a constant value of 0 3 was assigned for the porosity to represent the carbonate formations johnson 1967 it is to note here that the parameterisation methodologies used in this study are essentially similar with those applied in the previous studies on the same study area klaas and imteaz 2016 klaas et al 2018a d 2019 except for the grid cell size and number of pilot points which are different in the current model parameters used in the groundwater model are presented in table 1 2 3 3 model evaluation criteria both

estimated water demand during the projected period of 2020 2090 total water demand is reflected by two main consumptions i e domestic usage and regional gross irrigation demand for domestic usage the average water requirement per capita of 50 l c d proposed by gleick 1996 for the households in rural developing countries situated in tropical climatic zone was used this amount covers basic domestic consumption i e drinking bathing sanitation and food preparation to anticipate population growth during the relevant period the water requirement for the corresponding year was calculated over the projected population using surveyed population number in 2015 as the baseline and intermediary 4 increase rate as suggested by bps 2016 water requirement for irrigation was estimated based on current agricultural practice in the study area in where dry field paddy is the main crop cultivated by local farmers employing traditional farming system agricultural water demand was calculated based on total irrigation water requirement for paddy irrigation or net farm requirement nfr per acreage recommended by indonesian public work ministry spi 1986 by considering irrigation system type of crop

the wmvs in general the models both in calibration and validation simulation were considered statistically satisfactory with r 2 ranges from 0 57 to 0 91 the simulated values of the wmvs reasonably well replicated the observed values indicated with nse varying between 0 55 and 0 84 the value range falls to satisfactory very good categories 0 50 nse 1 00 according to the model criteria by moriasi et al 2007 which indicate a good simulation achievement overall sdsm produced a reasonably well calibrated and validated statistical models with the simulations closely follow the cycle of observed rainfall although monsoonal precipitation in particular was slightly overestimated with the simulated mean 4 49 mm month compared to an observed mean of 4 26 mm month mb 6 82 mm month for the calibration period and simulated mean of 4 74 mm day contrasted to 4 61 mm day of observed mean mb 3 94 mm month similar results of rainfall overestimations are also observed for adjacent islands i e sumbawa located around 600 km from rote island mcgregor et al 2016 the misfit is expected as the change of atmospheric variability in terms of precipitation over indonesia was concluded in the hadcm3 due to changes of convection over south china sea the philippines and western pacific martin et al 2000 ringer et al 2006 sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the winter tropics lachlan cope et al 2007 and increased evaporation and moisture transport over the southern tropical indian ocean bosmans et al 2018 as a result significant influence occurs on the precipitation climatology of hadcm3 resulting in excessive precipitation and earlier inception time compared to the observations mitchell et al 1987 inness et al 2003 3 1 2 projection of future climate scenarios fig 7 presents timeseries of the projections of the wmvs using the calibrated and validated sdsm models for h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios each scenario was generated for future time horizons from 2020 to 2090 in general although having a volatile tendency rainfalls display minor increasing trends an increase of 0 14 and 0 09 under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively over the study period during wet season rainfall is projected to rise by 45 53 mm month under the h3a2a scenario and 37 59 mm month under the h3b2a scenario rainfalls in dry season are also predicted to increase by 9 67 mm month and 1 19 mm month under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively fig 7 shows distinct trends occurring in three distinguishable time horizons 2020 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2090 the annual rainfall declines for the first period of 2020 2059 and third period 2080 2090 while an increasing trend occurs in the second period 2060 2079 in the first period decreases 5 24 and 8 01 are anticipated under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively in the second period 2060 2079 considerable increasing trends of 26 13 and 17 81 is projected for h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively the figure suggests declines of 25 1 and 23 63 under the h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively in the third period 2080 2089 the observed time horizons are comparably consistent with the trend of projected rainfall timeseries for nearby sumbawa island under hadcm3 csiro mk 3 5 and microc m scenarios kirono et al 2016 in all scenarios tmax and tavg were modelled to gradually increase in all time periods increases of 2 16 1 90 c or 0 027 c annually and 1 89 1 35 c or 0 019 c annually of tmax are expected under the h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively for the period 2020 2090 tavg are forecasted to increase 1 05 1 08 c or 0 015 c annually for h3a2a scenario and 1 59 0 81 c or 0 011 c annually under h3b2a scenario in contrast tmin are foreseeable to decrease 0 73 0 20 c or 0 003 c annually and 0 76 0 14 c or 0 002 c annually under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively our results are comparably similar with other study by lasco and boer 2006 whose models projected annual tavg increases of 0 021 c and 0 034 c over indonesia under sres a1f1 and b2 scenarios respectively 3 2 groundwater model calibration and validation the result of groundwater simulation to calibrate and validate the groundwater model is presented in fig 8 the model performances in the steady state simulation is considered satisfactory represented by mae and rsme of 0 42 and 0 52 m respectively in the simulation a well calibrated model is achieved indicated by the direction of groundwater flow which confirms the predefined flow direction domenico and schwartz 1998 fig 8a shows the distribution of hydraulic heads in the steady state calibration in the transient simulation the k h and sy values were estimated and their values are shown in fig 8b and 8c the graphical fitting of observed and simulated heads at seven observation wells in the calibration and validation steps are presented in fig 8d in the hydrograph although the observed heads were slightly underestimated particularly during the dry months relatively good matches between observed and simulated heads were found in the transient simulations in the calibration period rmse value of 0 26 m and mae value of 0 17 m were attained while the values in the validation step are 0 27 m and 0 18 m correspondingly in spite of model underperformance noticeably during low flow in the validation period the groundwater model was reasonably well fit and the error statistics of the model are considered small confirming that the model is capable of reproducing hydraulic heads to a satisfactory level 3 3 assessment of groundwater resources under hadcm3 gcm scenarios 3 3 1 impact of climate change on groundwater resources sustainability the sustainability of groundwater resources in the study area was assessed based on the ability of the spring to continuously supply water and meet agriculture and domestic water demands for the future period of 2020 2090 the calibrated and validated groundwater model presented in section 3 2 was employed to simulate transient groundwater flows over the catchment for the period of 2020 2090 the atmospheric input for the groundwater model was derived from wmvs generated by sdsm under the h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios the objective of the groundwater simulation was to determine the effect of downscaled wmvs on the magnitude of the discharges at the spring from the recharge over the catchment in the projected period table 5 displays the change of simulated recharge corresponding to the precipitation change for the relevant periods and scenarios fig 9 shows the projected discharge monthly timeseries of oemau spring resulted from the simulated groundwater model under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios overall the changes of both recharge and spring discharge proportionally reflects the over time variations of the downscaled weather variables the result shows that a decrease of 5 24 precipitation results in 2 48 reduction of recharge for the period 2020 2059 under h3a2a scenario while 17 81 rise in precipitation during 2060 2079 brings a 12 85 increase in recharge for the same period and scenario consequently the reduced recharge into the karst aquifer results in decline of spring discharge of oemau spring by 2 53 fig 9b in the same period a similar trend is shown for the groundwater simulation under the h3b2a scenario in this scenario spring discharge is projected to decrease by 5 19 as a result of 5 35 reduction of recharge due to 8 01 drop of rainfall over the period decreases of spring discharges of 22 80 and 20 70 are also anticipated under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively for the third period 2080 2090 in which recharge is simulated to decrease by 24 57 and 21 88 for the corresponding scenario meanwhile the catchment is projected to experience a considerable recharge increase in the second period 2060 2079 under the two hadcm3 gcm scenarios resulting in 14 41 and 15 04 increase of discharges at oemau spring fig 10 shows the result of assessment of the groundwater sustainability it graphically presents the temporal variation of spring discharge superimposed by the total water demand as a cumulation of domestic water usage red bars and regional gross irrigation demand green bars overall the figure shows that until the end of the century irrigation will be the most influential stressor for consumptive water use in the area given that foreseeably domestic consumption has much less effect on the sustainability of groundwater resources when compared with irrigation water demand with a 4 population growth assumed during the period number of populations will reach around 25 000 at 2090 adding to a total around 3 66 14 63 l s of agriculture demand table 6 summarises water supply demand balance calculation for oemau spring under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios under h3a2a scenario during the period of 2020 2046 the spring is capable of fulfilling the total projected water demand for the area with an average surplus of 52 84 l s the wet years indicated with water surplus begin again from 2071 to 2079 when for average there is 68 12 l s oversupply however for 24 years 2047 2070 having a 66 74 l s deficit in balance the ability of spring to supply water is at great risk these dry periods are characterised by decrease of rainfall and significant rise in water demand for irrigation due to increased evapotranspiration another period with shortage in water supply is projected to occur at the period before the next century 2080 2090 with an average of 28 84 l s deficit in water supply demand balance the same trend is projected to occur under h3b2a scenario although the severity degree of dry periods is relatively less than that under h3a2a the area is expected to experience a much longer period of wet years 31 years from 2020 with a 58 34 l s water surplus followed by 20 years of water supply shortfall from the spring 40 51 l s wet years begins again from 2071 to 2077 with a 62 09 l s oversupply before another 13 years of water deficit from 2070 to 2090 39 84 l s 3 3 2 proposed management strategies maintaining a continuous water security over time is vital to ensure sufficient water provision for the community nevertheless given the assessment result on the groundwater resources sustainability for oemau karst spring it is concluded that under both h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios the total water demand in the study area is not met in the two projected periods as presented in table 6 in the dry periods mainly around 2050 s 2060 s and 2080 s anticipated water demand principally from irrigation requirement well surpasses modelled spring discharge by around 29 67 l s or 10 24 of the average discharge from january 2011 april 2012 observed at oemau spring klaas et al 2017a decreased spring capacity in supplying water due to reduced precipitation and discharge over the catchment and increased irrigation water demand as a result of increased water evapotranspiration in these periods would apparently threaten the community that depends entirely on the water provision from the spring therefore water security is at stake in these periods in order to cope with the future alarming situation several management strategies are proposed in this study table 7 presents three main tailored management strategies namely socio cultural technical and ecological measures that can be implemented by the local authorities and community scale of priority and time urgency were assigned on each measure to guide all stakeholders in the design and implementation steps the strategies were selected mainly by incorporating local resources in terms of physical and social characteristics initial important measures include steps to empower and prepare the community i e strengthening indigenous water body and awareness campaign to cope with the projected water provision deficit due to climate changes existing water organisation known as mamar with the manaholo acting as the main administrator and guard of the forest encircling the spring is an important social institution in rotenese society that predominantly deals with forest protection and water management from the karst spring strengthening indigenous water organisation is considered high in both priority and time scale necessity because the existing local water organisation could lead and develop society s behaviour towards water conservation through environment friendly agriculture and livestock practices klaas 2008 accompanied by awareness raising through regional campaign on climate change socio cultural measures bound the community to collectively prepare themselves to the worst projected scenarios given the result of the water demand analysis and the discharge response of the spring to the projected climate change reducing irrigation requirement by cutting off water consumption is the utmost and imperative approach in relieving water stress due to shortage of water supply among irrigation practises whose consumptive use accounts for 90 of total groundwater resources worldwide shiklomanov and rodda 2003 paddy rice production is well known as the high water eater crop due to the nature of its system that requires prolonged and maintained soil moisture which evidently leaves an immense water footprint hoekstra and chapagain 2008 hoekstra et al 2009 therefore in this study several technical measures including optimising agriculture system and upgrading irritation canals were proposed to reduce actual irrigation requirement farmers can benefit from cultivating other crop than paddy in a sequence within a year applying crop rotation and substitution has demonstrated a positive impact both on reducing water consumption and increasing field yield of paddy kamoshita et al 2007 sujono 2012 xu et al 2016 considering monsoonal rainfall opting less water consumptive yet sizeably profitable crop such as maize zea mays peanut arachis hypogaea and snake bean vigna unguiculata subsp sesquipedalis in a diversification scheme during the dry periods can significantly lessen spring s burden thus improving water security however considering drawbacks of crop rotation application in sulawesi island northern part of indonesia where the cropping systems has resulted in damaging soil structure cass et al 1994 future studies are needed to understand how these crops can be orderly combined after or before rice harvesting period and most importantly to determine their appropriateness and sustainability in terms of impacts on local soil properties adopting water saving rice cultivation such as system of rice intensification sri is one way to significantly save water in several countries compared to the conventional practices this method is confirmed to reduce irrigation requirement by 25 70 and greenhouse gas ghg emissions by around 28 70 while attaining farm productivity increase by 50 300 satyanarayana et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 sharif 2011 jain et al 2014 choi et al 2014 in indonesia it proved to be successfully applied in eastern part of indonesia with 40 water saving cut of production cost by more than 25 mainly from reduced fertiliser application and margin profit rise of more than five times more than water extensive traditional rice farm method sato 2006 hasan and sato 2007 therefore subject to providing a recommended preliminary systematic investigation on how it fits with the local soil and climate characteristics immediate application of sri water management methods could greatly mitigate the severity of water deficit during the dry periods in the study area a combination of reforestation and afforestation can be implemented as an adaptive measure to reduce climate change risk by improving hydrological conditions upstream these measures would not only increase long term recharge capacity of cos and improve micro climate but will also offer other vital functions i e economic sustenance biodiversity conservation rural development livelihood security enhancement and employment generation non wood forest productivity can be increased by planting some local acclimated plants such as coconut cocos nucifera betel palm areca catechu mango mangifera banana musaceae betel piper betle kapuk randu ceiba pentandra lontar borassus flabellifer and kahembi schleichera oleosa some of which have high social and economic values in the study area klaas 2008 4 conclusions this study aimed at assessing the sustainability of groundwater resource of oemau spring for the period from 2020 to 2090 using modflow in which groundwater flow was simulated using four downscaled weather model variables i e minimum average and maximum temperatures and precipitation the weather model variables were downscaled and generated using a stochastic weather generator sdsm the sustainability analysis was established on the basis of the capacity of the spring discharge to meet domestic and agricultural water demands applying sdsm the downscaling was performed based on statistical correlations established between data series of observed rainfalls as the predictands and selected ncep re analysis large scale atmospheric predictors although monsoonal precipitation was slightly overestimated statistically good fit atmospheric models were attained in the calibration 1982 1998 and validation 1982 1998 periods after having an acceptable calibration and validation results sdsm then generated timeseries of weather model variables using the hadcm3 gcm predictor variables under h3a2a and h3b2a climate scenarios projected for the period 2020 2090 the downscaled results of hadcm3 indicated that the rainfall and temperatures would likely to be affected by climate change overall the rainfall is projected to slightly increase by 0 14 and 0 09 under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively a gradual increase of 1 89 2 16 for tmax and 1 05 1 59 for tavg and a decrease of 0 73 0 76 for tmin were projected for all scenarios the generated meteorological weather variables timeseries were then input into the validated groundwater model to simulate the discharges for the period 2020 2090 the numerical groundwater model implemented within modflow code was accurately able to reproduce the general groundwater flow observed although the observed heads were slightly underestimated during the dry months considerably acceptable model performances were achieved during transient simulation indicated by small error statistics mae 0 17 0 18 m rmse 0 26 0 27 having a reasonably well fit model modflow simulated groundwater flow for the future period of 2020 2090 using the downscaled weather timeseries generated by sdsm the overall timeline was split into three periods i e 2020 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2090 to accommodate different projected rainfall trends in general both recharge and spring discharge proportionally respond to the variation of the downscaled weather variables for the period 2020 2059 under h3a2a scenario a 5 24 average decrease of rainfall results in 2 48 and 2 53 reduction of recharge and spring discharge respectively while a 14 41 increase of discharge at oemau spring is projected for the period 2060 2079 after having significant 26 13 and 18 63 rise in rainfall and recharge respectively under the same scenario declining trend of spring discharge is anticipated to occur from 2080 2090 with a 5 19 drop as a result of 5 35 reduction of recharge due to 8 01 reduction of rainfall over the period as expected a similar trend is revealed for the groundwater simulation under the h3b2a scenario with the spring expected to experience highest decrease in discharge in the period of 2080 2090 and increase in discharge of 15 04 in the period of 2060 2079 calculation of water demand in the area shows that domestic consumption has much less effect with a fraction 3 66 of the irrigation water demand at 2090 on the sustainability of groundwater resources the assessment result of the groundwater resources sustainability for 2020 2090 under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios reveals two periods of wet years characterised by average supply surplus and two periods of dry periods signified by deficit in water supply by oemau spring the area is projected to variably experience around 29 67 l s shortage in dry periods and 53 68 l s over supply in wet periods period of 2047 2070 is projected as the most prolonged deficit period with an average annual deficit of 66 74 l s for 24 years simulated under h3a2a scenario meanwhile having a 58 34 l s oversupply in 2020 2050 31 years the area would enjoy the longest surplus period in order to assist the community to deal with water deficit during the expected dry periods three main adaptive strategies namely socio cultural technical and ecological measures were proposed considering the scale of priority and time urgency for each measure all stakeholders including decision makers regional planner and community could implement the management strategies to adapt with the expected climate change and to mitigate adverse impacts of climate change in term of water deficit during the dry periods there are extensive literatures discussing groundwater assessment and evaluation for water supply in karst areas around the world using both or separately groundwater and climate models however little effort was endeavoured to add to the research essential components which are water management and recommendation as per the regional characteristics are considered compared to previous research in karst water quantification this study is considered novel as it provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to link the validated physical based hydrology and climate models and the assessment of the implication of climate and demographic variabilities on the sustainability of freshwater resources furthermore the study is able to address the ultimate question of water availability in the area under study based on supply demand analysis over a projected future timeseries using a statistical downscaled climate model before proposing groundwater resources management strategies the findings of this study can not only assist modellers to construct an integrated climate groundwater model but also provide practical guidelines for decision maker and relevant stakeholders to develop and implement a comprehensive set of management strategies as palliative and adaptive measures to assist the community dealing with water deficit during dry periods in general this study presents a blueprint for assessing groundwater sustainability under climate change scenarios and developing tailored management strategies to cope with adverse impacts of climate change which can become fundamental guidelines for other karst islands in the future concerning groundwater model and climate forcing the outcomes of this study are considered valid and representative for other areas having similar sub surface characteristics i e eogenetic karst and dominant diffuse flow system and hydro climate system i e monsoonal climate therefore the practical recommendation given in this study is considered representative of many karst terrains in islands under similar hydrogeology and climate regimes considering the integrated approach between physical based hydrology and climate models and water management methodology the methodologies employed in this study are considered applicable to any karst catchment with various complexity of climate and demographic functions however although the results presented here are promising it is worth emphasizing that supplementary studies are needed to address several research components beyond what is currently analysed given the scope of this study for further studies it is suggested to gain process based understanding of the effects of land use modification on magnitude and spatial distributions of recharge and discharge at spring proper incorporation of uncertainty analysis on both climate change and groundwater model is an additional worthy contribution to fully understand how the water sustainability can be secured in the study

5821,developing tailored management strategies to ensure the sustainability of groundwater resource under climatic and demographic changes is critical for tropical karst catchment where relatively small watershed and highly porous soil make this natural resource highly susceptible and thus very sensitive to those changes in this study long term impacts of climate variability on groundwater recharge and discharge at oemau spring rote island indonesia were selected and investigated following calibration and validation of groundwater model using modflow code groundwater flow was simulated for the period of 2020 2090 under hadcm3 global climate model gcm scenarios using input data of weather variables downscaled by statistical downscaling model sdsm the reported analysis suggests that the sustainability of groundwater resources which was evaluated by assessing the ability of the spring to supply water demand from irrigation requirement and domestic consumption generally varies over the period and will be adversely affected by climate change during dry periods when the area is projected to variably experience supply shortage of around 29 67 l s as a result of 5 24 23 63 decrease of rainfall 2 48 24 57 reduction of recharge and 2 53 22 80 decrease of spring discharge under hadcm3 gcm scenarios a subsequent comprehensive set of management strategies as palliative and adaptive efforts was proposed to be implemented by relevant stakeholders to assist the community dealing with water deficit during the dry periods three main adaptive strategies namely socio cultural technical and ecological measures were proposed by incorporating physical and socio economic characteristics of the area this study presents a blueprint for assessing groundwater sustainability under climate change scenarios and developing tailored management strategies to cope with adverse impacts of climate change which may become fundamental guidelines across other karst islands in the future keywords climate change groundwater sustainability management strategies tropical karst island indonesia 1 introduction groundwater in karst area characterised by secondary drainage system of soluble carbonate rocks is notably important to sustain the living of approximately 20 25 of world population as suggested by ford and williams 2007 karst landscapes which cover around 7 12 of the earth s land surface drew 1999 are in particularly important and were considered to be more prone to adverse impacts of climate change due to insignificant watershed size in addition to the absence of continuous supply of surface water due to porous soil and increasing water consumption due to population growth white and falkland 2011 compared to other non granular soil type groundwater flow travelling faster in karst environment through its extensive heterogeneity of porous nature of soil dictated by larger matrix and secondary porosity e g fissures channels conduits fractures and sinkholes therefore karst landscapes whose system is governed by either diffuse laminar or conduit turbulent flow in both autogenic and allogenic karst kiraly 1998 shuster and white 1971 are highly susceptible to environmental stresses such as soil and water contamination schiperski et al 2015 vallejos et al 2015 du preez et al 2016 prolonged drought due to limited precipitation steiakakis et al 2016 and seawater intrusion bonacci and roje bonacci 1997 menning et al 2015 rote island situated in indonesia archipelago is not immune to potential negative impact of climate change particularly on freshwater availability the island geologically characterised by carbonate formations is already under high pressure by increasing number of population due to migration as a result of decentralisation policy in indonesia klaas and imteaz 2016 hydro climatological change and discharge rate alteration at oemau spring a sole water supplier to the capital and nearby agriculture farmlands were observed klaas et al 2017a b on regional scale hydro climatological impacts attributed to climate change such as spatial and seasonal changing of regional rainfall patterns and temperature trends portmann et al 2009 shiu et al 2012 and prolonged drought hisdal et al 2001 kruse and eslamian 2017 could threaten the ability of groundwater resources in karst islands to continuously provide freshwater for the community several studies loáiciga et al 2000 žganec 2012 dirnböck et al 2016 liu et al 2016 have shown that karst areas are highly susceptible to climate change related stressors consequently evaluation of the impact climate change on the sustainability of groundwater in small karst island is important to serve as a robust basis for developing recommendation towards water security for the community assessment of the magnitude and temporal components of the climate change impacts on the sustainability of groundwater resources in tropical karst island in different regions of the world have been addressed by numerous authors using various methodologies swat models arnold et al 1998 were employed by nikolaidis et al 2013 and leta et al 2017 for crete island greece and nuuanu area watersheds oahu hawaii respectively five climate models echam5 bca racmo2 rca and remo were used in the first study while the later exercised two scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 sutra models voss and provost 2003 were utilised by bailey et al 2014 and mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 for atoll islands maldives and kish island iran respectively while chenda and bailey 2017 incorporated 26 global circulation models gcms to determine impacts of climate change on groundwater availability on atoll islands of maldives bryan et al 2016 applied a combination of phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 a hydrogeochemical code and isotopic analyses for rottnest island australia whereas kanakoudis et al 2017 applied a tailored risk assessment rra method and three regional circulation models rcms of regcm3 aladin and promes on corfu island greece however none of the mentioned studies have proposed a comprehensive set of management strategies as palliative and adaptive efforts to climate change sequentially after investigating the effects of climate change on spring discharge in a small karst island and their implications on the sustainability of freshwater resources hence there is an exigency to develop tailored management strategies to carefully manage groundwater resources and ensure their sustainability in the future while taking into consideration the increasing and variability of stresses from regional stressors such as population growth and agricultural demands the mitigating plans are designed based on the model of potential climatic variability over the long term evaluation of the physical functionality of the sub surface system in the area in term of spring discharge and incorporation of local socio economic characteristics considering the current situation and taking into account the aforementioned remarks the aims of this study are 1 to calibrate and validate a physically based groundwater model for the catchment area of oemau spring in rote island indonesia 2 to generate a dataset of climate variables rainfall and temperature using statistical downscaling technique sdsm for the projected period of 2010 2020 as an input data for simulating groundwater model for the future years 3 to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources under two hadcm3 gcm scenarios and 4 to propose regional tailored management strategies to adapt to climate change and to mitigate its adverse impacts in term of water deficit 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 locality and topography the study area is the catchment of oemau spring cos lying between latitudes

characterising monsoonal season of two distinct periods dry may november and wet december april in wet periods the humidity increases to over 90 and gradually falls to around 75 in dry period average temperature varies moderately throughout the year with the lowest temperature of around 25 c in august and the highest of about 32 c in november recorded temperature and precipitation data of over 31 years 1982 2015 from lekunik station located within the catchment of the spring has shown a shift of hydro climatological variables with an increasing trend of temperature 0 06 and rainfall 0 15

data at oemau spring klaas et al 2017c as shown in fig 3 a further analysis on discharge timeseries data shows that the spring produces a smooth and less structured hydrograph fig 3b suggesting a diffuse infiltration characterised by less developed and interconnected karst network bonacci 1993 white 2002 fig 3b shows that in general the spring discharge is correlated to rainfall intensity and period the rising limb of spring discharge begins from january to peak on middle april parallel to intensive rainfall which provide sufficient recharge into the aquifer during the period the discharge starts to decline right after the dry season begins characterised by a period of no rainfall middle may to november the curve immediately begins to rise on december following intensified rainfall events on november an indicative recharge discharge time lag of around one month as displayed between the rainfall peak and curve crest from fig 3b signifies that the aquifer is primarily not controlled by quick flow gunn 1986 padilla et al 1994 2 1 4 present and anticipated groundwater resources and management rote island has been experienced a substantial demographic change since 2002 when government at regional level became more financially and legislatively independent as a result of decentralization policy implemented over indonesia the change which results in increased population corresponds to rapid land use change for settlement in the expense of about 4 of the total area of bush grass forest and plantation in the recharge area of the oemau spring occurred klaas

downstream klaas 2008 between the period 2002 2012 a 2 61 decrease of total water supply in the capital was reported due to a decrease in the flow rate of the springs in spite of 8 32 increase of customers during the same period klaas and imteaz 2016 the change of climatic characteristics in rote island apparently can alter the recharge pattern of the hydrological system of the oemau spring resulting in potential change of spring discharge in the future furthermore increased evapotranspiration due to temperature rise can increase irrigation water requirement thus it gives additional stress in addition to increased water demand for domestic purpose due to projected population growth and possible lifestyle change during the dry periods of the year 2 2 downscaling input data 2 2 1 local observed climatic data predictands data series of four meteorological elements i e daily precipitation and minimum average and maximum temperatures referred as weather model variables wmvs were

study area a2 for continuous population and economic growths and b2 for a slower population growth and moderate level of economic development houghton et al 2001 the predictor dataset was downloaded from http www cccsn ec gc ca page pred hadcm3 parameters used in the climate model are presented in table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 downscaling of climate variables although gcms are capable of globally simulating potential response of climate to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions the outputs from gcm simulations at local scale oftentimes unrealistic due to uncertainty range of regional projections inherited from its coarse resolution which limits its ability to resolve reduced scale climate features due to hadcm3 s coarse resolution which restricts its ability to spatially acquire regional climate dynamic at a finer scale sdsm ver 4 2 wilby et al 2002 a composite of multi linear regression technique and stochastic weather generator was employed for downscaling climate variables sdsm is a freely available tool that mainly assist modellers to significantly reduce projection resolution of gcms weather data for local or regional modelling purposes by extracting statistical parameters from observed data series several routines i e input data examination screening of predictors generation of weather variables calibration and validation and weather generation for future projections were sequentially involved in the overall downscaling procedure wilby and dawson 2007 overall the objective of the procedure is to assess the suitability of the downscaled dataset for climate scenario purpose by analysing statistical correlation between local observed climatic data predictands and historical large scale atmospheric variables predictors wilby et al 2002 following input data quality control all atmospheric predictors from the ncep re analysis large scale dataset were assessed but only a few were selected as the most suitable predictors using a combination of partial correlation coefficients p 0 05 histograms and scatter plots as suggested by khan et al 2006 and wilby et al 2004 the selected atmospheric predictors were then paired with the predictands in the calibration step to establish statistical relationships and construct synthetic downscaled weather series of the wmvs for the period 1982 1991 using ordinary least square optimization method upon obtaining satisfactory results in the calibration step the wmvs were then modelled for the period of 1992 2001 in the validation step in this step a comparison between the mean of the ensemble simulations and observed values of the wmvs for the equivalent period was then performed having obtained a statistically acceptable calibrated and validated result the downscaled dataset of the wmvs was modelled in the scenario generator using the hadcm3 gcm predictor variables for the h3a2a and h3b2a climate scenarios the generated meteorological timeseries were the inputs for the groundwater simulations to establish forecasted discharge for period 2020 2090 as explained in sections 2 3 2 and 3 3 2 3 2 groundwater model development and analysis selection of sub surface hydrogeological characteristics is conceptually important in order to accurately represent the behaviour of groundwater flow in groundwater models in our study based the examinations on geological period karstification degree bore sample hydraulic properties spring hydrograph and visual field assessment as explained in section 2 1 3 a conceptual model consisting of one horizontal layer which assumes a continuum representation of unconfined carbonate aquifer was employed this rather modest representation is methodically compliant to the dominant eogenetic carbonate aquifer in the geologic stratum and assumed diffuse flow application of continuum approach on unconfined system however poses limitation as it would not represent potential conduit or preferential flow and spatial subsurface heterogeneity painter et al 2008 however the assumed generalization is adequate in study area with relatively low hydraulic gradients and large storage ford and williams 2007 moreover to offset the simplification of using single layer unconfined aquifer incorporate parameter values from local field investigation and thus increase model accuracy voss 2011 a geostatistical tool parameter estimation pest method doherty 2004 was carried using a detailed spatial rendering and optimisation of the values of sub surface properties in this method the pilot point method ppm was used by dispersing a number of pilot points onto which the values of the hydraulic properties were estimated de marsily 1984 a superposition principle of kriging was employed in ppm to accommodate variability of subsurface properties between pilot points by interpolating distributed values between points using the geostatistical software library gslib routine deutsch and journel 1992 the implementation of ppm was due to its robust ability to accommodate heterogeneity into a continuum domain zhou et al 2014 capability in include prior and expert knowledge doherty 2003 and producing a coherently smooth transition of aquifer properties enhance the representation of the model domain christensen and doherty 2008 in performing pest pcg2 preconditioned conjugate gradient 2 hill 1990 was utilised to efficiently increase iterative calculation tikhonov regularisation doherty 2003 and value decomposition svd doherty 2004 were applied to stabilise the mathematical approximation the groundwater flow under both steady state and transient conditions was simulated using modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 the code was run and visualised within the groundwater modelling system gms ver 9 2 9 byu 2014 using finite different method modflow solves the following equation for three dimensional groundwater flow through an unconfined porous medium 1 x k x h h x y k y h h y z k z h h z w s y h t where kx y z is the hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinates m day w is the volumetric flux that represents sources or sinks of water l s h is the hydraulic head m s y is the specific yield and x y and z are coordinate directions and t is time d the model domain was discretised in the layer property flow package lpf harbaugh 2005 resulting in 201 139 active cells 530 rows and 1050 columns in a homogenous horizontal model of 10 m 10 m grid cells fig 5 b this refined grid resolution together with ppm method in the pest application as explained above was chosen to offset the limitation of continuum approach for model domain and thus to improve model performance given the fact that smaller grid cells would likely to increase model accuracy painter et al 2008 klaas et al 2017a a no flow boundary along the catchment boundary was defined using arcgis esri 1999 and 2 m resolution digital elevation model dem data provided by the local bureau of regional spatial planning and development bappeda 2009 fig 5a a specified head boundary dirichlet using time variant specified head chd harbaugh et al 2000 was assigned to the stream downstream of the oemau spring to simulate the drains on the aquifer within the model domain the drain package drn harbaugh et al 2000 was applied see fig 5a for the drainage network the drain conductance of the streams was assigned accordingly between 2 700 and 8 125 m day with respect to the stream dimension and hydraulic conductivity values derived from local pumping test analysis using the boulton method boulton 1963 the recharge package rch harbaugh et al 2000 was used to model recharge process which was mainly characterised by atmospheric stresses i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and the surface i e land use type water balance method bras 1990 was employed to calculate the net recharge values assigned to each land use zone shown in fig 5c surface runoff component was estimated using the scs cn viessman and lewis 2003 to calculate potential evapotranspiration modified hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 hargreaves 1994 droogers and allen 2002 was applied aiming to reduce total head residual in the transient simulation and assist a smooth model convergence knowling et al 2015 steady state simulation was initially performed the highest recharge of the period and the corresponding observed heads at the seven observation wells were used as initial inputs in the steady state simulation values of horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h were calibrated and then used as initial values for transient simulation woessner and anderson 1992 in the transient simulation the model was calibrated and validated each for the period of eight months with each comprising of 10 time steps using observed data from january 2010 to april 2011 considering the typical tropical hydrograph of the study area with of one crest and one recession a periodic cycle aldrian and susanto 2003 the distinct response of spring discharge to rainfall event represented by a one month recharge discharge time lag as explained in section 2 1 3 and the less inaccessibility of study area the sixteen month groundwater simulation period is considered sufficient to accommodate the overall karst spring hydrogeologic regimes atmosphere subsurface connectivity and hence the groundwater flow in the area in the calibration and validation steps the values of subsurface properties k h and sy the pilot points were calibrated and spatially distributed using 1000x1000 m grid across the model domain using a distance area ratio of 0 05 as suggested by klaas and imteaz 2017 to avoid model overfitting fienen et al 2009 klaas et al 2017e f prior information of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield values at three pumping test locations within the catchment were pat 1992 used as preferred values resulting in a total of 26 pilot points the k h values were assigned to range between 0 1 and 250 m day to accommodate the analysis of bore samples at three locations within oemau catchment and five other pumping test locations adjacent to the catchment pat 1992 1995 and represent karst limestone davis 1969 freeze and cherry 1979 vertical anisotropy of 0 2 and a constant value of 0 3 was assigned for the porosity to represent the carbonate formations johnson 1967 it is to note here that the parameterisation methodologies used in this study are essentially similar with those applied in the previous studies on the same study area klaas and imteaz 2016 klaas et al 2018a d 2019 except for the grid cell size and number of pilot points which are different in the current model parameters used in the groundwater model are presented in table 1 2 3 3 model evaluation criteria both

estimated water demand during the projected period of 2020 2090 total water demand is reflected by two main consumptions i e domestic usage and regional gross irrigation demand for domestic usage the average water requirement per capita of 50 l c d proposed by gleick 1996 for the households in rural developing countries situated in tropical climatic zone was used this amount covers basic domestic consumption i e drinking bathing sanitation and food preparation to anticipate population growth during the relevant period the water requirement for the corresponding year was calculated over the projected population using surveyed population number in 2015 as the baseline and intermediary 4 increase rate as suggested by bps 2016 water requirement for irrigation was estimated based on current agricultural practice in the study area in where dry field paddy is the main crop cultivated by local farmers employing traditional farming system agricultural water demand was calculated based on total irrigation water requirement for paddy irrigation or net farm requirement nfr per acreage recommended by indonesian public work ministry spi 1986 by considering irrigation system type of crop

for crop which counts 70 of the average rainfall and ie is the irrigation efficiency which refers to loss of water at irrigation channel the percolation at paddy farm was assigned to 2 mm day referring to silty clay nature of the native soil spi 1986 consumptive use etc mm day which reflects the loss of water under standard condition due to crop evapotranspiration was calculated using 9 e

equal to 300 mm day as suggested by spi 1986 based on the nfr regional gross irrigation demand was estimated by multiplying the total farm acreage of 248 ha irrigated by the spring through gravity fed canals parameters used in the water demand analysis are presented in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather variables generation 3 1 1 predictors selection sdsm calibration and validation table 3 lists the predictor variables having acceptable correlation p 0 05 with the predictands overall 23 out of 26 predictor variables are empirically fitting for downscaling the wmvs among them zonal velocity meridional velocity vorticity consistently show high degree of correlations with the four predictands fig 6 presents the simulated values of the wmvs i e precipitation at monthly time scale and tmax tavg and tmin at daily time scale during calibration and validation steps table 4 recapitulates the performance of the sdsm models in regards to r 2 rmse and nse for the simulated values of the wmvs in general the models both in calibration and validation simulation were considered statistically satisfactory with r 2 ranges from 0 57 to 0 91 the simulated values of the wmvs reasonably well replicated the observed values indicated with nse varying between 0 55 and 0 84 the value range falls to satisfactory very good categories 0 50 nse 1 00 according to the model criteria by moriasi et al 2007 which indicate a good simulation achievement overall sdsm produced a reasonably well calibrated and validated statistical models with the simulations closely follow the cycle of observed rainfall although monsoonal precipitation in particular was slightly overestimated with the simulated mean 4 49 mm month compared to an observed mean of 4 26 mm month mb 6 82 mm month for the calibration period and simulated mean of 4 74 mm day contrasted to 4 61 mm day of observed mean mb 3 94 mm month similar results of rainfall overestimations are also observed for adjacent islands i e sumbawa located around 600 km from rote island mcgregor et al 2016 the misfit is expected as the change of atmospheric variability in terms of precipitation over indonesia was concluded in the hadcm3 due to changes of convection over south china sea the philippines and western pacific martin et al 2000 ringer et al 2006 sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the winter tropics lachlan cope et al 2007 and increased evaporation and moisture transport over the southern tropical indian ocean bosmans et al 2018 as a result significant influence occurs on the precipitation climatology of hadcm3 resulting in excessive precipitation and earlier inception time compared to the observations mitchell et al 1987 inness et al 2003 3 1 2 projection of future climate scenarios fig 7 presents timeseries of the projections of the wmvs using the calibrated and validated sdsm models for h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios each scenario was generated for future time horizons from 2020 to 2090 in general although having a volatile tendency rainfalls display minor increasing trends an increase of 0 14 and 0 09 under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively over the study period during wet season rainfall is projected to rise by 45 53 mm month under the h3a2a scenario and 37 59 mm month under the h3b2a scenario rainfalls in dry season are also predicted to increase by 9 67 mm month and 1 19 mm month under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively fig 7 shows distinct trends occurring in three distinguishable time horizons 2020 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2090 the annual rainfall declines for the first period of 2020 2059 and third period 2080 2090 while an increasing trend occurs in the second period 2060 2079 in the first period decreases 5 24 and 8 01 are anticipated under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively in the second period 2060 2079 considerable increasing trends of 26 13 and 17 81 is projected for h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively the figure suggests declines of 25 1 and 23 63 under the h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively in the third period 2080 2089 the observed time horizons are comparably consistent with the trend of projected rainfall timeseries for nearby sumbawa island under hadcm3 csiro mk 3 5 and microc m scenarios kirono et al 2016 in all scenarios tmax and tavg were modelled to gradually increase in all time periods increases of 2 16 1 90 c or 0 027 c annually and 1 89 1 35 c or 0 019 c annually of tmax are expected under the h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively for the period 2020 2090 tavg are forecasted to increase 1 05 1 08 c or 0 015 c annually for h3a2a scenario and 1 59 0 81 c or 0 011 c annually under h3b2a scenario in contrast tmin are foreseeable to decrease 0 73 0 20 c or 0 003 c annually and 0 76 0 14 c or 0 002 c annually under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively our results are comparably similar with other study by lasco and boer 2006 whose models projected annual tavg increases of 0 021 c and 0 034 c over indonesia under sres a1f1 and b2 scenarios respectively 3 2 groundwater model calibration and validation the result of groundwater simulation to calibrate and validate the groundwater model is presented in fig 8 the model performances in the steady state simulation is considered satisfactory represented by mae and rsme of 0 42 and 0 52 m respectively in the simulation a well calibrated model is achieved indicated by the direction of groundwater flow which confirms the predefined flow direction domenico and schwartz 1998 fig 8a shows the distribution of hydraulic heads in the steady state calibration in the transient simulation the k h and sy values were estimated and their values are shown in fig 8b and 8c the graphical fitting of observed and simulated heads at seven observation wells in the calibration and validation steps are presented in fig 8d in the hydrograph although the observed heads were slightly underestimated particularly during the dry months relatively good matches between observed and simulated heads were found in the transient simulations in the calibration period rmse value of 0 26 m and mae value of 0 17 m were attained while the values in the validation step are 0 27 m and 0 18 m correspondingly in spite of model underperformance noticeably during low flow in the validation period the groundwater model was reasonably well fit and the error statistics of the model are considered small confirming that the model is capable of reproducing hydraulic heads to a satisfactory level 3 3 assessment of groundwater resources under hadcm3 gcm scenarios 3 3 1 impact of climate change on groundwater resources sustainability the sustainability of groundwater resources in the study area was assessed based on the ability of the spring to continuously supply water and meet agriculture and domestic water demands for the future period of 2020 2090 the calibrated and validated groundwater model presented in section 3 2 was employed to simulate transient groundwater flows over the catchment for the period of 2020 2090 the atmospheric input for the groundwater model was derived from wmvs generated by sdsm under the h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios the objective of the groundwater simulation was to determine the effect of downscaled wmvs on the magnitude of the discharges at the spring from the recharge over the catchment in the projected period table 5 displays the change of simulated recharge corresponding to the precipitation change for the relevant periods and scenarios fig 9 shows the projected discharge monthly timeseries of oemau spring resulted from the simulated groundwater model under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios overall the changes of both recharge and spring discharge proportionally reflects the over time variations of the downscaled weather variables the result shows that a decrease of 5 24 precipitation results in 2 48 reduction of recharge for the period 2020 2059 under h3a2a scenario while 17 81 rise in precipitation during 2060 2079 brings a 12 85 increase in recharge for the same period and scenario consequently the reduced recharge into the karst aquifer results in decline of spring discharge of oemau spring by 2 53 fig 9b in the same period a similar trend is shown for the groundwater simulation under the h3b2a scenario in this scenario spring discharge is projected to decrease by 5 19 as a result of 5 35 reduction of recharge due to 8 01 drop of rainfall over the period decreases of spring discharges of 22 80 and 20 70 are also anticipated under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively for the third period 2080 2090 in which recharge is simulated to decrease by 24 57 and 21 88 for the corresponding scenario meanwhile the catchment is projected to experience a considerable recharge increase in the second period 2060 2079 under the two hadcm3 gcm scenarios resulting in 14 41 and 15 04 increase of discharges at oemau spring fig 10 shows the result of assessment of the groundwater sustainability it graphically presents the temporal variation of spring discharge superimposed by the total water demand as a cumulation of domestic water usage red bars and regional gross irrigation demand green bars overall the figure shows that until the end of the century irrigation will be the most influential stressor for consumptive water use in the area given that foreseeably domestic consumption has much less effect on the sustainability of groundwater resources when compared with irrigation water demand with a 4 population growth assumed during the period number of populations will reach around 25 000 at 2090 adding to a total around 3 66 14 63 l s of agriculture demand table 6 summarises water supply demand balance calculation for oemau spring under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios under h3a2a scenario during the period of 2020 2046 the spring is capable of fulfilling the total projected water demand for the area with an average surplus of 52 84 l s the wet years indicated with water surplus begin again from 2071 to 2079 when for average there is 68 12 l s oversupply however for 24 years 2047 2070 having a 66 74 l s deficit in balance the ability of spring to supply water is at great risk these dry periods are characterised by decrease of rainfall and significant rise in water demand for irrigation due to increased evapotranspiration another period with shortage in water supply is projected to occur at the period before the next century 2080 2090 with an average of 28 84 l s deficit in water supply demand balance the same trend is projected to occur under h3b2a scenario although the severity degree of dry periods is relatively less than that under h3a2a the area is expected to experience a much longer period of wet years 31 years from 2020 with a 58 34 l s water surplus followed by 20 years of water supply shortfall from the spring 40 51 l s wet years begins again from 2071 to 2077 with a 62 09 l s oversupply before another 13 years of water deficit from 2070 to 2090 39 84 l s 3 3 2 proposed management strategies maintaining a continuous water security over time is vital to ensure sufficient water provision for the community nevertheless given the assessment result on the groundwater resources sustainability for oemau karst spring it is concluded that under both h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios the total water demand in the study area is not met in the two projected periods as presented in table 6 in the dry periods mainly around 2050 s 2060 s and 2080 s anticipated water demand principally from irrigation requirement well surpasses modelled spring discharge by around 29 67 l s or 10 24 of the average discharge from january 2011 april 2012 observed at oemau spring klaas et al 2017a decreased spring capacity in supplying water due to reduced precipitation and discharge over the catchment and increased irrigation water demand as a result of increased water evapotranspiration in these periods would apparently threaten the community that depends entirely on the water provision from the spring therefore water security is at stake in these periods in order to cope with the future alarming situation several management strategies are proposed in this study table 7 presents three main tailored management strategies namely socio cultural technical and ecological measures that can be implemented by the local authorities and community scale of priority and time urgency were assigned on each measure to guide all stakeholders in the design and implementation steps the strategies were selected mainly by incorporating local resources in terms of physical and social characteristics initial important measures include steps to empower and prepare the community i e strengthening indigenous water body and awareness campaign to cope with the projected water provision deficit due to climate changes existing water organisation known as mamar with the manaholo acting as the main administrator and guard of the forest encircling the spring is an important social institution in rotenese society that predominantly deals with forest protection and water management from the karst spring strengthening indigenous water organisation is considered high in both priority and time scale necessity because the existing local water organisation could lead and develop society s behaviour towards water conservation through environment friendly agriculture and livestock practices klaas 2008 accompanied by awareness raising through regional campaign on climate change socio cultural measures bound the community to collectively prepare themselves to the worst projected scenarios given the result of the water demand analysis and the discharge response of the spring to the projected climate change reducing irrigation requirement by cutting off water consumption is the utmost and imperative approach in relieving water stress due to shortage of water supply among irrigation practises whose consumptive use accounts for 90 of total groundwater resources worldwide shiklomanov and rodda 2003 paddy rice production is well known as the high water eater crop due to the nature of its system that requires prolonged and maintained soil moisture which evidently leaves an immense water footprint hoekstra and chapagain 2008 hoekstra et al 2009 therefore in this study several technical measures including optimising agriculture system and upgrading irritation canals were proposed to reduce actual irrigation requirement farmers can benefit from cultivating other crop than paddy in a sequence within a year applying crop rotation and substitution has demonstrated a positive impact both on reducing water consumption and increasing field yield of paddy kamoshita et al 2007 sujono 2012 xu et al 2016 considering monsoonal rainfall opting less water consumptive yet sizeably profitable crop such as maize zea mays peanut arachis hypogaea and snake bean vigna unguiculata subsp sesquipedalis in a diversification scheme during the dry periods can significantly lessen spring s burden thus improving water security however considering drawbacks of crop rotation application in sulawesi island northern part of indonesia where the cropping systems has resulted in damaging soil structure cass et al 1994 future studies are needed to understand how these crops can be orderly combined after or before rice harvesting period and most importantly to determine their appropriateness and sustainability in terms of impacts on local soil properties adopting water saving rice cultivation such as system of rice intensification sri is one way to significantly save water in several countries compared to the conventional practices this method is confirmed to reduce irrigation requirement by 25 70 and greenhouse gas ghg emissions by around 28 70 while attaining farm productivity increase by 50 300 satyanarayana et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 sharif 2011 jain et al 2014 choi et al 2014 in indonesia it proved to be successfully applied in eastern part of indonesia with 40 water saving cut of production cost by more than 25 mainly from reduced fertiliser application and margin profit rise of more than five times more than water extensive traditional rice farm method sato 2006 hasan and sato 2007 therefore subject to providing a recommended preliminary systematic investigation on how it fits with the local soil and climate characteristics immediate application of sri water management methods could greatly mitigate the severity of water deficit during the dry periods in the study area a combination of reforestation and afforestation can be implemented as an adaptive measure to reduce climate change risk by improving hydrological conditions upstream these measures would not only increase long term recharge capacity of cos and improve micro climate but will also offer other vital functions i e economic sustenance biodiversity conservation rural development livelihood security enhancement and employment generation non wood forest productivity can be increased by planting some local acclimated plants such as coconut cocos nucifera betel palm areca catechu mango mangifera banana musaceae betel piper betle kapuk randu ceiba pentandra lontar borassus flabellifer and kahembi schleichera oleosa some of which have high social and economic values in the study area klaas 2008 4 conclusions this study aimed at assessing the sustainability of groundwater resource of oemau spring for the period from 2020 to 2090 using modflow in which groundwater flow was simulated using four downscaled weather model variables i e minimum average and maximum temperatures and precipitation the weather model variables were downscaled and generated using a stochastic weather generator sdsm the sustainability analysis was established on the basis of the capacity of the spring discharge to meet domestic and agricultural water demands applying sdsm the downscaling was performed based on statistical correlations established between data series of observed rainfalls as the predictands and selected ncep re analysis large scale atmospheric predictors although monsoonal precipitation was slightly overestimated statistically good fit atmospheric models were attained in the calibration 1982 1998 and validation 1982 1998 periods after having an acceptable calibration and validation results sdsm then generated timeseries of weather model variables using the hadcm3 gcm predictor variables under h3a2a and h3b2a climate scenarios projected for the period 2020 2090 the downscaled results of hadcm3 indicated that the rainfall and temperatures would likely to be affected by climate change overall the rainfall is projected to slightly increase by 0 14 and 0 09 under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios respectively a gradual increase of 1 89 2 16 for tmax and 1 05 1 59 for tavg and a decrease of 0 73 0 76 for tmin were projected for all scenarios the generated meteorological weather variables timeseries were then input into the validated groundwater model to simulate the discharges for the period 2020 2090 the numerical groundwater model implemented within modflow code was accurately able to reproduce the general groundwater flow observed although the observed heads were slightly underestimated during the dry months considerably acceptable model performances were achieved during transient simulation indicated by small error statistics mae 0 17 0 18 m rmse 0 26 0 27 having a reasonably well fit model modflow simulated groundwater flow for the future period of 2020 2090 using the downscaled weather timeseries generated by sdsm the overall timeline was split into three periods i e 2020 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2090 to accommodate different projected rainfall trends in general both recharge and spring discharge proportionally respond to the variation of the downscaled weather variables for the period 2020 2059 under h3a2a scenario a 5 24 average decrease of rainfall results in 2 48 and 2 53 reduction of recharge and spring discharge respectively while a 14 41 increase of discharge at oemau spring is projected for the period 2060 2079 after having significant 26 13 and 18 63 rise in rainfall and recharge respectively under the same scenario declining trend of spring discharge is anticipated to occur from 2080 2090 with a 5 19 drop as a result of 5 35 reduction of recharge due to 8 01 reduction of rainfall over the period as expected a similar trend is revealed for the groundwater simulation under the h3b2a scenario with the spring expected to experience highest decrease in discharge in the period of 2080 2090 and increase in discharge of 15 04 in the period of 2060 2079 calculation of water demand in the area shows that domestic consumption has much less effect with a fraction 3 66 of the irrigation water demand at 2090 on the sustainability of groundwater resources the assessment result of the groundwater resources sustainability for 2020 2090 under h3a2a and h3b2a scenarios reveals two periods of wet years characterised by average supply surplus and two periods of dry periods signified by deficit in water supply by oemau spring the area is projected to variably experience around 29 67 l s shortage in dry periods and 53 68 l s over supply in wet periods period of 2047 2070 is projected as the most prolonged deficit period with an average annual deficit of 66 74 l s for 24 years simulated under h3a2a scenario meanwhile having a 58 34 l s oversupply in 2020 2050 31 years the area would enjoy the longest surplus period in order to assist the community to deal with water deficit during the expected dry periods three main adaptive strategies namely socio cultural technical and ecological measures were proposed considering the scale of priority and time urgency for each measure all stakeholders including decision makers regional planner and community could implement the management strategies to adapt with the expected climate change and to mitigate adverse impacts of climate change in term of water deficit during the dry periods there are extensive literatures discussing groundwater assessment and evaluation for water supply in karst areas around the world using both or separately groundwater and climate models however little effort was endeavoured to add to the research essential components which are water management and recommendation as per the regional characteristics are considered compared to previous research in karst water quantification this study is considered novel as it provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to link the validated physical based hydrology and climate models and the assessment of the implication of climate and demographic variabilities on the sustainability of freshwater resources furthermore the study is able to address the ultimate question of water availability in the area under study based on supply demand analysis over a projected future timeseries using a statistical downscaled climate model before proposing groundwater resources management strategies the findings of this study can not only assist modellers to construct an integrated climate groundwater model but also provide practical guidelines for decision maker and relevant stakeholders to develop and implement a comprehensive set of management strategies as palliative and adaptive measures to assist the community dealing with water deficit during dry periods in general this study presents a blueprint for assessing groundwater sustainability under climate change scenarios and developing tailored management strategies to cope with adverse impacts of climate change which can become fundamental guidelines for other karst islands in the future concerning groundwater model and climate forcing the outcomes of this study are considered valid and representative for other areas having similar sub surface characteristics i e eogenetic karst and dominant diffuse flow system and hydro climate system i e monsoonal climate therefore the practical recommendation given in this study is considered representative of many karst terrains in islands under similar hydrogeology and climate regimes considering the integrated approach between physical based hydrology and climate models and water management methodology the methodologies employed in this study are considered applicable to any karst catchment with various complexity of climate and demographic functions however although the results presented here are promising it is worth emphasizing that supplementary studies are needed to address several research components beyond what is currently analysed given the scope of this study for further studies it is suggested to gain process based understanding of the effects of land use modification on magnitude and spatial distributions of recharge and discharge at spring proper incorporation of uncertainty analysis on both climate change and groundwater model is an additional worthy contribution to fully understand how the water sustainability can be secured in the study

5822,the loess plateau of china is a major apple cultivating region but much of the plateau is water limited and the expansion of apple growing is putting pressure on soil water resources plants water consumption patterns have been intensively studied to facilitate formulation of robust agricultural strategies but previous studies have generally applied indirect methods to characterize their water use moreover the few studies that have applied direct isotopic methods have mostly focused on shallow 0 200 cm soil layers usually in stands of a single age or single climatic region to avoid these limitations we have investigated the primary water sources of apple trees of three ages 10 15 and 22 years in semiarid and semihumid climatic regions of the plateau using both natural stable isotopic signatures δ 2h values and injections of 2h2o into deep soil layers we found that water content in apple orchards soil decreased with increases in depth and stand age and was higher in the semihumid area than in the semiarid area nevertheless patterns of apple trees water uptake from shallow 0 300 cm soil layers were similar in the two climatic regions and the main water sources became shallower with increases in stand age however water uptake from deep 400 500 cm soil layers was also detected particularly in the blossom and young fruit stage in apple orchards of the semiarid area moreover older trees absorbed more water from these layers than younger trees in the semiarid area but not in the semihumid area throughout the growing season excessive consumption of deep soil water inevitably results in deep soil drying and severely threatens the sustainability of apple cultivation our work suggests that it is necessary to take actions e g supplementary irrigation landscaping and mulching combinations to reduce the proportion of deep soil water used by apple trees to prevent the development of dried soil layers it also highlights the need to assess uptake patterns of plants at multiple developmental stages and ages to identify times when and places where interventions may be required or most effective keywords water uptake patterns shallow soil water deep soil water stable isotopes artificial isotopes 1 introduction apples are among the most widely cultivated fruits in the world baldi et al 2013 li et al 2013 large parts of the loess plateau of china have abundant light and heat resources as well as large diurnal temperature ranges and are thus considered suitable for producing high quality apples wang et al 2012 now the apple industry has become the backbone of the local rural economy wang and wang 2017 and the plateau has become the largest area of intensive apple cultivation globally in 2016 the cover and yield of apple trees in the region amounted to 1 31 million hectares and 22 9 million tons accounting for 25 2 and 26 3 of global coverage and production respectively however much of the plateau is water limited and most orchards in the region are cultivated under rain fed conditions song et al 2017 in many parts the limited precipitation is barely sufficient to meet apple orchards high water consumption rates hence the large scale expansion of apple cultivation has changed ecohydrological processes with profound implications for its sustainability in the region in water limited ecosystems soil moisture generated by precipitation is a limiting factor governing vegetation dynamics and ecosystem processes moreno de las heras et al 2011 in turn vegetation affects soil water resources in varying ways depending on the climatic conditions species and stand ages grossiord et al 2017 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2017 when water consumption by plants exceeds soil water supplies water deficits inevitably occur and prolonged excessive consumption causes soil drying and eventually damage to soil structure that is difficult to ameliorate duan et al 2016 jian et al 2015 apple orchards have already caused such damage notably formation of dried soil layers dsl in parts of the plateau wang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 therefore more knowledge of the water consumption patterns of plants including apple trees is urgently required to formulate robust strategies for the sustainable use of water resources and vegetation on the plateau and similar water limited regions there are several traditional techniques to determine plants water consumption generally involving root system excavation and soil water determination ma et al 2019 wang et al 2012 xu and li 2006 these methods can provide valuable snapshots of conditions but provide little information about plants dynamic water uptake processes especially in environments where soil water conditions are highly variable and difficult to predict moreover they provide no direct evidence of water uptake by roots in contrast tracing stable isotope δ 2h and δ 18o signatures provides a powerful reliable and nondestructive approach for studying plants water uptake and utilization dawson and ehleringer 1991 wang et al 2010 by comparing the isotopic composition of xylem water and potential water sources we can identify the water sources used by plants and estimate their proportional contributions dai et al 2015 liu et al 2010 wu et al 2018 most researchers who have applied this approach have focused on plants uptake from shallow 0 200 cm or even 0 100 cm soil layers tang et al 2018 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a however for shrubs or trees with deep root systems this may lead to overestimates of proportional contributions of shallow soil water and neglect of potentially vital contributions of deep soil water especially in arid and semiarid areas uptake of deep soil water by roots is crucial for some plants normal physiological activities bleby et al 2010 maeght et al 2013 and thus must be considered to obtain sufficient understanding of ecohydrological processes a complication is that vertical profiles of δ 2h or δ 18o are often c or s shaped when deep soil layers are considered which must be accounted for in calculations of proportional uptake from different depths stahl et al 2013 a labeling approach that increases the abundance of a monitored isotope in deep soil can provide direct evidence of water uptake from deep layers beyer et al 2016 therefore for plants with deep root systems combining analyses of natural stable isotopic signatures and isotopic labeling might provide more comprehensive information and robust insights a further limitation of previous studies concerning the variation in plants water uptake patterns on the loess plateau is that they have been mostly restricted to catchment scales or specific stand ages tang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 little is known about the water uptake characteristics of apple trees of different ages under different climatic conditions although climatic variables especially precipitation and stand age clearly affect plants water use thus there are urgent needs to study their water uptake patterns in more detail to elucidate their age and developmental stage dependent effects on ecohydrological processes in water limited ecosystems and facilitate formulation of sustainable apple cultivation and water conservation strategies to address these needs we have monitored the seasonal variation of water uptake patterns of apple stands of three ages 10 15 and 22 years in semiarid and semihumid climatic regions of the loess plateau using both natural stable isotope signatures and isotope labeling of deep layers there were two specific objectives first to identify effects of stand age on apple trees shallow soil water use in each climatic region second to elucidate differences in deep soil water use of stands of the three ages in the two climatic regions this was done by measuring stable isotope levels in soil and xylem water samples and soil water content at various depths in apple orchards in the two regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area and experimental sites the study was conducted in 2016 on the loess plateau of china 33 43 41 16 n 100 54 114 33 e which covers 620 000 km2 annual precipitation on the plateau ranges from 150 mm in the northwest to 800 mm in the southeast and 55 78 of the total precipitation falls in june to september jia et al 2017 based on the ratio of mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration p et the plateau has been divided into three climatic regions arid 0 05 0 2 semiarid 0 2 0 5 and semihumid 0 5 0 65 scanlon et al 2006 unesco 1979 the annual average temperature ranges from 3 6 to 14 3 c there are rich solar energy resources with mean annual sunshine hours of 2200 2800 h gao et al 2017 the plateau s surface is covered by a thick layer of loess 100 m thick on average representative sites were selected for sample collection in both the semiarid and semihumid areas of the plateau each hosting apple orchards of three stand ages 10 15 and 22 years the two sites are located in the tianhe watershed baota district yan an and the loess plateau experimental station in qingyang respectively where the p et ratios based on mean precipitation and evapotranspiration from 1995 to 2010 are 0 49 and 0 51 respectively fig 1 both sites are located in the main apple cultivation area of the loess plateau at each site we collected soil and xylem samples from apple orchards of each age the data gathered from the stands are valid for our comparative purposes because all orchards at the same site are located in the same small watershed have similar slopes aspects and soil texture and have been subjected to the same management regimes e g no irrigation with standard clipping and fertilization treatments locations of the stands were recorded with a portable gps receiver in addition the height diameter at breast height and crown dimensions long and short axes of 20 randomly selected trees in each stand were measured with a hypsometer caliper scale and tapeline respectively general information on the apple orchards is presented in table 1 2 2 soil water dynamics simulation 2 2 1 numerical modelling hydrus 2d version 2 03 is reportedly powerful software for simulating two or three dimensional axially symmetric water flow and root water uptake based on finite element numerical solutions of flow equations simunek et al 2006 thus we used it to simulate soil water dynamics in the apple orchards ignoring effects of temperature and gas on soil water movement and assuming that soil is homogeneous and isotropic its two

distribution function and tp is the potential transpiration rate cm 1 d we set the upper boundary to atmospheric boundary conditions left and right boundaries to zero flux conditions and the bottom boundary to free drainage boundary conditions because the water table in the study area is much lower than the observed soil depth 2 2 3 acquisition of model parameters the soil hydraulic properties were described by the van genuchten equation 1980 as follows 3 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 4 k h k s s e 1 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 h is the soil

cm 3 ks is saturated hydraulic conductivity and se is the relative saturation the initial hydraulic parameters θr θs α ks and n of different soil layers were estimated using the neural network prediction program in the rosetta module and then optimized by the inverse solution in hydrus 2d for these parameters 2 2 4 model calibration and evaluation the volumetric water content of soil in the 10 year old apple orchard in the semiarid area yan an was measured using a portable time reflectometry tdr system trime pico iph t3 imko germany during the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 soil water was measured at 20 cm intervals to 280 cm depth once a month with additional monitoring after rain the data acquired in 2016 and 2017 were respectively used to calibrate and validate the hydraulic parameters days were set as the time units in the numerical simulations which ran from may 1 2016 to september 30 2016 and may 1 2017 to september 30 2017 simulated values were compared with observed values and values of the calibrated parameters were selected from the run when simulated and observed values were adequately consistent he et al 2018 the soil hydraulic parameters in 2016 calibration set and 2017 validation set are shown in table 2 the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were used to assess the consistency between the simulations and observations as expressed by the following equations 5 mae i 1 n p i o i n 6 rmse i 1 n p i q i 2 n 7 r 2 1 i 1 n p i q i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of compared values p i is the predicted value o i is the observed value and o is the mean of observed data 2 3 isotopic data collection 2 3 1 fine root collection preliminary investigations about the apple trees root systems distribution were conducted before isotopic sample collection root samples of 10 year old apple trees 0 800 cm were collected in trisection radiation from the representative tree trunk at 0 5 m distance using a hand auger with 90 mm diameter in may 2016 li et al 2017 collected root samples were poured into a sieve 0 2 mm 25 cm diameter 7 5 cm height and then washed carefully with tap water to remove all unnecessary soil roots which 2 mm in diameter are the primary organ of absorbing water and nutrients in forest systems ceccon et al 2011 the fine roots were scanned using a scanner at 300 dpi and then the fine root length was determined using winrhizo software version 5 0 regent instruments inc quebec canada the fine root length density frld m m 3 in each sample was then calculated by dividing the obtained length of fine roots by the volume of the sample 2 3 2 sampling natural stable isotopes plant and soil samples were collected from the orchards in the following three developmental stages in 2016 blossom and young fruit byf may fruit swelling fsw july and fruit maturation ftm september on each sampling occasion three apple trees in each orchard were randomly selected xylem and soil samples were collected concurrently between 8 00 and 12 00 when the trees were actively transpiring wang et al 2010 three suberized twigs 0 3 0 5 cm diameter ca 10 cm long and near the tree trunk were cut from the sunny side of each sampling tree and the bark phloem and cambium were removed from them then each debarked twig was cut into 1 cm segments which were immediately placed in vials that were sealed with parafilm and placed in a box with ice for transportation to the laboratory where they were stored in a refrigerator until water extraction after xylem sampling soil samples were collected with a hand auger from shallow soil layers at 10 20 and 40 cm intervals from the 0 20 20 80 and 80 300 cm layers respectively the soil samples depth of 300 cm was determined because 70 of apple tree roots were distributed in the 0 300 cm soil layers and there was a distinct gradient in δ 2h values existed in this layer which meeting requirements for use of isotopic mixing models to distinguish primary water sources each soil sample was divided into two parts one of which was placed in a vial and stored identically to the xylem samples for isotopic determination while the other was used to obtain the gravimetric soil water content swc by oven drying 2 3 3 isotope labeling experiments to obtain complementary information on deep soil water use three trees in each orchard with similar height crown diameter and diameter at breast height were randomly selected for inclusion in a 2h2o tracer experiment in 2016 a day before tracer injection a 400 cm hole was drilled 50 cm from the trunk of each selected tree using a hand auger a 400 cm long polyvinyl chloride pipe was inserted into the holes to inject tracer at the target depth 400 cm then 150 ml of 10 2h2o solution 15 ml 99 99 2h2o plus 135 ml tap water prepared in advance was injected into each hole a previous preliminary experiment showed that this treatment increased swc 24 h after injection by less than 1 which is negligible for soil hydrological processes after the 2h2o injection the polyvinyl chloride pipe was removed and the hole was sealed we collected xylem samples in the 7 days following each injection to detect possible tracer uptake by the trees the first 2h2o tracer injection was conducted in may and the xylem samples were collected 2 4 and 7 days after the injection assuming that the 2h concentration in the soil would steadily decline as a result of soil water transport and uptake by roots in july we applied a second tracer injection identical to the first in terms of volume and concentration and collected xylem samples 2 and 7 days later xylem samples were also collected from the labeled trees at the end of september at the same time that xylem samples were collected from labeled trees corresponding samples were collected from unlabeled trees in the same orchards to acquire background isotope concentrations if a sample had a 2h concentration that was at least two standard deviations sd higher than the background value tracer was assumed to be present kulmatiski et al 2010 2 4 isotopic analysis the water in xylem and soil samples was extracted using a li 2000 cryogenic vacuum distillation system los gatos research mountain view usa transferred to 5 ml glass vials and stored at 4 c until analysis the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of extracted water were then determined using a tiwa 45ep isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy analyzer los gatos research mountain view usa methanol contamination in the plant samples was corrected by correction equation which acquired through calibration test of methanol contamination spectrum as expressed by the following equations 8 δ d t δ d m 0 0247 l n m 3 0 0749 l n m 2 1 2613 l n m 1 0182 where δdt is the true value δdm is the measure value m is the methanol value 2 5 determination of plant water sources the bayesian isotope mixing model mixsir 1 0 4 which accounts for uncertainties associated with multiple sources moore and semmens 2008 was used to calculate proportional contributions of water from considered soil layers to water extracted from the xylem samples the two study areas are both covered by thick loess soils and groundwater is too deep for plants roots to absorb moreover all the experimental apple orchards are rainfed thus soil water is the primary water source for plants in the orchards and on the plateau generally fan et al 2016 based on distributions of soil water content swc and δ 2h values the entire shallow soil profile 0 300 cm was divided into three potential soil water sources 0 40 40 160 and 160 300 cm layers both swc and δ 2h values were most variable in the 0 40 layer and most stable in the 160 300 cm layer the mean δ 2h values and their standard deviations in each of these potential water sources and the xylem samples were respectively used as source and mixture data for the model the fractionation factor was set to zero because no isotope fractionation is believed to occur during water uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 2 6 statistics distributions of the swc and δ 2h values of both xylem and soil water samples met requirements for analysis of variance anova therefore differences in δ 2h values of xylem water among sampling dates were evaluated by one way anova two way anova was applied to detect differences in swc and δ 2h of soil water between sampling dates and depths as well as in contributions of the three water sources soil layers to xylem water between sampling dates least significant difference lsd post hoc tests with α 0 05 were used to identify significant between date and between depth differences 3 results 3 1 precipitation and soil moisture dynamics total precipitation in the study year 2016 amounted to 502 2 and 478 4 mm in the semiarid and semihumid areas respectively which were both defined as normal precipitation years in both cases 90 of the precipitation occurred during the growing season additionally the highest monthly precipitation was 175 4 mm in july in the semiarid area and 105 6 mm in june in the semihumid area in the highest single precipitation events 89 5 and 66 9 mm of rain fell in these areas respectively in both cases in july the precipitation in 2016 was 28 2 greater than in 2015 in the semiarid area but 10 6 lower than in 2015 in the semihumid area fig 2 fig 3 shows the observed and simulated soil water dynamics of 10 year old apple orchard in semiarid area in 2016 and 2017 the results suggest that there is a strong correlation between the simulated and observed volumetric water content for both 5 soil layers mae rmse and r2 ranged from 0 5 to 2 1 0 5 to 3 2 and 80 0 to 92 4 respectively table 3 these data confirmed the suitability of hydrus 2d for simulating water dynamics in the area at least under the range of precipitation conditions during the monitoring period based on the united states department of agriculture s classification system the soils at the two sites are similar silt loam with 15 8 clay 59 4 silt and 18 2 sand contents in yan an and 22 6 clay 51 5 silt and 26 5 sand contents in qingyang thus data acquired at the yan an site were used to calibrate parameters for numerical simulations with the hydrus 2d model of the soil water dynamics of the orchards in both the semiarid and semihumid regions of the plateau the volumetric soil water content vswc of all six orchards displayed clear seasonal and vertical variations throughout the growing season and differed with stand age and climate fig 4 due to the typical effects of rainfall infiltration and evapotranspiration the vswc showed markedly high temporal variations in 0 100 cm soil layers than in deeper layers in the semiarid area desiccation occurred at 160 300 160 240 and 100 300 cm depths in the 10 15 and 22 year old orchards respectively the vswc of all orchards decreased with increasing stand age in both the semiarid and semihumid areas although the total precipitation in the semiarid area was slightly higher than in the semihumid area in 2016 the vswc in the profile was lower in the semiarid area than in the semihumid area during the byf stage from the 121th to 150th day fig 4 this difference is mainly attributed to the impact of precipitation in the preceding year which as mentioned above was substantially higher in the semihumid area 534 9 mm than in the semiarid area 391 7 mm fig 2 overall as expected orchards in the semihumid area had higher soil water contents than those in the semiarid area 3 2 δ 2h values in xylem and soil water the δ 2h values in xylem water from trees in stands of different ages varied substantially during the growth period in the two climatic regions fig 5 the xylem water δ 2h of 10 year old trees fluctuated most during the growing season varying from 66 7 to 53 3 in the semiarid area and from 68 9 to 57 3 in the semihumid area the variation in δ 2h in xylem water from the 15 and 22 year old trees showed similar temporal trends in the two climatic regions falling between the byf and fsw stages then increasing between the fsw and ftm stages there were marked variations with both depth and sampling date in δ 2h values of shallow soil layers in both climatic regions fig 6 the values were more negative in 40 300 cm layers than in 0 40 cm soil layers of all the orchards in the byf and ftm stages but they were more negative in the 0 40 cm layers in the fsw stage possibly due to infiltration of precipitation with strongly negative values in summer events hence the soil water δ 2h fluctuated more strongly in the upper 40 cm layers ranging from 69 87 to 21 69 in the semiarid area and from 87 53 to 17 47 in the semihumid area than in the 40 300 cm layers as soil depth increased the influences of precipitation weakened the δ 2h values in the 40 300 cm soil layers were relatively stable and did not significantly differ among sampling dates 3 3 water uptake patterns analysis of the δ 2h values of xylem and soil water revealed significant variation in contributions of three potential soil water sources of the apple trees throughout the growing season in the two climatic regions fig 7 in the byf stage when precipitation was relatively light and evaporation strong the swc values in the shallow layers were relatively low and the trees took up correspondingly large proportions of water from deeper layers for example 15 year old trees in the semiarid area took up 48 3 of their xylem water from the 40 160 cm soil layers in the semiarid area similarly 10 year old trees took up 44 8 of their xylem water from the below 160 cm soil layers in the semiarid area and the 10 and 15 year old trees respectively took up 63 4 and 41 8 from the below 160 cm layers in the semihumid area during this stage as precipitation infiltrated in the ftm stage 10 and 15 year old apple trees showed great plasticity in their water uptake patterns switching their main water source to the 0 40 cm soil layers which respectively accounted for 43 6 and 44 8 of the xylem water for 10 and 15 year old trees in the semiarid area and 63 4 and 41 8 in the semihumid area respectively fig 7a d the 22 year old apple trees in the two climatic regions showed similar water uptake patterns they primarily derived water from 0 160 cm soil layers 73 6 and 71 7 in byf and fsw stages in the semiarid area respectively 71 5 and 89 1 in these stages in the semihumid area respectively then switched to 0 40 cm soil layers 48 5 and 58 4 in the semiarid and semihumid areas respectively in the ftm stage when the water in the upper layers was replenished fig 7e and f 3 4 variations in the isotopic label the temporal variation in 2h concentrations in the xylem of monitored trees following 2h2o injections provided direct evidence of deep root water uptake fig 8 with differences associated with both stand age and climatic region in the semiarid area 22 year old apple trees absorbed water from 400 500 cm soil layers rapidly fig 8a as manifested by significantly elevated 2h values of samples taken two days after the injections then δ 2h values progressively increased to 43 78 30 8 higher than the background value by the seventh day in contrast no artificial tracer was detected in xylem of 10 and 15 year old trees 2 and 4 days after labeling but by the seventh day their δ 2h values were significantly 18 4 and 21 9 respectively higher than the background values no evidence of uptake of labelled water by the trees was found in the seven days following the second injection but clear signs of uptake were observed on september 25 no uptake of the labeled water in any of the three apple orchards at any stage of the sampling campaign was detected in the semihumid area fig 8b 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty in the soil moisture simulation hydrus 2d accurately captured temporal and spatial dynamics of soil moisture according to comparison of observed and simulated values with both mae and rmse 3 2 and r2 consistently 80 0 table 3 this may be to the reasons of the application of inverse solution in the acquisition of parameters nascimento et al 2018 had demonstrated good similarity between field measured data and data fitted by inverse solution and hydrus inverse solution is a useful technique for rapid characterization of the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties rashid et al 2015 these results confirm numerous previous demonstrations that hydrus 2d has high ability to simulate soil moisture dynamics under diverse conditions autovino et al 2018 cai et al 2018 karandish and šimůnek 2019 nevertheless there are clearly uncertainties in soil moisture simulations by hydrus 2d due to uncertainties in multiple soil meteorology and plant parameters for example neural network prediction program in the rosetta module was used to predict the soil hydraulic parameters in the loess plateau lü et al 2009 random aspects of sedimentation processes during formation of soils on the plateau resulted in significant spatial variability in soil physical and chemical properties which inevitably affect movements of soil moisture and then impact on the simulation effect notably the simulation of soil moisture was less accurate for the 160 300 cm soil layers than for other layers following extreme rainfall 108 mm on july 3 2016 possibly due to preferential flow leading to increases in soil moisture in the 160 300 cm soil layers that the model did not account for moreover the root distribution is simply described by hydrus 2d with just six parameters maximum rooting depth and radius maximum rooting intensity depth and radius dimensionless parameter pz and px which is clearly insufficient for detailed simulation of root water uptake 4 2 seasonal and regional variations of water uptake patterns the δ 2h values of soil water in the apple orchards exhibited significant seasonal patterns in both climatic regions fig 6 and they were intimately associated with precipitation infiltration and evaporation which differed in the two regions this directly caused variations in δ 2h values of xylem water in the trees throughout the growing season within and between the two climatic regions fig 5 therefore there were distinct seasonal and spatial variations in the trees water sources which also varied among orchards of different ages fig 7 the mixsir 1 0 4 based analysis detected apparently adaptive water use by the 10 and 15 year old apple trees in the semiarid area which switched their primary water sources from 160 300 or 40 160 cm soil layers to 0 40 cm soil layers as the growing season progressed fig 7a and c this is consistent with findings of several previous studies that plants absorbed water predominantly from deep soil layers during drought periods gao et al 2018b song et al 2016 and switched to shallow soil layers during other periods yang et al 2015 in contrast the 22 year old trees predominately acquired water from 0 160 cm soil layers and the proportional contribution of water from 160 300 cm layers decreased throughout the growing season this could be ascribed to relatively low swc in the 160 300 cm soil layers due to continuous consumption fig 7e this result partially differs from findings of zhao et al 2018 that shallow 0 40 cm layers were not the primary sources for 22 year old jujube trees in the semiarid area possibly due to differences in soil water availability apple trees in the semihumid area showed similar water use patterns to those in the semiarid area 10 and 15 year old trees shifted their water sources from the 160 300 cm to 0 40 cm soil layers and 22 year old trees mainly exploited water from the 0 160 cm soil layers throughout the growing season fig 7b d and f in addition the proportional contributions of water in the 160 300 cm layers were significantly higher in the byf stage than in the ftm stage for trees of all three ages p 0 05 this could be due to relatively low availability of water in the 0 160 cm layers due to relatively high evapotranspiration and low precipitation in the byf stage fig 7b d and f interestingly despite swc in the 0 40 cm soil layers increasing significantly due to heavy rainfall in the fsw stage the proportional use of shallow water by the 15 and 22 year old trees did not increase fig 7d and f similar studies in water limited ecosystems have detected a time lag in plants switches to different water sources following precipitation mediated increases in water availability in shallow layers huo et al 2018 wu et al 2016 other studies have also detected a time lag between water shortage and plants responses vicente serrano et al 2013 yang et al 2015 nevertheless the proportional contribution of the 0 40 cm soil water for 10 year old apple trees increased significantly in the fsw stage in marked contrast to the observed pattern for older trees fig 7b this could be partly due to root systems of younger trees having higher sensitivity to water skubel et al 2015 also found that young stands may be more suitable than older stands in warm environments with variable precipitation hence both the likelihood of such time lags and their duration if they occur may be related to stand age trees of all three ages obtained the largest proportions of their water from the 0 40 cm soil layers in the ftm age and the swc in these layers was correspondingly low fig 7b normally plants roots obtain resources from upper soil layers when available as the energy costs are lower and both water and nutrient availability are generally high in the upper layers schenk 2008 4 3 water uptake dynamics from deep soil layers the water extracted from deep soil is important for plants growth especially in dry periods and significantly contributes to drought avoidance yang et al 2017 thus to obtain more comprehensive information about the trees water uptake patterns 2h2o tracer was injected at 400 cm depth and concentrations of 2h in xylem samples were measured to investigate their deep soil water uptake dynamics fig 8 the artificial tracer was detected in xylem of apple trees as expected fig 8a given that roots of apple trees at full productive age could reach depths of 10 m and the roots were deeper as the stand age increasing zhang et al 2017b li et al 2019 water uptake from deep soil layers 400 500 cm was detected in byf in apple orchards of the semiarid area it maybe because precipitation in byf was relatively less and evaporation was strong resulting in relatively low soil water content in shallow layers meanwhile byf is the critical period of water demand for apple trees and the swc in 400 cm depth was higher than its in shallow layers 0 300 cm fig s1 in this period so apple trees would take up more deep soil water when shallow soil water rarely suffices the demand interestingly in the semiarid area 22 year old apple trees absorbed deep 400 500 cm soil water rapidly within 2 days but the younger trees absorbed it after a longer delay fig 8a according to the criterion of xylem 2h concentrations being at least two standard deviations sd higher than the background value there are several possible explanations for such uptake first some roots capable of taking up water may be present at the labeling depth second hydraulic redistribution of water from deep to upper soil layers may occur enabling shallow roots to absorb it bleby et al 2010 scott et al 2008 third deep water may be rapidly accessed and transferred through mycorrhizae plamboeck et al 2007 it should be noted that 2h xylem concentrations increased more rapidly in the 22 year old trees than in the younger trees indicating that older trees might have higher transpiration requirements this inference is consistent with findings by wang and wang 2017 that apple trees daily transpiration and evapotranspiration rates are positively correlated with age furthermore the 22 year old trees were markedly larger than the younger trees table 1 and recent research suggests that canopy cover is the primary driver of orchards water consumption dzikiti et al 2018 in addition evidence of uptake of the injected 2h2o was detected in samples from trees in the semiarid area substantially later on september 25 fig 8a possibly because the trees were water stressed in this period or hydraulic redistribution occurred beyer et al 2016 in contrast no uptake of the artificial tracer was detected in apple trees in the semihumid area at any sampling date fig 8b the difference between trees in the two areas could be due to differences in soil water distributions resulting from spatiotemporal heterogeneity of precipitation wang et al 2011 many trees including apple trees have dimorphic root systems which enable them to switch water sources between shallow and deep soil layers depending on the soil moisture distribution liu et al 2019 therefore soil water conditions in shallow layers will strongly affect apple trees utilization of deep soil water 4 4 implications knowledge of apple trees age and climate dependent water uptake patterns is crucial for formulating robust sustainable apple cultivation and water management strategies we found that stands of different ages showed significantly differing responses to water moisture in the semiarid but not the semihumid area fig 4 however uptake patterns of the trees from shallow soil layers were similar in the two climatic regions fig 7 the youngest 10 year old trees absorbed the largest proportion of water from the 160 300 cm soil layer fig 7a while the 15 and 22 year old trees took up successively more from the shallower layers however mean swc in the 160 300 cm layers decreased with increases in stand age and approached wilting point 5 47 in the 22 year old orchard in the semiarid area fig 7e the variation in shallow soil moisture conditions directly affected the trees utilization of deep soil water in the byf stage apple trees in the semiarid area increased their water uptake depth and obtained more deep soil water presumably in responses that alleviated water stress in addition the proportion of water they absorbed from deep soil layers according to the tracer measurements was positively correlated with their age fig 8a however there is virtually no groundwater recharge exist in apple orchards which rooting depth is deeper than 15 m li et al 2018a so it should be noted that excessive consumption of deep soil water will result in soil drying that is difficult to ameliorate wang et al 2011 if predictions of huang et al 2017 and zhang et al 2016 are accurate the climate of the loess plateau will become drier and warmer in the future this would strongly affect water resources especially soil water availability gao et al 2018a and accelerate deep soil drying posing severe challenges to the sustainability of apple orchards hence it is essential to take appropriate action to prevent development of dsl the critical water demand stage for apple trees is the byf and we found strong consumption of water from the 160 300 cm soil layer by young apple trees in this stage thus supplementary irrigation during this period may be appropriate for young orchards for older apple orchards mulching e g with straw or plastic film and landscaping e g creation of fishponds and rainwater collection and infiltration systems may be good choices for increasing rainfall infiltration and reducing evaporation especially in the semiarid area li et al 2018b in addition climate smart agroforestry could help to conserve soil nutrients and orchard yields thereby assisting efforts to cope with climate change gao et al 2018a 5 conclusions in this study water uptake patterns of apple trees of three ages in two climatic regions of the loess plateau were investigated using both natural δ 2h signatures and 2h2o labeling uptake of shallow 0 300 cm water showed significant seasonal variation that was similar in both climatic regions however there were distinct differences in the trees utilization of deep 400 500 cm soil water between the two regions apple trees exploited deep 400 500 cm soil water in the semiarid area especially in the byf stage and uptake of deep water was positively correlated with the trees age in contrast no uptake of deep water was detected at any stage of the growing season in the semihumid area excessive consumption of deep soil water profoundly affects the sustainability of apple production and the plateau s climate is expected to become drier and warmer thereby exacerbating soil drying hence we do not recommend development of old apple orchards in the semiarid area our results also indicate that supplementary irrigation during the byf stage may be beneficial for young orchards and measures such as mulching and landscaping for old orchards credit authorship contribution statement shaofei

5822,the loess plateau of china is a major apple cultivating region but much of the plateau is water limited and the expansion of apple growing is putting pressure on soil water resources plants water consumption patterns have been intensively studied to facilitate formulation of robust agricultural strategies but previous studies have generally applied indirect methods to characterize their water use moreover the few studies that have applied direct isotopic methods have mostly focused on shallow 0 200 cm soil layers usually in stands of a single age or single climatic region to avoid these limitations we have investigated the primary water sources of apple trees of three ages 10 15 and 22 years in semiarid and semihumid climatic regions of the plateau using both natural stable isotopic signatures δ 2h values and injections of 2h2o into deep soil layers we found that water content in apple orchards soil decreased with increases in depth and stand age and was higher in the semihumid area than in the semiarid area nevertheless patterns of apple trees water uptake from shallow 0 300 cm soil layers were similar in the two climatic regions and the main water sources became shallower with increases in stand age however water uptake from deep 400 500 cm soil layers was also detected particularly in the blossom and young fruit stage in apple orchards of the semiarid area moreover older trees absorbed more water from these layers than younger trees in the semiarid area but not in the semihumid area throughout the growing season excessive consumption of deep soil water inevitably results in deep soil drying and severely threatens the sustainability of apple cultivation our work suggests that it is necessary to take actions e g supplementary irrigation landscaping and mulching combinations to reduce the proportion of deep soil water used by apple trees to prevent the development of dried soil layers it also highlights the need to assess uptake patterns of plants at multiple developmental stages and ages to identify times when and places where interventions may be required or most effective keywords water uptake patterns shallow soil water deep soil water stable isotopes artificial isotopes 1 introduction apples are among the most widely cultivated fruits in the world baldi et al 2013 li et al 2013 large parts of the loess plateau of china have abundant light and heat resources as well as large diurnal temperature ranges and are thus considered suitable for producing high quality apples wang et al 2012 now the apple industry has become the backbone of the local rural economy wang and wang 2017 and the plateau has become the largest area of intensive apple cultivation globally in 2016 the cover and yield of apple trees in the region amounted to 1 31 million hectares and 22 9 million tons accounting for 25 2 and 26 3 of global coverage and production respectively however much of the plateau is water limited and most orchards in the region are cultivated under rain fed conditions song et al 2017 in many parts the limited precipitation is barely sufficient to meet apple orchards high water consumption rates hence the large scale expansion of apple cultivation has changed ecohydrological processes with profound implications for its sustainability in the region in water limited ecosystems soil moisture generated by precipitation is a limiting factor governing vegetation dynamics and ecosystem processes moreno de las heras et al 2011 in turn vegetation affects soil water resources in varying ways depending on the climatic conditions species and stand ages grossiord et al 2017 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2017 when water consumption by plants exceeds soil water supplies water deficits inevitably occur and prolonged excessive consumption causes soil drying and eventually damage to soil structure that is difficult to ameliorate duan et al 2016 jian et al 2015 apple orchards have already caused such damage notably formation of dried soil layers dsl in parts of the plateau wang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 therefore more knowledge of the water consumption patterns of plants including apple trees is urgently required to formulate robust strategies for the sustainable use of water resources and vegetation on the plateau and similar water limited regions there are several traditional techniques to determine plants water consumption generally involving root system excavation and soil water determination ma et al 2019 wang et al 2012 xu and li 2006 these methods can provide valuable snapshots of conditions but provide little information about plants dynamic water uptake processes especially in environments where soil water conditions are highly variable and difficult to predict moreover they provide no direct evidence of water uptake by roots in contrast tracing stable isotope δ 2h and δ 18o signatures provides a powerful reliable and nondestructive approach for studying plants water uptake and utilization dawson and ehleringer 1991 wang et al 2010 by comparing the isotopic composition of xylem water and potential water sources we can identify the water sources used by plants and estimate their proportional contributions dai et al 2015 liu et al 2010 wu et al 2018 most researchers who have applied this approach have focused on plants uptake from shallow 0 200 cm or even 0 100 cm soil layers tang et al 2018 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a however for shrubs or trees with deep root systems this may lead to overestimates of proportional contributions of shallow soil water and neglect of potentially vital contributions of deep soil water especially in arid and semiarid areas uptake of deep soil water by roots is crucial for some plants normal physiological activities bleby et al 2010 maeght et al 2013 and thus must be considered to obtain sufficient understanding of ecohydrological processes a complication is that vertical profiles of δ 2h or δ 18o are often c or s shaped when deep soil layers are considered which must be accounted for in calculations of proportional uptake from different depths stahl et al 2013 a labeling approach that increases the abundance of a monitored isotope in deep soil can provide direct evidence of water uptake from deep layers beyer et al 2016 therefore for plants with deep root systems combining analyses of natural stable isotopic signatures and isotopic labeling might provide more comprehensive information and robust insights a further limitation of previous studies concerning the variation in plants water uptake patterns on the loess plateau is that they have been mostly restricted to catchment scales or specific stand ages tang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 little is known about the water uptake characteristics of apple trees of different ages under different climatic conditions although climatic variables especially precipitation and stand age clearly affect plants water use thus there are urgent needs to study their water uptake patterns in more detail to elucidate their age and developmental stage dependent effects on ecohydrological processes in water limited ecosystems and facilitate formulation of sustainable apple cultivation and water conservation strategies to address these needs we have monitored the seasonal variation of water uptake patterns of apple stands of three ages 10 15 and 22 years in semiarid and semihumid climatic regions of the loess plateau using both natural stable isotope signatures and isotope labeling of deep layers there were two specific objectives first to identify effects of stand age on apple trees shallow soil water use in each climatic region second to elucidate differences in deep soil water use of stands of the three ages in the two climatic regions this was done by measuring stable isotope levels in soil and xylem water samples and soil water content at various depths in apple orchards in the two regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area and experimental sites the study was conducted in 2016 on the loess plateau of china 33 43 41 16 n 100 54 114 33 e which covers 620 000 km2 annual precipitation on the plateau ranges from 150 mm in the northwest to 800 mm in the southeast and 55 78 of the total precipitation falls in june to september jia et al 2017 based on the ratio of mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration p et the plateau has been divided into three climatic regions arid 0 05 0 2 semiarid 0 2 0 5 and semihumid 0 5 0 65 scanlon et al 2006 unesco 1979 the annual average temperature ranges from 3 6 to 14 3 c there are rich solar energy resources with mean annual sunshine hours of 2200 2800 h gao et al 2017 the plateau s surface is covered by a thick layer of loess 100 m thick on average representative sites were selected for sample collection in both the semiarid and semihumid areas of the plateau each hosting apple orchards of three stand ages 10 15 and 22 years the two sites are located in the tianhe watershed baota district yan an and the loess plateau experimental station in qingyang respectively where the p et ratios based on mean precipitation and evapotranspiration from 1995 to 2010 are 0 49 and 0 51 respectively fig 1 both sites are located in the main apple cultivation area of the loess plateau at each site we collected soil and xylem samples from apple orchards of each age the data gathered from the stands are valid for our comparative purposes because all orchards at the same site are located in the same small watershed have similar slopes aspects and soil texture and have been subjected to the same management regimes e g no irrigation with standard clipping and fertilization treatments locations of the stands were recorded with a portable gps receiver in addition the height diameter at breast height and crown dimensions long and short axes of 20 randomly selected trees in each stand were measured with a hypsometer caliper scale and tapeline respectively general information on the apple orchards is presented in table 1 2 2 soil water dynamics simulation 2 2 1 numerical modelling hydrus 2d version 2 03 is reportedly powerful software for simulating two or three dimensional axially symmetric water flow and root water uptake based on finite element numerical solutions of flow equations simunek et al 2006 thus we used it to simulate soil water dynamics in the apple orchards ignoring effects of temperature and gas on soil water movement and assuming that soil is homogeneous and isotropic its two

distribution function and tp is the potential transpiration rate cm 1 d we set the upper boundary to atmospheric boundary conditions left and right boundaries to zero flux conditions and the bottom

prediction program in the rosetta module and then optimized by the inverse solution in hydrus 2d for these parameters 2 2 4 model calibration and evaluation the volumetric water content of soil in the 10 year old apple orchard in the semiarid area yan an was measured using a portable time reflectometry tdr system trime pico iph t3 imko germany during the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 soil water was measured at 20 cm intervals to 280 cm depth once a month with additional monitoring after rain the data acquired in 2016 and 2017 were respectively used to calibrate and validate the hydraulic parameters days were set as the time units in the numerical simulations which ran from may 1 2016 to september 30 2016 and may 1 2017 to september 30 2017 simulated values were compared with observed values and values of the calibrated parameters were selected from the run when simulated and observed values were adequately consistent he et al 2018 the soil hydraulic parameters in 2016 calibration set and 2017 validation set are shown in table 2 the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were used to assess the consistency between the simulations and observations as expressed by the following equations 5 mae i 1 n p i o i n 6 rmse i 1 n p i q i 2 n 7 r 2 1 i 1 n p i q i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of compared values p i is the predicted value o i is the observed value and o is the mean of observed data 2 3 isotopic data collection 2 3 1 fine root collection preliminary investigations about the apple trees root systems distribution were conducted before isotopic sample collection root samples of 10 year old apple trees 0 800 cm were collected in trisection radiation from the representative tree trunk at 0 5 m distance using a hand auger with 90 mm diameter in may 2016 li et al 2017 collected root samples were poured into a sieve 0 2 mm 25 cm diameter 7 5 cm height and then washed carefully with tap water to remove all unnecessary soil roots which 2 mm in diameter are the primary organ of absorbing water and nutrients in forest systems ceccon et al 2011 the fine roots were scanned using a scanner at 300 dpi and then the fine root length was determined using winrhizo software version 5 0 regent instruments inc quebec canada the fine root length density frld m m 3 in each sample was then calculated by dividing the obtained length of fine roots by the volume of the sample 2 3 2 sampling natural stable isotopes plant and soil samples were collected from the orchards in the following three developmental stages in 2016 blossom and young fruit byf may fruit swelling fsw july and fruit maturation ftm september on each sampling occasion three apple trees in each orchard were randomly selected xylem and soil samples were collected concurrently between 8 00 and 12 00 when the trees were actively transpiring wang et al 2010 three suberized twigs 0 3 0 5 cm diameter ca 10 cm long and near the tree trunk were cut from the sunny side of each sampling tree and the bark phloem and cambium were removed from them then each debarked twig was cut into 1 cm segments which were immediately placed in vials that were sealed with parafilm and placed in a box with ice for transportation to the laboratory where they were stored in a refrigerator until water extraction after xylem sampling soil samples were collected with a hand auger from shallow soil layers at 10 20 and 40 cm intervals from the 0 20 20 80 and 80 300 cm layers respectively the soil samples depth of 300 cm was determined because 70 of apple tree roots were distributed in the 0 300 cm soil layers and there was a distinct gradient in δ 2h values existed in this layer which meeting requirements for use of isotopic mixing models to distinguish primary water sources each soil sample was divided into two parts one of which was placed in a vial and stored identically to the xylem samples for isotopic determination while the other was used to obtain the gravimetric soil water content swc by oven drying 2 3 3 isotope labeling experiments to obtain complementary information on deep soil water use three trees in each orchard with similar height crown diameter and diameter at breast height were randomly selected for inclusion in a 2h2o tracer experiment in 2016 a day before tracer injection a 400 cm hole was drilled 50 cm from the trunk of each selected tree using a hand auger a 400 cm long polyvinyl chloride pipe was inserted into the holes to inject tracer at the target depth 400 cm then 150 ml of 10 2h2o solution 15 ml 99 99 2h2o plus 135 ml tap water prepared in advance was injected into each hole a previous preliminary experiment showed that this treatment increased swc 24 h after injection by less than 1 which is negligible for soil hydrological processes after the 2h2o injection the polyvinyl chloride pipe was removed and the hole was sealed we collected xylem samples in the 7 days following each injection to detect possible tracer uptake by the trees the first 2h2o tracer injection was conducted in may and the xylem samples were collected 2 4 and 7 days after the injection assuming that the 2h concentration in the soil would steadily decline as a result of soil water transport and uptake by roots in july we applied a second tracer injection identical to the first in terms of volume and concentration and collected xylem samples 2 and 7 days later xylem samples were also collected from the labeled trees at the end of september at the same time that xylem samples were collected from labeled trees corresponding samples were collected from unlabeled trees in the same orchards to acquire background isotope concentrations if a sample had a 2h concentration that was at least two standard deviations sd higher than the background value tracer was assumed to be present kulmatiski et al 2010 2 4 isotopic analysis the water in xylem and soil samples was extracted using a li 2000 cryogenic vacuum distillation system los gatos research mountain view usa transferred to 5 ml glass vials and stored at 4 c until analysis the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of extracted water were then determined using a tiwa 45ep isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy analyzer los gatos research mountain view usa methanol contamination in the plant samples was corrected by correction equation which acquired through calibration test of methanol contamination spectrum as expressed by the following equations 8 δ d t δ d m 0 0247 l n m 3 0 0749 l n m 2 1 2613 l n m 1 0182 where δdt is the true value δdm is the measure value m is the methanol value 2 5 determination of plant water sources the bayesian isotope mixing model mixsir 1 0 4 which accounts for uncertainties associated with multiple sources moore and semmens 2008 was used to calculate proportional contributions of water from considered soil layers to water extracted from the xylem samples the two study areas are both covered by thick loess soils and groundwater is too deep for plants roots to absorb moreover all the experimental apple orchards are rainfed thus soil water is the primary water source for plants in the orchards and on the plateau generally fan et al 2016 based on distributions of soil water content swc and δ 2h values the entire shallow soil profile 0 300 cm was divided into three potential soil water sources 0 40 40 160 and 160 300 cm layers both swc and δ 2h values were most variable in the 0 40 layer and most stable in the 160 300 cm layer the mean δ 2h values and their standard deviations in each of these potential water sources and the xylem samples were respectively used as source and mixture data for the model the fractionation factor was set to zero because no isotope fractionation is believed to occur during water uptake ehleringer and dawson 1992 2 6 statistics distributions of the swc and δ 2h values of both xylem and soil water samples met requirements for analysis of variance anova therefore differences in δ 2h values of xylem water among sampling dates were evaluated by one way anova two way anova was applied to detect differences in swc and δ 2h of soil water between sampling dates and depths as well as in contributions of the three water sources soil layers to xylem water between sampling dates least significant difference lsd post hoc tests with α 0 05 were used to identify significant between date and between depth differences 3 results 3 1 precipitation and soil moisture dynamics total precipitation in the study year 2016 amounted to 502 2 and 478 4 mm in the semiarid and semihumid areas respectively which were both defined as normal precipitation years in both cases 90 of the precipitation occurred during the growing season additionally the highest monthly precipitation was 175 4 mm in july in the semiarid area and 105 6 mm in june in the semihumid area in the highest single precipitation events 89 5 and 66 9 mm of rain fell in these areas respectively in both cases in july the precipitation in 2016 was 28 2 greater than in 2015 in the semiarid area but 10 6 lower than in 2015 in the semihumid area fig 2 fig 3 shows the observed and simulated soil water dynamics of 10 year old apple orchard in semiarid area in 2016 and 2017 the results suggest that there is a strong correlation between the simulated and observed volumetric water content for both 5 soil layers mae rmse and r2 ranged from 0 5 to 2 1 0 5 to 3 2 and 80 0 to 92 4 respectively table 3 these data confirmed the suitability of hydrus 2d for simulating water dynamics in the area at least under the range of precipitation conditions during the monitoring period based on the united states department of agriculture s classification system the soils at the two sites are similar silt loam with 15 8 clay 59 4 silt and 18 2 sand contents in yan an and 22 6 clay 51 5 silt and 26 5 sand contents in qingyang thus data acquired at the yan an site were used to calibrate parameters for numerical simulations with the hydrus 2d model of the soil water dynamics of the orchards in both the semiarid and semihumid regions of the plateau the volumetric soil water content vswc of all six orchards displayed clear seasonal and vertical variations throughout the growing season and differed with stand age and climate fig 4 due to the typical effects of rainfall infiltration and evapotranspiration the vswc showed markedly high temporal variations in 0 100 cm soil layers than in deeper layers in the semiarid area desiccation occurred at 160 300 160 240 and 100 300 cm depths in the 10 15 and 22 year old orchards respectively the vswc of all orchards decreased with increasing stand age in both the semiarid and semihumid areas although the total precipitation in the semiarid area was slightly higher than in the semihumid area in 2016 the vswc in the profile was lower in the semiarid area than in the semihumid area during the byf stage from the 121th to 150th day fig 4 this difference is mainly attributed to the impact of precipitation in the preceding year which as mentioned above was substantially higher in the semihumid area 534 9 mm than in the semiarid area 391 7 mm fig 2 overall as expected orchards in the semihumid area had higher soil water contents than those in the semiarid area 3 2 δ 2h values in xylem and soil water the δ 2h values in xylem water from trees in stands of different ages varied substantially during the growth period in the two climatic regions fig 5 the xylem water δ 2h of 10 year old trees fluctuated most during the growing season varying from 66 7 to 53 3 in the semiarid area and from 68 9 to 57 3 in the semihumid area the variation in δ 2h in xylem water from the 15 and 22 year old trees showed similar temporal trends in the two climatic regions falling between the byf and fsw stages then increasing between the fsw and ftm stages there were marked variations with both depth and sampling date in δ 2h values of shallow soil layers in both climatic regions fig 6 the values were more negative in 40 300 cm layers than in 0 40 cm soil layers of all the orchards in the byf and ftm stages but they were more negative in the 0 40 cm layers in the fsw stage possibly due to infiltration of precipitation with strongly negative values in summer events hence the soil water δ 2h fluctuated more strongly in the upper 40 cm layers ranging from 69 87 to 21 69 in the semiarid area and from 87 53 to 17 47 in the semihumid area than in the 40 300 cm layers as soil depth increased the influences of precipitation weakened the δ 2h values in the 40 300 cm soil layers were relatively stable and did not significantly differ among sampling dates 3 3 water uptake patterns analysis of the δ 2h values of xylem and soil water revealed significant variation in contributions of three potential soil water sources of the apple trees throughout the growing season in the two climatic regions fig 7 in the byf stage when precipitation was relatively light and evaporation strong the swc values in the shallow layers were relatively low and the trees took up correspondingly large proportions of water from deeper layers for example 15 year old trees in the semiarid area took up 48 3 of their xylem water from the 40 160 cm soil layers in the semiarid area similarly 10 year old trees took up 44 8 of their xylem water from the below 160 cm soil layers in the semiarid area and the 10 and 15 year old trees respectively took up 63 4 and 41 8 from the below 160 cm layers in the semihumid area during this stage as precipitation infiltrated in the ftm stage 10 and 15 year old apple trees showed great plasticity in their water uptake patterns switching their main water source to the 0 40 cm soil layers which respectively accounted for 43 6 and 44 8 of the xylem water for 10 and 15 year old trees in the semiarid area and 63 4 and 41 8 in the semihumid area respectively fig 7a d the 22 year old apple trees in the two climatic regions showed similar water uptake patterns they primarily derived water from 0 160 cm soil layers 73 6 and 71 7 in byf and fsw stages in the semiarid area respectively 71 5 and 89 1 in these stages in the semihumid area respectively then switched to 0 40 cm soil layers 48 5 and 58 4 in the semiarid and semihumid areas respectively in the ftm stage when the water in the upper layers was replenished fig 7e and f 3 4 variations in the isotopic label the temporal variation in 2h concentrations in the xylem of monitored trees following 2h2o injections provided direct evidence of deep root water uptake fig 8 with differences associated with both stand age and climatic region in the semiarid area 22 year old apple trees absorbed water from 400 500 cm soil layers rapidly fig 8a as manifested by significantly elevated 2h values of samples taken two days after the injections then δ 2h values progressively increased to 43 78 30 8 higher than the background value by the seventh day in contrast no artificial tracer was detected in xylem of 10 and 15 year old trees 2 and 4 days after labeling but by the seventh day their δ 2h values were significantly 18 4 and 21 9 respectively higher than the background values no evidence of uptake of labelled water by the trees was found in the seven days following the second injection but clear signs of uptake were observed on september 25 no uptake of the labeled water in any of the three apple orchards at any stage of the sampling campaign was detected in the semihumid area fig 8b 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty in the soil moisture simulation hydrus 2d accurately captured temporal and spatial dynamics of soil moisture according to comparison of observed and simulated values with both mae and rmse 3 2 and r2 consistently 80 0 table 3 this may be to the reasons of the application of inverse solution in the acquisition of parameters nascimento et al 2018 had demonstrated good similarity between field measured data and data fitted by inverse solution and hydrus inverse solution is a useful technique for rapid characterization of the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties rashid et al 2015 these results confirm numerous previous demonstrations that hydrus 2d has high ability to simulate soil moisture dynamics under diverse conditions autovino et al 2018 cai et al 2018 karandish and šimůnek 2019 nevertheless there are clearly uncertainties in soil moisture simulations by hydrus 2d due to uncertainties in multiple soil meteorology and plant parameters for example neural network prediction program in the rosetta module was used to predict the soil hydraulic parameters in the loess plateau lü et al 2009 random aspects of sedimentation processes during formation of soils on the plateau resulted in significant spatial variability in soil physical and chemical properties which inevitably affect movements of soil moisture and then impact on the simulation effect notably the simulation of soil moisture was less accurate for the 160 300 cm soil layers than for other layers following extreme rainfall 108 mm on july 3 2016 possibly due to preferential flow leading to increases in soil moisture in the 160 300 cm soil layers that the model did not account for moreover the root distribution is simply described by hydrus 2d with just six parameters maximum rooting depth and radius maximum rooting intensity depth and radius dimensionless parameter pz and px which is clearly insufficient for detailed simulation of root water uptake 4 2 seasonal and regional variations of water uptake patterns the δ 2h values of soil water in the apple orchards exhibited significant seasonal patterns in both climatic regions fig 6 and they were intimately associated with precipitation infiltration and evaporation which differed in the two regions this directly caused variations in δ 2h values of xylem water in the trees throughout the growing season within and between the two climatic regions fig 5 therefore there were distinct seasonal and spatial variations in the trees water sources which also varied among orchards of different ages fig 7 the mixsir 1 0 4 based analysis detected apparently adaptive water use by the 10 and 15 year old apple trees in the semiarid area which switched their primary water sources from 160 300 or 40 160 cm soil layers to 0 40 cm soil layers as the growing season progressed fig 7a and c this is consistent with findings of several previous studies that plants absorbed water predominantly from deep soil layers during drought periods gao et al 2018b song et al 2016 and switched to shallow soil layers during other periods yang et al 2015 in contrast the 22 year old trees predominately acquired water from 0 160 cm soil layers and the proportional contribution of water from 160 300 cm layers decreased throughout the growing season this could be ascribed to relatively low swc in the 160 300 cm soil layers due to continuous consumption fig 7e this result partially differs from findings of zhao et al 2018 that shallow 0 40 cm layers were not the primary sources for 22 year old jujube trees in the semiarid area possibly due to differences in soil water availability apple trees in the semihumid area showed similar water use patterns to those in the semiarid area 10 and 15 year old trees shifted their water sources from the 160 300 cm to 0 40 cm soil layers and 22 year old trees mainly exploited water from the 0 160 cm soil layers throughout the growing season fig 7b d and f in addition the proportional contributions of water in the 160 300 cm layers were significantly higher in the byf stage than in the ftm stage for trees of all three ages p 0 05 this could be due to relatively low availability of water in the 0 160 cm layers due to relatively high evapotranspiration and low precipitation in the byf stage fig 7b d and f interestingly despite swc in the 0 40 cm soil layers increasing significantly due to heavy rainfall in the fsw stage the proportional use of shallow water by the 15 and 22 year old trees did not increase fig 7d and f similar studies in water limited ecosystems have detected a time lag in plants switches to different water sources following precipitation mediated increases in water availability in shallow layers huo et al 2018 wu et al 2016 other studies have also detected a time lag between water shortage and plants responses vicente serrano et al 2013 yang et al 2015 nevertheless the proportional contribution of the 0 40 cm soil water for 10 year old apple trees increased significantly in the fsw stage in marked contrast to the observed pattern for older trees fig 7b this could be partly due to root systems of younger trees having higher sensitivity to water skubel et al 2015 also found that young stands may be more suitable than older stands in warm environments with variable precipitation hence both the likelihood of such time lags and their duration if they occur may be related to stand age trees of all three ages obtained the largest proportions of their water from the 0 40 cm soil layers in the ftm age and the swc in these layers was correspondingly low fig 7b normally plants roots obtain resources from upper soil layers when available as the energy costs are lower and both water and nutrient availability are generally high in the upper layers schenk 2008 4 3 water uptake dynamics from deep soil layers the water extracted from deep soil is important for plants growth especially in dry periods and significantly contributes to drought avoidance yang et al 2017 thus to obtain more comprehensive information about the trees water uptake patterns 2h2o tracer was injected at 400 cm depth and concentrations of 2h in xylem samples were measured to investigate their deep soil water uptake dynamics fig 8 the artificial tracer was detected in xylem of apple trees as expected fig 8a given that roots of apple trees at full productive age could reach depths of 10 m and the roots were deeper as the stand age increasing zhang et al 2017b li et al 2019 water uptake from deep soil layers 400 500 cm was detected in byf in apple orchards of the semiarid area it maybe because precipitation in byf was relatively less and evaporation was strong resulting in relatively low soil water content in shallow layers meanwhile byf is the critical period of water demand for apple trees and the swc in 400 cm depth was higher than its in shallow layers 0 300 cm fig s1 in this period so apple trees would take up more deep soil water when shallow soil water rarely suffices the demand interestingly in the semiarid area 22 year old apple trees absorbed deep 400 500 cm soil water rapidly within 2 days but the younger trees absorbed it after a longer delay fig 8a according to the criterion of xylem 2h concentrations being at least two standard deviations sd higher than the background value there are several possible explanations for such uptake first some roots capable of taking up water may be present at the labeling depth second hydraulic redistribution of water from deep to upper soil layers may occur enabling shallow roots to absorb it bleby et al 2010 scott et al 2008 third deep water may be rapidly accessed and transferred through mycorrhizae plamboeck et al 2007 it should be noted that 2h xylem concentrations increased more rapidly in the 22 year old trees than in the younger trees indicating that older trees might have higher transpiration requirements this inference is consistent with findings by wang and wang 2017 that apple trees daily transpiration and evapotranspiration rates are positively correlated with age furthermore the 22 year old trees were markedly larger than the younger trees table 1 and recent research suggests that canopy cover is the primary driver of orchards water consumption dzikiti et al 2018 in addition evidence of uptake of the injected 2h2o was detected in samples from trees in the semiarid area substantially later on september 25 fig 8a possibly because the trees were water stressed in this period or hydraulic redistribution occurred beyer et al 2016 in contrast no uptake of the artificial tracer was detected in apple trees in the semihumid area at any sampling date fig 8b the difference between trees in the two areas could be due to differences in soil water distributions resulting from spatiotemporal heterogeneity of precipitation wang et al 2011 many trees including apple trees have dimorphic root systems which enable them to switch water sources between shallow and deep soil layers depending on the soil moisture distribution liu et al 2019 therefore soil water conditions in shallow layers will strongly affect apple trees utilization of deep soil water 4 4 implications knowledge of apple trees age and climate dependent water uptake patterns is crucial for formulating robust sustainable apple cultivation and water management strategies we found that stands of different ages showed significantly differing responses to water moisture in the semiarid but not the semihumid area fig 4 however uptake patterns of the trees from shallow soil layers were similar in the two climatic regions fig 7 the youngest 10 year old trees absorbed the largest proportion of water from the 160 300 cm soil layer fig 7a while the 15 and 22 year old trees took up successively more from the shallower layers however mean swc in the 160 300 cm layers decreased with increases in stand age and approached wilting point 5 47 in the 22 year old orchard in the semiarid area fig 7e the variation in shallow soil moisture conditions directly affected the trees utilization of deep soil water in the byf stage apple trees in the semiarid area increased their water uptake depth and obtained more deep soil water presumably in responses that alleviated water stress in addition the proportion of water they absorbed from deep soil layers according to the tracer measurements was positively correlated with their age fig 8a however there is virtually no groundwater recharge exist in apple orchards which rooting depth is deeper than 15 m li et al 2018a so it should be noted that excessive consumption of deep soil water will result in soil drying that is difficult to ameliorate wang et al 2011 if predictions of huang et al 2017 and zhang et al 2016 are accurate the climate of the loess plateau will become drier and warmer in the future this would strongly affect water resources especially soil water availability gao et al 2018a and accelerate deep soil drying posing severe challenges to the sustainability of apple orchards hence it is essential to take appropriate action to prevent development of dsl the critical water demand stage for apple trees is the byf and we found strong consumption of water from the 160 300 cm soil layer by young apple trees in this stage thus supplementary irrigation during this period may be appropriate for young orchards for older apple orchards mulching e g with straw or plastic film and landscaping e g creation of fishponds and rainwater collection and infiltration systems may be good choices for increasing rainfall infiltration and reducing evaporation especially in the semiarid area li et al 2018b in addition climate smart agroforestry could help to conserve soil nutrients and orchard yields thereby assisting efforts to cope with climate change gao et al 2018a 5 conclusions in this study water uptake patterns of apple trees of three ages in two climatic regions of the loess plateau were investigated using both natural δ 2h signatures and 2h2o labeling uptake of shallow 0 300 cm water showed significant seasonal variation that was similar in both climatic regions however there were distinct differences in the trees utilization of deep 400 500 cm soil water between the two regions apple trees exploited deep 400 500 cm soil water in the semiarid area especially in the byf stage and uptake of deep water was positively correlated with the trees age in contrast no uptake of deep water was detected at any stage of the growing season in the semihumid area excessive consumption of deep soil water profoundly affects the sustainability of apple production and the plateau s climate is expected to become drier and warmer thereby exacerbating soil drying hence we do not recommend development of old apple orchards in the semiarid area our results also indicate that supplementary irrigation during the byf stage may be beneficial for young orchards and measures such as mulching and landscaping for old orchards credit authorship contribution statement shaofei

5823,the increasing availability of high resolution terrain data fostered the development of two dimensional hydrodynamic based surface runoff models at basin scale for flood hazard assessment and mapping purposes the generation of the computational domain is one of the most important preliminary steps for practical applications of this kind of modeling several studies can be found in the technical literature showing the influence exerted by the computational grid type used on the results in terms of water depth flow velocity and discharge several approaches were proposed for the mesh generation even though in practice it is subject to the modeller choice and experience in any case the reason why a specific mesh is used is rarely discussed and its impact on the model results in terms of outflow hydrographs runoff volumes and flooded areas extent is seldom analysed in this work a rigorous approach for an a priori design of a computational grid is proposed the a priori term suggests that the proposed procedure aims at generating a computational mesh close to the optimal one in a time saving process which is not based on trial meshes and trial simulations namely the process is based on the application of the two dimensional fourier analysis to a high resolution digital elevation model in order to compute the power spectrum and finally to identify the significant waves lengths and the characteristic scales the latter ones are located in the catchment and used for the generation of a computational grid characterized by different elements size the simulations of surface runoff at a basin scale have shown that the application of the proposed method for the a priori construction of the grid leads to the generation of a computational mesh which reduces the calculation time by approximately 87 if compared to a fine grid taken as reference with negligible errors on outflow hydrographs and flooded areas extent keywords hydrodynamic based rainfall runoff modelling computational grid spectral analysis spatial scales overland flow model direct rainfall method 1 introduction recently lidar technologies provide high resolution topography geomorphology and hydrography data sets at relative low cost their increasing availability fostered the development of physically based distributed models for rainfall runoff analysis zhang et al 2016 that have the merit to provide the description of the spatial variation of the variables throughout the basin in this sense they represent a more detailed approach than the classic lumped models the increasing use of high performance computing techniques helped in a dramatically reduction of the overall simulation cost of this kind of modeling petaccia et al 2016 lacasta et al 2015 vacondio et al 2014 xia et al 2019 sanders and schubert 2019 therefore the application of two dimensional shallow water models 2d swes for the description of hydrodynamic based surface runoff computations in rainfall runoff simulations at the catchment scale is becoming a reference approach as testified by the plethora of studies in the related literature cea et al 2010 cea et al 2014 yeh et al 2011 costabile et al 2012 costabile et al 2013 caviedes voullième et al 2012 simons et al 2014 liang et al 2015 singh et al 2014 huang et al 2015 cea and bladé 2015 fernández pato and garcia navarro 2016 fernández pato et al 2016 bellos and tsakiris 2016 xia et al 2017 fernández pato et al 2018 bout and jetten 2018 hou et al 2018 xia and liang 2018 macchione et al 2019 this approach sometimes referred as direct rainfall method yu and harbor 2019 jamali et al 2019 consists in the application of rainfall to each cell of the two dimensional domain the consequent runoff is then routed by the 2d hydrodynamic model this approach seems to be attractive for modelers and scientists because it significantly reduces the need for hydrologic modelling for the runoff estimation and consequently the number of models for generation and propagation of surface runoff at a basin scale hall 2015 finally it has been recently observed that the hydrodynamic based rainfall runoff simulations can shed new light to the analysis of basin drainage networks introducing novel scaling laws and an innovative method for channel heads detection costabile et al 2019 besides the rainfall estimation that proved to be a fundamental data to obtain reliable results fraga et al 2019 one of the key preliminary steps for the application of the physically based distributed modelling based on the 2 d swes is the generation of a computational mesh the grid design involves two interrelated issues degree of accuracy and computational costs which need to be somewhat balanced besides the expected reduction of numerical errors due to the spatial and temporal discretization of the chosen model a fine mesh may be essential to reproduce important flow paths in areas of high topographic variability or to describe sharp flow features see for example costabile and macchione 2015 costabile et al 2015a b at the same time the computational costs will significantly increase because it is inversely proportional to the third power of the cell size kim et al 2014 furthermore though not considered in this work the computational grid can affect the infiltration process that is a dominant component of the hydrologic water loss since it strongly depends on the residence time of the surface water in the cells the impact of mesh type and resolution on the flood propagation was extensively discussed for example horritt and bates 2002 analysed the results obtained using both 1d and 2d models showing that the simulated topographic properties had a major effect on the simulations and that topography played a significant role in flood inundation patterns as they develop over time similarly tsubaki and kawahara 2013 showed a shallower and faster flood propagation when moving from coarser to finer grid with the same roughness parameter this is essentially due to the smoothing effect of the elevation distribution induced by a coarse grid that therefore cannot adequately solve rapidly varied 2d flow regarding the mesh type some studies concluded that there is no an optimal choice for 2d flood modelling because each element type e g triangle and quadrilateral is advantageous under different circumstances kim et al 2014 for this reason some studies suggested the use of a mixed mesh hoch et al 2018 bomers et al 2019 or adaptive grids hu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 savant et al 2019 for maximum versatility in practical applications others studies focused on mesh refinement by the detection of key topographic features where the high resolution mesh is needed while the mesh in the rest of the domain remains coarse hou et al 2018 the grid size effect could be considered as a part of a much wider context related to the analysis of the effects and implications of dem resolution on the characterization of surface microtopography quantification of hydrologic connectivity and simulation of hydrologic processes at the catchment scale for example yu and harbor 2019 have shown that coarser dem resolutions overestimated the hydrologic connectivity and underestimated the maximum depression storage as a result surface runoff was increased and filling time of depressions was reduced bringing to significant alterations of the overland flow patterns and of the response mechanisms furthermore habtezion et al 2016 highlighted that coarser resolution dems tended to underestimate discharge peaks in comparison with fine resolution dems however they showed that resolutions up to a threshold of 10 m did provide comparable simulation results other studies demonstrated that the dem resolution could have serious implications on the values of the hydrologically important spatial indices derived from the dem itself vaze et al 2010 in addition hancock 2005 stated that the area slope relationship cumulative area distribution width function and strahler statistics are sensitive to digital elevation model grid scale while the hypsometric curve was not confirming that hillslope detail is lost at grid scales greater than 10 m as provided by zhang and montgomery 1994 by contrast thomas et al 2017 identified a 1 2 m resolution dems as the optimal for runoff generating areas in complex agricultural catchments the spatial and statistical distribution of derived hydrological attributes at the field scale as a function of dem resolution has been explored also by woodrow et al 2016 who showed that coarser resolution dems resulted in a mixture of larger and severely truncated field catchments due to the inability of coarser scale to accurately represent within field low relief ridges that serve as salient drainage divides according to ariza villaverde et al 2015 high dem resolutions provided accurate drainage networks especially in case of dense drainage network if the drainage network is sparse the influence of the dem resolution was found less significant ying et al 2014 pointed out that higher resolution dems generally result in improved stream network and watershed boundary representations but the improvements in the description of the hydrographic network do not necessarily result in improved streamflow simulations modellers are aware of the importance of size assumption in the design of a mesh but in practice mesh resolution is subject to their practical experience in any case the reason why a specific mesh is used is rarely discussed and its impact on outflow hydrographs and runoff volumes is seldom analysed therefore despite the importance of this issue highlighted in the studies mentioned above this is an evident gap in the literature from a numerical point of view a mesh quality index could be introduced based on numerical convergence analysis caviedes voullième et al 2012 alternatively the modeler can define a pre fixed number of meshes having different resolution in channels floodplains and hillslopes to realize the response to spatial resolution hardy et al 1999 in this sense the design of the grid is an a posteriori operation with respect to the numerical simulation based on different runs of the 2 d hydrodynamic model that unavoidably leads to a very time consuming overall process in this work the authors intend to address the mesh generation problem and the associated issues related to accuracy and computational costs providing a novel point of view the idea is to propose a rigorous approach based on the hypothesis that an a priori mesh closer to the optimal one based on the maximum resolution in the available topography data can be built the a priori term suggests that the proposed procedure aims at generating a reliable computational mesh in a time saving process which is not based on trial meshes and simulations the key assumption of this new method is that each natural catchment contains characteristic scales namely characteristics lengths that can be used in the construction of a computational mesh capable of reproducing faithfully the catchment topography therefore the novel contribution provided by this paper is to explore a peculiar range of characteristic scales that can be directly employed in the computational mesh generation process for the application of 2d swe model for the description of hydrodynamic based surface runoff simulations at the catchment scale this paper is organized as follows the proposed method to generate an a priori grid is presented in section 2 followed by the description of the case studies chosen in this work section 3 section 4 is devoted to the results and relative discussion in which the benefits of the proposed mesh generation method are shown in terms of accuracy and computational times finally the conclusions are reported in section 5 2 proposed method the method proposed in this paper takes advance of the invariant scales hypothesis ansoult 1989 in a natural catchment generating the computational mesh according to specific peculiarities of the catchment this hypothesis asserts that spatial scales representing characteristic dimensions are capable of correctly fitting the local trend of the topography perron et al 2008 specifically a two dimensional spectral analysis based on the discrete fourier transform is chosen as a tool to define the characteristic scales through the spectral analysis the entire range of wavelengths contained in a natural catchment could be explored to isolate the most appropriate range for an a priori design of a reliable grid which preserves the main dem morphological features like slopes and watershed network the steps of the proposed procedure are described in fig 1 hence the procedure needs a digital elevation model xyz matrix as starting point to describe the watershed step 1 in fig 1 according to priestley 1981 and maus and dimri 1995 the fourier transform provides reliable results only if the signal represented by z x y satisfies the quasi periodicity condition namely the dem should have a null mean and an approximately constant variance to respect the quasi periodicity condition the dem can be interpolated using a linear polynomial surface lps step 2 in fig 1 and then the lps is subtracted from the dem step 3 as suggested by perron et al 2008 and shown in fig 2 step 4 of the procedure is based on the use of the discrete fourier transform dft which transforms the real space domain into a complex function in the frequency domain for two dimensional data the dft z is defined as priestley 1981 1 z k x k y m 0 n x 1 n 0 n y 1 z m δ x n δ y e 2 π k x m n x k y n n y where k x and k y are the wavenumbers in x and y direction n x n y is the dem dimension having a resolution of δ x in x direction and δ y in y direction m and n are the indexes of elevation the function z m δ x n δ y along x and y respectively the frequency of a generic element in k x k y position is defined as 2 f x k x n x δ x f y k y n y δ y where n x 2 k x n x 2 1 and n y 2 1 k y n y 2 the maximum resolved frequencies are the well known nyquist frequencies which can be defined as f x max 1 2 δ x and f y max 1 2 δ y for a grid discretized by δ x and δ y following the parseval s theorem the energy of a signal is equivalent in the frequency domain and the real domain thus the power spectrum p dft indicated in step 5 of fig 1 can be calculated as 3 p dft k x k y 1 n x 2 n y 2 z k x k y 2 also for non periodic signals like the elevation signal in real catchments perron et al 2008 since in a real catchment the z x y signal is not strictly periodic the dft needs the use of a wide range of sinusoidal functions including some spurious ones to describe it properly these spurious functions may influence significantly the spectrum in order to mitigate their effects the windowing process harris 1978 was applied here several window functions were tested geckinli and yavuz 1978 harris 1978 and the tukey s windows function was chosen priestley 1981 since it filtered a larger number of noise peaks if compared to the other functions ferraro et al 2019 step 6 of the proposed procedure consists in the switch from a two dimensional 2d spectrum to a one dimensional 1d one to facilitate the identification of the characteristic scales specifically radial average was chosen kirby 2005 sidick 2009 as shown in fig 3 a in a fixed range of frequency a scaling law f α is recognizable being α a rational number hough 1989 steyn and ayotte 1985 the next step of the procedure step 7 is the characteristic scales identification which is performed using a different idea with respect to the perron method consisting in pre multiplying the 1d spectrum by the scaling law f α p dft as shown in fig 3b bullock et al 1978 jimenez 1998 kim and adrian 1999 guala et al 2006 this technique emphasizes the energy peaks in the frequency range characterized by the scaling law finally the corresponding energy peak frequencies can be related to the characteristic scale sizes which can be used as a base length of the computational mesh according to bout and jetten 2018 length scales greater than 40 m corresponding to frequencies lower than 157 1 m can be a priori neglected since they could generate coarse meshes unreliable for practical applications once the peaks of the spectrum are identified the frequencies can be switch in wavelength as l 2 π f where f is the frequency related to the chosen scale the next step step 8 is the identification of the position of the characteristic scales in the real domain this can be performed applying band pass filters to the 2d dft z k x k y in order to isolate the characteristic scales finally the inverse fourier transform ift can be performed to obtain a filtered signal z x y from z k x k y step 9 the last step is the generation of a new dem composed by the filtered scales and finally the traces of the filtered scales can be placed in the real space domain using a gis software step 10 the proposed procedure is automatic except for the step n 7 that is left to the user choice moreover the method is very fast the computational time was two or three minutes for the considered basins using a serial code in matlab environment and a personal computer processor amd ryzen 7 2007 3 description of the analyzed catchments in this section the

region south of italy the area of the extracted sub catchment is 22 5 km2 with an elevation between 1015 to 112 m above sea level and catchment mean slope of 18 6 agricultural and wooded areas represent the dominant land use while urbanisation is less than 2 of the total catchment area an airborne lidar sensor riegl lms q560 was used to cover the catchment area providing a sampling density of four points over 1 m2 from lidar data different kinds of dem digital surface model digital terrain model with and without buildings and other objects surmounting the ground etc with resolution up to 0 5 m were produced and used in this paper this basin will be referred in the following as catchment n 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 application of the proposed method at the catchment n 1 and a priori design of the grid following the procedure described in section 2 and shown in fig 1 the pre multiplied spectrum obtained for the first catchment is shown in fig 6 a fig 6b representing the most interesting part of fig 6a shows the energy peaks into the filtered range of wavelength switching from the frequency domain to the real one the characteristic scales l 1 2 6 m and l 2 13 9 m resulted from the proposed procedure in fig 6 b the large scale peak is well identified by the bulge in the spectrum whereas the smaller scale seems less evident the first point in the spectrum shows the highest energy level but the associated scale is related to the lidar resolution being a trivial solution hence we took the smallest peak frequency as the non trivial scale once the characteristic scales were defined their position in the real space is required fig 7 shows the filtered scales in the real domain according to perron et al 2008 the planimetric traces of the filtered scales are located where morphological discontinuities appear changes in slope macro roughness elements 1 m levees once scales dimension and their position in the real space are defined it is possible to use these information for the discretization of the catchment through an unstructured computational grid a non uniform resolution was chosen to consider the two characteristic scale dimensions obtained by the proposed procedure the resulting computational grid which will be referred to as a priori grid in the following is a triangular unstructured mesh of 74 184 elements of edges ranging from l 1 to l 2 see fig 8 c 4 2 application of the proposed method at the catchment n 2 and design of the a priori grids the result of the application of the proposed methodology to the catchment n 2 is shown in fig 9 where two scales l 5 2 26 m and l 6 25 54 m are identified applying the ift through the band pass filter the filtered scales are located into the real space as shown in fig 10 to represent the second catchment an unstructured triangular grid of 725 422 elements was generated the edges of which vary from l 5 to l 6 was considered as a result of the proposed procedure see fig 11 c 4 3 performances of the a priori grids the evaluation of the performances of the a priori grids will be organized according to two different point of views attention will be focused first on some topographic features of the designed grids in relation to two other reference grids in particular the first one is a very fine grid that tries to exploit as much as possible the original lidar resolution representing therefore the most accurate computational domain fine grid hereafter on the contrary the second one is much coarser and has been generated assuming the triangular side of the computational element equal to 10 m coarse grid hereafter the latter choice is based on the suggestions extrapolated by literature review presented in the introduction according to which resolution up to 10 m does not influence the most important geomorphologic indices flow patterns and basin hydrologic responses to a rainfall input the second analysis performed here is based on the effects on hydrologic and hydraulic variables it will be discussed performing 2 d swes simulations at the catchment scale using the three grids considered before 4 3 1 topographic analysis of the a priori grids the analysis will be essentially devoted to cross sections as mentioned before in order to have some reference solution we have considered two other grids with uniform resolution throughout the basins as regards the catchment n 1 we have considered a uniform triangular mesh of 1 055 582 elements of l 3 2 0 m side fig 8b as for catchment n 2 the refined grid has a uniform triangular mesh resolution with the cell side l 3 3 0 m so that the computational domain has 5 785 206 elements fig 11b it has to be pointed out that the 3 m resolution was the best the authors could achieve in order to create a uniform mesh over the whole catchment a grid made of too many elements and difficult to be handled would have resulted if a 2 m dimension was imposed this consideration refers to the computational times of the 2d swes model since the proposed methodology for the scale detection is very fast the consequence of this limitation was that for the catchment n 2 the fine grid accuracy was lower than the a priori grid accuracy in the main channel this limitation will show up in the results finally the coarse grids are composed of 41 178 and 530 126 elements for catchment n 1 and n 2 respectively see figs 8d and 11d fig 12 shows the comparison between some cross sections belonging to the catchment n 1 reproduced by the a priori grid and the homologous ones generated by the other two reference grids in particular as an example six cross sections have been considered fig 12 located both in the main stream fig 12 cross sections s 1 s 2 and in the peripheral parts of the catchment fig 12 cross sections s3 to s6 compared to the fine grid it is interesting to observe that the a priori grid provides not only similar profiles in the main channel as expected due to the same resolution used for the channel network but also a good reproduction of the overall slopes characterizing the shape of the sections themselves moreover the a priori grid seems to give a more reliable reproduction of the cross section in respect of the coarse grid the latter grid provides a less accurate position of the thalweg and channelized part of the section the comparison between six cross sections belonging to the catchment n 2 fig 13 reproduced by the a priori grid and the reference grids confirms the overall behavior discussed above in particular the sections reproduced by the a priori grid are very close to those generated by the fine grid compared to the coarse grid the a priori grid performs better since provides the right position of the thalweg and a satisfactory description of the main channel especially in most peripheral parts of the catchment fig 13 cross sections s 3 s 5 s 6 moving to downstream the differences between the a priori grid and the coarse one tend to reduce significantly fig 13 cross sections s 1 and s 2 4 3 2 effects on hydrologic and hydraulic variables besides the topographic analysis discussed in section 4 3 1 it is clear that the main interest in the generation of the a priori grid is its potential benefit on the runoff simulations at the basin scale the advantage here is intended related to a reliable estimation of hydrologic and hydraulic variables supporting flood hazard assessment specifically flood hydrographs at the basins outlet and flood extents reducing the overall computational times once again the results obtained by using the a priori grids will be compared to the results of the simulations performed with the fine and coarse grid already discussed in the previous sections to that purpose ideal simulations have been carried out for both catchments the mathematical model for surface runoff simulation is based on the 2 d fully dynamic swe which was integrated with a finite volume method fvm first order accurate in time and space the roe scheme roe 1981 suitable numerical treatments of the source terms and wet dry fronts have been applied brufau et al 2004 costabile et al 2013 cea and bladé 2015 this model has been already presented in previous works of the authors providing robust and reliable results for both fluvial urban floods macchione et al 2019a b and rainfall runoff simulations costabile et al 2019 2020 therefore it is not reported here the code has been parallelized using mpi directives two series of tests have been planned with a uniform rainfall throughout the domain the difference in the two boundary conditions is the rainfall duration which was considered as infinite or equal to the concentration time the concentration time was evaluated as the time at which the maximum discharge was reached into the simulations rain scenarios are summarized in table 1 for both catchments where i represents the rain intensity and t is the rain duration for all the performed simulations the manning roughness coefficient was set to 0 05 s m 1 3 the reason for choosing a constant manning coefficient over the whole catchment is to analyse the performances of the three types of grids a priori fine and coarse fixing all the remaining parameters the authors are aware that this choice implies an idealization of the case studies but it is made to analyse the results only in terms of grid accuracy moreover no infiltration losses were considered a dry bed condition has been used as an initial condition in fig 14 a discharge hydrographs for the rainfall hyetograph r1 are compared for the three grids at the catchment outlet fig 14b shows the discharge hydrographs for the rainfall hyetograph r2 having a duration equal to the catchment concentration time related to the three grids fig 14a shows a good agreement between the results of the a priori grid and the fine grid results for the coarse grid show a delay in the flood wave arrival together with an underestimation of the hydrograph rising stage the fine and a priori grid have similar results in terms of peak discharges and concentration time the concentration time of the coarse grid is a little bit greater than that obtained using the fine grid about 10 this is observed also in fig 14b where the results of the coarse mesh suggest a bigger volume accumulation into the mesh domain since the mass conservation balance can be considered good enough see table 2 this behaviour is influenced by the cells size according to caviedes voullième et al 2012 this effect tends to decrease for non uniform grids with local refinements fig 15 shows the maps of the maximum flooded areas computed using the three computational grids for the rainfall hyetograph r 1 the results of the a priori grid and the fine grid are very close in terms of flooded areas whereas some differences arise for the coarse grid results for the three grids related to the rainfall event r1 are summarized in table 2 as expected calculation times are different for the different computational grids since they decrease with the number of elements of the computational grid taking the fine grid as reference the a priori grid leads to a great decrease of the computational time without observing significant errors in the flooded area 0 26 the coarse grid shows an error in terms of flooded area which is not negligible 22 9 the reduction of the computational time is 82 for the a priori grid and 88 for the coarse mesh in respect of that related to the fine grid referring to catchment n 2 three rainfall events were considered the former has a rain duration much longer than the catchment concentration time and a rainfall intensity i 3 whereas r4 has the same rain intensity and the rain duration is equal to the catchment concentration time the last rain event has a two peak hyetograph with a maximum rainfall intensity of 15 mm h and a duration equal to the catchment concentration time see table 1 in figs 16a 16b and 16 c the discharge hydrographs at catchments outlet relative to the rain inputs r3 r4 and r5 respectively are shown the outflow hydrographs in figs 16a and b resulting from the three computational grids are comparable the coarse grid shows once again a delay in the flood wave arrival and an underestimation of the hydrograph rising stage in fig 16c the outflow hydrographs show a significant discrepancy between the simulation related to the coarse grid and those related to the fine grid and the a priori grid in particular considering the r3 and r4 rain scenarios the differences of the peak discharges obtained using the three grids are negligible whereas the concentration time of the coarse grid is greater than that obtained using the fine grid about 16 moving the attention to the flooding area fig 17 shows results of the different computational grids figs 17a b and c represent the maximum flooded area for the rainfall intensity r3 obtained with the fine grid for the a priori grid and for the coarse one respectively the results of the a priori and the fine grid are close in the main channel whereas some discrepancies are observed with the coarse grid fig 17c this result reveals difficulties of the coarse mesh to represent narrow valleys this is also confirmed by the maximum water depth simulated in the three simulations which shows a discrepancy of 7 for the a priori grid and of 24 for the coarse one with respect to the fine grid moreover this behaviour is found also in the results of the flooded area with a relative error of 13 39 for the a priori grid if compared to 24 62 for the coarse grid as shown in table 3 the reduction of the computational time is 87 for the a priori grid and 96 for the coarse mesh in respect of that related to the fine grid computational times for the fine grid are very high simulation times related to the grid obtained using the proposed methodology are smaller and feasible for real time simulations 5 conclusions in this paper the original idea presented by perron et al 2008 to quantitatively investigate the existence of characteristic landscape scales derived from high resolution topographic maps was applied to find characteristic scales to build an optimal a priori grid for overland flow models this approach takes advantage of perron s work opening a brand new field of application specifically the procedure proposed by perron was originally modified by the authors to emphasize the energy peaks in the power spectrum in order to find the characteristic scales in the natural catchments and to locate them in the domain this information was used to build an a priori unstructured computational mesh therefore we have explored a technique to identify areas where the smallest scale is needed to represent topographic features describing the remaining areas with less accuracy using the larger scales this procedure has not modified significantly the slopes of the basins two additional unstructured grids were subsequently generated the former with a resolution close to the resolution of the dem fine mesh which was taken as a reference mesh and the latter mesh with a cell size recommended by the literature coarse mesh the results showed good performances of the a priori grid which gave results very close to the reference simulations represented by the simulations performed on fine grids providing a great reduction of the computational time up to 87 the method is very fast the computational time was two or three minutes for the basins considered here using a serial code therefore one may argue that even for basins of two order of magnitude greater thousand of square kilometers the practical applicability of the procedure still holds taking up few hours presumably although the results here presented are preliminary and over idealized hydraulic hydrologic conditions they are very promising for real events since the method is still not at an advanced stage of development further detailed analysis are needed to understand the relation among the topographic characteristic scales the grid resolution throughout the domain and the scale of the flow features induced by the different rainfall events

5823,the increasing availability of high resolution terrain data fostered the development of two dimensional hydrodynamic based surface runoff models at basin scale for flood hazard assessment and mapping purposes the generation of the computational domain is one of the most important preliminary steps for practical applications of this kind of modeling several studies can be found in the technical literature showing the influence exerted by the computational grid type used on the results in terms of water depth flow velocity and discharge several approaches were proposed for the mesh generation even though in practice it is subject to the modeller choice and experience in any case the reason why a specific mesh is used is rarely discussed and its impact on the model results in terms of outflow hydrographs runoff volumes and flooded areas extent is seldom analysed in this work a rigorous approach for an a priori design of a computational grid is proposed the a priori term suggests that the proposed procedure aims at generating a computational mesh close to the optimal one in a time saving process which is not based on trial meshes and trial simulations namely the process is based on the application of the two dimensional fourier analysis to a high resolution digital elevation model in order to compute the power spectrum and finally to identify the significant waves lengths and the characteristic scales the latter ones are located in the catchment and used for the generation of a computational grid characterized by different elements size the simulations of surface runoff at a basin scale have shown that the application of the proposed method for the a priori construction of the grid leads to the generation of a computational mesh which reduces the calculation time by approximately 87 if compared to a fine grid taken as reference with negligible errors on outflow hydrographs and flooded areas extent keywords hydrodynamic based rainfall runoff modelling computational grid spectral analysis spatial scales overland flow model direct rainfall method 1 introduction recently lidar technologies provide high resolution topography geomorphology and hydrography data sets at relative low cost their increasing availability fostered the development of physically based distributed models for rainfall runoff analysis zhang et al 2016 that have the merit to provide the description of the spatial variation of the variables throughout the basin in this sense they represent a more detailed approach than the classic lumped models the increasing use of high performance computing techniques helped in a dramatically reduction of the overall simulation cost of this kind of modeling petaccia et al 2016 lacasta et al 2015 vacondio et al 2014 xia et al 2019 sanders and schubert 2019 therefore the application of two dimensional shallow water models 2d swes for the description of hydrodynamic based surface runoff computations in rainfall runoff simulations at the catchment scale is becoming a reference approach as testified by the plethora of studies in the related literature cea et al 2010 cea et al 2014 yeh et al 2011 costabile et al 2012 costabile et al 2013 caviedes voullième et al 2012 simons et al 2014 liang et al 2015 singh et al 2014 huang et al 2015 cea and bladé 2015 fernández pato and garcia navarro 2016 fernández pato et al 2016 bellos and tsakiris 2016 xia et al 2017 fernández pato et al 2018 bout and jetten 2018 hou et al 2018 xia and liang 2018 macchione et al 2019 this approach sometimes referred as direct rainfall method yu and harbor 2019 jamali et al 2019 consists in the application of rainfall to each cell of the two dimensional domain the consequent runoff is then routed by the 2d hydrodynamic model this approach seems to be attractive for modelers and scientists because it significantly reduces the need for hydrologic modelling for the runoff estimation and consequently the number of models for generation and propagation of surface runoff at a basin scale hall 2015 finally it has been recently observed that the hydrodynamic based rainfall runoff simulations can shed new light to the analysis of basin drainage networks introducing novel scaling laws and an innovative method for channel heads detection costabile et al 2019 besides the rainfall estimation that proved to be a fundamental data to obtain reliable results fraga et al 2019 one of the key preliminary steps for the application of the physically based distributed modelling based on the 2 d swes is the generation of a computational mesh the grid design involves two interrelated issues degree of accuracy and computational costs which need to be somewhat balanced besides the expected reduction of numerical errors due to the spatial and temporal discretization of the chosen model a fine mesh may be essential to reproduce important flow paths in areas of high topographic variability or to describe sharp flow features see for example costabile and macchione 2015 costabile et al 2015a b at the same time the computational costs will significantly increase because it is inversely proportional to the third power of the cell size kim et al 2014 furthermore though not considered in this work the computational grid can affect the infiltration process that is a dominant component of the hydrologic water loss since it strongly depends on the residence time of the surface water in the cells the impact of mesh type and resolution on the flood propagation was extensively discussed for example horritt and bates 2002 analysed the results obtained using both 1d and 2d models showing that the simulated topographic properties had a major effect on the simulations and that topography played a significant role in flood inundation patterns as they develop over time similarly tsubaki and kawahara 2013 showed a shallower and faster flood propagation when moving from coarser to finer grid with the same roughness parameter this is essentially due to the smoothing effect of the elevation distribution induced by a coarse grid that therefore cannot adequately solve rapidly varied 2d flow regarding the mesh type some studies concluded that there is no an optimal choice for 2d flood modelling because each element type e g triangle and quadrilateral is advantageous under different circumstances kim et al 2014 for this reason some studies suggested the use of a mixed mesh hoch et al 2018 bomers et al 2019 or adaptive grids hu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 savant et al 2019 for maximum versatility in practical applications others studies focused on mesh refinement by the detection of key topographic features where the high resolution mesh is needed while the mesh in the rest of the domain remains coarse hou et al 2018 the grid size effect could be considered as a part of a much wider context related to the analysis of the effects and implications of dem resolution on the characterization of surface microtopography quantification of hydrologic connectivity and simulation of hydrologic processes at the catchment scale for example yu and harbor 2019 have shown that coarser dem resolutions overestimated the hydrologic connectivity and underestimated the maximum depression storage as a result surface runoff was increased and filling time of depressions was reduced bringing to significant alterations of the overland flow patterns and of the response mechanisms furthermore habtezion et al 2016 highlighted that coarser resolution dems tended to underestimate discharge peaks in comparison with fine resolution dems however they showed that resolutions up to a threshold of 10 m did provide comparable simulation results other studies demonstrated that the dem resolution could have serious implications on the values of the hydrologically important spatial indices derived from the dem itself vaze et al 2010 in addition hancock 2005 stated that the area slope relationship cumulative area distribution width function and strahler statistics are sensitive to digital elevation model grid scale while the hypsometric curve was not confirming that hillslope detail is lost at grid scales greater than 10 m as provided by zhang and montgomery 1994 by contrast thomas et al 2017 identified a 1 2 m resolution dems as the optimal for runoff generating areas in complex agricultural catchments the spatial and statistical distribution of derived hydrological attributes at the field scale as a function of dem resolution has been explored also by woodrow et al 2016 who showed that coarser resolution dems resulted in a mixture of larger and severely truncated field catchments due to the inability of coarser scale to accurately represent within field low relief ridges that serve as salient drainage divides according to ariza villaverde et al 2015 high dem resolutions provided accurate drainage networks especially in case of dense drainage network if the drainage network is sparse the influence of the dem resolution was found less significant ying et al 2014 pointed out that higher resolution dems generally result in improved stream network and watershed boundary representations but the improvements in the description of the hydrographic network do not necessarily result in improved streamflow simulations modellers are aware of the importance of size assumption in the design of a mesh but in practice mesh resolution is subject to their practical experience in any case the reason why a specific mesh is used is rarely discussed and its impact on outflow hydrographs and runoff volumes is seldom analysed therefore despite the importance of this issue highlighted in the studies mentioned above this is an evident gap in the literature from a numerical point of view a mesh quality index could be introduced based on numerical convergence analysis caviedes voullième et al 2012 alternatively the modeler can define a pre fixed number of meshes having different resolution in channels floodplains and hillslopes to realize the response to spatial resolution hardy et al 1999 in this sense the design of the grid is an a posteriori operation with respect to the numerical simulation based on different runs of the 2 d hydrodynamic model that unavoidably leads to a very time consuming overall process in this work the authors intend to address the mesh generation problem and the associated issues related to accuracy and computational costs providing a novel point of view the idea is to propose a rigorous approach based on the hypothesis that an a priori mesh closer to the optimal one based on the maximum resolution in the available topography data can be built the a priori term suggests that the proposed procedure aims at generating a reliable computational mesh in a time saving process which is not based on trial meshes and simulations the key assumption of this new method is that each natural catchment contains characteristic scales namely characteristics lengths that can be used in the construction of a computational mesh capable of reproducing faithfully the catchment topography therefore the novel contribution provided by this paper is to explore a peculiar range of characteristic scales that can be directly employed in the computational mesh generation process for the application of 2d swe model for the description of hydrodynamic based surface runoff simulations at the catchment scale this paper is organized as follows the proposed method to generate an a priori grid is presented in section 2 followed by the description of the case studies chosen in this work section 3 section 4 is devoted to the results and relative discussion in which the benefits of the proposed mesh generation method are shown in terms of accuracy and computational times finally the conclusions are reported in section 5 2 proposed method the method proposed in this paper takes advance of the invariant scales hypothesis ansoult 1989 in a natural catchment generating the computational mesh according to specific peculiarities of the catchment this hypothesis asserts that spatial scales representing characteristic dimensions are capable of correctly fitting the local trend of the topography perron et al 2008 specifically a two dimensional spectral analysis based on the discrete fourier transform is chosen as a tool to define the characteristic scales through the spectral analysis the entire range of wavelengths contained in a natural catchment could be explored to isolate the most appropriate range for an a priori design of a reliable grid which preserves the main dem morphological features like slopes and watershed network the steps of the proposed procedure are described in fig 1 hence the procedure needs a digital elevation model xyz matrix as starting point to describe the watershed step 1 in fig 1 according to priestley 1981 and maus and dimri 1995 the fourier transform provides reliable results only if the signal represented by z x y satisfies the quasi periodicity condition namely the dem should have a null mean and an approximately constant variance to respect the quasi periodicity condition the dem can be interpolated using a linear polynomial surface lps step 2 in fig 1 and then the lps is subtracted from the dem step 3 as suggested by perron et al 2008 and shown in fig 2 step 4 of the procedure is based on the use of the discrete fourier transform dft which transforms the real space domain into a complex function in the frequency domain for two dimensional data the dft z is defined as priestley 1981 1 z k x k y m 0 n x 1 n 0 n y 1 z m δ x n δ y e 2 π k x m n x k y n n y where k x and k y are the wavenumbers in x and y direction n x n y is the dem dimension having a resolution of δ x in x direction and δ y in y direction m and n are the indexes of elevation the function z m δ x n δ y along x and y respectively the frequency of a generic element in k x k y position is defined as 2 f x k x n x δ x f y k y n y δ y where n x 2 k x n x 2 1 and n y 2 1 k y n y 2 the maximum resolved frequencies are the well known nyquist frequencies which can be defined as f x max 1 2 δ x and f y max 1 2 δ y for a grid discretized by δ x and δ y following the parseval s theorem the energy of a signal is equivalent in the frequency domain and the real domain thus the power spectrum p dft indicated in step 5 of fig 1 can be calculated as 3 p dft k x k y 1 n x 2 n y 2 z k x k y 2 also for non periodic signals like the elevation signal in real catchments perron et al 2008 since in a real catchment the z x y signal is not strictly periodic the dft needs the use of a wide range of sinusoidal functions including some spurious ones to describe it properly these spurious functions may influence significantly the spectrum in order to mitigate their effects the windowing process harris 1978 was applied here several window functions were tested geckinli and yavuz 1978 harris 1978 and the tukey s windows function was chosen priestley 1981 since it filtered a larger number of noise peaks if compared to the other functions ferraro et al 2019 step 6 of the proposed procedure consists in the switch from a two dimensional 2d spectrum to a one dimensional 1d one to facilitate the identification of the characteristic scales specifically radial average was chosen kirby 2005 sidick 2009 as shown in fig 3 a in a fixed range of frequency a scaling law f α is recognizable being α a rational number hough 1989 steyn and ayotte 1985 the next step of the procedure step 7 is the characteristic scales identification which is performed using a different idea with respect to the perron method consisting in pre multiplying the 1d spectrum by the scaling law f α p dft as shown in fig 3b bullock et al 1978 jimenez 1998 kim and adrian 1999 guala et al 2006 this technique emphasizes the energy peaks in the frequency range characterized by the scaling law finally the corresponding energy peak frequencies can be related to the characteristic scale sizes which can be used as a base length of the computational mesh according to bout and jetten 2018 length scales greater than 40 m corresponding to frequencies lower than 157 1 m can be a priori neglected since they could generate coarse meshes unreliable for practical applications once the peaks of the spectrum are identified the frequencies can be switch in wavelength as l 2 π f where f is the frequency related to the chosen scale the next step step 8 is the identification of the position of the characteristic scales in the real domain this can be performed applying band pass filters to the 2d dft z k x k y in order to isolate the characteristic scales finally the inverse fourier transform ift can be performed to obtain a filtered signal z x y from z k x k y step 9 the last step is the generation of a new dem composed by the filtered scales and finally the traces of the filtered scales can be placed in the real space domain using a gis software step 10 the proposed procedure is automatic except for the step n 7 that is left to the user choice moreover the method is very fast the computational time was two or three minutes for the considered basins using a serial code in matlab environment and a personal computer processor amd ryzen 7 2007 3 description of the analyzed catchments in this section the analyzed catchments are presented the first one was chosen since it was used by perron et al 2008 to originally propose the method for different purposes than those faced in this work it is a small basin and the topographic data can be downloaded directly from the web the second catchment is an italian catchment for which a dem having a 0 5 m resolution was available to the authors 3 1 south fork of eel river catchment n 1 the south fork eel river basin is the largest tributary of the eel river in central northern california usa the dominant land cover is forest in this study a sub basin having an area of 1 68 km2 was chosen its elevation ranges between 380 and 784 m a s l being its average elevation 578 m above sea level and its average slope 64 this basin will be referred in the following as catchment n 1 the topographic data derived by a 1 m dem resolution having a vertical precision of 10 cm is shown in fig 4 where the black line represents the catchment contour the raw topographic data was acquired with airborne laser swath technology and the vegetation was treated with a block minimum filter axelsson 1999 haugerud et al 2003 the dem was downloaded directly from the website http opentopo sdsc edu datasetmetadata otcollectionid ot 122016 26910 1 3 2 turbolo catchment n 2 the turbolo creek catchment fig 5 is a tributary of the crati river located in the calabria region south of italy the area of the extracted sub catchment is 22 5 km2 with an elevation between 1015 to 112 m above sea level and catchment mean slope of 18 6 agricultural and wooded areas represent the dominant land use while urbanisation is less than 2 of the total catchment area an airborne lidar sensor riegl lms q560 was used to cover the catchment area providing a sampling density of four points over 1 m2 from lidar data different kinds of dem digital surface model digital terrain model with and without buildings and other objects surmounting the ground etc with resolution up to 0 5 m were produced and used in this paper this basin will be referred in the following as catchment n 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 application of the proposed method at the catchment n 1 and a priori design of the grid following the procedure described in section 2 and shown in fig 1 the pre multiplied spectrum obtained for the first catchment is shown in fig 6 a fig 6b representing the most interesting part of fig 6a shows the energy peaks into the filtered range of wavelength switching from the frequency domain to the real one the characteristic scales l 1 2 6 m and l 2 13 9 m resulted from the proposed procedure in fig 6 b the large scale peak is well identified by the bulge in the spectrum whereas the smaller scale seems less evident the first point in the spectrum shows the highest energy level but the associated scale is related to the lidar resolution being a trivial solution hence we took the smallest peak frequency as the non trivial scale once the characteristic scales were defined their position in the real space is required fig 7 shows the filtered scales in the real domain according to perron et al 2008 the planimetric traces of the filtered scales are located where morphological discontinuities appear changes in slope macro roughness elements 1 m levees once scales dimension and their position in the real space are defined it is possible to use these information for the discretization of the catchment through an unstructured computational grid a non uniform resolution was chosen to consider the two characteristic scale dimensions obtained by the proposed procedure the resulting computational grid which will be referred to as a priori grid in the following is a triangular unstructured mesh of 74 184 elements of edges ranging from l 1 to l 2 see fig 8 c 4 2 application of the proposed method at the catchment n 2 and design of the a priori grids the result of the application of the proposed methodology to the catchment n 2 is shown in fig 9 where two scales l 5 2 26 m and l 6 25 54 m are identified applying the ift through the band pass filter the filtered scales are located into the real space as shown in fig 10 to represent the second catchment an unstructured triangular grid of 725 422 elements was generated the edges of which vary from l 5 to l 6 was considered as a result of the proposed procedure see fig 11 c 4 3 performances of the a priori grids the evaluation of the performances of the a priori grids will be organized according to two different point of views attention will be focused first on some topographic features of the designed grids in relation to two other reference grids in particular the first one is a very fine grid that tries to exploit as much as possible the original lidar resolution representing therefore the most accurate computational domain fine grid hereafter on the contrary the second one is much coarser and has been generated assuming the triangular side of the computational element equal to 10 m coarse grid hereafter the latter choice is based on the suggestions extrapolated by literature review presented in the introduction according to which resolution up to 10 m does not influence the most important geomorphologic indices flow patterns and basin hydrologic responses to a rainfall input the second analysis performed here is based on the effects on hydrologic and hydraulic variables it will be discussed performing 2 d swes simulations at the catchment scale using the three grids considered before 4 3 1 topographic analysis of the a priori grids the analysis will be essentially devoted to cross sections as mentioned before in order to have some reference solution we have considered two other grids with uniform resolution throughout the basins as regards the catchment n 1 we have considered a uniform triangular mesh of 1 055 582 elements of l 3 2 0 m side fig 8b as for catchment n 2 the refined grid has a uniform triangular mesh resolution with the cell side l 3 3 0 m so that the computational domain has 5 785 206 elements fig 11b it has to be pointed out that the 3 m resolution was the best the authors could achieve in order to create a uniform mesh over the whole catchment a grid made of too many elements and difficult to be handled would have resulted if a 2 m dimension was imposed this consideration refers to the computational times of the 2d swes model since the proposed methodology for the scale detection is very fast the consequence of this limitation was that for the catchment n 2 the fine grid accuracy was lower than the a priori grid accuracy in the main channel this limitation will show up in the results finally the coarse grids are composed of 41 178 and 530 126 elements for catchment n 1 and n 2 respectively see figs 8d and 11d fig 12 shows the comparison between some cross sections belonging to the catchment n 1 reproduced by the a priori grid and the homologous ones generated by the other two reference grids in particular as an example six cross sections have been considered fig 12 located both in the main stream fig 12 cross sections s 1 s 2 and in the peripheral parts of the catchment fig 12 cross sections s3 to s6 compared to the fine grid it is interesting to observe that the a priori grid provides not only similar profiles in the main channel as expected due to the same resolution used for the channel network but also a good reproduction of the overall slopes characterizing the shape of the sections themselves moreover the a priori grid seems to give a more reliable reproduction of the cross section in respect of the coarse grid the latter grid provides a less accurate position of the thalweg and channelized part of the section the comparison between six cross sections belonging to the catchment n 2 fig 13 reproduced by the a priori grid and the reference grids confirms the overall behavior discussed above in particular the sections reproduced by the a priori grid are very close to those generated by the fine grid compared to the coarse grid the a priori grid performs better since provides the right position of the thalweg and a satisfactory description of the main channel especially in most peripheral parts of the catchment fig 13 cross sections s 3 s 5 s 6 moving to downstream the differences between the a priori grid and the coarse one tend to reduce significantly fig 13 cross sections s 1 and s 2 4 3 2 effects on hydrologic and hydraulic variables besides the topographic analysis discussed in section 4 3 1 it is clear that the main interest in the generation of the a priori grid is its potential benefit on the runoff simulations at the basin scale the advantage here is intended related to a reliable estimation of hydrologic and hydraulic variables supporting flood hazard assessment specifically flood hydrographs at the basins outlet and flood extents reducing the overall computational times once again the results obtained by using the a priori grids will be compared to the results of the simulations performed with the fine and coarse grid already discussed in the previous sections to that purpose ideal simulations have been carried out for both catchments the mathematical model for surface runoff simulation is based on the 2 d fully dynamic swe which was integrated with a finite volume method fvm first order accurate in time and space the roe scheme roe 1981 suitable numerical treatments of the source terms and wet dry fronts have been applied brufau et al 2004 costabile et al 2013 cea and bladé 2015 this model has been already presented in previous works of the authors providing robust and reliable results for both fluvial urban floods macchione et al 2019a b and rainfall runoff simulations costabile et al 2019 2020 therefore it is not reported here the code has been parallelized using mpi directives two series of tests have been planned with a uniform rainfall throughout the domain the difference in the two boundary conditions is the rainfall duration which was considered as infinite or equal to the concentration time the concentration time was evaluated as the time at which the maximum discharge was reached into the simulations rain scenarios are summarized in table 1 for both catchments where i represents the rain intensity and t is the rain duration for all the performed simulations the manning roughness coefficient was set to 0 05 s m 1 3 the reason for choosing a constant manning coefficient over the whole catchment is to analyse the performances of the three types of grids a priori fine and coarse fixing all the remaining parameters the authors are aware that this choice implies an idealization of the case studies but it is made to analyse the results only in terms of grid accuracy moreover no infiltration losses were considered a dry bed condition has been used as an initial condition in fig 14 a discharge hydrographs for the rainfall hyetograph r1 are compared for the three grids at the catchment outlet fig 14b shows the discharge hydrographs for the rainfall hyetograph r2 having a duration equal to the catchment concentration time related to the three grids fig 14a shows a good agreement between the results of the a priori grid and the fine grid results for the coarse grid show a delay in the flood wave arrival together with an underestimation of the hydrograph rising stage the fine and a priori grid have similar results in terms of peak discharges and concentration time the concentration time of the coarse grid is a little bit greater than that obtained using the fine grid about 10 this is observed also in fig 14b where the results of the coarse mesh suggest a bigger volume accumulation into the mesh domain since the mass conservation balance can be considered good enough see table 2 this behaviour is influenced by the cells size according to caviedes voullième et al 2012 this effect tends to decrease for non uniform grids with local refinements fig 15 shows the maps of the maximum flooded areas computed using the three computational grids for the rainfall hyetograph r 1 the results of the a priori grid and the fine grid are very close in terms of flooded areas whereas some differences arise for the coarse grid results for the three grids related to the rainfall event r1 are summarized in table 2 as expected calculation times are different for the different computational grids since they decrease with the number of elements of the computational grid taking the fine grid as reference the a priori grid leads to a great decrease of the computational time without observing significant errors in the flooded area 0 26 the coarse grid shows an error in terms of flooded area which is not negligible 22 9 the reduction of the computational time is 82 for the a priori grid and 88 for the coarse mesh in respect of that related to the fine grid referring to catchment n 2 three rainfall events were considered the former has a rain duration much longer than the catchment concentration time and a rainfall intensity i 3 whereas r4 has the same rain intensity and the rain duration is equal to the catchment concentration time the last rain event has a two peak hyetograph with a maximum rainfall intensity of 15 mm h and a duration equal to the catchment concentration time see table 1 in figs 16a 16b and 16 c the discharge hydrographs at catchments outlet relative to the rain inputs r3 r4 and r5 respectively are shown the outflow hydrographs in figs 16a and b resulting from the three computational grids are comparable the coarse grid shows once again a delay in the flood wave arrival and an underestimation of the hydrograph rising stage in fig 16c the outflow hydrographs show a significant discrepancy between the simulation related to the coarse grid and those related to the fine grid and the a priori grid in particular considering the r3 and r4 rain scenarios the differences of the peak discharges obtained using the three grids are negligible whereas the concentration time of the coarse grid is greater than that obtained using the fine grid about 16 moving the attention to the flooding area fig 17 shows results of the different computational grids figs 17a b and c represent the maximum flooded area for the rainfall intensity r3 obtained with the fine grid for the a priori grid and for the coarse one respectively the results of the a priori and the fine grid are close in the main channel whereas some discrepancies are observed with the coarse grid fig 17c this result reveals difficulties of the coarse mesh to represent narrow valleys this is also confirmed by the maximum water depth simulated in the three simulations which shows a discrepancy of 7 for the a priori grid and of 24 for the coarse one with respect to the fine grid moreover this behaviour is found also in the results of the flooded area with a relative error of 13 39 for the a priori grid if compared to 24 62 for the coarse grid as shown in table 3 the reduction of the computational time is 87 for the a priori grid and 96 for the coarse mesh in respect of that related to the fine grid computational times for the fine grid are very high simulation times related to the grid obtained using the proposed methodology are smaller and feasible for real time simulations 5 conclusions in this paper the original idea presented by perron et al 2008 to quantitatively investigate the existence of characteristic landscape scales derived from high resolution topographic maps was applied to find characteristic scales to build an optimal a priori grid for overland flow models this approach takes advantage of perron s work opening a brand new field of application specifically the procedure proposed by perron was originally modified by the authors to emphasize the energy peaks in the power spectrum in order to find the characteristic scales in the natural catchments and to locate them in the domain this information was used to build an a priori unstructured computational mesh therefore we have explored a technique to identify areas where the smallest scale is needed to represent topographic features describing the remaining areas with less accuracy using the larger scales this procedure has not modified significantly the slopes of the basins two additional unstructured grids were subsequently generated the former with a resolution close to the resolution of the dem fine mesh which was taken as a reference mesh and the latter mesh with a cell size recommended by the literature coarse mesh the results showed good performances of the a priori grid which gave results very close to the reference simulations represented by the simulations performed on fine grids providing a great reduction of the computational time up to 87 the method is very fast the computational time was two or three minutes for the basins considered here using a serial code therefore one may argue that even for basins of two order of magnitude greater thousand of square kilometers the practical applicability of the procedure still holds taking up few hours presumably although the results here presented are preliminary and over idealized hydraulic hydrologic conditions they are very promising for real events since the method is still not at an advanced stage of development further detailed analysis are needed to understand the relation among the topographic characteristic scales the grid resolution throughout the domain and the scale of the flow features induced by the different rainfall events

5824,presented in this paper is a theoretical analysis of migration of active particles in a surface flow constructed wetland in which the longitudinal and vertical swimming behaviors are taken into account besides the hydrodynamic effects in the conventional analysis of passive particle dispersion theoretical solutions of mass distribution moving velocity of the mass center and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient are rigorously derived for a gyrotactic micro organisms patch based on aris moment method and the method of separation of variables for linear partial differential equations it is found that the mass distribution motion of the mass center and longitudinal dispersion of the gyrotactic micro organisms patch can reach a stable status on the time scale 3 π 2 pe v 2 4 where pe v is the péclet number characterized by the total vertical diffusivity and vertical swimming velocity and the necessary time corresponding to the dispersion of soluble contaminants can be embodied as a case of pe v 0 the total quantity of gyrotactic micro organisms in each streamline satisfies exponential distribution for large pe v while it approximately satisfies linear distribution for small pe v the asymptotic velocity of mass center for gyrotactic micro organisms in each streamline is in general not equal to the depth averaged flow velocity due to the longitudinal mean swimming caused by gyrotaxis in the shear flow the increase of pe v and u r dimensionless flow velocity at free water surface relative to swimming speed can enhance the motion of the mass center and longitudinal

techniques to treat domestic agricultural and industrial wastewater mitsch and gosselink 1993 kadlec and knight 1996 the cost and efficiency of wastewater treatment mainly depend on the complex physical chemical and biological processes related to active particles which can swim in a specific direction under various external stimuli such as gravity flow shear light chemical gradient magnetic field etc understanding the migration of active particles in the surface flow constructed wetland will make an important contribution to hydraulic design and operation of constructed wetlands us environmental protection agency epa 1999 us environmental protection agency epa 1999 kadlec and knight 1996 zeng et al 2019 particles in the surface flow constructed wetland consist of passive e g plastic granules sediments etc and active particles e g chlammydomonas reinhardtii heterosigma akashiwo dinoflagellates etc the former cannot propel themselves by means of the conversion of their inner biochemical energy into mechanical energy the migration of passive particles is mainly driven by external conditions such as ambient flows turbulent diffusion the rising and sedimentation caused by the density difference of particles and ambient waters etc the latter can propel themselves by waving undulating or rotating flagella or cilia which means the energy stored within the active particles is responsible for their migration to some extents pedley and kessler 1992 in general the migration of active particles is governed by both external flow conditions and self propelled swimming furthermore the active particles have a strong active tendency for external stimulations such as light temperature salinity etc strictly speaking the presence of ions in these particles and their charges have effects more or less on the migration of both passive and active particles the effects are relatively strong for tiny passive particles e g flocculation of cohesive sand in the estuaries while they are usually weak for active particles due to their swimming with regards to the migration of passive particles associated with wetland flows numerous theoretical experimental and numerical exertions were performed nepf et al 2007 nepf 2012 wang et al 2013 zeng et al 2014 zeng et al 2015 yang et al 2016 luo et al 2016 luo et al 2017 guo et al 2019 huai et al 2018 huai et al 2019 wang and zeng 2019 wang et al 2019 yang and nepf 2019 based on taylor dispersion analysis for long time evolution of soluble materials taylor 1953 aris moments analysis aris 1956 from a statistical perspective as well as multiple scale analysis mei et al 1996 these work focused on the effects of wetland flow turbulent diffusion as well as molecular diffusion on the transport of passive particles such as dissolved contaminants sediment particles etc those efforts helped us to explore how flow profiles flow dominated by free surface effects flow dominated by bank wall effects etc zeng et al 2014 vegetation forms rigid and flexible vegetation emergent and submerged vegetation etc nepf 2012 vegetation distribution two layer wetland three zone wetland etc luo et al 2016 luo et al 2017 and turbulent kinetic energy yang et al 2016 influenced the transport of passive particles in various wetlands flows however these work only reflect the effects of hydrodynamics and vegetation on the migration of passive particles besides the passive particles there exist abundant micro organisms in natural and constructed wetlands which also play an important role for the contaminant removal efficiency the distinct differences of micro organisms with the passive particles are their active tendency and randomness which may be spontaneous or stimulated by external conditions therefore some essential biological behaviors are required to be considered for more accurate description and prediction of contaminant evolution in wetlands directional and random swimming are two typical biological behaviors the former can be described by the mean swimming velocity while the latter can be characterized by the translational diffusion however those efforts on the migration of passive particles provided some valuable information to understand the evolution of micro organisms in various natural and constructed wetlands which can be considered as one basis to investigate the migration of active particles zeng et al 2019 gyrotactic micro organisms are typical active particles in natural waters such as chlamydomonas dinoflagellate heterosigma akashiwo etc the migration of gyrotactic micro organisms in wetland flows is quite complicated due to the complexity of swimming behaviors bearon et al 2011 flow patterns associated with vegetation nepf 2012 as well as the interaction of particles and ambient flows pedley and kessler 1990 pedley and kessler 1992 durham et al 2009 durham et al 2013 goldstein 2015 ardekani et al 2017 chen et al 2018 regarding the migration of gyrotactic micro organisms current efforts focus on cells accumulation in various pure fluids such as the unidirectional laminar flow through parallel walls hwang and pedley 2014 and a circular tube kessler 1985 kessler 1986 the thermal stratification flow lovecchio et al 2017 the rotary flow associated with gravitational acceleration lillo et al 2014 and kármán vortex streets in the wake of vertical circular cylinder zeng and pedley 2018 however the longitudinal and vertical migration of gyrotactic micro organisms has not been fully explored for flows associated with constructed wetlands recently zeng et al 2019 presented an analytical solution of active particles distribution for a weak shear wetland flow which is valid for the idealized case that cells distribution is longitudinal uniform so far few specific theoretical solution has been given for mass distribution mass center motion and longitudinal dispersion of a gyrotactic micro organisms patch which is non uniform in both longitudinal and vertical direction in this work we focus on the longitudinal and vertical migration of typical active particles in a surface flow constructed wetland the concrete goals are i to formulate the migration of a gyrotactic micro organisms patch ii to analyze the mass distribution moving velocity of mass center and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of the gyrotactic micro organisms patch and iii to explore the influences of dimensionless physical parameters on gyrotactic micro organisms transport 2 formulation for typical wetland flows the

velocity of gyrotactic micro organisms λ m 2 s 1 the mass diffusivity κ dimensionless the tortuosity k m 2 s 1 the mass dispersivity tensor and λ s m 2 s 1 the translational diffusivity tensor of gyrotactic micro organisms there are two types of factors which influence the longitudinal and vertical migration of particles the first type of factors are related to the hydrodynamic characteristics under the combined action of flowing water and vegetation including the wetland flow velocity mass diffusivity mass dispersivity tensor and tortuosity to reflect the micro scale flow passage the second type of factors depend on the swimming behaviours of micro organisms including the mean swimming velocity and translational diffusivity tensor as the first step to investigate the migration of active particles in a surface flow constructed wetland we only considered the gyrotactic mirco organisms which can swim and the attached microorganisms as well as the microorganisms in the sediments and root zone are not included consider the longitudinal and vertical migration of gyrotactic micro organisms in the steady current through a surface flow constructed wetland with constant ϕ λ and κ the longitudinal x axis is in parallel with the free surface the z axis points vertically upwards and the coordinate origin is arranged at the bed surface fig 1 for many cases of interest associated with the wastewater treatment and ecological risk assessments of natural or constructed wetlands cells sedimentation is negligible compared with their swimming because the latter is much greater than the former for example the swimming speed of chlamydomonas reinhardtii is around 100 μ m s 1 while its sedimentation velocity is approximately 2 μ m s 1 yoshimura et al 2003 for the initial

distribution of total quantity of gyrotactic micro organisms in each stream line consider the migration of gyrotactic micro organisms in a surface flow constructed wetland with typical parameters of ϕ 0 9 h 1 0 m depth averaged velocity u 0 01 m s 1 λ 1 0 10 5 m 2 s 1 density of water ρ 1 0 10 3 kg m 3 dynamic viscosity μ 1 0 10 3 kg m 1 s 1 and mean diameter of stem d 0 02 m zeng and chen 2011 in general there are three key steps in this procedure firstly we need to determine the vertical mass dispersivity k v on the phase average scale which can be calculated as liu et al 2005 57 k v 160 pe d λ ϕ 11 3 1 ϕ 2 3 4 0 25 pe d 100 pe d 1 2 10 6 ped 1 1 42 10 4 m 2 where re d ρ u d μ and pe d u d λ are the reynolds numbers and p e clet number at the stem scale respectively the second step is to obtain the vertical swimming velocity w s and the vertical component of translational diffusivity tensor λ zz s strictly speaking w s and λ zz s depend on the vorticity however for the wetland flow with weak vorticity they can be treated as a constant it is noted that we cannot neglect the effects of cells randomness on the w s and λ zz s even for the weak shear wetland flow for the case of heterosigma akashiwo the vertical swimming velocity and vertical translational diffusivity are calculated as w s 0 71 v s 0 71 136 5 μ m s 1 96 92 μ m s 1 chen et al 2018 and λ zz s 0 08 v s 2 τ c 1 49 10 8 m 2 s 1 where τ c 10 s is the correlation time of gyrotactic micro organisms thirdly we can compute the dimensionless parameters with eqs 6 and 11 subsequently eq 25 can be employed to calculate the distribution of total quantity of cells in each stream line as shown in fig 6 here we just show a procedure to calculate the holistic distribution of gyrotactic micro organisms when we concern the motion velocity of gyrotactic micro organisms patch we need to determine α which reflects the shape of velocity profile zeng and chen 2011 presented one way to calculate α 58 α h μ f κ μ l v where the shear factor f m 1 tortuosity κ and vertical moment dispersivity lv kg m 1 s 1 can be estimated with the expression by liu et al 2005 and ergun 1952 following the procedure by zeng and chen 2011 we have κ 0 95 f 2 06 10 4 m 2 l v 0 142 kg m 1 s 1 and α 12 31 aris moments analysis has been widely used in the analysis of particles transport in various flows river lakes estuaries wetlands etc however there exist some limitations when we use it to analyze the transport of micro organisms in wetland flows firstly aris moments method only reflects the overall characteristics of particle migration such as the total quantity of contaminants migration of the mass center dispersion of contaminant cloud in each stream line or the whole water body etc and it cannot provide particles concentration at a given point due to the limitation of statistical method secondly higher order concentration moments are required if we want to know more overall information about particles transport for example if we focus on the skewness and the kurtosis in the early stage of the migration of a micro organism patch the computation of third and fourth order moments are necessary however it is difficult to obtain the analytical solutions of high order moments due to the complex of the velocity profile of wetland flow furthermore the vertical flux of cells concentration caused by the directional motion intensify the difficulty since the vertical convective term results in the spatial partial derivatives non self adjoint in the concentration moment equations however the zeroth first and second order moments can provide much information for most general concerns related to contaminant removal efficiency as well as environmental and ecological risk assessments associated with wetlands as an initial step to analyse the migration of active particles in the wetland flow we directly adopted the analytical solution of velocity profile for the free surface wetland flow the flow considered in this work is fully developed unidirectional flow through a surface flow constructed wetland it neglects the effects of some complex external conditions such as wind wave the variation of water level heterogeneity of vegetation distribution etc some velocity profiles were provided for the complex hydrodynamic and hydrologic conditions e g chen et al 2010 which could be one option to analyse corresponding migration of micro organisms in this work we adopted dimensionless parameters to get the representative validation data set the advantages of dimensionless parameters represent the relative strength of different factors for example pe v reflects the relative strength of the vertical swimming velocity and vertical total vertical diffusivity u r represents the ratio of the flow velocity relative to swimming speed at free water surface and d l r reflects the relative strength of total longitudinal diffusion to the total vertical diffusion three typical dimensionless values e g 0 1 1 and 10 usually can represent a relatively large range of parameters change we also introduced the characteristic length and time to characterize the relative position and time which has distinct physical meanings for example ζ 0 1 which represents the vertical points with distance away from the bed bottom equal to 0 1 h zero flux boundary conditions for the concentration of gyrotactic micro organisms did not depend on the no slip boundary condition which is only specified for the wetland flow for the dilute suspension of gyrotactic micro organisms this can be easily understood by the fact that the interaction of wetland flow and cells swimming in general can be considered one way coupling that the hydrodynamic conditions can greatly change the swimming behaviour of gyrotactic micro organisms while the effects of swimming behaviours on the bulk water can be neglected even for the high concentration of gyrotactic micro organisms the zero flux boundary condition is still valid only if cells do not adhere to the wall however it is not clear whether much too high concentration of active particles can greatly affect the rationality of no slip boundary conditions some discussions were reported for the zero flux boundary condition of active particles in the two dimensional laminar flow jiang et al 2019 the migration of active particles patch is closely related to the plants and micro organisms the effects of plants on the migration of particles include three typical aspects firstly the morphology and distribution of plants can influence the velocity profile of wetland flow thus changing the contribution of convective transport to the migration of active articles transport secondly the existence of plants can directly influence the effects of superficial diffusion to their migration by affecting mass dispersion of particles on the phase averaged scale thirdly the velocity profile of wetland flow influenced by vegetation can change the swimming velocity and translational diffusivity of active particles the first two aspects belongs to the direct impacts of plants on the migration of active particles patch while the third aspects belongs to the indirect influence the role of micro organisms in the migration of active particles patch are mainly attributed to their mean swimming velocity and translational diffusivity which reflects the tendency and randomness associated with the biological behaviors respectively the relative importance of plants and micro organisms in the migration of active particles patch depends on the relative strength of wetland flow and cells swimming for the case of strong wetland flows plants can play a dominant role for the migration of active particles patch while for the case of weak wetland flows the role of cells swimming is more obvious for example for the strong shear wetland flow cells will be trapped by strong vorticity and cannot swim in a fixed direction the pollutant removal in constructed wetlands is quite complex which depends on both physical chemical and biological processes the migration of active particles is essential to understand the effects of biological processes on pollutant removal efficiency some work were performed for passive particles transport in which biodegradation were treated as source term based on the first order reaction kinetics the inclusion of sorption and biodegradation into this model will be quite complex due to the complicated coupling of hydrodynamics and cells swimming the main objective of this work is to understand the characteristics of mass distribution moving velocity of mass center and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of a gyrotactic micro organisms and to determine the effect of dimensionless parameters to represent the relative strength of two factors on migration of gyrotactic micro organisms therefore the sorption and biodegradation are not included in this model in this work which can be considered as a separate challenging project in future in summary this work presented a theoretical analysis of migration of active particles in a surface flow constructed wetland in which the hydrodynamic effects as well as longitudinal and vertical swimming behaviors are taken into account however there are still some interesting future issues related to this topic i contaminant transport under the combined action of hydrodynamics cells swimming as well as biodegradation and ii comparison of theoretical analysis and field observations for a practical application 7 conclusions theoretical analysis was carried out for the migration of active particles under the combined action of hydrodynamics and self swimming behaviors in a surface flow constructed wetland it is found that the mass distribution motion of the mass center and longitudinal dispersion of a micro organisms patch can eventually reach a stable status and that the necessary time to reach the status is the function of péclet number associated with the vertical swimming velocity rather than a constant for the passive particles the total quantity of active particles in each streamline satisfies exponential distribution in the vertical direction for large pe v while it approximately satisfies linear distribution for small pe v analytical results revealed and explained the discrepancy of mass center motion of gyrotactic micro organisms and the depth averaged longitudinal flow velocity which is caused by the longitudinal swimming triggered by ambient vorticity this work

5824,presented in this paper is a theoretical analysis of migration of active particles in a surface flow constructed wetland in which the longitudinal and vertical swimming behaviors are taken into account besides the hydrodynamic effects in the conventional analysis of passive particle dispersion theoretical solutions of mass distribution moving velocity of the mass center and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient are rigorously derived for a gyrotactic micro organisms patch based on aris moment method and the method of separation of variables for linear partial differential equations it is found that the mass distribution motion of the mass center and longitudinal dispersion of the gyrotactic micro organisms patch can reach a stable status on the time scale 3 π 2 pe v 2 4 where pe v is the péclet number characterized by the total vertical diffusivity and vertical swimming velocity and the necessary time corresponding to the dispersion of soluble contaminants can be embodied as a case of pe v 0 the total quantity of gyrotactic micro organisms in each streamline satisfies exponential distribution for large pe v while it approximately satisfies linear distribution for small pe v the asymptotic velocity of mass center for gyrotactic micro organisms in each streamline is in general not equal to the depth averaged flow velocity due to the longitudinal mean swimming caused by gyrotaxis in the shear flow the increase of pe v and u r dimensionless flow velocity at free water surface relative to swimming speed can enhance the motion of the mass center and longitudinal

techniques to treat domestic agricultural and industrial wastewater mitsch and gosselink 1993 kadlec and knight 1996 the cost and efficiency of wastewater treatment mainly depend on the complex physical chemical and biological processes related to active particles which can swim in a specific direction under various external stimuli such as gravity flow shear light chemical gradient magnetic field etc understanding the migration of active particles in the surface flow constructed wetland will make an important contribution to hydraulic design and operation of constructed wetlands us environmental protection agency epa 1999 us environmental protection agency epa 1999 kadlec and knight 1996 zeng et al 2019 particles in the surface flow constructed wetland consist of passive e g plastic granules sediments etc and active particles e g chlammydomonas reinhardtii heterosigma akashiwo dinoflagellates etc the former cannot propel themselves by means of the conversion of their inner biochemical energy into mechanical energy the migration of passive particles is mainly driven by external conditions such as ambient flows turbulent diffusion the rising and sedimentation caused by the density difference of particles and ambient waters etc the latter can propel themselves by waving undulating or rotating flagella or cilia which means the energy stored within the active particles is responsible for their migration to some extents pedley and kessler 1992 in general the migration of active particles is governed by both external flow conditions and self propelled swimming furthermore the active particles have a strong active tendency for external stimulations such as light temperature salinity etc strictly speaking the presence of ions in these particles and their charges have effects more or less on the migration of both passive and active particles the effects are relatively strong for tiny passive particles e g flocculation of cohesive sand in the estuaries while they are usually weak for active particles due to their swimming with regards to the migration of passive particles associated with wetland flows numerous theoretical experimental and numerical exertions were performed nepf et al 2007 nepf 2012 wang et al 2013 zeng et al 2014 zeng et al 2015 yang et al 2016 luo et al 2016 luo et al 2017 guo et al 2019 huai et al 2018 huai et al 2019 wang and zeng 2019 wang et al 2019 yang and nepf 2019 based on taylor dispersion analysis for long time evolution of soluble materials taylor 1953 aris moments analysis aris 1956 from a statistical perspective as well as multiple scale analysis mei et al 1996 these work focused on the effects of wetland flow turbulent diffusion as well as molecular diffusion on the transport of passive particles such as dissolved contaminants sediment particles etc those efforts helped us to explore how flow profiles flow dominated by free surface effects flow dominated by bank wall effects etc zeng et al 2014 vegetation forms rigid and flexible vegetation emergent and submerged vegetation etc nepf 2012 vegetation distribution two layer wetland three zone wetland etc luo et al 2016 luo et al 2017 and turbulent kinetic energy yang et al 2016 influenced the transport of passive particles in various wetlands flows however these work only reflect the effects of hydrodynamics and vegetation on the migration of passive particles besides the passive particles there exist abundant micro organisms in natural and constructed wetlands which also play an important role for the contaminant removal efficiency the distinct differences of micro organisms with the passive particles are their active tendency and randomness which may be spontaneous or stimulated by external conditions therefore some essential biological behaviors are required to be considered for more accurate description and prediction of contaminant evolution in wetlands directional and random swimming are two typical biological behaviors the former can be described by the mean swimming velocity while the latter can be characterized by the translational diffusion however those efforts on the migration of passive particles provided some valuable information to understand the evolution of micro organisms in various natural and constructed wetlands which can be considered as one basis to investigate the migration of active particles zeng et al 2019 gyrotactic micro organisms are typical active particles in natural waters such as chlamydomonas dinoflagellate heterosigma akashiwo etc the migration of gyrotactic micro organisms in wetland flows is quite complicated due to the complexity of swimming behaviors bearon et al 2011 flow patterns associated with vegetation nepf 2012 as well as the interaction of particles and ambient flows pedley and kessler 1990 pedley and kessler 1992 durham et al 2009 durham et al 2013 goldstein 2015 ardekani et al 2017 chen et al 2018 regarding the migration of gyrotactic micro organisms current efforts focus on cells accumulation in various pure fluids such as the unidirectional laminar flow through parallel walls hwang and pedley 2014 and a circular tube kessler 1985 kessler 1986 the thermal stratification flow lovecchio et al 2017 the rotary flow associated with gravitational acceleration lillo et al 2014 and kármán vortex streets in the wake of vertical circular cylinder zeng and pedley 2018 however the longitudinal and vertical migration of gyrotactic micro organisms has not been fully explored for flows associated with constructed wetlands recently zeng et al 2019 presented an analytical solution of active particles distribution for a weak shear wetland flow which is valid for the idealized case that cells distribution is longitudinal uniform so far few specific theoretical solution has been given for mass distribution mass center motion and longitudinal dispersion of a gyrotactic micro organisms patch which is non uniform in both longitudinal and vertical direction in this work we focus on the longitudinal and vertical migration of typical active particles in a surface flow constructed wetland the concrete goals are i to formulate the migration of a gyrotactic micro organisms patch ii to analyze the mass distribution moving velocity of mass center and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of the gyrotactic micro organisms patch and iii to explore the influences of dimensionless physical parameters on gyrotactic micro organisms transport 2 formulation for typical wetland flows the

velocity of gyrotactic micro organisms λ m 2 s 1 the mass diffusivity κ dimensionless the tortuosity k m 2 s 1 the mass dispersivity tensor and λ s m 2 s 1 the translational diffusivity tensor of gyrotactic micro organisms there are two types of factors which influence the longitudinal and vertical migration of particles the first type of factors are related to the hydrodynamic characteristics under the combined action of flowing water and vegetation including the wetland flow velocity mass diffusivity mass dispersivity tensor and tortuosity to reflect the micro scale flow passage the second type of factors depend on the swimming behaviours of micro organisms including the mean swimming velocity and translational diffusivity tensor as the first step to investigate the migration of active particles in a surface flow constructed wetland we only considered the gyrotactic mirco organisms which can swim and the attached microorganisms as well as the microorganisms in the sediments and root zone are not included consider the longitudinal and vertical migration of gyrotactic micro organisms in the steady current through a surface flow constructed wetland with constant ϕ λ and κ the longitudinal x axis is in parallel with the free surface the z axis points vertically upwards and the coordinate origin is arranged at the bed surface fig 1 for many cases of interest associated with the wastewater treatment and ecological risk assessments of natural or constructed wetlands cells sedimentation is negligible compared with their swimming because the latter is much greater than the former for example the swimming speed of chlamydomonas reinhardtii is around 100 μ m s 1 while its sedimentation velocity is approximately 2 μ m s 1 yoshimura et al 2003 for the initial

the order of shear rate o b ω can be estimated by o bu h as 0 01 10 as the initial step to analyze the migration of active particles patch in a constructed wetland we mainly concern the case of small

τ s can be expressed as τ s 3 π 2 pe v 2 4 which means that the stronger vertical swimming is beneficial to the quick appearance of the stable status the velocity of mass center motion for gyrotactic micro organisms patch differs from the depth averaged flow velocity during the stable stage in contrast to that for soluble matters identical to the depth averaged flow velocity the velocity of mass center motion for soluble matters can be embodied as a case of pe v 0 zeng and chen 2011 the large pe v and u r can enhance the moving velocity of mass center of gyrotactic micro organisms while the large α can weaken v c as shown in fig 4 5 dispersion of gyrotactic micro organisms patch applying the operation ξ 2 d ξ for eqs 7 8 and 10 by feat of eqs 9 and 12 gives 49 m 2 τ pe v m 2 ζ 2 m 2 ζ 2

for d l r 0 it is shown that d s decreases with increasing α while d s enhances with the rise of pe and u r 6 preliminary application and discussion here we presented a procedure to estimate the distribution of total quantity of gyrotactic micro organisms in each stream line consider the migration of gyrotactic micro organisms in a surface flow constructed wetland with typical parameters of ϕ 0 9 h 1 0 m depth averaged velocity u 0 01 m s 1 λ 1 0 10 5 m 2 s 1 density of water ρ 1 0 10 3 kg m 3 dynamic viscosity μ 1 0 10 3 kg m 1 s 1 and mean diameter of stem d 0 02 m zeng and chen 2011 in general there are three key steps in this procedure firstly we need to determine the vertical mass dispersivity k v on the phase average scale which can be calculated as liu et al 2005 57 k v 160 pe d λ ϕ 11 3 1 ϕ 2 3 4 0 25 pe d 100 pe d 1 2 10 6 ped 1 1 42 10 4 m 2 where re d ρ u d μ and pe d u d λ are the reynolds numbers and p e clet number at the stem scale respectively the second step is to obtain the vertical swimming velocity w s and the vertical component of translational diffusivity tensor λ zz s strictly speaking w s and λ zz s depend on the vorticity however for the wetland flow with weak vorticity they can be treated as a constant it is noted that we cannot neglect the effects of cells randomness on the w s and λ zz s even for the weak shear wetland flow for the case of heterosigma akashiwo the vertical swimming velocity and vertical translational diffusivity are calculated as w s 0 71 v s 0 71 136 5 μ m s 1 96 92 μ m s 1 chen et al 2018 and λ zz s 0 08 v s 2 τ c 1 49 10 8 m 2 s 1 where τ c 10 s is the correlation time of gyrotactic micro organisms thirdly we can compute the dimensionless parameters with eqs 6 and 11 subsequently eq 25 can be employed to calculate the distribution of total quantity of cells in each stream line as shown in fig 6 here we just show a procedure to calculate the holistic distribution of gyrotactic micro organisms when we concern the motion velocity of gyrotactic micro organisms patch we need to determine α which reflects the shape of velocity profile zeng and chen 2011 presented one way to calculate α 58 α h μ f κ μ l v where the shear factor f m 1 tortuosity κ and vertical moment dispersivity lv kg m 1 s 1 can be estimated with the expression by liu et al 2005 and ergun 1952 following the procedure by zeng and chen 2011 we have κ 0 95 f 2 06 10 4 m 2 l v 0 142 kg m 1 s 1 and α 12 31 aris moments analysis has been widely used in the analysis of particles transport in various flows river lakes estuaries wetlands etc however there exist some limitations when we use it to analyze the transport of micro organisms in wetland flows firstly aris moments method only reflects the overall characteristics of particle migration such as the total quantity of contaminants migration of the mass center dispersion of contaminant cloud in each stream line or the whole water body etc and it cannot provide particles concentration at a given point due to the limitation of statistical method secondly higher order concentration moments are required if we want to know more overall information about particles transport for example if we focus on the skewness and the kurtosis in the early stage of the migration of a micro organism patch the computation of third and fourth order moments are necessary however it is difficult to obtain the analytical solutions of high order moments due to the complex of the velocity profile of wetland flow furthermore the vertical flux of cells concentration caused by the directional motion intensify the difficulty since the vertical convective term results in the spatial partial derivatives non self adjoint in the concentration moment equations however the zeroth first and second order moments can provide much information for most general concerns related to contaminant removal efficiency as well as environmental and ecological risk assessments associated with wetlands as an initial step to analyse the migration of active particles in the wetland flow we directly adopted the analytical solution of velocity profile for the free surface wetland flow the flow considered in this work is fully developed unidirectional flow through a surface flow constructed wetland it neglects the effects of some complex external conditions such as wind wave the variation of water level heterogeneity of vegetation distribution etc some velocity profiles were provided for the complex hydrodynamic and hydrologic conditions e g chen et al 2010 which could be one option to analyse corresponding migration of micro organisms in this work we adopted dimensionless parameters to get the representative validation data set the advantages of dimensionless parameters represent the relative strength of different factors for example pe v reflects the relative strength of the vertical swimming velocity and vertical total vertical diffusivity u r represents the ratio of the flow velocity relative to swimming speed at free water surface and d l r reflects the relative strength of total longitudinal diffusion to the total vertical diffusion three typical dimensionless values e g 0 1 1 and 10 usually can represent a relatively large range of parameters change we also introduced the characteristic length and time to characterize the relative position and time which has distinct physical meanings for example ζ 0 1 which represents the vertical points with distance away from the bed bottom equal to 0 1 h zero flux boundary conditions for the concentration of gyrotactic micro organisms did not depend on the no slip boundary condition which is only specified for the wetland flow for the dilute suspension of gyrotactic micro organisms this can be easily understood by the fact that the interaction of wetland flow and cells swimming in general can be considered one way coupling that the hydrodynamic conditions can greatly change the swimming behaviour of gyrotactic micro organisms while the effects of swimming behaviours on the bulk water can be neglected even for the high concentration of gyrotactic micro organisms the zero flux boundary condition is still valid only if cells do not adhere to the wall however it is not clear whether much too high concentration of active particles can greatly affect the rationality of no slip boundary conditions some discussions were reported for the zero flux boundary condition of active particles in the two dimensional laminar flow jiang et al 2019 the migration of active particles patch is closely related to the plants and micro organisms the effects of plants on the migration of particles include three typical aspects firstly the morphology and distribution of plants can influence the velocity profile of wetland flow thus changing the contribution of convective transport to the migration of active articles transport secondly the existence of plants can directly influence the effects of superficial diffusion to their migration by affecting mass dispersion of particles on the phase averaged scale thirdly the velocity profile of wetland flow influenced by vegetation can change the swimming velocity and translational diffusivity of active particles the first two aspects belongs to the direct impacts of plants on the migration of active particles patch while the third aspects belongs to the indirect influence the role of micro organisms in the migration of active particles patch are mainly attributed to their mean swimming velocity and translational diffusivity which reflects the tendency and randomness associated with the biological behaviors respectively the relative importance of plants and micro organisms in the migration of active particles patch depends on the relative strength of wetland flow and cells swimming for the case of strong wetland flows plants can play a dominant role for the migration of active particles patch while for the case of weak wetland flows the role of cells swimming is more obvious for example for the strong shear wetland flow cells will be trapped by strong vorticity and cannot swim in a fixed direction the pollutant removal in constructed wetlands is quite complex which depends on both physical chemical and biological processes the migration of active particles is essential to understand the effects of biological processes on pollutant removal efficiency some work were performed for passive particles transport in which biodegradation were treated as source term based on the first order reaction kinetics the inclusion of sorption and biodegradation into this model will be quite complex due to the complicated coupling of hydrodynamics and cells swimming the main objective of this work is to understand the characteristics of mass distribution moving velocity of mass center and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of a gyrotactic micro organisms and to determine the effect of dimensionless parameters to represent the relative strength of two factors on migration of gyrotactic micro organisms therefore the sorption and biodegradation are not included in this model in this work which can be considered as a separate challenging project in future in summary this work presented a theoretical analysis of migration of active particles in a surface flow constructed wetland in which the hydrodynamic effects as well as longitudinal and vertical swimming behaviors are taken into account however there are still some interesting future issues related to this topic i contaminant transport under the combined action of hydrodynamics cells swimming as well as biodegradation and ii comparison of theoretical analysis and field observations for a practical application 7 conclusions theoretical analysis was carried out for the migration of active particles under the combined action of hydrodynamics and self swimming behaviors in a surface flow constructed wetland it is found that the mass distribution motion of the mass center and longitudinal dispersion of a micro organisms patch can eventually reach a stable status and that the necessary time to reach the status is the function of péclet number associated with the vertical swimming velocity rather than a constant for the passive particles the total quantity of active particles in each streamline satisfies exponential distribution in the vertical direction for large pe v while it approximately satisfies linear distribution for small pe v analytical results revealed and explained the discrepancy of mass center motion of gyrotactic micro organisms and the depth averaged longitudinal flow velocity which is caused by the longitudinal swimming triggered by ambient vorticity this work also illustrated the effects of dimensionless parameters pe v u r and α on the mass center motion and longitudinal dispersion of gyrotactic micro organisms declaration of competing interest the
