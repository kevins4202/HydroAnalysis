process through evolution nature has developed highly selective and fast acting proteins that could help address these issues but research and application have been limited often due to assumptions about stability and economic feasibility here we highlight the potential advantages of cell free protein based water and wastewater treatment processes biocatalysis and biosorption evaluate existing

needs of biocatalysis and biosorption for drinking water and wastewater treatment applications for both biocatalysis and biosorption our definition is restricted to cell free proteins not encompassing any whole cell applications this biological toolbox exhibits several potentially beneficial characteristics first in comparison to chemical catalysts proteins generally function best under mild conditions typical of water and wastewater treatment biocatalysts can maintain optimal activity over a ph range from 6 5 to 9 and exhibit a predictable activity temperature dependence hutchison and

limits e g phosphorus third biocatalysts have the potential for complete degradation of contaminants e g hutchison and zilles 2018 avoiding problems associated with transformation products fourth both biocatalysts and biosorbents vary in their degree of specificity which provides an opportunity to tailor process design for example more promiscuous biocatalysts such as laccase have been proposed to treat a wide range of contaminants chen et al 2016 garcia et al 2011 lloret et al 2013 on the other end of the specificity spectrum the high specificity of perchlorate reductase is advantageous because it allows removal of perchlorate in the presence of much higher concentrations of co contaminating nitrate hutchison et al 2013 a situation that ion exchange and whole cell biological processes have difficulty with moreover selective biosorption processes can enable recovery of the target without contamination from other constituents e g venkiteshwaran et al 2018 2020 an ideal biosorption process would leverage highly selective sensitive and reversible under controlled conditions biosorption to facilitate recovery in a concentrated contaminant free form suitable for reuse while cell free biocatalysis is widely applied in pharmaceutical and industrial biotechnology processes it has not yet been widely implemented for drinking water or wastewater treatment applications the high volume and low profit margin of water treatment industries present challenges not faced in the pharmaceutical industry contributing to the most frequently voiced concern that biocatalysts are too expensive to our knowledge protein biosorbents are not yet in use industrially or in water treatment although they have been proposed for metals han et al 2017 keshav et al 2019 maruyama et al 2007 xiao et al 2020 and phosphorus removal and recovery venkiteshwaran et al 2018 2020 in this article we examine the state of knowledge concerning the economic feasibility of biocatalysis and biosorption for drinking water and wastewater treatment we then consider what types of applications might be most amenable to biocatalysis or biosorption and conclude by highlighting key research needs evaluating the economic feasibility of biocatalysis and biosorption we begin with the specific case of biocatalysis for perchlorate removal from drinking water because this has been studied in more detail our recent technoeconomic assessment suggested that biocatalysis could be a cost competitive treatment for perchlorate hutchison et al 2017 specifically with directed research investment biocatalytic perchlorate drinking water treatment was projected to cost 0 034 m 3 with global warming potential gwp impacts of 0 051 kg co2 eq m 3 these values compare favorably to overall water treatment costs and environmental impacts constituting a potential increase of 6 5 in costs and 7 3 in gwp impacts compared to total drinking water treatment plant operations without perchlorate removal in our analysis these costs and impacts were also comparable to alternative technologies at a more advanced stage of development idealized biological perchlorate reduction and perchlorate selective ion exchange these results are quite promising for an early stage technology why are they so different from common expectations perceptions that biocatalysis and biosorption are too expensive often derive from concerns about protein stability effects of complex water matrices on proteins and production costs data from perchlorate reducing enzymes demonstrate that these concerns are not universally applicable first perchlorate reducing enzymes are quite stable maintaining 58 2 of initial activity up to 23 days without any effort to optimize stability hutchison et al 2013 a variety of approaches are also available to enhance protein stability including genetic engineering chandler et al 2020 and encapsulation in materials such as gels zhang et al 2015 or vault nanoparticles wang et al 2015 second perchlorate reducing enzymes maintain high activity in real drinking water sources hutchison and zilles 2015 and ion exchange regeneration brines hutchison and zilles 2018 the third concern production costs is more difficult to evaluate since existing production protocols have been developed for research purposes and are not optimized for large scale production however models for scale up are available from the pharmaceutical industry and experience curves from a wide range of industries show that substantial reductions in cost are typically achieved during technology scale up and development thomassen et al 2020 wene 2000 these results illustrate the potential of this new toolbox although key technology developments are needed economic feasibility appears attainable implementing biocatalysis in a way that allows reuse of the proteins is essential for cost effective perchlorate treatment hutchison et al 2017 and likely for biocatalytic and biosorption approaches in general as others have noted previously e g sheldon 2007 tufvesson et al 2010 zhu et al 2019 a wide variety of approaches are available for protein reuse e g cao 2005 minteer 2011 several of these approaches have been investigated for environmental applications including immobilizing proteins for use in fixed bed regenerable ion exchange style systems e g venkiteshwaran et al 2018 displaying them on a cell surface e g chen et al 2016 hussein et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 or attaching them to beads or nanotubes which can be settled filtered out or recovered with a magnetic field depending on their size e g kumar and cabana 2016 zhu et al 2021 despite decades of research in the pharmaceutical industry identifying an immobilization strategy that maintains or enhances activity and stability for a given protein remains largely a matter of trial and error integration of data driven approaches such as materials informatics jones et al 2020 has the potential to accelerate design of new materials featuring effective immobilization as discussed in a recent review zhu et al 2019 for our purposes here the important point is that immobilization and reuse are technically feasible to our knowledge robust tea and lca analyses for contaminant removal and or recovery from water or wastewater using cell free protein based biosorbents have not been conducted however two teas focused on the use of intact bacterial cells for sorption and recovery of rare earth elements from industrial byproducts identified specific applications that were economically viable alipanah et al 2020 jin et al 2017 both studies incorporated immobilization and reuse of the whole cell biosorbents which was critical for economic and environmental performance considering stability and matrix complexity the surface expressed peptide tags on these cells were active in a range of complex matrices including acid leachate and geothermal brine jin et al 2017 for biosorption in addition to the concept of sorbent reuse new dimensions come into play biosorbents not only need to be retained or recovered for reuse their sorption capacity also needs to be regenerated under controlled conditions to release the target sorbate analogous to reversible selective inorganic ion exchange like reuse regeneration is technically feasible for example phosphorus binding capacity was sustained over ten cycles of neutral and high ph washes that promoted adsorption and desorption respectively venkiteshwaran et al 2018 from a cost perspective biosorption has additional potential benefits recovery of the compound being removed in a concentrated high affinity pure form high specificity could advance the waste valorization paradigm other considerations may be universal or specific to certain biocatalysts or biosorbents as with any emerging technology infrastructure buildup is necessary to supply protein based materials the protein production scale required for the technologies proposed here is an ongoing field of study however large scale applications are being pursued commercially for biocatalytic recycling of polyethylene terephthalate plastics albert 2020 although stability and sensitivity to complex water matrices were not problematic for perchlorate biocatalysis these important characteristics affect the economic feasibility of biocatalysis and biosorption and will likely vary across proteins however even in cases where stability and or sensitivity are problematic there are established routes for improving protein characteristics including mining biological diversity mobilia et al 2017 applying directed evolution arnold 1996 and using structure based approaches sammond et al 2007 on the whole then realizing these technology improvements could put the economic feasibility of biocatalysis and biosorption for water and wastewater treatment within reach for perchlorate reduction which requires reducing power another major technology development goal required for sustainable application is identifying effective and scalable means of supplying electron donors hutchison et al 2017 identifying suitable sources of electron donors or acceptors will be important for redox reactions while other types of reactions might require specific cofactors or cosubstrates and yet others might not require anything besides the biocatalyst and the contaminant mobilia et al 2017 for biosorbents the materials needed for regeneration will be a key consideration determining when biocatalysis or biosorption might be appropriate a decision to investigate one of these approaches should be based on specific characteristics of the contaminant s in general contaminants with recovery value are good candidates for biosorption while contaminants that are difficult to treat with existing methods are good candidates for biocatalysis fig 1 biosorption could assist with the recovery of economically valuable constituents in water facilitating the shift from wastewater treatment plants to water resource recovery facilities for contaminants that have little to no economic value transformation into innocuous end products is beneficial classification of a compound as a contaminant generally depends on it having biological effects since cells evolve over time to take up useful resources and to expel or degrade toxic compounds potential biosorbents or biocatalysts are likely to be naturally occurring for many contaminants in cases where current technologies are unable to realize the full potential of resource recovery or contaminant degradation then existing proteins may provide new treatments based on biosorption biocatalysis biocatalysis and biosorption can be applied on their own or within hybrid processes hybrid processes in which biocatalysis or biosorption play a supporting role may provide particularly good opportunities to rigorously evaluate performance and reliability in water and wastewater treatment and to develop operational experience with these emerging technologies for example sidestream biocatalysis could be used to regenerate spent anion exchange brine hutchison and zilles 2018 enhancing the sustainability of ion exchange processes lehman et al 2008 phosphate binding proteins could facilitate anaerobic digestion of enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr biosolids by capturing the released phosphate and allowing its recovery specifically comparing biocatalysis and biosorption to biological processes in general whole cell biological processes should be investigated first they are likely to be less expensive because the cells are biologically regenerated within the process however there are a variety of applications where whole cell processes are ineffective or uncompetitive for example when a contaminant is present at low concentrations or in sporadic pulses it might be unable to sustain a whole cell process but could be amenable to treatment using cell free proteins in other cases there might be health risks regulatory restrictions and or public relations concerns associated with the use of whole cells such as in drinking water treatment in the united states while the health risks associated with any specific biocatalyst or biosorbent need to be evaluated the building blocks of proteins are nontoxic and their inability to reproduce reduces the risk of widespread contamination as compared with whole cells biocatalysis and biosorption can also provide more opportunities for a targeted process for example biocatalysis allows removal of perchlorate in the presence of excess co contaminating nitrate hutchison et al 2013 a condition where whole cells preferentially remove the nitrate likewise phosphorus binding proteins are being investigated as biosorbents in part because of the potential to selectively recover phosphorus even in the presence of structurally similar oxyanions such as sulfate and arsenate which can co adsorb to inorganic adsorbents venkiteshwaran et al 2020 2021 even when compound recovery may not be a priority biosorbents selectivity and sensitivity may still have utility such as with ultra low treatment targets e g 10 µg l arsenic to investigate the potential treatment landscape for biocatalysis and biosorption in more detail we collected and modeled key protein characteristics and compared them to environmental contaminant concentrations specifically for biocatalysts kinetic parameters for activity vmax and substrate affinity km were used in conjunction with the michaelis menten equation to calculate enzyme activity µmole min 1 µmole 1 simplified to min 1 for contaminant concentration ranges typical of environmental waters and wastewaters the resulting contaminant concentrations and corresponding biocatalyst activities ranged across 12 orders of magnitude a large treatment landscape fig 2 a typically biocatalyst activity profiles would have a characteristic plateau at maximum activity as seen with the phenol degrading biocatalysts this plateau is missing for several enzymes because the environmentally relevant contaminant concentrations used here were too low to support maximum activity for biocatalysts on the lower part of the graph where activity is relatively low at relevant concentrations optimization of substrate affinity might be necessary this research need has been noted previously for example in a study using laccase to remove tetracycline abejón et al 2015 nonetheless biocatalysts provide advantages over chemical catalysts including using earth abundant nontoxic metals in lieu of the rare and hazardous metals common to traditional chemical catalysts and having faster kinetics for example the perchlorate reducing biocatalysts activity value is 41 000 times greater than rhenium palladium based perchlorate reducing catalysts hutchison and zilles 2015 even more noteworthy are the extreme reaction potentials achieved by the fastest biocatalysts which can push the upper bounds of the activity graph to 109 min 1 ogura and yamazaki 1983 for biosorbents the relevant parameter is the equilibrium dissociation constant kd which is a measure of the protein s binding affinity for the contaminant the inverse of kd is equivalent to the langmuir equilibrium constant to calculate the results in fig 2b the langmuir isotherm was integrated in a continuously stirred tank reactor mass balance with a flow rate of one million liters per day a uniform distribution of environmentally relevant contaminant concentrations was used to determine the moles of biosorbent required to achieve effluent targets some precious metals were excluded from the figure due to their low environmental concentrations several of the phosphate binding proteins are approaching an ideal binding efficiency frontier of 1 1 molar ratio of biosorbent to contaminant over a range of contaminant removals for these proteins further efforts to optimize binding efficiency or to decrease the kd value may not yield substantial improvements in comparison the arsenic binding protein modeled here shows room for improvement in binding efficiency key research needs as detailed in this perspective piece the available data suggest that biocatalysis and biosorption could be economically viable for particular water and wastewater applications our comparison of kinetic parameters for biocatalysts and dissociation constants indicative of binding strength for biosorbents with environmentally relevant contaminant concentrations suggests the potential treatment landscape is large we turn therefore to highlighting key research needs for development of this promising new water treatment toolbox as detailed above development and demonstration of repeated cycles of reuse is a key technology development goal although a few studies have demonstrated cycles of reuse e g chen et al 2016 venkiteshwaran et al 2018 little data is available to show how many cycles might be feasible particularly in natural water and wastewater matrices and support materials have not been optimized for these applications more generally the many different approaches for immobilization and or recovery likely vary in their associated trade offs including effects on activity mass transfer limitations and retention recovery efficiency strategic use of integrated life cycle analysis lca and technoeconomic assessment tea that include potential technology improvements also referred to as prospective assessments or quantitative sustainable design shi and guest 2020 thomassen et al 2019 should continue to guide technology development hutchison et al 2017 establishing a robust framework for development of biocatalytic and biosorptive treatment processes it would be particularly helpful to have a representative lca tea for biosorption as the value of recovered product could shift the economics further into the competitive realm conclusions biocatalysis and biosorption have the potential to provide robust high activity capacity tailored specificity and low cost processes improving our ability to meet water and wastewater treatment goals biosorption additionally could facilitate resource recovery this is a research area ripe for advancement key research needs include i evaluating different approaches for biocatalyst biosorbent reuse and their associated impacts on activity stability mass transfer and flow rates and ii conducting teas and lcas to guide technology development toward the most problematic issues and

established qpcr modifications to measure infectivity is capsid integrity qpcr an approach where samples are pre treated with the intercalating azo dyes propidium monoazide pma ethidium monoazide ema or their derivates pmaxx and pemax first described almost two decades ago by nogva et al 2003 to allow the identification of viable but non cultivable bacteria this technique has been successfully adapted to remove putatively false positive qpcr signals deriving from virions with broken capsids in complex matrices like sewage and surface water leifels et al 2016 randazzo et al 2018a based on the principle that an azo dye can only enter virions with a damaged capsid to covalently and irreversibly bind with viral dna or rna this pretreatment can block amplification of nucleic acids due to the detachment of the polymerase when it encounters the dye genome complex subsequently only genomic targets are amplified that originate from intact virions while those nucleic acids that are free outside the virion or belong to non infectious viruses are removed from the quantitative qpcr this indirect viable measurement method has been especially useful for those viruses for which cell cultivation based detection has been difficult but has yet to be fully validated estes et al 2019 one known limitation of the azo intercalating dyes is their inability to differentiate viruses that have lost their infectivity due to damaged nucleic acids but whose capsid remains intact a condition often found after uv c treatment leifels et al 2015 moreover there are numerous factors that affect the efficacy of a method including virus type inactivation method type of dye and its concentration incubation conditions and light source are also crucial in the applicability of capsid integrity qpcr as reflected by the great range of capsid integrity pretreatment conditions in the literature consequently the objectives of this review were to evaluate the efficiency of azo dye pretreatment conditions as stated in current literature and to establish protocols and considerations of the capsid integrity qpcr methods for virus infectivity monitoring 2 literature search and analysis strategy the guidelines for systematic article search and selection as recommended in the prisma statement have been adopted in this work moher et al 2009 2015 to ensure reproducibility a search string was constructed in accordance with the cochrane handbook cochrane 2019 and a search was conducted in march 2020 fig 1 in relevant databases like pubmed scopus ovid medline and web of knowledge to cover relevant articles in english since the first introduction of the azo dye pretreatment in 2003 supplementary table s1 articles were screened according to specific criteria for quality control and to follow the recommendations of cochrane 2019 two of the authors m l and k s conducted the title and abstract evaluation in parallel with a third author e s acting as tie breaker in the case of disagreement as depicted in fig 2 the 41 articles represented here include studies discussing the application of azo dyes pma ema pmaxx and pemax to determine virus or bacteriophage infectivity in the context of food safety or environmental virology as well as comparisons of azo dye applications with other established methods such as cell culture phage plaque assay or conventional qpcr supplementary table s2 disinfection methods utilized in water treatment or food safety have also used capsid integrity qpcr to determine the efficiency in virus inactivation lee et al 2018 leifels et al 2015 randazzo et al 2018b 3 viruses studied all known types of enteric viruses whether they contain single or double stranded dna or rna have been studied with capsid integrity qpcr methods with most investigations focusing on non enveloped viruses fig 3 most studies investigated two or more viruses 69 with an emphasis on the detection of norovirus gi and gii nov gi nov gii together with hepatitis a virus hav the increase in the number of studies on capsid integrity of nov and hav between 2016 and 2020 is most likely associated with the release of iso ts 15216 1 2013 iso 2013a and iso ts 15216 2 2013 iso 2013b that regulate the qualitative analysis and to a certain extent quantification of nov and hav in food using qpcr both standards have subsequently been replaced with updated versions iso 2017 2019 the risk associated with norovirus outbreaks due to a low infectious dose and high rate of particle shedding by infected individuals together with the absence of commercially available animal tissue cell lines also explains the interest in developing azo dye pretreatments for the detection of nov blanco et al 2017 lowther et al 2019 murine norovirus mnv and mengovirus two viruses without relevance to human health have been chosen as both have been reported to be suitable as process controls because they lack human pathogenicity and are easy to propagate on commercial cell lines coudray et al 2013 iso 2013a of the articles included only three cover bacteriophages infecting escherichia coli as their host phages ms2 phix174 and t4 as the laboratory safety requirements as well as workload for culture based detection of those phages are significantly lower than for enteric viruses the necessity to establish alternative methods to determine phage infectivity is not as urgent as for enteric viruses toribio avedillo et al 2020 their increasing relevance in the context of microbial source tracking will likely lead to more studies in the future ogilvie et al 2018 wangkahad et al 2017 the intercalating dye infectivity assay was successfully applied to most viruses tested with few exceptions bacteriophage t4 infecting escherichia coli required higher temperatures for inactivation than other viruses with extremely high heat 110 c for significant capsid damage lower temperatures 85 c and proteolysis were not effective fittipaldi et al 2012 moreover capsid disruption of mnv was more challenging than for other viruses in the same studies i e human adenovirus hadv poliovirus rotavirus rov and bacteriophages phix174 and ms2 using heat treatment kim and ko 2012 leifels et al 2015 lack of efficacy of an azo dye method with avian influenza virus was suspected to be due to natural characteristics of an enveloped virus that make it difficult for ema to penetrate the compromised capsid graiver et al 2010 however the pma dye assay was successfully applied to detect dengue virus another enveloped single stranded rna virus huang et al 2016 lending further support to the conclusion that pma is more effective than ema in removing false positive signals in qpcr while not showing microbicidal effects fittipaldi et al 2012 gedalanga and olson 2009 leifels et al 2019 4 origin of studied viruses the viruses analyzed were split evenly between strains obtained from culture collections and wild types those obtained from clinical environmental and food samples table 1 while progress has been made in introducing protocols for their propagation in the laboratory an established cell line to propagate nov gi gii has yet to arrive estes et al 2019 veronica et al 2018 subsequently the studies included in this review analyzed nov in stool samples obtained from hospitals in sewage or in surface water one study evaluated the presence of nov gi gii in struvite a phosphate source used for fertilization that was reclaimed from wastewater sludge yee et al 2019 for other viruses direct investigation for effects of strain origins i e laboratory grown strains and environmentally acquired strains is limited and comparisons of results among different studies would lead to biases due to diverse experimental protocols and conditions moreover a limitation of azo dye studies on clinical environmental and food samples is the absence of information regarding absolute quantification of infectious and non infectious viruses to evaluate the assay performance even though known concentrations of mengovirus randazzo et al 2018a 2018b or murine norovirus leifels et al 2016 2019 have been added as internal controls in some studies investigating greywater used for irrigation or freshwater near a recreational bathing site other complicating factors include process recovery loss and inhibition effects in qpcr assays that appeared to affect rna viruses more than dna viruses regardless of azo dye pretreatment leifels et al 2016 next we discuss the assay conditions that influence the efficacy of capsid integrity qpcr in measuring infective viruses 5 azo dye type and concentration range both ema and pma can permeate the bacterial cell membrane and virus capsid to intercalate with nucleic acids when activated with light emitted by high energy lamps or blue light emitting diodes leds these azo dyes became available for research purposes in the early 2000s but a number of studies reported that the more charged ema tended to enter bacterial cells with intact membranes thus potentially resulting in false negative qpcr results and cytotoxic effects fittipaldi et al 2012 gedalanga and olson 2009 seventy percent of the articles we researched used pma or the derived pmaxx and a third of the studies compared them to ema and or the derivate pemax table 1 in general pma and pmaxx were found to be more suitable for capsid integrity qpcr most likely due to their higher ability to enter thermally and chemically inactivated virions while not penetrating intact capsids or showing microbicidal effects jeong et al 2017 kim et al 2017 moreno et al 2015 when compared to infectious virus titers determined by cell culture leifels et al 2019 azo dye concentrations are quite evenly distributed ranging from less than 10 μm to greater than 200 μm more than half of the articles under investigation reported either 50 μm or 100 μm table 1 which is in accordance with the recommendations by the manufacturer for bacterial cultures biotium inc 2019 however some works indicated optimal reduction rates of presumably false positive signals as shown in the cell culture with dye concentrations between 4 μm and 10 μm karim et al 2015 lee et al 2016 leifels et al 2016 2019 prevost et al 2016 the effect of high azo dye concentration appeared to vary with virus type for example two log reduction in viability of phage ms2 has been reported with 125 μm pma kim and ko 2012 while 250 μm pma successfully removed signals of inactivated viruses for mnv and nov gii 4 without causing an adverse inactivation effect jeong et al 2017 lee et al 2015 6 incubation conditions approximately two thirds of the studies included in this review applied an incubation time with the azo dye of 5 or 10 min table 1 a quarter incubated for 30 min and less than one in ten of the studies reported periods lasting longer than one hour a similarly clear trend is observed for incubation temperature most studies incubated at temperatures between 20 c and 25 c or indicated that room temperature was used table 1 the remainder of the articles described the samples being stored on ice or at 4 6 c none of them used higher temperatures as sometimes discussed for bacterial assays codony et al 2019 studies that applied a long incubation time tended to use low temperatures coudray mounier et al 2013 sangsanont et al 2014 prevost et al 2016 leifels et al 2016 2019 canh et al 2018 2019 oristo et al 2018 fraisse et al 2018 7 dye activation conditions early publications utilizing azo dyes for the removal of non infectious virus particles exclusively applied 500 to 800 watt halogen light sources used in stage lighting bellehumeur et al 2015 canh et al 2018 escudero abarca et al 2014 graiver et al 2010 leifels et al 2015 parshionikar et al 2010 sangsanont et al 2014 besides their operational hazards such as light bulbs exploding due to long running times a maximum of 5 min is recommended by the manufacturer both the heat and light emission in the ultraviolet and infrared spectra could potentially harm the sample thus subverting the purpose of the pretreatment altogether wider availability of consumer grade led light technology in general and the introduction of dedicated azo dye activation light sources by companies like geniul spain allowed for a much more precise and reproducible activation of pma ema pemax and pmaxx not surprisingly 72 of the records included in this review utilized either the commercial led active blue light system geniul spain or leds emitting blue around 460 nm light lee et al 2015 fongaro et al 2016 as depicted in table 1 a similar trend towards uniformity in the protocol design is apparent in the length of time a sample is exposed to the light source while the operational requirements of the 500 to 800 w halogen lamps severely limited the exposure time to very short periods the standard configuration of the commercial light systems allows for 15 min of intense blue light two thirds of the studies therefore employed 15 min as the light exposure time 8 additional reagents for azo dye pretreatment addition of non ionic surfactants like triton x 100 coudray meunier et al 2013 moreno et al 2015 and sodium lauroyl sarcosinate lee et al 2018 2019 have been described as beneficial for the determination of virus infectivity and were most frequently used in the studies evaluated table 1 inclusion of non ionic surfactant enable the azo dye molecules to enter partially or completely ruptured capsids thus improving their binding properties in the virus genome palladium and platinum compounds such as platinum iv chloride ptcl4 and cis dichlorodiammineplatinum cppd are long known to chelate in mammalian cells by nucleic acid ligands rosenberg et al 1965 and have recently been adopted for the qpcr based discrimination between live and dead bacteria such as e coli and cronobacter skazakii soejima et al 2016 attempts to use them to determine virus infectivity have been successful but their associated health risk limits potential applications in routine environmental microbiology fraisse et al 2018 randazzo et al 2018b 9 virus inactivation various methods to inactivate viruses were used in the studies included in this review the intention was either to evaluate disinfection efficiency as it is currently used in food safety and water treatment jeong et al 2017 langlet et al 2018 leifels et al 2016 randazzo et al 2018a or to act as controls to evaluate the efficacy of the capsid integrity protocol canh et al 2018 2019 farkas et al 2020 leifels et al 2015 addition of chlorine exposure to heat and proteolysis are known to damage the viral capsid thus rendering the genome accessible to azo dyes temperatures from moderate to high 45 c 95 c for ten to thirty minutes could reproducibly demonstrate the ability of all dyes to remove virus signals to varying degrees from molecular quantification fraisse et al 2018 jeong et al 2017 leifels et al 2015 2019 oristo et al 2018 similar effects could be shown for the addition of hypochlorite of up to two milligram per milliliter fuster et al 2016 mclellan et al 2016 prevost et al 2016 light in the ultraviolet spectrum on the other hand affects the hydrogen bonds between nucleic acids resulting in the inability to reproduce inside the host cell capsid integrity qpcr failed to capture the loss of virus infectivity in most uv studies karim et al 2015 kim et al 2017 leifels et al 2016 2019 it could detect capsid damage caused by medium pressure uv lamps especially at 230 245 nm wavelength sangsanont et al 2014 but not nucleic acid damage caused by other wavelengths in the uv range beck et al 2018 beck et al 2014 sirikanchana et al 2008a b natural decay and the ability of azo dyes to remove virus signals originating from this die off have been investigated explicitly only by prevost et al 2016 fongaro et al 2016 and coudray mounier et al 2013 while other works discussed effects on virus enumeration in environmental samples leifels et al 2016 2019 lee et al 2016 the viruses assessed in those studies are all classified as enteric and non enveloped potentially limiting the applicability of insights obtained to enveloped viruses like sars cov 2 or dengue virus the varying efficiencies of pma pmaxx pemax and ema in preventing the amplification of dna rna of viruses that have lost their ability to infect their host cells due to exposure to heat and reactive substances like chlorine resemble those that have been described for bacteria starting with the first publication on the subject nogva et al 2003 10 recommendations and potential applications the utilization of azo dye pretreatment can be recommended for applications where culture assays take too long to inform necessary remedial actions and under low resource conditions either in developing countries or in laboratories with only basic analytical capabilities and biosafety levels the recent outbreak of sars cov 2 associated covid 19 represents an example where knowing the ratio of infectious to non infectious virions would help in determining whether symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers need to be isolated beeching et al 2020 kaul 2020 and could potentially increase the confidence in already standardized molecular quantification methods by removing at least a portion of the false positive signals considering the utility of wastewater based surveillance during the current sars cov 2 pandemic corpuz et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 studies evaluating the use of capsid integrity qpcr to detect this non enteric enveloped virus are needed and expected to be published in the coming months a step by step protocol introducing azo dye pretreatment to determine capsid integrity and thus virus infectivity into an established qpcr workflow can be developed fig 4 based on parameters suggested in this review like incubation duration dye concentration as well as light source and exposure time the key steps in the optimization process are virus and matrix specific optimization e g increasing the length of the genome region targeted by the qpcr assay to increase the probability of azo dye genome interaction and the dilution of extracted environmental samples to reduce the influence of co concentrated inhibitory substances as well as optimizing incubation conditions dye concentration and photoactivation to determine the validity of azo dye pretreatment of environmental samples a robust set of controls for environmental and foodstuff related samples should be included such controls could involve viral targets like pepper mild mottle virus symonds et al 2019 and crassphage farkas et al 2019 that occur in the majority of samples but are not human pathogenic alternatively the addition of known concentrations of viruses that are not endemic in the water under investigation e g mengovirus and murine norovirus prior to sample concentration as well as the azo dye pretreatment have been reported in addition to allowing the determination of a virus recovery rate such external controls can also help quantifying the ratio of virions with intact and broken capsid 11 conclusions an evaluation of methods on the application of azo dye pretreatment to determine virus infectivity by qpcr revealed a great diversity of viruses that have been tested under a range of treatment conditions the systematic literature comparison led to the following conclusions pma and the derivate pmaxx show a higher efficiency in removing false positive signals from qpcr for both dna and rna viruses than ema and pemax incubation duration and temperature reagent concentration as well as light source and exposure time need to be optimized and validated for the virus under investigation one size fits all pretreatment approaches are possible but might lead to lower signal reduction rates of individual viruses capsid integrity qpcr can be a valuable tool to adapt existent workflows and qpcr protocols to reflect the ability of viruses to infect humans thus improving risk assessment and consumer safety derived from these measurements capsid integrity is a strong indicator of virus infectivity which allows for the establishment of robust assays to assess the infectivity of novel viruses in the event of outbreaks like the 2014 ebola virus epidemic and

follow the recommendations of cochrane 2019 two of the authors m l and k s conducted the title and abstract evaluation in parallel with a third author e s acting as tie breaker in the case of disagreement as depicted in fig 2 the 41 articles represented here include studies discussing the application of azo dyes pma ema pmaxx and pemax to determine virus or bacteriophage infectivity in the context of food safety or environmental virology as well as comparisons of azo dye applications with other established methods such as cell culture phage plaque assay or conventional qpcr supplementary table s2 disinfection methods utilized in water treatment or food safety have also used capsid integrity qpcr to determine the efficiency in virus inactivation lee et al 2018 leifels et al 2015 randazzo et al 2018b 3 viruses studied all known types of enteric viruses whether they contain single or double stranded dna or rna have been studied with capsid integrity qpcr methods with most investigations focusing on non enveloped viruses fig 3 most studies investigated two or more viruses 69 with an emphasis on the detection of norovirus gi and gii nov gi nov gii together with hepatitis a virus hav the increase in the number of studies on capsid integrity of nov and hav between 2016 and 2020 is most likely associated with the release of iso ts 15216 1 2013 iso 2013a and iso ts 15216 2 2013 iso 2013b that regulate the qualitative analysis and to a certain extent quantification of nov and hav in food using qpcr both standards have subsequently been replaced with updated versions iso 2017 2019 the risk associated with norovirus outbreaks due to a low infectious dose and high rate of particle shedding by infected individuals together with the absence of commercially available animal tissue cell lines also explains the interest in developing azo dye pretreatments for the detection of nov blanco et al 2017 lowther et al 2019 murine norovirus mnv and mengovirus two viruses without relevance to human health have been chosen as both have been reported to be suitable as process controls because they lack human pathogenicity and are easy to propagate on commercial cell lines coudray et al 2013 iso 2013a of the articles included only three cover bacteriophages infecting escherichia coli as their host phages ms2 phix174 and t4 as the laboratory safety requirements as well as workload for culture based detection of those phages are significantly lower than for enteric viruses the necessity to establish alternative methods to determine phage infectivity is not as urgent as for enteric viruses toribio avedillo et al 2020 their increasing relevance in the context of microbial source tracking will likely lead to more studies in the future ogilvie et al 2018 wangkahad et al 2017 the intercalating dye infectivity assay was successfully applied to most viruses tested with few exceptions bacteriophage t4 infecting escherichia coli required higher temperatures for inactivation than other viruses with extremely high heat 110 c for significant capsid damage lower temperatures 85 c and proteolysis were not effective fittipaldi et al 2012 moreover capsid disruption of mnv was more challenging than for other viruses in the same studies i e human adenovirus hadv poliovirus rotavirus rov and bacteriophages phix174 and ms2 using heat treatment kim and ko 2012 leifels et al 2015 lack of efficacy of an azo dye method with avian influenza virus was suspected to be due to natural characteristics of an enveloped virus that make it difficult for ema to penetrate the compromised capsid graiver et al 2010 however the pma dye assay was successfully applied to detect dengue virus another enveloped single stranded rna virus huang et al 2016 lending further support to the conclusion that pma is more effective than ema in removing false positive signals in qpcr while not showing microbicidal effects fittipaldi et al 2012 gedalanga and olson 2009 leifels et al 2019 4 origin of studied viruses the viruses analyzed were split evenly between strains obtained from culture collections and wild types those obtained from clinical environmental and food samples table 1 while progress has been made in introducing protocols for their propagation in the laboratory an established cell line to propagate nov gi gii has yet to arrive estes et al 2019 veronica et al 2018 subsequently the studies included in this review analyzed nov in stool samples obtained from hospitals in sewage or in surface water one study evaluated the presence of nov gi gii in struvite a phosphate source used for fertilization that was reclaimed from wastewater sludge yee et al 2019 for other viruses direct investigation for effects of strain origins i e laboratory grown strains and environmentally acquired strains is limited and comparisons of results among different studies would lead to biases due to diverse experimental protocols and conditions moreover a limitation of azo dye studies on clinical environmental and food samples is the absence of information regarding absolute quantification of infectious and non infectious viruses to evaluate the assay performance even though known concentrations of mengovirus randazzo et al 2018a 2018b or murine norovirus leifels et al 2016 2019 have been added as internal controls in some studies investigating greywater used for irrigation or freshwater near a recreational bathing site other complicating factors include process recovery loss and inhibition effects in qpcr assays that appeared to affect rna viruses more than dna viruses regardless of azo dye pretreatment leifels et al 2016 next we discuss the assay conditions that influence the efficacy of capsid integrity qpcr in measuring infective viruses 5 azo dye type and concentration range both ema and pma can permeate the bacterial cell membrane and virus capsid to intercalate with nucleic acids when activated with light emitted by high energy lamps or blue light emitting diodes leds these azo dyes became available for research purposes in the early 2000s but a number of studies reported that the more charged ema tended to enter bacterial cells with intact membranes thus potentially resulting in false negative qpcr results and cytotoxic effects fittipaldi et al 2012 gedalanga and olson 2009 seventy percent of the articles we researched used pma or the derived pmaxx and a third of the studies compared them to ema and or the derivate pemax table 1 in general pma and pmaxx were found to be more suitable for capsid integrity qpcr most likely due to their higher ability to enter thermally and chemically inactivated virions while not penetrating intact capsids or showing microbicidal effects jeong et al 2017 kim et al 2017 moreno et al 2015 when compared to infectious virus titers determined by cell culture leifels et al 2019 azo dye concentrations are quite evenly distributed ranging from less than 10 μm to greater than 200 μm more than half of the articles under investigation reported either 50 μm or 100 μm table 1 which is in accordance with the recommendations by the manufacturer for bacterial cultures biotium inc 2019 however some works indicated optimal reduction rates of presumably false positive signals as shown in the cell culture with dye concentrations between 4 μm and 10 μm karim et al 2015 lee et al 2016 leifels et al 2016 2019 prevost et al 2016 the effect of high azo dye concentration appeared to vary with virus type for example two log reduction in viability of phage ms2 has been reported with 125 μm pma kim and ko 2012 while 250 μm pma successfully removed signals of inactivated viruses for mnv and nov gii 4 without causing an adverse inactivation effect jeong et al 2017 lee et al 2015 6 incubation conditions approximately two thirds of the studies included in this review applied an incubation time with the azo dye of 5 or 10 min table 1 a quarter incubated for 30 min and less than one in ten of the studies reported periods lasting longer than one hour a similarly clear trend is observed for incubation temperature most studies incubated at temperatures between 20 c and 25 c or indicated that room temperature was used table 1 the remainder of the articles described the samples being stored on ice or at 4 6 c none of them used higher temperatures as sometimes discussed for bacterial assays codony et al 2019 studies that applied a long incubation time tended to use low temperatures coudray mounier et al 2013 sangsanont et al 2014 prevost et al 2016 leifels et al 2016 2019 canh et al 2018 2019 oristo et al 2018 fraisse et al 2018 7 dye activation conditions early publications utilizing azo dyes for the removal of non infectious virus particles exclusively applied 500 to 800 watt halogen light sources used in stage lighting bellehumeur et al 2015 canh et al 2018 escudero abarca et al 2014 graiver et al 2010 leifels et al 2015 parshionikar et al 2010 sangsanont et al 2014 besides their operational hazards such as light bulbs exploding due to long running times a maximum of 5 min is recommended by the manufacturer both the heat and light emission in the ultraviolet and infrared spectra could potentially harm the sample thus subverting the purpose of the pretreatment altogether wider availability of consumer grade led light technology in general and the introduction of dedicated azo dye activation light sources by companies like geniul spain allowed for a much more precise and reproducible activation of pma ema pemax and pmaxx not surprisingly 72 of the records included in this review utilized either the commercial led active blue light system geniul spain or leds emitting blue around 460 nm light lee et al 2015 fongaro et al 2016 as depicted in table 1 a similar trend towards uniformity in the protocol design is apparent in the length of time a sample is exposed to the light source while the operational requirements of the 500 to 800 w halogen lamps severely limited the exposure time to very short periods the standard configuration of the commercial light systems allows for 15 min of intense blue light two thirds of the studies therefore employed 15 min as the light exposure time 8 additional reagents for azo dye pretreatment addition of non ionic surfactants like triton x 100 coudray meunier et al 2013 moreno et al 2015 and sodium lauroyl sarcosinate lee et al 2018 2019 have been described as beneficial for the determination of virus infectivity and were most frequently used in the studies evaluated table 1 inclusion of non ionic surfactant enable the azo dye molecules to enter partially or completely ruptured capsids thus improving their binding properties in the virus genome palladium and platinum compounds such as platinum iv chloride ptcl4 and cis dichlorodiammineplatinum cppd are long known to chelate in mammalian cells by nucleic acid ligands rosenberg et al 1965 and have recently been adopted for the qpcr based discrimination between live and dead bacteria such as e coli and cronobacter skazakii soejima et al 2016 attempts to use them to determine virus infectivity have been successful but their associated health risk limits potential applications in routine environmental microbiology fraisse et al 2018 randazzo et al 2018b 9 virus inactivation various methods to inactivate viruses were used in the studies included in this review the intention was either to evaluate disinfection efficiency as it is currently used in food safety and water treatment jeong et al 2017 langlet et al 2018 leifels et al 2016 randazzo et al 2018a or to act as controls to evaluate the efficacy of the capsid integrity protocol canh et al 2018 2019 farkas et al 2020 leifels et al 2015 addition of chlorine exposure to heat and proteolysis are known to damage the viral capsid thus rendering the genome accessible to azo dyes temperatures from moderate to high 45 c 95 c for ten to thirty minutes could reproducibly demonstrate the ability of all dyes to remove virus signals to varying degrees from molecular quantification fraisse et al 2018 jeong et al 2017 leifels et al 2015 2019 oristo et al 2018 similar effects could be shown for the addition of hypochlorite of up to two milligram per milliliter fuster et al 2016 mclellan et al 2016 prevost et al 2016 light in the ultraviolet spectrum on the other hand affects the hydrogen bonds between nucleic acids resulting in the inability to reproduce inside the host cell capsid integrity qpcr failed to capture the loss of virus infectivity in most uv studies karim et al 2015 kim et al 2017 leifels et al 2016 2019 it could detect capsid damage caused by medium pressure uv lamps especially at 230 245 nm wavelength sangsanont et al 2014 but not nucleic acid damage caused by other wavelengths in the uv range beck et al 2018 beck et al 2014 sirikanchana et al 2008a b natural decay and the ability of azo dyes to remove virus signals originating from this die off have been investigated explicitly only by prevost et al 2016 fongaro et al 2016 and coudray mounier et al 2013 while other works discussed effects on virus enumeration in environmental samples leifels et al 2016 2019 lee et al 2016 the viruses assessed in those studies are all classified as enteric and non enveloped potentially limiting the applicability of insights obtained to enveloped viruses like sars cov 2 or dengue virus the varying efficiencies of pma pmaxx pemax and ema in preventing the amplification of dna rna of viruses that have lost their ability to infect their host cells due to exposure to heat and reactive substances like chlorine resemble those that have been described for bacteria starting with the first publication on the subject nogva et al 2003 10 recommendations and potential applications the utilization of azo dye pretreatment can be recommended for applications where culture assays take too long to inform necessary remedial actions and under low resource conditions either in developing countries or in laboratories with only basic analytical capabilities and biosafety levels the recent outbreak of sars cov 2 associated covid 19 represents an example where knowing the ratio of infectious to non infectious virions would help in determining whether symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers need to be isolated beeching et al 2020 kaul 2020 and could potentially increase the confidence in already standardized molecular quantification methods by removing at least a portion of the false positive signals considering the utility of wastewater based surveillance during the current sars cov 2 pandemic corpuz et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 studies evaluating the use of capsid integrity qpcr to detect this non enteric enveloped virus are needed and expected to be published in the coming months a step by step protocol introducing azo dye pretreatment to determine capsid integrity and thus virus infectivity into an established qpcr workflow can be developed fig 4 based on parameters suggested in this review like incubation duration dye concentration as well as light source and exposure time the key steps in the optimization process are virus and matrix specific optimization e g increasing the length of the genome region targeted by the qpcr assay to increase the probability of azo dye genome interaction and the dilution of extracted environmental samples to reduce the influence of co concentrated inhibitory substances as well as optimizing incubation conditions dye concentration and photoactivation to determine the validity of azo dye pretreatment of environmental samples a robust set of controls for environmental and foodstuff related samples should be included such controls could involve viral targets like pepper mild mottle virus symonds et al 2019 and crassphage farkas et al 2019 that occur in the majority of samples but are not human pathogenic alternatively the addition of known concentrations of viruses that are not endemic in the water under investigation e g mengovirus and murine norovirus prior to sample concentration as well as the azo dye pretreatment have been reported in addition to allowing the determination of a virus recovery rate such external controls can also help quantifying the ratio of virions with intact and broken capsid 11 conclusions an evaluation of methods on the application of azo dye pretreatment to determine virus infectivity by qpcr revealed a great diversity of viruses that have been tested under a range of treatment conditions the systematic literature comparison led to the following conclusions pma and the derivate pmaxx show a higher efficiency in removing false positive signals from qpcr for both dna and rna viruses than ema and pemax incubation duration and temperature reagent concentration as well as light source and exposure time need to be optimized and validated for the virus under investigation one size fits all pretreatment approaches are possible but might lead to lower signal reduction rates of individual viruses capsid integrity qpcr can be a valuable tool to adapt existent workflows and qpcr protocols to reflect the ability of viruses to infect humans thus improving risk assessment and consumer safety derived from these measurements capsid integrity is a strong indicator of virus infectivity which allows for the establishment of robust assays to assess the infectivity of novel viruses in the event of outbreaks like the 2014 ebola virus epidemic and

19957,epidemiologists have used trihalomethanes thms as a surrogate for overall disinfection byproduct dbp exposure based on the assumption that thm concentrations are proportional to concentrations of other dbp classes toxicological evidence indicates thms are less potent toxins than unregulated classes like haloacetonitriles hans if thms are not proportional to the dbps driving toxicity the use of thms to measure exposure may introduce non trivial exposure misclassification bias in epidemiologic studies this study developed statistical models to evaluate the covariance and proportionality of han and thm concentrations in a dataset featuring over 9500 measurements from 248 public water systems thms only explain 30 of the variance in hans whether the data is pooled in a classic linear regression or hierarchically grouped by water system in a multilevel linear regression the 95 prediction interval on hans for the median thm concentration exceeds the interquartile range of hans mean han thm ratios range from 2 4 to 80 across water systems and varied with source water category season disinfectant sequence and distribution system location the han thm ratio was 265 higher in groundwater systems than in surface water systems and declined by 40 between finished effluent and maximum residence times in surface water systems with chlorine chlorine disinfection a maximum likelihood approach was used to estimate the misclassification bias that may result from using thms to construct risk ratios assuming that hans represent the true dbp exposure risk the results indicate an odds ratio of 2 estimated with thm concentrations could correspond to a true odds ratio of 4 5 these findings demonstrate the need for epidemiologic studies to evaluate exposure by measuring dbps that are likely to drive toxicity graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts drinking water epidemiology exposure assessment methods drinking water monitoring data 1 introduction epidemiologic studies have employed the four chlorinated and brominated trihalomethanes thms as a surrogate for exposure to total disinfection byproducts dbps grellier et al 2015 the significance and magnitude of the association between high thm concentrations and bladder cancer costet et al 2011 colorectal cancer rahman et al 2010 and adverse reproductive outcomes grellier et al 2010 wright et al 2017 has been inconsistent although meta analyses suggest that the most consistent association is with bladder cancer hrudey et al 2015 dbps occur in a complex mixture in disinfected drinking waters with over 700 species identified and it remains unknown which classes are toxicity drivers li and mitch 2018 richardson and kimura 2020 the toxicological evidence suggests that thms cannot explain the magnitude of risk identified for human health outcomes like bladder cancer bull et al 2012 thms were substantially less cytotoxic and genotoxic than most unregulated classes using in vitro chinese hamster ovary cho cell assays wagner and plewa 2017 when concentrations of individual dbps in drinking waters were weighted by their cho cytotoxicity lc50 values haloacetonitriles hans consistently comprised the majority of the toxic potency weighted concentrations while thms contributed very little chuang et al 2019 furst et al 2019 recent research has demonstrated that the cho cytotoxicity of defined mixtures of regulated and unregulated dbps is additive lau et al 2020 supporting the use of toxic potency weighted dbp concentrations to compare the contributions of individual dbps to cytotoxicity despite indications that thms are not the primary toxicity drivers thms continue to be used to assess dbp exposure based on the assumption that thms correlate with other dbps there are several reasons why this assumption may not be valid first differences in precursors between source waters could change the tendency to form thms vs other dbps for example while humic materials serve as thm precursors in pristine waters liang and singer 2003 wastewater and algal impacted waters feature higher dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations serving as precursors for nitrogenous dbps including hans westerhoff and mash 2002 shah and mitch 2012 second dbp classes feature distinct formation pathways differences in disinfection schemes could promote some classes over others chuang et al 2015 furst et al 2018 for example chlorine is more reactive than chloramines regarding halogen transfer to humic materials to form thms and to organic nitrogen to form hans hayes larsen et al 2010 shah and mitch 2012 however hans can also form via a separate pathway involving chloramine incorporation into aldehydes kimura et al 2013 vu et al 2019 thus switching from chlorine to chloramines may reduce thms to a greater extent than hans third thms increase with distribution system residence time as end products while other dbps occur as intermediates hua et al 2020 for example hans form as intermediates hydrolyzing to haloacetamides and haloacetic acids yu and reckhow 2015 thus intermediate dbps could reach steady state concentrations or decline while thms continue to increase previous studies of the spatiotemporal covariation of dbps in distribution systems are limited to analysis of thms with haloacetic acids e g hinckley et al 2005 evans et al 2013 and qualitative observations of thms with unregulated classes weinberg et al 2002 wei et al 2010 if thm concentrations are not reliably proportional to concentrations of toxicity drivers their use to measure dbp exposure could obscure the magnitude and significance of associations between dbps and adverse health outcomes i e exposure misclassification bias previous studies evaluating the relationship between thms and unregulated classes suffer from the following limitations 1 low sample count with few samples from many water systems furst et al 2019 krasner et al 1989 and or samples from few water systems wei et al 2010 2 analysis conducted on pooled data from multiple water systems and or time points without accounting for clustering and spatiotemporal dependencies wei et al 2010 krasner et al 2016 furst et al 2019 and 3 simplified methods for evaluating covariance e g pearson or spearman correlation coefficients krasner et al 1989 wei et al 2010 krasner et al 2016 furst et al 2019 the conclusions of these studies were mixed for hans and thms krasner et al 1989 and wei et al 2010 found high correlations r2 0 9 while furst et al 2019 found a lower correlation r2 0 5 0 6 the goal of this study is to evaluate the assumption that thms are sufficient exposure surrogates for other dbp classes hans are used as a test case for two reasons 1 previous research suggests hans are more geno and cytotoxic than thms wagner and plewa 2017 2 the concentrations of both the four thms and four hans dichloroacetonitrile dcan bromochloroacetonitrile bcan dibromoacetonitrile dban and trichloroacetonitrile tcan are available in the u s environmental protection agency s information collection rule icr database usepa united states environmental protection agency 2000 the icr database encompasses 296 large us public water systems most consisting of multiple water treatment plant distribution system pairs wtps samples were collected quarterly between july 1997 and december 1998 i e up to six sampling events per wtp from the finished effluent and four distribution system locations providing over 10 000 sample records the database is extensively described in mcguire et al 2002 this study has 3 objectives 1 evaluate the assumption that thm concentrations are proportional to han concentrations between water systems as well as within individual water systems 2 examine how the han thm ratio varies with source water type season disinfectant sequence and distribution system residence time 3 estimate the odds ratio bias that may be incurred through misclassifying han exposure with thms as a surrogate and evaluate the implications for detecting associations between dbps and adverse health outcomes the results have important implications for the use of thm concentrations as an exposure surrogate for other dbp classes in epidemiologic studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 data preparation the icr aux1 database was retrieved from the epa data repository usepa united states environmental protection agency 2000 details regarding the initial processing and are provided in text s1 sample records missing values for any thm or han species were excluded in many records concentrations of certain species were left censored i e below the method reporting limits mrl of 1 0 μg l for each thm and 0 5 μg l for each han seven wtps with only left censored data for all species were excluded remaining left censored concentrations were replaced by half of the mrl for a record with left censored concentrations for all four hans or thms the cumulative replacement value was 1 0 μg l or 2 0 μg l respectively the replacement values for left censored concentrations could affect the outcome of models francis et al 2009 a sensitivity analysis was conducted by replacing left censored concentrations with the full mrl value and repeating key analyses the conclusions were unchanged text s2 the final fraction of left censored records was 15 4 for hans and 7 6 for thms records were included for samples collected from finished effluent finish three intermediate distribution system locations avg1 avg2 and dse or distribution system equivalent selected for comparison with simulated distribution system experiments and the maximum retention time max seven wtps with only finished effluent records were excluded systems that blended treated effluents from multiple wtps were excluded nearly 19 of records n 1835 had no entry for the primary disinfectant field 14 records were filled based on wtp process train information 25 records with erroneous entries were corrected less than 1 of records were affected the secondary residual disinfectant field was empty for 1 2 of records n 115 these were filled with chlorine or chloramines following evaluation of 1 other records for that wtp 2 relative concentrations of free and total chlorine and 3 utility process information lastly records from one of five quarters for one wtp were excluded due to unrealistic tcan concentrations 40 μg l at all sampling locations all tcan concentrations were below the mrl for the other four quarters with no observable change in water quality or treatment the final dataset consisted of 9587 records from 412 wtps representing 248 public water systems 2 2 selection of water system features included in the final models we evaluated the impact of four categorical variables on the han thm ratio source water type distribution system location season and disinfection sequence table s1a source water types include surface water groundwater mixed source waters where none exceeds 80 of the flow groundwater under the influence of surface water and purchased wholesale waters following screening 71 of records n 6772 represented surface water 25 represented groundwater n 2405 and the remaining categories each represented 1 2 of records text s1 records were sorted into season by sampling month summer june august autumn september november winter december february and spring march may the icr database included distribution system residence time estimates but these estimates are imprecise text s1 instead the location category was used to indicate relative residence time finish dse avg1 avg2 max table s1b primary disinfectants used were chlorine chloramines chlorine chloramines chlorine dioxide ozone or no entry residual disinfectants were either chlorine or chloramines primary and residual disinfectants were concatenated to create the disinfectant sequence variable table s1a 2 3 multilevel model development prior statistical evaluations of the icr database were developed by pooling measurements from multiple wtps with the assumption that data were generated by independent random sampling e g obolensky et al 2008 francis et al 2009 however the icr data is hierarchically grouped by wtp model errors are correlated for measurements within each wtp such that pooling the data produces overconfidence in model estimates in this study multilevel hierarchical regression models mlms were used to accommodate the hierarchical data structure and to estimate the variance between and within groups the mlms developed have a 2 level hierarchical structure with level 1 units 9578 sample records nested within level 2 groups 412 wtps the 412 wtps have a median of 25 records 25th percentile of 20 75th percentile of 29 range 3 30 in this study the classic and multilevel regression models were designated in two ways for objective 1 we first regress han concentrations on thm concentrations i e h a n s β t h m s α to estimate the variance in han concentrations explained by thms for the remainder of objective 1 and for objective 2 we use the ratio of han to thm concentrations as the outcome variable i e h a n s t h m s α to directly evaluate whether han and thm concentrations are proportional i e maintain a constant ratio the variance estimates for the multilevel model fit to the han thm ratio are more robust to left censoring than the equivalent bivariate multilevel model regressing hans against thms supplemental text s2 regression coefficients for mlms can either vary by group or are fixed for the population of groups equations 1 1 and 1 2 comprise the bivariate mlm used to evaluate the variance in han concentrations explained by thms equation 1 1 describes level 1 where outcome variable y i j is the han concentration log nm in sample i from wtp j explanatory variable x i j is the thm concentration log nm in sample i from wtp j coefficient β j is the slope for wtp j coefficient α j is the intercept and e i j is the residual error of sample i in wtp j equation 1 2 describes level 2 of the model in which coefficients α j and β j consist of a fixed population parameter fit to all wtps in the dataset α 0 and β 0 respectively and parameters that are fit to each wtp j u j and v j respectively u j and v j were assumed to be uncorrelated because the han and thm concentrations are log normally distributed they were log transformed prior to modeling for precision in the variance estimates 1 1 l e v e l 1 y i j α j β j x i j e i j 1 2 l e v e l 2 α j α 0 u j β j β 0 v j equations 2 1 and 2 2 describe the univariate model i e a model with no explanatory variables with the intercept allowed to vary by wtp to model the variance in the han thm ratio between and within wtps equation 2 1 describes level 1 of the model in which outcome variable y i j is defined as l o g h a n n m t h m n m in sample i from wtp j coefficient α j is the intercept and e i j is the residual error of sample i in wtp j level 2 equation 2 2 shows that α j consists of population parameter α 0 a fixed value fit to all wtps and u j fit to each wtp j 2 1 l e v e l 1 y i j α j e i j 2 2 l e v e l 2 α j α 0 u j to evaluate the effect of key water system features on the han thm ratio equation 2 1 was modified to include four categorical explanatory variables equation 3 1 source water type s r c sample location e v n t season s e a s and disinfectant sequence d i s coefficients β k γ l δ k and π n respectively intercept α 0 j is allowed to vary by wtp as in the previous model equation 3 2 interaction terms are included for source water type with disinfectant sequence and with season coefficients ζ k m and η k n respectively to capture differences in the effect of season on different source types and dependencies between the choice of disinfectant and the source water type y i j α j k β k s r c k l γ l e v n t k m δ k s e a s k n π n d i s n 3 1 k m ζ k m s r c k s e a s m k n η k n s r c k d i s n e i j 3 2 α j α 0 u j 2 4 estimating odds ratio bias we used logistic regression to estimate the potential odds ratio bias that may be incurred from misclassifying exposure with thms as a proxy for more toxic dbps with hans as an illustrative example epidemiologic studies often designate a threshold thm concentration as a binary indicator of low or high dbp exposure for each icr record the proxy exposure variable was set to one for thm concentrations above 543 nm the 90th percentile icr concentration and zero otherwise the true exposure was set to one for han concentrations above the 90th percentile concentration 62 4 nm and zero otherwise the probability of a given health outcome y p y as a function of the binary thm exposure surrogate z is given by 4 1 p y exp α λ z j γ j w j 1 exp α λ z j γ j w j where λ estimates the odds ratios for y with exposure surrogate z and w j is a set of covariates i e source water and distribution system location for the true dbp exposure x and the unbiased odds ratio estimate λ 4 2 p y exp α λ x j γ j w j 1 exp α λ x j γ j w j using equations 4 1 and 4 2 we fit the relationship between exposure proxy z and true exposure x to estimate the true odds ratio λ values corresponding to odds ratio estimates λ determined in epidemiologic studies that used thm as the exposure indicator a maximum likelihood approach was used to estimate the true odds ratios λ this required several assumptions 1 that hans not thms affect health outcomes 2 that the prevalence of congenital anomalies and bladder cancer in the general population is low and 3 that exposure misclassification is unrelated to the likelihood of a health outcome or to covariates w j i e it is non differential further details regarding the methods and assumptions are provided in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 thms as a simple linear predictor of han concentrations by using thms as a surrogate for overall dbp exposure epidemiologic studies implicitly assume that thms are proportional to more toxic dbps such as hans for studies within single water systems this assumption requires that thms are highly correlated with hans and the intercept i e the han concentration projected for a thm concentration of zero is small such that the han thm ratio does not vary substantially with thm concentration for studies that pool data from two or more water systems this assumption further requires a low variance in slopes and intercepts between water systems such that thm concentrations are consistently representative of han concentrations if these conditions are not met the use of thms as a surrogate may cause exposure misclassification resulting in odds ratio bias fig 1 shows the ordinary least squares ols linear regression of hans on thms where data from 9587 records is pooled without accounting for hierarchical clustering by wtp the correlation coefficients r2 on a weight 0 31 and molar basis 0 29 indicate that thms account for only 30 of total variation in hans substantially lower than the 0 9 r2 values reported for smaller datasets krasner et al 1989 wei et al 2010 for this pooled regression the error in the predicted han concentration for a given thm concentration e r r o r p r e d is calculated by equation 5 where σ ˆ is the standard deviation of the residuals x 0 is a measured thm concentration and v a r β ˆ is the variance of the slope estimate 5 e r r o r p r e d σ ˆ 2 x 0 2 v a r β ˆ v a r β ˆ σ ˆ 2 i 1 n x i x 2 for the median thm concentration of 31 4 μg l 223 nm table 1 the predicted han concentration is 3 89 μg l 28 5 nm with a 95 confidence interval of 0 μg l to 9 5 μg l 0 nm 76 nm for perspective this interval is 2 6 times the interquartile range of han concentrations 3 8 μg l 29 nm indicating that thms are an imprecise predictor of hans across multiple water systems the fan shape evident in fig 1 suggests that the prediction errors increase with increasing thm concentrations i e the model errors are heteroscedastic which was confirmed by a breusch pagan test for heteroskedasticity significant at the 0 1 level breusch and pagan 1979 heteroscedasticity is often a feature of hierarchically grouped data where each group has a distinct line of best fit as would be the case if the han thm relationship varies systematically between water systems 3 2 variance in the linear relationship of thm and han concentrations between water systems to evaluate the variance between and within the 412 wtps equation 1 mlm was fit to the icr dataset with hans log nm as the outcome and thms log nm as an explanatory variable to obtain intercept α and slope β for each wtp the total variance in the regression is decomposed into two components the level 2 variances i e the systematic variance between the 412 wtp intercepts σ α 2 0 087 and slopes σ β 2 0 008 and the level 1 residual variance within wtps σ e 2 0 128 table s2a the proportion of variance in hans explained by thms r2 0 322 can be calculated by comparing the total variances in this model with and without thms as an explanatory variable table s3 thus even after considering clustering by wtps thms only explain 32 of the total variance in hans across 412 wtps the intercepts α j mean 1 33 0 295 standard deviation sd and slopes β j mean 0 349 0 088 sd obtained from modeling the log transformed han and thm concentrations exhibited substantial variability table s2a the slopes represent the percent increase in han concentration for each 1 increase in thm concentration 95 of the wtp slopes fall between 0 206 and 0 479 thus for a 1 increase in thms the mean increase in hans is between 0 21 and 0 48 for most wtps to isolate the potential implication of this variability in slopes we translate to han concentrations with the equation h a n s e α t h m s β for the mean intercept e 1 33 3 78 nm hans and median thm concentration 223 nm the mean han concentration is between 11 5 and 50 7 nm for 95 of wtps this interval spans the 20th and 85th percentile han concentrations and easily exceeds the interquartile range 28 6 nm therefore the high variability in slopes relating han and thm concentrations between water systems has practical implications for the use of thms as an exposure surrogate for hans the relative standard deviation of the intercepts 0 221 is almost as great as for the slopes 0 252 indicating that variation in baseline han concentrations between wtps may be substantial enough to violate the assumption of proportionality between thms and hans 3 3 evaluation of the assumption of proportionality of hans and thms between and within wtps the use of thms as a proxy for total dbp exposure assumes that concentrations of thms and other dbps are proportional i e that they maintain a constant ratio as concentrations increase or decrease section 3 2 demonstrated that for many wtps the intercepts representing baseline han concentrations unassociated with thm formation can be substantial which suggests that the assumption of proportionality could be violated within water systems however the simultaneous variation in both slopes and intercepts among wtps makes the proportionality of thms and hans difficult to evaluate to test whether the assumption of proportionality results in inaccurate estimations of exposure to hans equation 2 mlm was fit with the ratio of log transformed han and thm concentrations as the outcome variable the mean of the 412 wtp log han thm ratios is 1 98 with a between wtp variance i e the systematic variance σ α 2 of 0 480 and within wtp variance i e residual variance σ e 2 of 0 249 table s4a the portion of the total variance attributable to systematic variance is computed by the intraclass correlation icc ρ equation 6 which ranges from 0 no systematic variance to 1 all variance is systematic 6 ρ σ α 2 σ α 2 σ e 2 the icc for the equation 2 mlm is 0 66 indicating that epidemiologic studies spanning multiple wtps while employing the assumption of proportionality between thms and unregulated dbps like hans may be particularly vulnerable to exposure misclassification bias the geometric mean han thm ratio for the population of wtps is 0 138 while the 412 wtp geometric mean han thm ratios range from 0 0239 to 0 795 fig 2 thus depending on wtp typical han concentrations could be anywhere between 2 4 and 80 of thm concentrations even if we exclude outliers by only considering ratios within the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles 0 0364 0 563 the median thm concentration 223 nm corresponds to mean han concentrations between 7 7 and 123 nm an interval four fold wider than the interquartile range 28 6 nm hans thus thms are not proportional to hans across icr wtps and the variance in the han thm ratio is sufficient to introduce substantial misclassification bias in epidemiologic studies that span multiple water systems considering only within wtp variance in the han thm ratio 34 of the total variance the han thm ratio ranges from 0 051 2 5th percentile to 0 374 97 5th percentile for the median thm concentration 223 nm this translates to a range of 11 3 83 6 nm hans which is 2 5 fold larger than the interquartile range of han concentrations thus there is substantial variance in the han thm ratio within many water systems and the assumption that thms are proportional to han concentrations may introduce non trivial misclassification bias in epidemiologic studies even when the assumption is employed within one water system 3 4 evaluation of the contribution of water system features to systematic variance in the han thm ratio to evaluate whether key water system features can explain the between wtp and within wtp variance observed in the han thm ratio equation 2 was adapted to include the following explanatory variables source water type season disinfectant sequence distribution system location and the interactions of source water type with season and disinfectant sequence equation 3 the variances and coefficients estimated by this model are presented in table s5 and fig s1 to evaluate the portion of variance explained by water system features we compare these variances to those estimated with the univariate model section 3 3 the between wtp variance u j 0 283 is lower than the univariate model 0 480 by 41 indicating that these water system features explain a substantial portion of the systematic variance the within wtp variance e i j 0 212 is reduced compared to the univariate model 0 249 by 15 the total variance in the han thm ratio was decomposed into the variance explained by each variable and the residual variance with anova analysis of variance the water system features and interaction terms each explain a statistically significant share of the total variance in han thm ratios table s6 the mean han thm ratio α 0 is 2 133 in log nm units exponentiating the conditional geometric mean ratio is 0 119 nm nm thus under base case conditions i e in finished effluent of wtps utilizing surface water with chlorine chlorine disinfection in summer han concentrations are 12 of thm concentrations 3 4 1 source water compared to the base case of surface water mean han thm ratios for all source water categories were significantly different p 0 05 with the exception of purchased wholesale table 2 fig 3 a relative to surface water 0 119 the mean han thm ratio for groundwater 0 315 represents a 165 mean increase in hans relative to thms in finished waters treated with chlorine chlorine disinfection in the summer on a molar basis han concentrations are 12 of thm concentrations in surface water but 32 of thm concentrations in groundwater estimated mean han thm ratios for mixed source water and groundwater under the influence of surface water represent a 73 and 53 increase over surface water respectively consistent with their intermediate status as blends of surface water and groundwater to evaluate whether these effects are primarily driven by differences in hans or thms equation 3 mlm was fit with either han or thm concentrations log nm as the outcome variable fig s2 table s7 table s8 for both hans and thms mean concentrations were lower in groundwater compared to surface water however hans were only 46 lower in groundwater 15 nm compared to surface water 28 nm while thms were 79 lower in groundwater 50 nm than surface water 237 nm on average thus the discrepancy in han thm ratios between different source water types is driven by greater differences in thms relative to hans the reasons for the different behavior of hans and thms with respect to source water categories is beyond the scope of this model and warrants further investigation 3 4 2 seasonal impacts statistically significant variation was observed in the han thm ratio across all seasons for the base case of finished water disinfected with chlorine chlorine associated with surface water table 2 fig 3b the geometric mean han thm ratio is lowest in summer 0 12 and peaks in winter 0 16 a 38 increase the interaction effects between season and source water type indicate that the han thm ratio does not seasonally vary in groundwater table 3 seasonal variation of thms in surface waters has been demonstrated accompanied by the assumption that the changes are representative of the overall dbp mixture symanski et al 2004 rodriguez et al 2004 to determine whether seasonal effects on the han thm ratio are due to changes in thms or hans equation 3 was refit with either thms or hans as the outcome variable a significant p 0 001 reduction in thms was observed in winter by 35 relative to summer for finished surface waters disinfected with chlorine chlorine table s8 while hans were only 10 lower in winter p 0 001 table s7 additional research is needed to isolate the causes responsible for the observed seasonal differences in han and thm formation 3 4 3 disinfectant sequence the choice of disinfectant sequence is dependent on the source water type quality and treatment train obolensky et al 2007 of 412 wtps 146 35 used chloramines for secondary and or primary disinfection during the study period some wtps used chlorine dioxide 21 5 1 and ozone 18 4 4 for primary disinfection the anova results show that overall the portion of the variance due to disinfectant sequence type is statistically significant yet small relative to other predictors table s6 of eight disinfectant sequences used by surface water wtps four exhibit statistically significant differences in mean han thm ratios compared to chlorine chlorine wtps for finished waters in the summer table 2 fig 3c wtps that used chlorine dioxide chloramines and ozone chloramines exhibit 28 5 and 29 2 lower han thm ratios than chlorine chlorine wtps wtps that used chlorine chloramines chloramines or chloramines only exhibit 19 3 and 22 3 higher han thm ratios respectively at groundwater wtps the effects of most disinfectant sequences were statistically indistinguishable from surface water wtps however groundwater wtps that used chlorine chloramines chloramines had a 14 lower adjusted mean han thm ratio 0 271 relative to chlorine chlorine to determine whether these effects correspond to trends in individual thm and han concentrations the model was refit with thm or han log nm concentrations as the outcome variable tables s7 and s8 for surface water wtps mean hans are 30 lower and mean thms are 20 45 lower for wtps that used four of five chloramine based disinfectant sequences chlorine chloramines chloramines chlorine dioxide chloramines and ozone chloramines compared to chlorine chlorine however mean han and thm concentrations at chlorine chloramine chloramine wtps are not significantly distinct from chlorine chlorine wtps these models compare concentrations between wtps that used chlorine chlorine and other disinfectant sequences which is distinct from comparing concentrations between different disinfectants used within the same water system wtps that used a chloramine based disinfectant sequence may not have had the same thm or han concentrations with chlorine as wtps still using chlorine at the time of icr data collection particularly as wtps with higher thms are more likely to implement chloramines 3 4 4 distribution system location the anova results show that distribution system location explains a notable share of the variance in the han thm ratio indicated by the high sum of squares table s6 under base case conditions surface water disinfected with chlorine chlorine in the summer the geometric mean han thm ratio decreased by an average of 40 between finish 0 119 and max 0 071 sampling locations and by 20 27 between finish and the three intermediate sampling locations table 2 fig 3d a decline in the han thm ratio with distance from the wtp is consistent with findings that thms tend to increase with distribution system retention time rodriguez et al 2004 while hans may peak early and decline with time due to hydrolysis yu and reckhow 2015 these trends were confirmed by fitting the model with either hans or thms as the outcome variable tables s7 and s8 under base case conditions thms increase by 35 45 between finish and intermediate sampling locations and 64 between finish and max sampling locations on average fig s3a the average change in hans is small or negligible with a 7 4 increase between finish and avg2 and no significant difference p 0 05 between finish and max fig s3b 3 4 5 practical importance for epidemiological studies to understand the implications of the effects of these four water system features on the han thm ratio consider a hypothetical epidemiologic study which uses thms as an exposure surrogate for more toxic dbps like hans this study encompasses one surface water and one groundwater system both using chlorine chlorine in the summer with mean han thm ratios corresponding to the model estimates table 2 we measure 235 nm thms in the surface water system and 89 nm thms in the groundwater system representing a 62 reduction in the exposure surrogate for the groundwater system customers however han concentrations are 28 nm for both the surface water 0 119 han thm and groundwater 0 315 han thm systems epidemiologic studies often bracket thm concentrations into tertiles or quartiles say the data distribution in our study is identical to the icr table 1 we therefore classify 89 nm in the first tertile or quartile and 235 nm in the second tertile or third quartile we also try classifying exposure with a binary contrast assigning the low reference dose to customers of the groundwater system and the high treatment dose to customers of the surface water system either way if hans are the main driver of the health outcome of interest our study would likely result in a false negative similarly consider a study within one water system disinfecting with chlorine chlorine in the summer say we measure 235 nm thms in the finished effluent or nearest customer location and 394 nm thms at the maximum residence time location we therefore classify exposure as 68 higher at the maximum residence time location but actual han concentrations are 28 nm at both locations finish 0 119 max 0 071 han thm say 235 394 nm thms represents the range of concentrations measured in the study and we classify exposure by bracketing thm concentrations into tertiles or quartiles thus we assign the nearest customer to the lowest exposure bracket and the maximum residence time customer to the highest bracket if hans are the main driver of the health outcome of interest our study would likely result in a false negative say we conduct another study in this system to consider seasonal contrasts in finished effluent we measure 235 nm thms in summer and 171 nm thms in winter representing a 38 reduction but han concentrations were 28 nm in both summer 0 119 han thm and winter 0 164 han thm if hans are the main driver of the targeted health outcome we would accurately find no effect of season on exposure risk but we would miss attribute the reason to an insufficient contrast in thm concentrations finally consider a study of surface water systems using different disinfectant sequences we measure 235 nm thms at a facility using chlorine chlorine disinfection and 193 nm thms at a facility using chloramines and therefore classify exposure as 20 lower for the chloramine facility but han concentrations were 28 nm at both the chlorine chlorine 0 119 han thm and chloramines 0 145 han thm facilities although the largest effect identified for a disinfectant sequence 29 chlorine chlorine versus ozone chloramines is smaller than the maximum effect for the other three water system features combinations of categorical effects could compound differences in the han thm ratio for example if 223 nm thms were measured in the finished effluents of a surface water facility using chlorine dioxide chlorine 0 085 han thm and a groundwater facility using chlorine chlorine 0 315 han thm the han concentrations would be 19 0 nm 40th percentile and 70 2 nm 90th percentile respectively representing a 270 increase 3 5 odds ratio bias from dbp exposure misclassification the final objective of this study is to estimate the odds ratio bias that could result from using thms as a surrogate of exposure to other dbps in epidemiologic studies with hans as an example if thms do not accurately measure exposure to hans this could result in misclassification of exposure which could in turn result in systematic biasing of odds ratio estimates table 4 presents a confusion matrix in which high thms 90th percentile concentrations are used as an indicator of high han exposure 90th percentile concentrations eighty four percent of icr records represent true negatives with low thms accurately identifying low han exposure of the high han observations only 41 were correctly classified as high exposure by the thm indicator while 59 were incorrectly classified as low han exposure false negatives conversely 59 of high thm observations correspond to low han exposure false positives this demonstrates that using high thms as an indicator of high han exposure can introduce exposure misclassification in the form of both false negatives and false positives odds ratio bias was estimated using the confusion matrix in table 4 and equation s 8 fig 4 provides the estimated mean odds ratios and 95 ci corresponding to true dbp exposure odds ratios for each distribution system location for wtps treating groundwater or surface water with chlorine during the summer the results indicate that misclassification of han exposure from the use of thms as a surrogate could lead to significant downward bias in odds ratio estimates for wtps utilizing both surface water and groundwater across each of the five sampling locations the points in the bottom panel of fig 4 show selected odds ratio estimates for dbp exposure s effects on bladder cancer hrudey et al 2015 and reproductive i e congenital anomalies nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009 prior odds ratio estimates are generally between 1 and 2 although values as high as 3 7 were found for certain subgroups at risk of bladder cancer additional details provided in text s3 and table s9 across the entire study sample our estimates indicate that an estimated odds ratio of 2 may correspond to a true odds ratio of 4 6 and will be above 4 2 in 98 of cases the variation in odds ratio bias by source water type suggests that bias is often larger in surface water wtps than groundwater wtps in finished effluent an estimated odds ratio of 2 could correspond to a real odds ratio of 3 1 5 0 95 ci in surface water compared to 2 1 2 5 95 ci in groundwater for surface water bias also increases with distance from the water treatment plant in the case of surface water sampled from the furthest max location category a measured odds ratio of just 2 could correspond to a true odds ratio of 5 3 10 1 4 conclusions using thms to measure dbp exposure implicitly assumes that thm concentrations are proportional to concentrations of more toxic dbps in the mixture and that this proportionality is robust to variables within water systems such as distribution system residence time and between water systems such as differences in source waters using hans as an example this study employed statistical models to evaluate the assumption that thms are proportional to more toxic dbp classes using a dataset of 9578 records from 412 large us water systems whether the data is pooled in a classic linear regression or hierarchically grouped by wtp in a multilevel regression thms only explain 30 of the variance in hans and are poor predictors of han concentrations the multilevel regression on the han thm ratio demonstrated that thms are not proportional to hans within or between water systems though much of the variance in the han thm ratio 66 was due to effects between water systems four water system features source water type season disinfectant sequence and distribution system location accounted for 41 of the between wtp variance in the han thm ratio source water type had the largest magnitude effect with groundwater exhibiting a 165 higher han thm ratio than surface water under base case conditions chlorine chlorine finished effluent summer han thm ratios were 38 higher during summer compared to winter in chlorinated surface water some disinfectant sequences were associated with a 20 30 change in the han thm ratio relative to chlorine chlorine disinfection in chlorinated surface water during summer han thm ratios declined by 40 between finished effluents and maximum distribution system locations in most cases changes in thm concentrations drove differences in the han thm ratio while hans were less affected by water system features a quantitative analysis of misclassification bias found that using high thm concentrations as an indicator for high han concentrations was associated with a 5 9 probability of false negatives and 5 9 probability of false positives across the study sample an estimated odds ratio of 2 constructed based on thm concentrations may correspond to a true odds ratio of 4 6 the estimated odds ratio bias is greater in surface water than in groundwater and increases with distance from the treatment plant the results demonstrate that thms are not a reliable surrogate for hans and the misclassification bias associated with the use of thms to measure overall dbp exposure may significantly reduce the ability to discern associations between dbp exposure and adverse health outcomes as the 700 known dbps account for less than half of the total organic halogen tox identifying which dbps drive adverse health effects is a significant challenge epidemiologic studies could aid this effort by targeting the analysis of more dbp classes particularly high toxicity classes such as hans through the use of existing datasets like the icr and in new sampling campaigns measuring semi volatile unregulated classes like hans should not add excessive analytical burden to sampling efforts as they can be extracted and analyzed using the same method as thms furthermore strategic data collection efforts are needed to identify whether hans or other easily measured dbp classes are effective surrogates for exposure to a wide array of dbp classes while previous survey efforts have focused on measuring unregulated dbps in multiple water systems this study demonstrates the need for better spatiotemporal resolution within water systems to evaluate the covariance of multiple classes with hydraulic residence time future dbp data collection efforts should be designed to achieve statistical significance with multilevel modeling techniques to accurately estimate variance between and within water systems for as many co occurring dbp classes as possible funding this work was supported by the national science foundation engineering research center for

19957,epidemiologists have used trihalomethanes thms as a surrogate for overall disinfection byproduct dbp exposure based on the assumption that thm concentrations are proportional to concentrations of other dbp classes toxicological evidence indicates thms are less potent toxins than unregulated classes like haloacetonitriles hans if thms are not proportional to the dbps driving toxicity the use of thms to measure exposure may introduce non trivial exposure misclassification bias in epidemiologic studies this study developed statistical models to evaluate the covariance and proportionality of han and thm concentrations in a dataset featuring over 9500 measurements from 248 public water systems thms only explain 30 of the variance in hans whether the data is pooled in a classic linear regression or hierarchically grouped by water system in a multilevel linear regression the 95 prediction interval on hans for the median thm concentration exceeds the interquartile range of hans mean han thm ratios range from 2 4 to 80 across water systems and varied with source water category season disinfectant sequence and distribution system location the han thm ratio was 265 higher in groundwater systems than in surface water systems and declined by 40 between finished effluent and maximum residence times in surface water systems with chlorine chlorine disinfection a maximum likelihood approach was used to estimate the misclassification bias that may result from using thms to construct risk ratios assuming that hans represent the true dbp exposure risk the results indicate an odds ratio of 2 estimated with thm concentrations could correspond to a true odds ratio of 4 5 these findings demonstrate the need for epidemiologic studies to evaluate exposure by measuring dbps that are likely to drive toxicity graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts drinking water epidemiology exposure assessment methods drinking water monitoring data 1 introduction epidemiologic studies have employed the four chlorinated and brominated trihalomethanes thms as a surrogate for exposure to total disinfection byproducts dbps grellier et al 2015 the significance and magnitude of the association between high thm concentrations and bladder cancer costet et al 2011 colorectal cancer rahman et al 2010 and adverse reproductive outcomes grellier et al 2010 wright et al 2017 has been inconsistent although meta analyses suggest that the most consistent association is with bladder cancer hrudey et al 2015 dbps occur in a complex mixture in disinfected drinking waters with over 700 species identified and it remains unknown which classes are toxicity drivers li and mitch 2018 richardson and kimura 2020 the toxicological evidence suggests that thms cannot explain the magnitude of risk identified for human health outcomes like bladder cancer bull et al 2012 thms were substantially less cytotoxic and genotoxic than most unregulated classes using in vitro chinese hamster ovary cho cell assays wagner and plewa 2017 when concentrations of individual dbps in drinking waters were weighted by their cho cytotoxicity lc50 values haloacetonitriles hans consistently comprised the majority of the toxic potency weighted concentrations while thms contributed very little chuang et al 2019 furst et al 2019 recent research has demonstrated that the cho cytotoxicity of defined mixtures of regulated and unregulated dbps is additive lau et al 2020 supporting the use of toxic potency weighted dbp concentrations to compare the contributions of individual dbps to cytotoxicity despite indications that thms are not the primary toxicity drivers thms continue to be used to assess dbp exposure based on the assumption that thms correlate with other dbps there are several reasons why this assumption may not be valid first differences in precursors between source waters could change the tendency to form thms vs other dbps for example while humic materials serve as thm precursors in pristine waters liang and singer 2003 wastewater and algal impacted waters feature higher dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations serving as precursors for nitrogenous dbps including hans westerhoff and mash 2002 shah and mitch 2012 second dbp classes feature distinct formation pathways differences in disinfection schemes could promote some classes over others chuang et al 2015 furst et al 2018 for example chlorine is more reactive than chloramines regarding halogen transfer to humic materials to form thms and to organic nitrogen to form hans hayes larsen et al 2010 shah and mitch 2012 however hans can also form via a separate pathway involving chloramine incorporation into aldehydes kimura et al 2013 vu et al 2019 thus switching from chlorine to chloramines may reduce thms to a greater extent than hans third thms increase with distribution system residence time as end products while other dbps occur as intermediates hua et al 2020 for example hans form as intermediates hydrolyzing to haloacetamides and haloacetic acids yu and reckhow 2015 thus intermediate dbps could reach steady state concentrations or decline while thms continue to increase previous studies of the spatiotemporal covariation of dbps in distribution systems are limited to analysis of thms with haloacetic acids e g hinckley et al 2005 evans et al 2013 and qualitative observations of thms with unregulated classes weinberg et al 2002 wei et al 2010 if thm concentrations are not reliably proportional to concentrations of toxicity drivers their use to measure dbp exposure could obscure the magnitude and significance of associations between dbps and adverse health outcomes i e exposure misclassification bias previous studies evaluating the relationship between thms and unregulated classes suffer from the following limitations 1 low sample count with few samples from many water systems furst et al 2019 krasner et al 1989 and or samples from few water systems wei et al 2010 2 analysis conducted on pooled data from multiple water systems and or time points without accounting for clustering and spatiotemporal dependencies wei et al

et al 2019 the conclusions of these studies were mixed for hans and thms krasner et al 1989 and wei et al 2010 found high correlations r2 0 9 while furst et al 2019 found a lower correlation r2 0 5 0 6 the goal of this study is to evaluate the assumption that thms are sufficient exposure surrogates for other dbp classes hans are used as a test case for two reasons 1 previous research suggests hans are more geno and cytotoxic than thms wagner and plewa 2017 2 the concentrations of both the four thms and four hans dichloroacetonitrile dcan bromochloroacetonitrile bcan dibromoacetonitrile dban and trichloroacetonitrile tcan are available in the u s environmental protection agency s information collection rule icr database usepa united states environmental protection agency 2000 the icr database encompasses 296 large us public water systems most consisting of multiple water treatment plant distribution system pairs wtps samples were collected quarterly between july 1997 and december 1998 i e up to six sampling events per wtp from the finished effluent and four distribution system locations providing over 10 000 sample records the database is extensively described in mcguire et al 2002 this study has 3 objectives 1 evaluate the assumption that thm concentrations are proportional to han concentrations between water systems as well as within individual water systems 2 examine how the han thm ratio varies with source water type season disinfectant sequence and distribution system residence time 3 estimate the odds ratio bias that may be incurred through misclassifying han exposure with thms as a surrogate and evaluate the implications for detecting associations between dbps and adverse health outcomes the results have important implications for the use of thm concentrations as an exposure surrogate for other dbp classes in epidemiologic studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 data preparation the icr aux1 database was retrieved from the epa data repository usepa united states environmental protection agency 2000 details regarding the initial processing and are provided in text s1 sample records missing values for any thm or han species were excluded in many records concentrations of certain species were left censored i e below the method reporting limits mrl of 1 0 μg l for each thm and 0 5 μg l for each han seven wtps with only left censored data for all species were excluded remaining left censored concentrations were replaced by half of the mrl for a record with left censored concentrations for all four hans or thms the cumulative replacement value was 1 0 μg l or 2 0 μg l respectively the replacement values for left censored concentrations could affect the outcome of models francis et al 2009 a sensitivity analysis was conducted by replacing left censored concentrations with the full mrl value and repeating key analyses the conclusions were unchanged text s2 the final fraction of left censored records was 15 4 for hans and 7 6 for thms

less than 1 of records were affected the secondary residual disinfectant field was empty for 1 2 of records n 115 these were filled with chlorine or chloramines following evaluation of 1 other records for that wtp 2 relative concentrations of free and total chlorine and 3 utility process information lastly records from one of five quarters for one wtp were excluded due to unrealistic tcan concentrations 40 μg l at all sampling locations all tcan concentrations were below the mrl for the other four quarters with no observable change in water quality or treatment the final dataset consisted of 9587 records from 412 wtps representing 248 public water systems 2 2 selection of water system features included in the final models we evaluated the impact of four categorical variables

chloramines primary and residual disinfectants were concatenated to create the disinfectant sequence variable table s1a 2 3 multilevel model development prior statistical evaluations of the icr database were developed by pooling measurements from multiple wtps with the assumption that data were generated by independent random sampling e g obolensky et al 2008 francis et al 2009 however the icr data is hierarchically grouped by wtp model errors are correlated for measurements within each wtp such that pooling the data produces overconfidence in model estimates in this study multilevel hierarchical regression models mlms were used to accommodate the hierarchical data structure and to estimate the variance between and within groups the mlms developed have a 2 level hierarchical structure with level 1 units 9578 sample records nested within level 2 groups 412 wtps the 412 wtps have a median of 25 records 25th percentile of 20 75th percentile of 29 range 3 30 in this study the classic and multilevel regression models were designated in two ways for objective 1 we first regress han concentrations on thm concentrations i e h a n s β t h m s α to estimate the variance in han concentrations explained by thms for the remainder of objective 1 and for objective 2 we use the ratio of han to thm concentrations as the outcome variable i e h a n s t h m s α to directly evaluate whether han and thm concentrations are proportional i e maintain a constant ratio the variance estimates for the multilevel model fit to the han thm ratio are more robust to left censoring than the equivalent bivariate multilevel model regressing hans against thms supplemental text s2 regression coefficients for mlms can either vary by group or are fixed for the population of groups equations 1 1 and 1 2 comprise the bivariate mlm used to evaluate the variance in han concentrations explained by thms equation 1 1 describes level 1 where outcome variable y i j is the han concentration log nm in sample i from wtp j explanatory variable x i j is the thm concentration log nm in sample i from wtp j coefficient β j is the slope for wtp j coefficient α j is the intercept and e i j is the residual error of sample i in wtp j equation 1 2 describes level 2 of the model in which coefficients α j and β j consist of a fixed population parameter fit to all wtps in the dataset α 0 and β 0 respectively and parameters that are fit to each wtp j u j and v j respectively u j and v j were assumed to be uncorrelated because the han and thm concentrations are log normally distributed they were log transformed prior to modeling for precision in the variance estimates 1 1 l e v e l 1 y i j α j β j x i j e i j 1 2 l e v e l 2 α j α 0 u j β j β 0 v j equations 2 1 and 2 2 describe the univariate model i e a model with no explanatory variables with the intercept allowed to vary by wtp to model the variance in the han thm ratio between and within wtps equation 2 1 describes level 1 of the model in which outcome variable y i j is defined as l o g h a n n m t h m n m in sample i from wtp j coefficient α j is the intercept and e i j is the residual error of sample i in wtp j level

j 2 4 estimating odds ratio bias we used logistic regression to estimate the potential odds ratio bias that may be incurred from misclassifying exposure with thms as a proxy for more toxic dbps with hans as an illustrative example epidemiologic studies often designate a threshold thm concentration as a binary indicator of low or high dbp exposure for each icr record the proxy exposure variable was set to one for thm concentrations above 543 nm the 90th percentile icr concentration and zero otherwise the true exposure was set to one for han concentrations above the 90th percentile concentration 62 4 nm and zero otherwise the probability of a given health outcome y p y as a function of the binary thm exposure surrogate z is given by 4 1 p y exp α λ z j γ j w j 1 exp α λ z j γ j w j where λ estimates the odds ratios for y with exposure surrogate z and w j is a set of covariates i e source water and distribution system location for the true dbp exposure x and the unbiased odds ratio estimate λ 4 2 p y exp α λ x j γ j w j 1 exp α λ x j γ j w j using equations 4 1 and 4 2 we fit the relationship between exposure proxy z and true exposure x to estimate the true odds ratio λ values corresponding to odds ratio estimates λ determined in epidemiologic studies that used thm as the exposure indicator a maximum likelihood approach was used to estimate the true odds ratios λ this required several assumptions 1 that hans not thms affect health outcomes 2 that the prevalence of congenital anomalies and bladder cancer in the general population is low and 3 that exposure misclassification is unrelated to the likelihood of a health outcome or to covariates w j i e it is non differential further details regarding the methods and assumptions are provided in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 thms as a simple linear predictor of han concentrations by using thms as a surrogate for overall dbp exposure epidemiologic studies implicitly assume that thms are proportional to more toxic dbps such as hans for studies within single water systems this assumption requires that thms are highly correlated with hans and the intercept i e the han concentration projected for a thm concentration of zero is small such that the han thm ratio does not vary substantially with thm concentration for studies that pool data from two or more water systems this assumption further requires a low variance in slopes and intercepts between water systems such that thm concentrations are consistently representative of han concentrations if these conditions are not met the use of thms as a surrogate may cause exposure misclassification resulting in odds ratio bias fig 1 shows the ordinary least squares ols linear regression of hans on thms where data from 9587 records is pooled without accounting for hierarchical clustering by wtp the correlation coefficients r2 on a weight 0 31 and molar basis 0 29 indicate that thms account for only 30 of total variation in hans substantially lower than the 0 9 r2 values reported for smaller datasets krasner et al 1989 wei et al 2010 for this pooled regression the error in the predicted han concentration for a given thm concentration e r r o r p r e d is calculated by equation 5 where σ ˆ is the standard deviation of the residuals x 0 is a measured thm concentration and v a r β ˆ is the variance of the slope estimate 5 e r r o r p r e d σ ˆ 2 x 0 2 v a r β ˆ v a r β ˆ σ ˆ 2 i 1 n x i x 2 for the median thm concentration of 31 4 μg l 223 nm table 1 the predicted han concentration is 3 89 μg l 28 5 nm with a 95 confidence interval of 0 μg l to 9 5 μg l 0 nm 76 nm for perspective this interval is 2 6 times the interquartile range of han concentrations 3 8 μg l 29 nm indicating that thms are an imprecise predictor of hans across multiple water systems the fan shape evident in fig 1 suggests that the prediction errors increase with increasing thm concentrations i e the model errors are heteroscedastic which was confirmed by a breusch pagan test for heteroskedasticity significant at the 0 1 level breusch and pagan 1979 heteroscedasticity is often a feature of hierarchically grouped data where each group has a distinct line of best fit as would be the case if the han thm relationship varies systematically between water systems 3 2 variance in the linear relationship of thm and han concentrations between water systems to evaluate the variance between and within the 412 wtps equation 1 mlm was fit to the icr dataset with hans log nm as the outcome and thms log nm as an explanatory variable to obtain intercept α and slope β for each wtp the total variance in the regression is decomposed into two components the level 2 variances i e the systematic variance between the 412 wtp intercepts σ α 2 0 087 and slopes σ β 2 0 008 and the level 1 residual variance within wtps σ e 2 0 128 table s2a the proportion of variance in hans explained by thms r2 0 322 can be calculated by comparing the total variances in this model with and without thms as an explanatory variable table s3 thus even after considering clustering by wtps thms only explain 32 of the total variance in hans across 412 wtps the intercepts α j mean 1 33 0 295 standard deviation sd and slopes β j mean 0 349 0 088 sd obtained from modeling the log transformed han and thm concentrations exhibited substantial variability table s2a the slopes represent the percent increase in han concentration for each 1 increase in thm concentration 95 of the wtp slopes fall between 0 206 and 0 479 thus for a 1 increase in thms the mean increase in hans is between 0 21 and 0 48 for most wtps to isolate the potential implication of this variability in slopes we translate to han concentrations with the equation h a n s e α t h m s β for the mean intercept e 1 33 3 78 nm hans and median thm concentration 223 nm the mean han concentration is between 11 5 and 50 7 nm for 95 of wtps this interval spans the 20th and 85th percentile han concentrations and easily exceeds the interquartile range 28 6 nm therefore the high variability in slopes relating han and thm concentrations between water systems has practical implications for the use of thms as an exposure surrogate for hans the relative standard deviation of the intercepts 0 221 is almost as great as for the slopes 0 252 indicating that variation in baseline han concentrations between wtps may be substantial enough to violate the assumption of proportionality between thms and hans 3 3 evaluation of the assumption of proportionality of hans and thms between and within wtps the use of thms as a proxy for total dbp exposure assumes that concentrations of thms and other dbps are proportional i e that they maintain a constant ratio as concentrations increase or decrease section 3 2 demonstrated that for many wtps the intercepts representing baseline han concentrations unassociated with thm formation can be substantial which suggests that the assumption of proportionality could be violated within water systems however the simultaneous variation in both slopes and intercepts among wtps makes the proportionality of thms and hans difficult to evaluate to test whether the assumption of proportionality results in inaccurate estimations of exposure to hans equation 2 mlm was fit with the ratio of log transformed han and thm concentrations as the outcome variable the mean of the 412 wtp log han thm ratios is 1 98 with a between wtp variance i e the systematic variance σ α 2 of 0 480 and within wtp variance i e residual variance σ e 2 of 0 249 table s4a the portion of the total variance attributable to systematic variance is computed by the intraclass correlation icc ρ equation 6 which ranges from 0 no systematic variance to 1 all variance is systematic 6 ρ σ α 2 σ α 2 σ e 2 the icc for the equation 2 mlm is 0 66 indicating that epidemiologic studies spanning multiple wtps while employing the assumption of proportionality between thms and unregulated dbps like hans may be particularly vulnerable to exposure misclassification bias the geometric mean han thm ratio for the population of wtps is 0 138 while the 412 wtp geometric mean han thm ratios range from 0 0239 to 0 795 fig 2 thus depending on wtp typical han concentrations could be anywhere between 2 4 and 80 of thm concentrations even if we exclude outliers by only considering ratios within the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles 0 0364 0 563 the median thm concentration 223 nm corresponds to mean han concentrations between 7 7 and 123 nm an interval four fold wider than the interquartile range 28 6 nm hans thus thms are not proportional to hans across icr wtps and the variance in the han thm ratio is sufficient to introduce substantial misclassification bias in epidemiologic studies that span multiple water systems considering only within wtp variance in the han thm ratio 34 of the total variance the han thm ratio ranges from 0 051 2 5th percentile to 0 374 97 5th percentile for the median thm concentration 223 nm this translates to a range of 11 3 83 6 nm hans which is 2 5 fold larger than the interquartile range of han concentrations thus there is substantial variance in the han thm ratio within many water systems and the assumption that thms are proportional to han concentrations may introduce non trivial misclassification bias in epidemiologic studies even when the assumption is employed within one water system 3 4 evaluation of the contribution of water system features to systematic variance in the han thm ratio to evaluate whether key water system features can explain the between wtp and within wtp variance observed in the han thm ratio equation 2 was adapted to include the following explanatory variables source water type season disinfectant sequence distribution system location and the interactions of source water type with season and disinfectant sequence equation 3 the variances and coefficients estimated by this model are presented in table s5 and fig s1 to evaluate the portion of variance explained by water system features we compare these variances to those estimated with the univariate model section 3 3 the between wtp variance u j 0 283 is lower than the univariate model 0 480 by 41 indicating that these water system features explain a substantial portion of the systematic variance the within wtp variance e i j 0 212 is reduced compared to the univariate model 0 249 by 15 the total variance in the han thm ratio was decomposed into the variance explained by each variable and the residual variance with anova analysis of variance the water system features and interaction terms each explain a statistically significant share of the total variance in han thm ratios table s6 the mean han thm ratio α 0 is 2 133 in log nm units exponentiating the conditional geometric mean ratio is 0 119 nm nm thus under base case conditions i e in finished effluent of wtps utilizing surface water with chlorine chlorine disinfection in summer han concentrations are 12 of thm concentrations 3 4 1 source water compared to the base case of surface water mean han thm ratios for all source water categories were significantly different p 0 05 with the exception of purchased wholesale table 2 fig 3 a relative to surface water 0 119 the mean han thm ratio for groundwater 0 315 represents a 165 mean increase in hans relative to thms in finished waters treated with chlorine chlorine disinfection in the summer on a molar basis han concentrations are 12 of thm concentrations in surface water but 32 of thm concentrations in groundwater estimated mean han thm ratios for mixed source water and groundwater under the influence of surface water represent a 73 and 53 increase over surface water respectively consistent with their intermediate status as blends of surface water and groundwater to evaluate whether these effects are primarily driven by differences in hans or thms equation 3 mlm was fit with either han or thm concentrations log nm as the outcome variable fig s2 table s7 table s8 for both hans and thms mean concentrations were lower in groundwater compared to surface water however hans were only 46 lower in groundwater 15 nm compared to surface water 28 nm while thms were 79 lower in groundwater 50 nm than surface water 237 nm on average thus the discrepancy in han thm ratios between different source water types is driven by greater differences in thms relative to hans the reasons for the different behavior of hans and thms with respect to source water categories is beyond the scope of this model and warrants further investigation 3 4 2 seasonal impacts statistically significant variation was observed in the han thm ratio across all seasons for the base case of finished water disinfected with chlorine chlorine associated with surface water table 2 fig 3b the geometric mean han thm ratio is lowest in summer 0 12 and peaks in winter 0 16 a 38 increase the interaction effects between season and source water type indicate that the han thm ratio does not seasonally vary in groundwater table 3 seasonal variation of thms in surface waters has been demonstrated accompanied by the assumption that the changes are representative of the overall dbp mixture symanski et al 2004 rodriguez et al 2004 to determine whether seasonal effects on the han thm ratio are due to changes in thms or hans equation 3 was refit with either thms or hans as the outcome variable a significant p 0 001 reduction in thms was observed in winter by 35 relative to summer for finished surface waters disinfected with chlorine chlorine table s8 while hans were only 10 lower in winter p 0 001 table s7 additional research is needed to isolate the causes responsible for the observed seasonal differences in han and thm formation 3 4 3 disinfectant sequence the choice of disinfectant sequence is dependent on the source water type quality and treatment train obolensky et al 2007 of 412 wtps 146 35 used chloramines for secondary and or primary disinfection during the study period some wtps used chlorine dioxide 21 5 1 and ozone 18 4 4 for primary disinfection the anova results show that overall the portion of the variance due to disinfectant sequence type is statistically significant yet small relative to other predictors table s6 of eight disinfectant sequences used by surface water wtps four exhibit statistically significant differences in mean han thm ratios compared to chlorine chlorine wtps for finished waters in the summer table 2 fig 3c wtps that used chlorine dioxide chloramines and ozone chloramines exhibit 28 5 and 29 2 lower han thm ratios than chlorine chlorine wtps wtps that used chlorine chloramines chloramines or chloramines only exhibit 19 3 and 22 3 higher han thm ratios respectively at groundwater wtps the effects of most disinfectant sequences were statistically indistinguishable from surface water wtps however groundwater wtps that used chlorine chloramines chloramines had a 14 lower adjusted mean han thm ratio 0 271 relative to chlorine chlorine to determine whether these effects correspond to trends in individual thm and han concentrations the model was refit with thm or han log nm concentrations as the outcome variable tables s7 and s8 for surface water wtps mean hans are 30 lower and mean thms are 20 45 lower for wtps that used four of five chloramine based disinfectant sequences chlorine chloramines chloramines chlorine dioxide chloramines and ozone chloramines compared to chlorine chlorine however mean han and thm concentrations at chlorine chloramine chloramine wtps are not significantly distinct from chlorine chlorine wtps these models compare concentrations between wtps that used chlorine chlorine and other disinfectant sequences which is distinct from comparing concentrations between different disinfectants used within the same water system wtps that used a chloramine based disinfectant sequence may not have had the same thm or han concentrations with chlorine as wtps still using chlorine at the time of icr data collection particularly as wtps with higher thms are more likely to implement chloramines 3 4 4 distribution system location the anova results show that distribution system location explains a notable share of the variance in the han thm ratio indicated by the high sum of squares table s6 under base case conditions surface water disinfected with chlorine chlorine in the summer the geometric mean han thm ratio decreased by an average of 40 between finish 0 119 and max 0 071 sampling locations and by 20 27 between finish and the three intermediate sampling locations table 2 fig 3d a decline in the han thm ratio with distance from the wtp is consistent with findings that thms tend to increase with distribution system retention time rodriguez et al 2004 while hans may peak early and decline with time due to hydrolysis yu and reckhow 2015 these trends were confirmed by fitting the model with either hans or thms as the outcome variable tables s7 and s8 under base case conditions thms increase by 35 45 between finish and intermediate sampling locations and 64 between finish and max sampling locations on average fig s3a the average change in hans is small or negligible with a 7 4 increase between finish and avg2 and no significant difference p 0 05 between finish and max fig s3b 3 4 5 practical importance for epidemiological studies to understand the implications of the effects of these four water system features on the han thm ratio consider a hypothetical epidemiologic study which uses thms as an exposure surrogate for more toxic dbps like hans this study encompasses one surface water and one groundwater system both using chlorine chlorine in the summer with mean han thm ratios corresponding to the model estimates table 2 we measure 235 nm thms in the surface water system and 89 nm thms in the groundwater system representing a 62 reduction in the exposure surrogate for the groundwater system customers however han concentrations are 28 nm for both the surface water 0 119 han thm and groundwater 0 315 han thm systems epidemiologic studies often bracket thm concentrations into tertiles or quartiles say the data distribution in our study is identical to the icr table 1 we therefore classify 89 nm in the first tertile or quartile and 235 nm in the second tertile or third quartile we also try classifying exposure with a binary contrast assigning the low reference dose to customers of the groundwater system and the high treatment dose to customers of the surface water system either way if hans are the main driver of the health outcome of interest our study would likely result in a false negative similarly consider a study within one water system disinfecting with chlorine chlorine in the summer say we measure 235 nm thms in the finished effluent or nearest customer location and 394 nm thms at the maximum residence time location we therefore classify exposure as 68 higher at the maximum residence time location but actual han concentrations are 28 nm at both locations finish 0 119 max 0 071 han thm say 235 394 nm thms represents the range of concentrations measured in the study and we classify exposure by bracketing thm concentrations into tertiles or quartiles thus we assign the nearest customer to the lowest exposure bracket and the maximum residence time customer to the highest bracket if hans are the main driver of the health outcome of interest our study would likely result in a false negative say we conduct another study in this system to consider seasonal contrasts in finished effluent we measure 235 nm thms in summer and 171 nm thms in winter representing a 38 reduction but han concentrations were 28 nm in both summer 0 119 han thm and winter 0 164 han thm if hans are the main driver of the targeted health outcome we would accurately find no effect of season on exposure risk but we would miss attribute the reason to an insufficient contrast in thm concentrations finally consider a study of surface water systems using different disinfectant sequences we measure 235 nm thms at a facility using chlorine chlorine disinfection and 193 nm thms at a facility using chloramines and therefore classify exposure as 20 lower for the chloramine facility but han concentrations were 28 nm at both the chlorine chlorine 0 119 han thm and chloramines 0 145 han thm facilities although the largest effect identified for a disinfectant sequence 29 chlorine chlorine versus ozone chloramines is smaller than the maximum effect for the other three water system features combinations of categorical effects could compound differences in the han thm ratio for example if 223 nm thms were measured in the finished effluents of a surface water facility using chlorine dioxide chlorine 0 085 han thm and a groundwater facility using chlorine chlorine 0 315 han thm the han concentrations would be 19 0 nm 40th percentile and 70 2 nm 90th percentile respectively representing a 270 increase 3 5 odds ratio bias from dbp exposure misclassification the final objective of this study is to estimate the odds ratio bias that could result from using thms as a surrogate of exposure to other dbps in epidemiologic studies with hans as an example if thms do not accurately measure exposure to hans this could result in misclassification of exposure which could in turn result in systematic biasing of odds ratio estimates table 4 presents a confusion matrix in which high thms 90th percentile concentrations are used as an indicator of high han exposure 90th percentile concentrations eighty four percent of icr records represent true negatives with low thms accurately identifying low han exposure of the high han observations only 41 were correctly classified as high exposure by the thm indicator while 59 were incorrectly classified as low han exposure false negatives conversely 59 of high thm observations correspond to low han exposure false positives this demonstrates that using high thms as an indicator of high han exposure can introduce exposure misclassification in the form of both false negatives and false positives odds ratio bias was estimated using the confusion matrix in table 4 and equation s 8 fig 4 provides the estimated mean odds ratios and 95 ci corresponding to true dbp exposure odds ratios for each distribution system location for wtps treating groundwater or surface water with chlorine during the summer the results indicate that misclassification of han exposure from the use of thms as a surrogate could lead to significant downward bias in odds ratio estimates for wtps utilizing both surface water and groundwater across each of the five sampling locations the points in the bottom panel of fig 4 show selected odds ratio estimates for dbp exposure s effects on bladder cancer hrudey et al 2015 and reproductive i e congenital anomalies nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009 prior odds ratio estimates are generally between 1 and 2 although values as high as 3 7 were found for certain subgroups at risk of bladder cancer additional details provided in text s3 and table s9 across the entire study sample our estimates indicate that an estimated odds ratio of 2 may correspond to a true odds ratio of 4 6 and will be above 4 2 in 98 of cases the variation in odds ratio bias by source water type suggests that bias is often larger in surface water wtps than groundwater wtps in finished effluent an estimated odds ratio of 2 could correspond to a real odds ratio of 3 1 5 0 95 ci in surface water compared to 2 1 2 5 95 ci in groundwater for surface water bias also increases with distance from the water treatment plant in the case of surface water sampled from the furthest max location category a measured odds ratio of just 2 could correspond to a true odds ratio of 5 3 10 1 4 conclusions using thms to measure dbp exposure implicitly assumes that thm concentrations are proportional to concentrations of more toxic dbps in the mixture and that this proportionality is robust to variables within water systems such as distribution system residence time and between water systems such as differences in source waters using hans as an example this study employed statistical models to evaluate the assumption that thms are proportional to more toxic dbp classes using a dataset of 9578 records from 412 large us water systems whether the data is pooled in a classic linear regression or hierarchically grouped by wtp in a multilevel regression thms only explain 30 of the variance in hans and are poor predictors of han concentrations the multilevel regression on the han thm ratio demonstrated that thms are not proportional to hans within or between water systems though much of the variance in the han thm ratio 66 was due to effects between water systems four water system features source water type season disinfectant sequence and distribution system location accounted for 41 of the between wtp variance in the han thm ratio source water type had the largest magnitude effect with groundwater exhibiting a 165 higher han thm ratio than surface water under base case conditions chlorine chlorine finished effluent summer han thm ratios were 38 higher during summer compared to winter in chlorinated surface water some disinfectant sequences were associated with a 20 30 change in the han thm ratio relative to chlorine chlorine disinfection in chlorinated surface water during summer han thm ratios declined by 40 between finished effluents and maximum distribution system locations in most cases changes in thm concentrations drove differences in the han thm ratio while hans were less affected by water system features a quantitative analysis of misclassification bias found that using high thm concentrations as an indicator for high han concentrations was associated with a 5 9 probability of false negatives and 5 9 probability of false positives across the study sample an estimated odds ratio of 2 constructed based on thm concentrations may correspond to a true odds ratio of 4 6 the estimated odds ratio bias is greater in surface water than in groundwater and increases with distance from the treatment plant the results demonstrate that thms are not a reliable surrogate for hans and the misclassification bias associated with the use of thms to measure overall dbp exposure may significantly reduce the ability to discern associations between dbp exposure and adverse health outcomes as the 700 known dbps account for less than half of the total organic halogen tox identifying which dbps drive adverse health effects is a significant challenge epidemiologic studies could aid this effort by targeting the analysis of more dbp classes particularly high toxicity classes such as hans through the use of existing datasets like the icr and in new sampling campaigns measuring semi volatile unregulated classes like hans should not add excessive analytical burden to sampling efforts as they can be extracted and analyzed using the same method as thms furthermore strategic data collection efforts are needed to identify whether hans or other easily measured dbp classes are effective surrogates for exposure to a wide array of dbp classes while previous survey efforts have focused on measuring unregulated dbps in multiple water systems this study demonstrates the need for better spatiotemporal resolution within water systems to evaluate the covariance of multiple classes with hydraulic residence time future dbp data collection efforts should be designed to achieve statistical significance with multilevel modeling techniques to accurately estimate variance between and within water systems for as many co occurring dbp classes as possible funding this work was supported by the national science foundation engineering research center for

19958,the vast number of chemicals potentially reaching aquatic environment pose a challenge in maintaining the quality of water resources however best management practices to improve water quality are typically focused on reducing nutrient transport without assessing how these practices may impact the occurrence of micropollutants the potential for co management of nutrients and organic micropollutants exists but few studies have comprehensively evaluated the suite of contaminants associated with different water quality management practices riparian zone restoration stormwater management etc furthermore most studies dealing with the determination of micropollutants in environmental samples include only a limited number of target analytes leaving many contaminants undetected to address this limitation there has been a gradual shift in environmental monitoring from using target analysis to either suspect screening analysis ssa or non targeted analysis nta which relies on accurate mass measurements mass spectral fragmentation patterns and retention time information obtained using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry the work presented in this paper focuses on a wide scope detection of micropollutants in surface water samples from the potomac river watershed united states an in house database composed of 1039 compounds based on experimental analysis of primary standards was established and ssa workflow was optimized and applied to determine the presence of micropollutants in surface water a total of 103 micropollutants were detected in the samples some of which are contaminants that were not previously monitored and belong to various classes such as pharmaceuticals personal care products per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and other persistent industrial chemicals the impact of best management practices being implemented for nitrogen and phosphorus reductions were also assessed for their potential to reduce micropollutant transport this work illustrates the advantages of suspect screening methods to determine a large number of micropollutants in environmental samples and reveals the potential to co manage a diverse array of micropollutants based on shared transport and transformation mechanisms in watersheds keywords high resolution mass spectrometry hrms best management practices bmps emerging contaminants per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass antibiotics endocrine disrupting chemicals 1 introduction freshwater ecosystems are of vital importance to human existence but can be subjected to a range of anthropogenic pressures resulting to water resources degradation there are several routes in which a wide array of micropollutants reach the aquatic environment this include point sources such as outfalls from waste water treatment plants wwtps singhal and perez garcia 2016 margot et al 2015 and industrial discharges lapworth et al 2012 murakami et al 2009 along with non point sources such as agricultural runoff evans et al 2019 urban stormwater runoff murakami et al 2009 and others to reduce loading of these pollutants into surface water several strategies have been implemented such as upgrade of wwtps and implementation of nonpoint source best management practices bmps while these strategies are mostly focused on nutrient reduction several studies have also demonstrated the capability of these practices to reduce micropollutant transport for example advanced oxidation processes in wwtps such as ozonation can efficiently remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps margot et al 2015 angeles et al 2020 agricultural bmps like buffer strips riparian zones and constructed wetlands can also reduce transport of pesticides and their metabolites in watersheds significantly talib and randhir 2016 the potomac river watershed is the second largest subwatershed of the chesapeake bay in terms of water quantity belval and sprague 1999 and the fourth largest river on the eastern coast of the united states in year 2000 the chesapeake bay was listed as an impaired water body under the clean water act due to the degradation of water quality and decline in ecological health of the bay and its tributaries langland et al 2004 in this regard ambient water quality criteria was developed to reduce nutrient and sediment based pollution entering the bay usepa 2003 implementation of strategies to decrease point source nutrient loading resulted to a recovery from eutrophication and a shift of the tidal embayment from phytoplankton submerged to submerged aquatic vegetation was observed de mutsert et al 2017 jones 2020 the continuous increase in the use of chemicals in consumer products which eventually end up being discharged into surface waters delivers challenges to regulatory agencies in their efforts to implement and update water quality criteria decisions on which chemicals need to be regulated is highly dependent on their occurrence in the environment usepa hence dealing with toxic emerging contaminants which have not been previously included in monitoring programs is difficult if environmental monitoring programs will continuously rely on target analysis approach many contaminants will remain unnoticed to address this challenge a shift from pure target analysis to either suspect screening analysis ssa or non targeted analysis nta schymanski et al 2015 is becoming more and more common in environmental studies both ssa and nta approaches take advantage of the accurate mass measurements afforded by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms in ssa and nta the exact mass and isotope patterns of the molecule together with the molecule s characteristic fragmentation patterns are compared to a database or spectral resources of chemical suspects to identify potential matches andra et al 2017 ssa is performed when prior information indicates that a given structure may be present in the sample screening for suspect compounds are searched within a mass of interest typically included in a suspect list on the other hand nta aims at identifying compounds without searching for certain masses substances up front thus a full non target identification starting from the exact mass isotope adduct and fragmentation information is performed schymanski et al 2015 recently ssa approach was successfully used in the identification of 23 new potentially hazardous substances from the effluents collected in three major wwtps in sweden gago ferrero et al 2018 in the detection of 27 active pharmaceutical ingredients from wwtps effluents in switzerland singer et al 2016 in the identification of 13 pesticide transformation products in groundwater samples kiefer et al 2019 and in the prioritization of more than 5200 anthropogenic chemicals authorized in european market sjerps et al 2016 our group also applied retrospective ssa on previously analyzed samples and discovered high frequency of occurrence of antifungal compounds and amoxicillin metabolites in surface waters angeles et al 2020 currently a more holistic watershed approaches chan et al 2018 wang et al 2016 have been developed for large scale pollutant management in surface waters combining smart watershed approaches with advances in analytical testing capabilities e g nta ssa approach can provide sound evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures co management of multiple pollutants regulation of chemicals and sustainable water management hollender et al 2019 while ssa analysis offers increased chemical coverage and serendipitous discovery creating a meaningful ssa workflow and reproducible results among scientists is a daunting task hites and jobst 2018 to bridge this gap we took advantage of the experience of our laboratory in the analysis of various classes of contaminants in several environmental matrices to 1 build an in house tracefinder database that is traceable to primary standards 2 optimize ssa workflow by comparing the detection coverage of our previously validated lc methods 3 apply the optimized workflow to determine the presence of micropollutants in potomac watershed that were not part of prior targeted analysis and 4 assess the efficiency of bmps already in place in reducing transport of micropollutants 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals primary standards of the compounds used in

the format of the database was adopted from the work of wong et al 2018 that contained 603 pesticides and their metabolites an additional of 500 compounds other pesticides hormones pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass and other industrial chemicals were added into the database suspect screening was performed using trace finder version 4 1 thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma and the sensitivity of the workflow was assessed by comparing tolerance for precursor mass error 5 vs 10 ppm parts per million retention time window of 30s vs 60s presence of at least two fragment ions confirmed within 10 20 or 30 ppm mass error and an isotopic pattern match of at least 80 fit it was found that the optimized identification and confirmation settings for the suspect screening workflow is set at precursor ion within 5 ppm error presence of two fragment ions within 20 ppm error retention time match within 1 min and an isotopic pattern of 90 fit using these optimized parameters we were able to obtain a true positive of 94 using low ph method and 97 using the high ph method with zero false positive detailed information of the developed in house database is summarized in table s1 2 4 sample collection preparation and lc hrms analysis water samples were collected from october 2017 to june 2018 along potomac watershed in maryland usa from paired streams in very similar geographic watersheds for a comparable rainfall patterns and from blue plains wwtp fig 1 the paired agricultural streams with and without bmps are located in ben s branch of the lake linganore watershed in frederick county maryland the restored stream is a small headwater tributary surrounded by the hunting lotte farm a 450 acre crop and livestock farm with about 150 head of black angus cattle on about 80 acres of pasture prior to bmp installation the stream s riparian zone was part of a cattle pasture that provided the livestock with unrestricted access to the stream the bmps included more than 8800 feet of fencing three spring developments to replace in stream cattle watering improvements to areas heavily used by livestock including two stream crossings as well as plantings of over 9 acres of cool season grasses shanks and soehl 2008 the unrestored stream is a nearby small unnamed headwater tributary with similar land use and geomorphology the paired urban streams with and without bmps paint branch vs brier ditch are located in the anacostia watershed of maryland montgomery and prince georgy s county fig 1 both watersheds are dominated by urban land use but only paint branch was restored with urban bmps in 1995 the montgomery county council designated the upper paint branch watershed as a special protected area under a county law that provides additional protections to designated sensitive areas the maryland national parks and planning commission purchased undeveloped land along the stream to maintain shaded habitat and leaf litter inputs and implemented regulations that limited impervious area to 10 of all new development in the watershed the brier ditch watershed has not implemented bmp s and is of the most densely populated regions of the area with the fewest stormwater management controls only 13 of the stream has adequate riparian forest buffer compared to paint branch s 53 on the other hand the blue plains wwtp is the largest treatment plant in the potomac river watershed and the largest treatment facility of its kind in the usa with a rated capacity of 384 million gallons per day mgd it serves over two million customers with a collection area of washington dc and surrounding suburbs of maryland and virginia the treatment process utilizes preliminary and primary treatment secondary treatment nitrification denitrification effluent filtration chlorination dechlorination and post aeration blue plains 2020 in the last several years the plant has dramatically upgraded and improved its liquid processing systems surface water collection and sample preparation were described in details elsewhere he and aga 2019 samples and field blanks were collected from specified sampling locations fig 1 at five different sampling times oct 2017 dec 2017 feb 2018 apr 2018 jun 2018 a 500 ml water sample was collected in glass amber bottles pre rinsed with 10 nitric acid and ph was adjusted to 2 5 0 5 to reduce bacterial degradation samples were then filtered using a 0 45 mm glass fiber filter and spiked with 100 μl of 250 mg l 1 surrogate mixture solution containing e1 3s d4 e2 3s d4 e2 3g d3 e1 d4 e2 d3 ee2 d4 imidazolidine d4 prometon d14 metolachlor d6 atrazine d5 acetochlor d11 4 n nonylphenol d4 diazine d10 and dinotefuran d3 analytes of interest were extracted and pre concentrated using solid phase extraction spe with oasis hlb cartridge pre conditioned with 10 ml of methanol followed by 10 ml of nanopure water samples were loaded onto the cartridge at a flow rate of 3 5 ml min 1 cartridges were then completely dried under vacuum conditions at about 15 psi elution was done using 10 ml ethyl acetate eluate 1 and another 10 ml methanol with 2 ammonium hydroxide eluate 2 collected separately eluates 1 and 2 were slowly evaporated to 500 μl under a stream of nitrogen at 30 c and 300 μl aliquots of eluate 1 and eluate 2 were combined in graduated tubes evaporated until 200 μl and then brought up to a final volume of 600 μl with water acetonitrile 95 5 v v solution the solution was centrifuged and the supernatant was collected for lc ms analysis 2 5 target and suspect screening analysis samples were analyzed for 37 endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs using a triple quadrupole lc ms target analysis discussed in details in our previous work he and aga 2019 lc ms parameters lod and recovery for target analysis is summarized in table s2 accurate quantification was performed using isotope dilution technique to account for any matrix effects and correct for losses during sample preparation and transport he and aga 2019 for ssa the same set of samples were analyzed using lc hrms wherein esi data acquisition utilized the low ph method and esi data acquisition utilized the high ph method suspect screening was performed using the developed in house database for tracefinder software wherein the optimized criteria for positive detection precursor ion within 5 ppm error presence of two fragment ions within 20 ppm error retention time match 1 min and an isotopic pattern of 90 fit were used as discussed in section 2 3 blank subtraction was incorporated in the software settings for integration for compounds that were also detected in the blanks only those that have an area in the samples of at least five times higher than the average area of the blanks were considered finally manual checking of peak shape i e gaussian and not very broad 1 min for each confirmed compound was also performed for micropollutants detected in the samples using ssa retrospective semi quantitative analysis was done by analyzing a mix of standards at 100 μg l 1 concentration and using the areas from this standard mix to estimate the concentrations of the micropollutants based on a one point external calibration 2 6 calculation of micropollutant transport reduction the concentration obtained from target analysis and ssa table s3 for agricultural urban paired streams were used to estimate reduction of micropollutant transport due to bmp installation flow weighted mean concentrations fwmc ng l 1 was computed by multiplying concentrations and corresponding flow using the following equation f w m c i 0 n c i q i i 0 n q i where ci concentration in ith month qi mean flow of ith month this equation allows the concentration in each sample to be considered in light of the flow volume associated with it stream flow data were collected from the usgs webpage usgs 2020 if the sampling location was at the usgs gauging station if not data from the nearest usgs gauging station with similar land use and surface geology were used for the wwtp only the concentration of micropollutant i in the wwtp effluent and downstream for a given sampling time were considered 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of chemical coverage for the suspect screening workflow in non target approaches the impact of chromatographic separation is often overlooked or underestimated because of the high selectivity afforded by hrms however previous study croley et al 2012 emphasized the need for a good chromatography in nta and ssa this is due to ion suppression caused by co elution and peak coalescence observed in the orbitrap that caused mass shifts of up to 16 ppm from the theoretical masses more importantly the effect of mobile phase ph on the ionization efficiency should be considered in ssa where many studies have employed switching only the polarity of the ionization mode without changing the ph of the mobile phase albergamo et al 2019 knolhoff et al 2019 in particular methods that use large volume injection or on line spe do not amend themselves to re inject the sample extracts for a second analysis using a different polarity in electrospray ionization while on line spe offers good reproducibility and higher throughput analysis due to automation this approach may not be the best for suspect screening analysis if increasing chemical coverage is an important goal of the study in the optimization of the suspect screening workflow we compared two validated lc methods that have the highest number of compounds optimized for target analysis while both methods utilized a c18 hplc column the mobile phases were different due to the differences in the ionization efficiencies of the classes of compounds analyzed in each method to determine which method results in a wider chemical coverage and more efficient chromatographic separation a 100 μg l 1 standard mix was analyzed in each method separate injections for esi and esi were performed and the detection coverages between the methods were compared while in total we were able to detect more compounds using a low ph method 97 compared to using high ph method 94 we also analyzed the detection coverage considering the different classes of micropollutants that can be accurately identified using both methods fig 2 for pesticides and metabolites which were analyzed in esi 96 of the 942 compounds were detected using the low ph and 95 were detected using the high ph mobile phase antibiotics ppcps and flame retardants were also analyzed using esi and were all detected at the low ph but only 75 were detected using the high ph method for the class of compounds that ionizes well in esi such as pfass higher detection was observed at high ph method fig 2 based on these results we analyzed the extracted water samples using the low ph method for esi and high ph method for the esi this approach allowed us to detect several classes of contaminants that could be present in the water samples 3 2 micropollutants class and detection frequencies the non tidal portion of potomac river flows through different land use zones that range from agricultural in fredrick maryland suburban in germantown maryland and urban in washington dc thus monitoring the quality of water in potomac river is highly important previous studies on micropollutants in potomac river have focused on the determination of estrogenic contaminants such as estrogen and estradiol and their relationship to the high prevalence of male fish intersex observed in the river young et al 2014 kolpin et al 2013 other studies have detected polychlorinated biphenyls polybrominated diphenyl ethers and pfass from ospreys nesting in chesapeake bay rattner et al 2004 which are known for their high persistence in the environment and high bioaccumulation potential in organisms krafft and riess 2015 in 2017 several ppcps that include therapeutic drugs and active ingredients in household products were also detected in surface water sediment and fish collected from potomac river arya et al 2017 the presence of ppcps as micropollutants in surface water is undesirable because even trace levels of anti infective pharmaceuticals can induce antibiotic resistance in microorganisms segura et al 2009 in this work a total of 103 micropollutants that include pesticides and their metabolites 65 hormones and their conjugates 5 ppcps 14 pfass 8 and several other industrial chemicals 11 were detected in the samples table s3 all compounds were traceable to primary standards see supplementary information for the information on retention time precursor ion and confirmatory fragment ions table s1 and thus have level 1 confidence schymanski et al 2014 out of 103 compounds 19 compounds were detected using the target analysis for edcs monitoring and quantitative results were reported in table s3 a about 80 of the micropollutants in the samples were detected using the ssa approach suggesting that a large number of contaminants could have been missed if only the classical targeted analysis was conducted suspect screening revealed presence of other pesticides and their metabolites that are not part of previous monitoring as well as industrial chemicals that are known to persist in the environment such as pfass and flame retardants table s3 b shown in fig 3 is the summary of the distribution of the concentration of each micropollutant along with their detection frequencies df the actual concentrations of each micropollutant during various sampling times are summarized in the supplementary information table s4 the range of concentration observed for all contaminants was 0 8 952 3 ng l 1 with 81 of the micropollutants having concentrations below 100 ng l 1 which are typical in surface water systems around the world richardson and ternes 2014 the average concentrations of ppcps and pfass were all below 100 ng l 1 the extremely high concentrations of e1 3s 428 2 ng l 1 and α e2 214 7 ng l 1 were observed for samples collected at the agricultural site without bmp for february 2018 samples table s4 and were probably due to the presence of a herd of cows above the sampling stream during sample collection most of the pesticides and metabolites have average concentrations below 100 ng l 1 high concentrations 100 ng l 1 were consistently observed for industrial chemicals such as tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tdcp tris 1 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcpp tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tbep triethyl phosphate and 4 nonylphenol detected in the wwtp effluent samples among the several pesticides detected glyodin an agricultural fungicide was found to have highest average concentration 148 ng l 1 however glyodin was detected only in samples collected in 2017 the micropollutants detected in all samples are atrazine desethyl metabolite of atrazine a herbicide and triethyl phosphate an industrial catalyst and plasticizer and were both detected using ssa approach in addition there were 17 more compounds that have df of at least 50 and only 6 out of 17 compounds were included in the target analysis for edcs it is notable that besides these pesticides and metabolites acetamiprid atrazine clothianidin dinotefuran fipronil imadocloprid metalochlor prometon simazine atrazine desethyl atrazine desisopropyl simazine hydroxyl metalochlor and deet the other class of micropollutants that were prevalent 50 df in the samples are pfass and organophosphate flame retardants opfrs which are known to be persistent in the environment krafft and riess 2015 amap 2017 prevalence of atrazine simazine fipronil and metolachlor is consistent with the results presented in a recent study on the spatiotemporal variation of pesticides and other organic contaminants in six rivers of chesapeake bay where these pesticides were found to co occur most often across sites mcclure et al 2020 until now the agricultural sector remains the largest nutrient pollution source to the potomac river and chesapeake bay agriculturally derived micropollutants such as pesticides can be degraded by living organisms generating metabolites or can form transformation products tps in the environment which can reach concentration levels higher than the parent substances and be even more toxic richardson and ternes 2014 in this work several pesticide metabolites and tps were detected such as metabolites of atrazine atrazine desethyl df 100 atrazine desisopropyl df 63 atrazine desethyl desisopropyl df 31 dinotefuran dinotefuran uf df 43 disulfoton disulfoton sulfoxide df 40 fipronil fipronil sufide df 37 simazine simazine 2 hydroxy df 9 sulprofos sulfropos sulfoxide df 43 and fenthion sulfoxide df 37 a product of photooxidation of fenthion in the environment hirahara et al 1998 detection of these contaminants is important because historically monitoring programs do not necessarily consider metabolites and tps it was also observed that these metabolites and tps were detected in all sampling areas which indicates the need to include these micropollutants in monitoring efforts when implementing bmps which are typically focused only on nutrient load reduction 3 3 micropollutant spatiotemporal occurrence comparison of the occurrence of these micropollutants in the different sampling areas agricultural watershed urban watershed and wwtp indicated that the highest number of contaminants were detected in the wwtp effluent and receiving downstream surface water samples followed by the number of detections in the urban watershed samples and in the agricultural watershed samples fig 4 because the wwtp considered in this study receives industrial wastewater it is not surprising that the highest number of micropollutants were detected in the effluent the profile of the contaminants in effluent and downstream samples are comparable refer to table s3 for the detailed information which shows that contamination of downstream samples is mainly from the wwtp outfall as shown in fig 4 pesticides and industrial chemicals were detected in all sampling sites across the sampling times indicating the prevalence of these micropollutants in potomac river watershed the highest occurrence of ppcps was observed in the wwtp effluent and downstream samples while the highest occurrence of pfass was observed in the urban watershed samples and hormones were detected mostly in the samples collected from agricultural watershed fig 4 occurrence of ppcps in wwtps is common due to their universal consumption low human metabolic capability and improper disposal on the other hand pfass reach aquatic environment through discharges from urban runoff contaminated by non point sources murakami et al 2009 zushi and masunaga 2009 and wwtps outfalls arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 it is also worth noting that more pesticides and metabolites were detected from february to june spring and summer compared to samples collected in october and december fall and winter seasons fig 4 this influx of contaminants during spring and summer seasons can be attributed to the time of year that many of these chemicals are applied on the landscape mcclure et al 2020 during this season there can be winter snowmelt and rain event in this region which contribute to pulses in contaminant concentrations and fluxes kaushal et al 2014 in addition sampling occurred during some record wet years where precipitation events were important in influencing contaminant concentrations knowledge of the relationships between contaminant occurrence and agricultural land use in a watershed and stream discharge can help inform the development and implementation of management efforts such as bmps watershed bmps can be used to intercept and dampen contaminant pulses in human impacted landscapes where contaminants are efficiently transported to surface waters by engineered drainage systems kaushal and belt 2012 kaushal et al 2014 in addition these bmps may have some potential for co managing complex mixtures and or chemical cocktails of different contaminants with similarities in fate and transport or shared hydrologic flowpaths kaushal et al 2018 2020 previous research has demonstrated the potential for additive synergistic or antagonistic effects of chemical mixtures on aquatic organisms kortenkamp 2007 lopez doval et al 2019 thus a comprehensive information on the spatiotemporal occurrence of micropollutants is necessary to have an accurate assessment of their ecotoxicological risk 3 4 impact of bmps and wwtps on micropollutant transport in potomac river best management practices are designed to mitigate the negative environmental consequences that come with conversion of natural land for agricultural or urban development these practices are meant to reduce erosion manage storm water runoff control nutrient loading and stabilize other aspects of the watershed impact of agricultural and urban bmps were evaluated by comparing total concentration of the micropollutants in the streams with and without bmp fig 5 the assumption here is that the difference between the pairs of the stream were only attributed to the installation of the bmps thus only the micropollutant detected in paired streams were considered in this plot similarly efficiencies of the wwtps were also compared based on the concentration of micropollutant in the effluent and downstream samples fig 5 as shown in the fig 5 significant reductions in the total concentration of ppcps 70 pfass 65 and other industrial chemicals 75 were observed after the wastewater treatment processes this shows that upgrade of wastewater facilities is an effective means to co manage point sources of micropollutants n and organic c duan et al 2021 the capabilities of primary treatment processes i e sedimentation in removing ppcps are very limited because of the hydrophilic nature of most ppcps luo et al 2014 thus it is likely that this co management occurs during the biological processes secondary treatment and nitrification denitrification steps previous research has demonstrated that wwtp with nitrifying activated sludge results in enhanced biodegradation of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals batt et al 2006 the activated sludge process remove micropollutants through adsorption partial biotransformation or complete biodegradation mcclellan and halden 2010 jelic et al 2011 in the nitrification denitrification steps ammonia is oxidized to nitrate by aerobatic microbes nitrification and then nitrate is metabolized into nitrogen gas n2 under anoxic conditions hu et al 2012 similarly the significant decrease in the concentrations observed for the more persistent industrial chemicals such as pfass and opfrs after the treatment processes can be attributed to the hydrophobicity of these compounds enabling them to partition into the activated sludge during the secondary treatment processes sinclair and kannan 2006 dauchy et al 2017 cristale et al 2016 these results showed that wwtp upgrades with enhanced biological treatment processes could potentially improve efficiencies of wwtps and thus reduce point source inputs of micropollutants and nutrients to the potomac river duan et al 2021 the bmps at the urban site paint branch were designed to minimize the impact of urban development and water runoff from a high level of impervious surfaces by construction of environmental overlay zone muthukrishnan et al 2005 in contrast the brier ditch watershed has not implemented bmps and is one of the most densely populated regions in the area with the fewest stormwater management controls the reduction of 65 in the total concentration of ppcps and 40 in the total concentration of the more persistent industrial chemicals observed fig 5 in urban paired stream can be attributed to the constructed urban bmps this reduction in micropollutant concentrations is likely due to lesser urban discharge at the paint branch as compared to the densely populated region of brier ditch additionally there are several projects to manage stormwater runoff from developed areas restore stream habitat create wetlands and restore the riparian zone in the paint branch eopb 2020 on the other hand the bmps at the agricultural site are focused on restricting livestock access to the tributary and consisted of new fencing and stream crossings and the development of springs to eliminate in stream cattle watering as a result hormones and other micropollutant excreted by the livestock were not directly discharged into the stream this is evident in the significant reduction of the total concentration of hormones 100 at the paired streams with bmp and without manure and eroded soil cannot also easily reach the stream with shrubs and trees growing in riparian zone making it possible for a co reduction of micropollutant n and p inputs with bmps installation duan et al 2021 4 conclusions suspect screening analysis was performed on previously extracted samples that were analyzed using target analysis and were previously published duan et al 2021 to inform us on what additional contaminants need to be included in the next monitoring cycle in future studies on water quality management all of the compounds that were included in the in house database were analyzed experimentally using both high ph and low ph methods for high accuracy and good sensitivity once the most frequently detected compounds are discovered from ssa isotopically labeled analogues of these compounds can be purchased and be spiked into the samples prior to spe the use of the optimized ssa workflow provides a reliable detection of important contaminants to include in target analysis and avoid the purchase of irrelevant and expensive isotopically labeled surrogates without missing highly relevant contaminants in conclusion the optimized suspect screening workflow resulted in a detection of 100 micropollutants in the analysis of a subset of samples spanning agricultural non point urban non point and point wwtp locations in potomac watershed evaluation of the spatial occurrence of the micropollutants revealed that edcs are primarily linked to agricultural areas activities pfass and others industrial chemicals are linked to urban areas and wwtp point source while ppcps are mostly linked to wwtp we also analyzed the impact of the bmps in place and the wwtp upgrades on reducing concentrations or transport of these micropollutants in the potomac watershed and our results suggest that there is potential to co manage a diverse array or chemical cocktails of pollutants based on shared transport and transformation mechanisms in watersheds more research is needed to determine the types of substrates used in stormwater management to attenuate groups of contaminants and also tracking shared sources and flow paths integrating environmental chemistry geochemistry and hydrology across engineering and management designs this will

19958,the vast number of chemicals potentially reaching aquatic environment pose a challenge in maintaining the quality of water resources however best management practices to improve water quality are typically focused on reducing nutrient transport without assessing how these practices may impact the occurrence of micropollutants the potential for co management of nutrients and organic micropollutants exists but few studies have comprehensively evaluated the suite of contaminants associated with different water quality management practices riparian zone restoration stormwater management etc furthermore most studies dealing with the determination of micropollutants in environmental samples include only a limited number of target analytes leaving many contaminants undetected to address this limitation there has been a gradual shift in environmental monitoring from using target analysis to either suspect screening analysis ssa or non targeted analysis nta which relies on accurate mass measurements mass spectral fragmentation patterns and retention time information obtained using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry the work presented in this paper focuses on a wide scope detection of micropollutants in surface water samples from the potomac river watershed united states an in house database composed of 1039 compounds based on experimental analysis of primary standards was established and ssa workflow was optimized and applied to determine the presence of micropollutants in surface water a total of 103 micropollutants were detected in the samples some of which are contaminants that were not previously monitored and belong to various classes such as pharmaceuticals personal care products per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and other persistent industrial chemicals the impact of best management practices being implemented for nitrogen and phosphorus reductions were also assessed for their potential to reduce micropollutant transport this work illustrates the advantages of suspect screening methods to determine a large number of micropollutants in environmental samples and reveals the potential to co manage a diverse array of micropollutants based on shared transport and transformation mechanisms in watersheds keywords high resolution mass spectrometry hrms best management practices bmps emerging contaminants per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass antibiotics endocrine disrupting chemicals 1 introduction freshwater ecosystems are of vital importance to human existence but can be subjected to a range of anthropogenic pressures resulting to water resources degradation there are several routes in which a wide array of micropollutants reach the aquatic environment this include point sources such as outfalls from waste water treatment plants wwtps singhal and perez garcia 2016 margot et al 2015 and industrial discharges lapworth et al 2012 murakami et al 2009 along with non point sources such as agricultural runoff evans et al 2019 urban stormwater runoff murakami et al 2009 and others to reduce loading of these pollutants into surface water several strategies have been implemented such as upgrade of wwtps and implementation of nonpoint source best management practices bmps while these strategies are mostly focused on nutrient reduction several studies have also demonstrated the capability of these practices to reduce micropollutant transport for example advanced oxidation processes in wwtps such as ozonation can efficiently remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps margot et al 2015 angeles et al 2020 agricultural bmps like buffer strips riparian zones and constructed wetlands can also reduce transport of pesticides and their metabolites in watersheds significantly talib and randhir 2016 the potomac river watershed is the second largest subwatershed of the chesapeake bay in terms of water quantity belval and sprague 1999 and the fourth largest river on the eastern coast of the united states in year 2000 the chesapeake bay was listed as an impaired water body under the clean water act due to the degradation of water quality and decline in ecological health of the bay and its tributaries langland et al 2004 in this regard ambient water quality criteria was developed to reduce nutrient and sediment based pollution entering the bay usepa 2003 implementation of strategies to decrease point source nutrient loading resulted to a recovery from eutrophication and a shift of the tidal embayment from phytoplankton submerged to submerged aquatic vegetation was observed de mutsert et al 2017 jones 2020 the continuous increase in the use of chemicals in consumer products which eventually end up being discharged into surface waters delivers challenges to regulatory agencies in their efforts to implement and update water quality criteria decisions on which chemicals need to be regulated is highly dependent on their occurrence in the environment usepa hence dealing with toxic emerging contaminants which have not been previously included in monitoring programs is difficult if environmental monitoring programs will continuously rely on target analysis approach many contaminants will remain unnoticed to address this challenge a shift from pure target analysis to either suspect screening analysis ssa or non targeted analysis nta schymanski et al 2015 is becoming more and more common in environmental studies both ssa and nta approaches take advantage of the accurate mass measurements afforded by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms in ssa and nta the exact mass and isotope patterns of the molecule together with the molecule s characteristic fragmentation patterns are compared to a database or spectral resources of chemical suspects to identify potential matches andra et al 2017 ssa is performed when prior information indicates that a given structure may be present in the sample screening for suspect compounds are searched within a mass of interest typically included in a suspect list on the other hand nta aims at identifying compounds without searching for certain masses substances up front thus a full non target identification starting from the exact mass isotope adduct and fragmentation information is performed schymanski et al 2015 recently ssa approach was successfully used in the identification of 23 new potentially hazardous substances from the effluents collected in three major wwtps in sweden gago ferrero et al 2018 in the detection of 27 active pharmaceutical ingredients from wwtps effluents in switzerland singer et al 2016 in the identification of 13 pesticide transformation products in groundwater samples kiefer et al 2019 and in the prioritization of more than 5200 anthropogenic chemicals authorized in european market sjerps et al 2016 our group also applied retrospective ssa on previously analyzed samples and discovered high frequency of occurrence of antifungal compounds and amoxicillin metabolites in surface waters angeles et al 2020 currently a more holistic watershed approaches chan et al 2018 wang et al 2016 have been developed for large scale pollutant management in surface waters combining smart watershed approaches with advances in analytical testing capabilities e g nta ssa approach can provide sound evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures co management of multiple pollutants regulation of chemicals and sustainable water management hollender et al 2019 while ssa analysis offers increased chemical coverage and serendipitous discovery creating a meaningful ssa workflow and reproducible results among scientists is a daunting task hites and jobst 2018 to bridge this gap we took advantage of the experience of our laboratory in the analysis of various classes of contaminants in several environmental matrices to 1 build an in house tracefinder database that is traceable to primary standards 2 optimize ssa workflow by comparing the detection coverage of our previously validated lc methods 3 apply the optimized workflow to determine the presence of micropollutants in potomac watershed that were not part of prior targeted analysis and 4 assess the efficiency of bmps already in place in reducing transport of micropollutants 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals primary standards of the compounds used in

of the fragment ions for each analyzed compound were were extracted using the xcalibur 4 0 software thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma and all information were inputted into an in house database the format of the database was adopted from the work of wong et al 2018 that contained 603 pesticides and their metabolites an additional of 500 compounds other pesticides hormones pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass and other industrial chemicals were added into the database suspect screening was performed using trace finder version 4 1 thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma and the sensitivity of the workflow was assessed by comparing tolerance for precursor mass error 5 vs 10 ppm parts per million retention time window of 30s vs 60s presence of at least two fragment ions confirmed within 10 20 or 30 ppm mass error and an isotopic pattern match of at least 80 fit it was found that the optimized identification and confirmation settings for the suspect screening workflow is set at precursor ion within 5 ppm error presence of two fragment ions within 20 ppm error retention time match within 1 min and an isotopic pattern of 90 fit using these optimized parameters we were able to obtain a true positive of 94 using low ph method and 97 using the high ph method with zero false positive detailed information of the developed in house database is summarized in table s1 2 4 sample collection preparation and lc hrms analysis water samples were collected from october 2017 to june 2018 along potomac watershed in maryland usa from paired streams in very similar geographic watersheds for a comparable rainfall patterns and from blue plains wwtp fig 1 the paired agricultural streams with and without bmps are located in ben s branch of the lake linganore watershed in frederick county maryland the restored stream is a small headwater tributary surrounded by the hunting lotte farm a 450 acre crop and livestock farm with about 150 head of black angus cattle on about 80 acres of pasture prior to bmp installation the stream s riparian zone was part of a cattle pasture that provided the livestock with unrestricted access to the stream the bmps included more than 8800 feet of fencing three spring developments to replace in stream cattle watering improvements to areas heavily used by livestock including two stream crossings as well as plantings of over 9 acres of cool season grasses shanks and soehl 2008 the unrestored stream is a nearby small unnamed headwater tributary with similar land use and geomorphology the paired urban streams with and without bmps paint branch vs brier ditch are located in the anacostia watershed of maryland montgomery and prince georgy s county fig 1 both watersheds are dominated by urban land use but only paint branch was restored with urban bmps in 1995 the montgomery county council designated the upper paint branch watershed as a special protected area under a county law that provides additional protections to designated sensitive areas the maryland national parks and planning commission purchased undeveloped land along the stream to maintain shaded habitat and leaf litter inputs and implemented regulations that limited impervious area to 10 of all new development in the watershed the brier ditch watershed has not implemented bmp s and is of the most densely populated regions of the area with the fewest stormwater management controls only 13 of the stream has adequate riparian forest buffer compared to paint branch s 53 on the other hand the blue plains wwtp is the largest treatment plant in the potomac river watershed and the largest treatment facility of its kind in the usa with a rated capacity of 384 million gallons per day mgd it serves over two million customers with a collection area of washington dc and surrounding suburbs of maryland and virginia the treatment process utilizes preliminary and primary treatment secondary treatment nitrification denitrification effluent filtration chlorination dechlorination and post aeration blue plains 2020 in the last several years the plant has dramatically upgraded and improved its liquid processing systems surface water collection and sample preparation were described in details elsewhere he and aga 2019 samples and field blanks were collected from specified sampling locations fig 1 at five different sampling times oct 2017 dec 2017 feb 2018 apr 2018 jun 2018 a 500 ml water sample was collected in glass amber bottles pre rinsed with 10 nitric acid and ph was adjusted to 2 5 0 5 to reduce bacterial degradation samples were then filtered using a 0 45 mm glass fiber filter and spiked with 100 μl of 250 mg l 1 surrogate mixture solution containing e1 3s d4 e2 3s d4 e2 3g d3 e1 d4 e2 d3 ee2 d4 imidazolidine d4 prometon d14 metolachlor d6 atrazine d5 acetochlor d11 4 n nonylphenol d4 diazine d10 and dinotefuran d3 analytes of interest were extracted and pre concentrated using solid phase extraction spe with oasis hlb cartridge pre conditioned with 10 ml of methanol followed by 10 ml of nanopure water samples were loaded onto the cartridge at a flow rate of 3 5 ml min 1 cartridges were then completely dried under vacuum conditions at about 15 psi elution was done using 10 ml ethyl acetate eluate 1 and another 10 ml methanol with 2 ammonium hydroxide eluate 2 collected separately eluates 1 and 2 were slowly evaporated to 500 μl under a stream of nitrogen at 30 c and 300 μl aliquots of eluate 1 and eluate 2 were combined in graduated tubes evaporated until 200 μl and then brought up to a final volume of 600 μl with water acetonitrile 95 5 v v solution the solution was centrifuged and the supernatant was collected for lc ms analysis 2 5 target and suspect screening analysis samples were analyzed for 37 endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs using a triple quadrupole lc ms target analysis discussed in details in our previous work he and aga 2019 lc ms parameters lod and recovery for target analysis is summarized in table s2 accurate quantification was performed using isotope dilution technique to account for any matrix effects and correct for losses during sample preparation and transport he and aga 2019 for ssa the same set of samples were analyzed using lc hrms wherein esi data acquisition utilized the low ph method and esi data acquisition utilized the high ph method suspect screening was performed using the developed in house database for tracefinder software wherein the optimized criteria for positive detection precursor ion within 5 ppm error presence of two fragment ions within 20 ppm error retention time match 1 min and an isotopic pattern of 90 fit were used as discussed in section 2 3 blank subtraction was incorporated in the software settings for integration for compounds that were also detected in the blanks only those that have an area in the samples of at least five times higher than the average area of the blanks were considered finally manual checking of peak shape i e gaussian and not very broad 1 min for each confirmed compound was also performed for micropollutants detected in the samples using ssa retrospective semi quantitative analysis was done by analyzing a mix of standards at 100 μg l 1 concentration and using the areas from this standard mix to estimate the concentrations of the micropollutants based on a one point external calibration 2 6 calculation of micropollutant transport reduction the concentration obtained from target analysis and ssa table s3 for agricultural urban paired streams were used to estimate reduction of micropollutant transport due to bmp installation flow weighted mean concentrations fwmc ng l 1 was computed by multiplying concentrations and corresponding flow using the following equation f w m c i 0 n c i q i i 0 n q i where ci concentration in ith month qi mean flow of ith month this equation allows the concentration in each sample to be considered in light of the flow volume associated with it stream flow data were collected from the usgs webpage usgs 2020 if the sampling location was at the usgs gauging station if not data from the nearest usgs gauging station with similar land use and surface geology were used for the wwtp only the concentration of micropollutant i in the wwtp effluent and downstream for a given sampling time were considered 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of chemical coverage for the suspect screening workflow in non target approaches the impact of chromatographic separation is often overlooked or underestimated because of the high selectivity afforded by hrms however previous study croley et al 2012 emphasized the need for a good chromatography in nta and ssa this is due to ion suppression caused by co elution and peak coalescence observed in the orbitrap that caused mass shifts of up to 16 ppm from the theoretical masses more importantly the effect of mobile phase ph on the ionization efficiency should be considered in ssa where many studies have employed switching only the polarity of the ionization mode without changing the ph of the mobile phase albergamo et al 2019 knolhoff et al 2019 in particular methods that use large volume injection or on line spe do not amend themselves to re inject the sample extracts for a second analysis using a different polarity in electrospray ionization while on line spe offers good reproducibility and higher throughput analysis due to automation this approach may not be the best for suspect screening analysis if increasing chemical coverage is an important goal of the study in the optimization of the suspect screening workflow we compared two validated lc methods that have the highest number of compounds optimized for target analysis while both methods utilized a c18 hplc column the mobile phases were different due to the differences in the ionization efficiencies of the classes of compounds analyzed in each method to determine which method results in a wider chemical coverage and more efficient chromatographic separation a 100 μg l 1 standard mix was analyzed in each method separate injections for esi and esi were performed and the detection coverages between the methods were compared while in total we were able to detect more compounds using a low ph method 97 compared to using high ph method 94 we also analyzed the detection coverage considering the different classes of micropollutants that can be accurately identified using both methods fig 2 for pesticides and metabolites which were analyzed in esi 96 of the 942 compounds were detected using the low ph and 95 were detected using the high ph mobile phase antibiotics ppcps and flame retardants were also analyzed using esi and were all detected at the low ph but only 75 were detected using the high ph method for the class of compounds that ionizes well in esi such as pfass higher detection was observed at high ph method fig 2 based on these results we analyzed the extracted water samples using the low ph method for esi and high ph method for the esi this approach allowed us to detect several classes of contaminants that could be present in the water samples 3 2 micropollutants class and detection frequencies the non tidal portion of potomac river flows through different land use zones that range from agricultural in fredrick maryland suburban in germantown maryland and urban in washington dc thus monitoring the quality of water in potomac river is highly important previous studies on micropollutants in potomac river have focused on the determination of estrogenic contaminants such as estrogen and estradiol and their relationship to the high prevalence of male fish intersex observed in the river young et al 2014 kolpin et al 2013 other studies have detected polychlorinated biphenyls polybrominated diphenyl ethers and pfass from ospreys nesting in chesapeake bay rattner et al 2004 which are known for their high persistence in the environment and high bioaccumulation potential in organisms krafft and riess 2015 in 2017 several ppcps that include therapeutic drugs and active ingredients in household products were also detected in surface water sediment and fish collected from potomac river arya et al 2017 the presence of ppcps as micropollutants in surface water is undesirable because even trace levels of anti infective pharmaceuticals can induce antibiotic resistance in microorganisms segura et al 2009 in this work a total of 103 micropollutants that include pesticides and their metabolites 65 hormones and their conjugates 5 ppcps 14 pfass 8 and several other industrial chemicals 11 were detected in the samples table s3 all compounds were traceable to primary standards see supplementary information for the information on retention time precursor ion and confirmatory fragment ions table s1 and thus have level 1 confidence schymanski et al 2014 out of 103 compounds 19 compounds were detected using the target analysis for edcs monitoring and quantitative results were reported in table s3 a about 80 of the micropollutants in the samples were detected using the ssa approach suggesting that a large number of contaminants could have been missed if only the classical targeted analysis was conducted suspect screening revealed presence of other pesticides and their metabolites that are not part of previous monitoring as well as industrial chemicals that are known to persist in the environment such as pfass and flame retardants table s3 b shown in fig 3 is the summary of the distribution of the concentration of each micropollutant along with their detection frequencies df the actual concentrations of each micropollutant during various sampling times are summarized in the supplementary information table s4 the range of concentration observed for all contaminants was 0 8 952 3 ng l 1 with 81 of the micropollutants having concentrations below 100 ng l 1 which are typical in surface water systems around the world richardson and ternes 2014 the average concentrations of ppcps and pfass were all below 100 ng l 1 the extremely high concentrations of e1 3s 428 2 ng l 1 and α e2 214 7 ng l 1 were observed for samples collected at the agricultural site without bmp for february 2018 samples table s4 and were probably due to the presence of a herd of cows above the sampling stream during sample collection most of the pesticides and metabolites have average concentrations below 100 ng l 1 high concentrations 100 ng l 1 were consistently observed for industrial chemicals such as tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tdcp tris 1 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcpp tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tbep triethyl phosphate and 4 nonylphenol detected in the wwtp effluent samples among the several pesticides detected glyodin an agricultural fungicide was found to have highest average concentration 148 ng l 1 however glyodin was detected only in samples collected in 2017 the micropollutants detected in all samples are atrazine desethyl metabolite of atrazine a herbicide and triethyl phosphate an industrial catalyst and plasticizer and were both detected using ssa approach in addition there were 17 more compounds that have df of at least 50 and only 6 out of 17 compounds were included in the target analysis for edcs it is notable that besides these pesticides and metabolites acetamiprid atrazine clothianidin dinotefuran fipronil imadocloprid metalochlor prometon simazine atrazine desethyl atrazine desisopropyl simazine hydroxyl metalochlor and deet the other class of micropollutants that were prevalent 50 df in the samples are pfass and organophosphate flame retardants opfrs which are known to be persistent in the environment krafft and riess 2015 amap 2017 prevalence of atrazine simazine fipronil and metolachlor is consistent with the results presented in a recent study on the spatiotemporal variation of pesticides and other organic contaminants in six rivers of chesapeake bay where these pesticides were found to co occur most often across sites mcclure et al 2020 until now the agricultural sector remains the largest nutrient pollution source to the potomac river and chesapeake bay agriculturally derived micropollutants such as pesticides can be degraded by living organisms generating metabolites or can form transformation products tps in the environment which can reach concentration levels higher than the parent substances and be even more toxic richardson and ternes 2014 in this work several pesticide metabolites and tps were detected such as metabolites of atrazine atrazine desethyl df 100 atrazine desisopropyl df 63 atrazine desethyl desisopropyl df 31 dinotefuran dinotefuran uf df 43 disulfoton disulfoton sulfoxide df 40 fipronil fipronil sufide df 37 simazine simazine 2 hydroxy df 9 sulprofos sulfropos sulfoxide df 43 and fenthion sulfoxide df 37 a product of photooxidation of fenthion in the environment hirahara et al 1998 detection of these contaminants is important because historically monitoring programs do not necessarily consider metabolites and tps it was also observed that these metabolites and tps were detected in all sampling areas which indicates the need to include these micropollutants in monitoring efforts when implementing bmps which are typically focused only on nutrient load reduction 3 3 micropollutant spatiotemporal occurrence comparison of the occurrence of these micropollutants in the different sampling areas agricultural watershed urban watershed and wwtp indicated that the highest number of contaminants were detected in the wwtp effluent and receiving downstream surface water samples followed by the number of detections in the urban watershed samples and in the agricultural watershed samples fig 4 because the wwtp considered in this study receives industrial wastewater it is not surprising that the highest number of micropollutants were detected in the effluent the profile of the contaminants in effluent and downstream samples are comparable refer to table s3 for the detailed information which shows that contamination of downstream samples is mainly from the wwtp outfall as shown in fig 4 pesticides and industrial chemicals were detected in all sampling sites across the sampling times indicating the prevalence of these micropollutants in potomac river watershed the highest occurrence of ppcps was observed in the wwtp effluent and downstream samples while the highest occurrence of pfass was observed in the urban watershed samples and hormones were detected mostly in the samples collected from agricultural watershed fig 4 occurrence of ppcps in wwtps is common due to their universal consumption low human metabolic capability and improper disposal on the other hand pfass reach aquatic environment through discharges from urban runoff contaminated by non point sources murakami et al 2009 zushi and masunaga 2009 and wwtps outfalls arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 it is also worth noting that more pesticides and metabolites were detected from february to june spring and summer compared to samples collected in october and december fall and winter seasons fig 4 this influx of contaminants during spring and summer seasons can be attributed to the time of year that many of these chemicals are applied on the landscape mcclure et al 2020 during this season there can be winter snowmelt and rain event in this region which contribute to pulses in contaminant concentrations and fluxes kaushal et al 2014 in addition sampling occurred during some record wet years where precipitation events were important in influencing contaminant concentrations knowledge of the relationships between contaminant occurrence and agricultural land use in a watershed and stream discharge can help inform the development and implementation of management efforts such as bmps watershed bmps can be used to intercept and dampen contaminant pulses in human impacted landscapes where contaminants are efficiently transported to surface waters by engineered drainage systems kaushal and belt 2012 kaushal et al 2014 in addition these bmps may have some potential for co managing complex mixtures and or chemical cocktails of different contaminants with similarities in fate and transport or shared hydrologic flowpaths kaushal et al 2018 2020 previous research has demonstrated the potential for additive synergistic or antagonistic effects of chemical mixtures on aquatic organisms kortenkamp 2007 lopez doval et al 2019 thus a comprehensive information on the spatiotemporal occurrence of micropollutants is necessary to have an accurate assessment of their ecotoxicological risk 3 4 impact of bmps and wwtps on micropollutant transport in potomac river best management practices are designed to mitigate the negative environmental consequences that come with conversion of natural land for agricultural or urban development these practices are meant to reduce erosion manage storm water runoff control nutrient loading and stabilize other aspects of the watershed impact of agricultural and urban bmps were evaluated by comparing total concentration of the micropollutants in the streams with and without bmp fig 5 the assumption here is that the difference between the pairs of the stream were only attributed to the installation of the bmps thus only the micropollutant detected in paired streams were considered in this plot similarly efficiencies of the wwtps were also compared based on the concentration of micropollutant in the effluent and downstream samples fig 5 as shown in the fig 5 significant reductions in the total concentration of ppcps 70 pfass 65 and other industrial chemicals 75 were observed after the wastewater treatment processes this shows that upgrade of wastewater facilities is an effective means to co manage point sources of micropollutants n and organic c duan et al 2021 the capabilities of primary treatment processes i e sedimentation in removing ppcps are very limited because of the hydrophilic nature of most ppcps luo et al 2014 thus it is likely that this co management occurs during the biological processes secondary treatment and nitrification denitrification steps previous research has demonstrated that wwtp with nitrifying activated sludge results in enhanced biodegradation of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals batt et al 2006 the activated sludge process remove micropollutants through adsorption partial biotransformation or complete biodegradation mcclellan and halden 2010 jelic et al 2011 in the nitrification denitrification steps ammonia is oxidized to nitrate by aerobatic microbes nitrification and then nitrate is metabolized into nitrogen gas n2 under anoxic conditions hu et al 2012 similarly the significant decrease in the concentrations observed for the more persistent industrial chemicals such as pfass and opfrs after the treatment processes can be attributed to the hydrophobicity of these compounds enabling them to partition into the activated sludge during the secondary treatment processes sinclair and kannan 2006 dauchy et al 2017 cristale et al 2016 these results showed that wwtp upgrades with enhanced biological treatment processes could potentially improve efficiencies of wwtps and thus reduce point source inputs of micropollutants and nutrients to the potomac river duan et al 2021 the bmps at the urban site paint branch were designed to minimize the impact of urban development and water runoff from a high level of impervious surfaces by construction of environmental overlay zone muthukrishnan et al 2005 in contrast the brier ditch watershed has not implemented bmps and is one of the most densely populated regions in the area with the fewest stormwater management controls the reduction of 65 in the total concentration of ppcps and 40 in the total concentration of the more persistent industrial chemicals observed fig 5 in urban paired stream can be attributed to the constructed urban bmps this reduction in micropollutant concentrations is likely due to lesser urban discharge at the paint branch as compared to the densely populated region of brier ditch additionally there are several projects to manage stormwater runoff from developed areas restore stream habitat create wetlands and restore the riparian zone in the paint branch eopb 2020 on the other hand the bmps at the agricultural site are focused on restricting livestock access to the tributary and consisted of new fencing and stream crossings and the development of springs to eliminate in stream cattle watering as a result hormones and other micropollutant excreted by the livestock were not directly discharged into the stream this is evident in the significant reduction of the total concentration of hormones 100 at the paired streams with bmp and without manure and eroded soil cannot also easily reach the stream with shrubs and trees growing in riparian zone making it possible for a co reduction of micropollutant n and p inputs with bmps installation duan et al 2021 4 conclusions suspect screening analysis was performed on previously extracted samples that were analyzed using target analysis and were previously published duan et al 2021 to inform us on what additional contaminants need to be included in the next monitoring cycle in future studies on water quality management all of the compounds that were included in the in house database were analyzed experimentally using both high ph and low ph methods for high accuracy and good sensitivity once the most frequently detected compounds are discovered from ssa isotopically labeled analogues of these compounds can be purchased and be spiked into the samples prior to spe the use of the optimized ssa workflow provides a reliable detection of important contaminants to include in target analysis and avoid the purchase of irrelevant and expensive isotopically labeled surrogates without missing highly relevant contaminants in conclusion the optimized suspect screening workflow resulted in a detection of 100 micropollutants in the analysis of a subset of samples spanning agricultural non point urban non point and point wwtp locations in potomac watershed evaluation of the spatial occurrence of the micropollutants revealed that edcs are primarily linked to agricultural areas activities pfass and others industrial chemicals are linked to urban areas and wwtp point source while ppcps are mostly linked to wwtp we also analyzed the impact of the bmps in place and the wwtp upgrades on reducing concentrations or transport of these micropollutants in the potomac watershed and our results suggest that there is potential to co manage a diverse array or chemical cocktails of pollutants based on shared transport and transformation mechanisms in watersheds more research is needed to determine the types of substrates used in stormwater management to attenuate groups of contaminants and also tracking shared sources and flow paths integrating environmental chemistry geochemistry and hydrology across engineering and management designs this will require collaborative efforts identifying and quantifying the full spectrum of contaminants their transport and their transformation using interdisciplinary research declaration of competing interest

increased by approximately 0 5 log during two snowmelt rainfall episodes and approximately 1 0 log following a planned wastewater discharge upstream of the drinking water intake and during a β d glucuronidase activity peak in dry weather conditions increases in the removal of adenovirus and rotavirus by coagulation flocculation processes were observed during peak virus concentrations in source water suggesting that these processes do not operate under steady state conditions but dynamic conditions in response to source water conditions rotavirus and enterovirus detected in raw and treated water samples were predominantly negative in viral culture at one site infectious adenoviruses were detected in raw water and water treated by a combination of ballasted clarification ozonation gac filtration and uv disinfection operated at a dose of 40 mj cm 2 the proposed sampling strategy can inform the understanding of the dynamics associated with virus concentrations at drinking water treatment plants susceptible to de facto wastewater reuse graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water enteric viruses β d glucuronidase risk assessment 1 introduction accurate data on the physical removal and inactivation of enteric viruses by engineered water treatment processes is essential to the implementation of risk based preventive approaches to ensure drinking water safety who 2017 virus removal performances are commonly assessed by spiking cultured or isolated virus stocks these performances have been estimated at bench and pilot plant scales by plaque assays hijnen and medema 2010 or quantitative pcr qpcr assays kato et al 2018 shirasaki et al 2017 a limited number of studies also investigated the removal of viruses under full scale operating conditions in drinking water treatment plants dwtps albinana gimenez et al 2009 teunis et al 2009 however these removal performances are usually measured under random raw water quality conditions and little is known about specific removal performances during hydrometeorological events coagulation and flocculation are critical steps defining the efficacy of settling and chemically assisted filtration especially during intermittent changes in raw water quality inadequate floc formation floc breakdown and filter overloading can lead to increased amounts of particles in finished water which can render virus disinfection ineffective hejkal et al 1979 natural organic matter nom concentration in raw water can increase following rainfall events hurst et al 2004 which can interfere with virus flocculation performance nasser et al 1995 furthermore coagulation with hydrolyzing metal salts can perform less well at low water temperature due to lower solubility and slower kinetics of the metal hydroxides driscoll and letterman 1988 kang and cleasby 1995 and poor floc formation hanson and cleasby 1990 morris and knocke 1984 snowmelt episodes associated with high virus concentrations in river water during cold months could thus represent periods of higher viral risks for drinking water consumers sokolova et al 2015 however the identification and characterization of peaks in raw water viral contamination at drinking water intakes remain challenging westrell et al 2006 the automatization of rapid methods for detecting indicators of faecal contamination in surface water koschelnik et al 2015 ryzinska paier et al 2014 is stimulating the development of new strategies to characterize short term variations in raw water contamination at drinking water intakes online near real time monitoring of β d glucuronidase gluc activity has recently been used to measure the frequency duration and amplitude of faecal contamination peaks at an urban dwtp burnet et al 2019b furthermore event based monitoring strategies triggered by gluc activity were recently developed to characterize escherichia coli e coli peaks sylvestre et al 2020a and protozoan pathogens peaks sylvestre et al 2020b at dwtps however it is unclear whether online gluc activity can be used to identify peaks in source water viral contamination this knowledge gap limits the application of online gluc activity monitoring for water safety management and warrants further investigations demeter et al 2020 therefore the main objective of this work is to quantitatively describe short term fluctuations in virus concentrations in source water and their removal by full scale drinking water treatment processes under different source water conditions baseline background conditions and peak conditions during snowmelt periods online β d glucuronidase gluc activity measurements and local meteorological conditions were considered to inform sampling strategies large volumes of raw water 50 2200 l and treated water throughout the treatment train were concentrated to quantify multiple enteric viruses including norovirus rotavirus reovirus sapovirus astrovirus enterovirus adenovirus and a non enteric virus john cunningham jc virus by reverse transcription rt and real time quantitative pcr qpcr virus infectivity of cultivable viruses was also assessed using the cytopathic effect in cell culture and integrated cell culture with qpcr icc qpcr 2 materials and methods 2 1 catchment description sampling campaigns were carried out at two drinking water treatment plants dwtps treating water from the milles iles river in the greater montreal area in quebec canada the river has a length of 40 km an average water discharge of 286 m3 s 1 it is one of the major rivers of the montreal archipelago where the ottawa river meets the saint lawrence river drinking water intakes a and b are located at the middle point and the end of the river respectively locally this river and its tributaries are under the direct influence of a series of small watersheds totalling 1190 km2 there are 184 combined sewer overflows csos outfalls and 14 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps outfalls located in these small watersheds csos discharges can occur intermittently during rainfall or heavy snowmelt events most of these wwtps are using aerated ponds or combined biological and physicochemical treatment processes diffuse pollution sources may also contribute to viral contamination of animal origin in drinking water supplies because river tributaries are draining agricultural lands spring snowmelt freshet usually occurs between february and april in southern quebec and it is the critical period for microbial peaks at drinking water intakes located in this river burnet et al 2019b 2 2

measurements in raw water and local meteorological conditions temperature precipitation gluc activity was used as an indicator of the faecal contamination level an automated rapid monitoring system coliminder vwms gmbh vienna austria was installed at each dwtp in february 1 2 months before significant snowmelt episodes to monitor variations of gluc activity in raw water gluc activity was measured every 1 3 h and was reported online in modified fishman units mmfu 100 ml 1 turbidity levels were measured continuously in raw water and every 4 h in settled water individual filter effluents and combined effluent from all filters at dwtp a the event based sampling strategy was based on meteorological conditions daily rainfall 20 mm or air temperature 5 c over 24 h and gluc activity levels variation 5 mmfu 100 ml 1 over 1 h two events event a1 in february and event a2 in april were captured with this sampling strategy sequential grab raw water samples 110 500 l were collected at a frequency of 4 6 h for around 24 h to obtain a virus concentration profile over time sequential grab samples of settled and filtered waters 300 600 l were collected to match theoretical mean hydraulic residence times through clarification 3 h and filtration 2 h c durivage personal communication samples were not collected under baseline conditions at dwtp b four sampling campaigns were carried out under peak conditions 2 and baseline conditions 2 on february 7 2018 a planned discharge of raw sewage 4 h was undertaken to maintain the main sewer system at a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp located 5 km upstream of dwtp b the wwtp serves a population of 37 000 residents and treats on average 28 000 m3 of raw sewage per day in normal conditions the wastewater is treated using aerated lagoons the impact of this discharge on raw water quality at dwtp b was evaluated using gluc activity to trigger grab sampling of raw water event b1 in march 2018 a rapid increase in gluc activity 20 mmfu 100 ml was observed in dry weather conditions results from event based sampling campaigns at dwtp a in 2017 showed that such variations in gluc activity could indicate short term variations 0 5 log in virus concentrations we thus assumed that this period of high gluc activity represented peak conditions in source water microbial concentrations event b2 even if local meteorological conditions did not suggest a significant impact of rainfall or rapid snowmelt on source water quality sequential grab samples of raw 50 200 l settled 350 520 l filtered 1000 2000 l and uv disinfected 1200 2700 l waters were collected over four days during event b2 baseline conditions were defined as periods of low gluc activity level 20 mmfu 100 ml and dry weather conditions daily rainfall 1 mm and air temperature 5 c over 24 h grab samples of settled filtered and uv disinfected waters were collected under baseline conditions theoretical mean hydraulic residence times throughout clarification 1 5 h filtration and uv disinfection 1 5 h were matched for each raw water sample m marchand personal communication 2 4 virus concentration method an adsorption elution method was applied to concentrate viruses from water samples using electropositive filters nanoceram vs2 5 5 argonide corp sanford fl usa samples were filtered on site at the dwtps under a constant flow rate of 5 15 l min 1 pre filters were not used in this study a decontamination protocol was applied to prevent cross contamination during the repeated use of the filtration system before each use the intake and cartridge housing modules were sterilized with 6 naocl for 30 min rinsed with sterile ddh2o and then dechlorinated with a sodium thiosulfate solution after filtration cartridges were stored and kept cool between 1 and 10 c in a transport cooler and shipped to the university alberta hospital in edmonton ab canada for processing within 48 h after the start of the field sample collection eight samples collected at dwtp b on february 28 2018 could only be processed 96 h after the collection due to shipment delay the elution and flocculation steps after filtration were performed to concentrate the viruses in the samples as previously described pang et al 2012 in brief viruses retained by the positively charged filter were eluted with 1 l of 1 5 beef extract be buffer ph 9 75 the eluate was further flocculated with fecl3 and ph adjustment to 3 5 followed by centrifugation the water concentrate was suspended in glycine buffer 0 5 mol l glycine ph 9 0 with a final volume of 15 ml the ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 2 0 2 the concentrate was stored at 70 c until assayed 2 5 nucleic acid extraction and quantification of enteric viruses by qpcr total nucleic acids were extracted from 200 μl of concentrated water samples and eluted in 50 μl rnase free water using the magazorb total rna prep kit promega wi usa nucleic acid extracts were tested for norovirus genogroup i and gii gi gii rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus generic adenovirus enterovirus jc polyomavirus and reovirus quantification of viruses was performed by a two step reaction rt and qpcr with the abi prism 7500 sequence detection system abi as previously described qiu et al 2015 2016 the primer and probes used for qpcr were published previously pang et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 2018 rt and qpcr were carried out as described previously pang et al 2012 salmon dna was included as an internal control to monitor inhibition an external standard curve was established for quantification of all eight viruses using the 875 bp dna fragment of norovirus gii by 10 fold dilution from 10 to 1 106 genome copies qiu et al 2016 optimization of the panel qpcr assay for the eight viruses was performed by adjusting thermal cycler conditions and concentration of primers and probes to achieve similar qpcr efficiencies based on the standard curves and the cycle threshold values the virus concentration free or encapsidated genomes was expressed as genome copies per litre sample specific recovery rates were not measured but the recovery rates of qpcr based assays were described in a previous study pang et al 2012 the limit of detection lod of qpcr based assays was one genome copy per pcr reaction which was equal to 2 140 genome copies per 100 ml based on each sample s volume and their concentrate volume 2 6 virus cell culture viral replication in cultures was determined by monitoring cytopathic effects cpe infectivity of rotavirus enterovirus adenovirus and reovirus was assessed in each sample using buffalo green monkey kidney cells bgm and african rhesus monkey kidney cells ma104 grown separately on eagle s mem medium sigma on canada as previously described qiu et al 2015 integrated cell culture icc qpcr assay was used to evaluate the presence of infectious virions in the sample as detailed by qiu et al 2015 2 7 quantification of virus concentrations a hierarchical bayesian framework was adopted to evaluate virus concentrations two levels of analysis were specified to describe uncertainties related to the random error in sample collection and the analytical recovery due to losses during sample processing purified virus nucleic acids in each pcr n p were assumed to be poisson distributed with a mean λ p varughese et al 2018 this model assumes that virus nucleic acids are fully disaggregated and randomly distributed in the water i e homogeneous concentration within the time and space from which the sample was collected the virus to genome copy ratio was assumed to be 1 1 the expected analytical recovery of the detection method was assumed to vary randomly among samples according to a beta distribution wu et al 2014 the model can be written as 1 n p i poisson λ p i 2 λ p i v i v s i v p c r i v p i r i 3 r i beta α β where v is the virus concentration v s is the volume of raw of treated water filtered with the nanoceram filter v p c r is the volume for the pcr reaction v p is the volume of the pellet i e concentrated sample for the nucleic acid extraction and r is the expected analytical recovery shape parameters α β of the beta distribution were estimated from recovery rates previously published for adenovirus 41 n 3 mean 0 18 standard deviation std 0 03 and norovirus gii 4 n 3 mean 0 19 std 0 03 spiked and concentrated from 10 l of river water by nanoceram filtration and assayed by real time quantitative rt pcr and pcr pang et al 2012 beta distributions for adenovirus 41 and norovirus gii 4 were used to describe the recovery rates of other dna and rna viruses the bayesian analysis was conducted in r v3 4 1 via rjags v4 6 plummer 2013 the uncertainty in parameter values was evaluated using a markov chain monte carlo procedure four markov chains were run for 104 iterations after a burn in phase of 103 iterations the brooks gelman rubin scale reduction factor was considered to monitor the convergence of the four chains gelman and shirley 2011 a conjugate gamma prior was selected to describe the virus concentration v of the poisson model the shape and rate parameters of the gamma prior were both set to 0 001 this prior reflects practically no prior knowledge the posterior mean of the estimate virus concentration and its 95 credibility interval were reported the r code used to quantify virus concentrations is provided in the supplementary material 2 8 quantification of virus removal treatment removal performances were quantified using an empirical approach point estimates of the log removal lr across a treatment unit paired sample were calculated as follows 4 lr log 10 c i n c o u t where c i n and c o u t are the best estimate virus concentration per sample genome copies l 1 before and after treatment respectively the uncertainty in virus concentrations was not considered in the quantification of lr the limit of detection was considered in the calculation when c o u t was not quantified when multiple grab samples were collected in sequence over an event the mean effective log removal lr effective was calculated as follows 5 lr effective log 10 c i n c o u t each treatment step of the dwtp was assumed to behave as a plug flow reactor operated hydraulically at a steady state the theoretical hydraulic residence time was assumed to be a valid approximation of the retention time of the viruses 3 results 3 1 short term fluctuations in virus concentrations in source water short and long term time series of gluc activity turbidity ammonia and hydrometeorological variables at drinking water intakes a and b are presented in fig 2 and supplementary fig 1 at dwtp a the sampling strategy was triggered by local meteorological conditions and short term gluc activity variations the turbidity level and the river flow rate peaked several days after the gluc activity for the two targeted events supplementary fig 1 rotavirus adenovirus norovirus gii and jc virus were detected in most samples during the two snowmelt events table 1 raw water concentrations peaked at around 104 genome copies l 1 for adenovirus and rotavirus and 103 genome copies l 1 for norovirus gii and jc virus fig 3 a rotavirus and adenovirus concentrations increased by approximately 0 5 and 1 0 log respectively during these 24 h periods the uncertainties related to the random error in sample collection and the analytical error are shown with credible intervals in fig 4 these 95 credibility intervals indicate that the uncertainty on the virus concentration per sample is approximately 0 5 log at dwtp b the sampling strategy to capture peak events in raw water viral contamination was based on increases in gluc activity only local meteorological conditions were not considered to trigger sampling during peak conditions on february 7 raw water gluc activity increased from 20 to 40 mmfu 100 ml 1 about 10 h following the planned wastewater discharge event b1 this peak had a duration of approximately 24 h fig 2b in march the raw water gluc activity gradually increased from 20 to 50 mmfu 100 ml 1 over five days without significant cumulative rainfall 10 mm and cumulative snowmelt 10 cm over the ten days preceding the gluc activity peak event b2 baseline conditions gluc activity level 20 mmfu 100 ml and dry weather conditions were assessed approximately two weeks after event b2 turbidity and ammonia levels did not peak following the planned wastewater discharge and during the gluc activity peak in dry weather conditions supplementary fig 1 concentrations of rotavirus adenovirus norovirus gii and jc virus were about 1 0 log higher during peak event conditions than during baseline conditions fig 3b enterovirus astrovirus and sapovirus were sporadically measured in event based samples raw water concentrations peaked at around 105 genome copies l 1 for adenovirus and rotavirus and 104 genome copies l 1 for norovirus gii and jc virus these concentrations were approximately 1 0 log lower than treated wastewater effluent concentrations and approximately 2 0 log lower than raw sewage concentrations as measured at the upstream wwtp supplementary fig 1 3 2 removal by full scale treatment processes using qpcr data time series of removal of viruses throughout the treatment trains are presented in figs 4 and 5 error bars represent the 95 credibility interval on the concentration due to the analytical error and the random distribution of the genome copies in the sample at both dwtps the concentration of 300 520 l of settled water allowed the quantification of rotavirus and adenovirus 300 genome copies l in all samples norovirus gii was sporadically detected in settled water at dwtp a but not at dwtp b at both dwtps reovirus sapovirus astrovirus and enteroviruses were not detected in any samples collected throughout the treatment train variations in removal performance for rotavirus adenovirus norovirus gi and gii jc virus during baseline and event conditions are presented in supplementary table 1 raw and settled water turbidity levels during sample collection are shown in supplementary table 2 for adenovirus log removals varied from 0 3 to 1 3 log for floc blanket clarification dwtp a and from 1 2 to 1 7 log for ballasted clarification dwtp b for rotavirus and norovirus gii log removals by floc blanket clarification were negligible 0 5 log in contrast log removals by ballasted clarification varied from 0 5 to 1 6 log for rotavirus and from 0 9 to 2 5 log for norovirus gii overall enteric viruses were removed to a higher degree by ballasted clarification than floc blanket clarification results from sequential grab samples show that the coagulation flocculation of viruses did not deteriorate during these snowmelt episodes fig 6 peak concentrations of adenovirus were buffered by coagulation flocculation at both dwtps a buffering effect was also observed for rotavirus and jc virus at dwtp b the concentration of 500 to 2200 l did not allow us to quantify the log removal of enteric viruses by filtration accurately however virus concentrations were sporadically quantified at dwtp a after filtration rotavirus fig 4 and at dwtp b after a combination of ozonation and gac filtration adenovirus and rotavirus and uv disinfection rotavirus fig 5 3 3 inactivation of viruses using cell culture the evaluation of virus infectivity using icc qpcr shows that rotavirus and enterovirus were predominantly negative in viral culture in raw and treated water samples at dwtps a and b table 2 reovirus was mostly positive in raw water samples but not in treated water samples at dwtps a and b at dwtp b infectious adenoviruses were detected in 50 of the raw water samples 4 8 and 33 of the uv disinfected water samples 2 6 4 discussion 4 1 characterization of viral contamination peaks in source water a monitoring strategy triggered by automated online gluc activity measurements and local meteorological conditions was proposed to characterize peaks in raw water viral contamination and their removal by treatment processes this monitoring strategy was designed to provide insights on the amplitude of viral contamination peaks during snowmelt episodes at dwtps located in highly urbanized areas the adequate characterization of these short term fluctuations is important in microbial risk assessment as the long term risk may be driven by the occurrence of pathogen concentration peaks smeets et al 2010 teunis et al 2004 gluc activity was selected to trigger virus sampling because recent technological development enables its automated near real time measurement koschelnik et al 2015 furthermore a high resolution gluc activity monitoring data set was available to study catchment dynamics at dwtp a burnet et al 2019b at dwtp a this sampling strategy allowed the detection of increases of approximately 0 5 log in adenovirus and rotavirus concentrations in raw water following two snowmelt rainfall events short term variations of approximatively 1 0 log in norovirus and adenovirus concentrations were previously reported in wet weather conditions in river water influenced by wastewater discharges hata et al 2014 at dwtp b gluc activity monitoring allowed measuring increases in virus concentrations of approximately 1 0 log following a planned wastewater discharge upstream of the drinking water intake and during a gluc activity peak in dry weather conditions concentrations of viruses in raw water during peak conditions were approximately 1 0 log higher at dwtp b downstream than dwtp a upstream although virus concentrations were not quantified during the same year at dwtp a 2017 and dwtp b 2018 findings from the current study suggest that virus concentrations increased along an urban river influenced by numerous wastewater discharges increases in detection frequency and virus concentrations along rivers were also reported for major urban centers in france prevost et al 2015 and in alberta canada pang et al 2019 in our study the monitoring of virus at a wwtp upstream dwtp b also indicated that peak concentrations in raw water were around 2 0 log lower than virus concentrations in raw sewage and around 1 0 log lower than virus concentrations in treated wastewater effluent aerated lagoons gluc activity and virus concentrations peaked at drinking water intakes following rainfall snowmelt events and dry weather conditions the latter short term trends may reflect faecal contamination transported over long distances and interfering enzymatic activity by non fecal compounds fiksdal and tryland 2008 it has been established that viable but non culturable vbnc e coli can contribute to the gluc activity signal burnet et al 2019a ender et al 2017 garcia armisen et al 2005 stadler et al 2016 and that vbnc e coli decreased much more slowly than culturable e coli servais et al 2009 in our study virus concentrations were quantified using a qpcr method which detects the dna rna from viable and nonviable viruses qualitative results presence or absence of infectious viruses obtained with icc qpcr indicated that adenovirus rotavirus and enterovirus found in samples of source water were mostly not infectious detailed investigations confirming these findings in other areas and under different environmental conditions are needed to determine whether gluc activity is a generally useful trigger for viral contamination sampling online physicochemical measurements or other microbial indicators might be used instead of gluc activity to trigger virus sampling in this study turbidity did not simultaneously peak with virus concentrations during captured events viral contamination during snowmelt and rainfall runoff events may be dominated by point sources cso and wwtp discharges whereas turbidity may come from the whole watershed 4 2 virus type specific removal by full scale treatment processes the concentration of large volumes 50 600 l of raw and settled water allowed characterizing the full scale removal performance of a floc blanket clarifier dwtp a and a ballasted clarifier dwtp b for rotavirus and adenovirus under different source water conditions other enteric viruses were only sporadically detected in settled water suggesting that rotavirus and adenovirus should preferably be selected as reference viruses to quantify the removal of enteric viruses by full scale treatment processes the removal performance of physical treatment processes log removal is commonly assumed to be a first order process with respect to the influent concentration of the virus i e the same fraction of viruses is removed regardless of the influent concentration haas and trussell 1998 however short term increases in the removal performances of coagulation flocculation processes were observed during raw water peak events for adenovirus at dwtp a and for adenovirus and rotavirus at dwtp b these results suggest that coagulation flocculation processes do not operate under steady state conditions but dynamic conditions in response to source water conditions according to the smoluchowski theory of flocculation variations in the influent particle concentrations may influence the aggregation rate of viruses during flocculation while such an evaluation would be interesting this study was not designed to investigate this hypothesis even if large volumes of water 300 2700 l were concentrated the quantification of virus removal performances by chemically assisted filtration and disinfection remained a challenge because of detection limits rotavirus and adenovirus genomes were sporadically detected after filtration ozonation and uv disinfection and infectious adenoviruses were detected after uv disinfection at dwtp b previous studies reported low removal of viruses and bacteriophages by gac filtration at pilot plant scale guy et al 1977 hijnen et al 2010 and high uv resistance of adenovirus at a dose of 40 mj cm 2 meng and gerba 1996 thurston enriquez et al 2003 however a viral ozonation study demonstrated that a ct value of 0 6 mg l 1 min 1 calculated ct value at dwtp b should be sufficient to inactivate adenovirus type 40 by at least 4 0 logs in treated water thurston enriquez et al 2005 the disparity between our results and those of thurston enriquez et al 2005 makes it difficult to conclude on the extent to which full scale ozonation processes may inactivate naturally occurring adenovirus poor mixing and hydraulic conditions have been found to reduce the inactivation of e coli by full scale ozonation processes smeets et al 2006 the hydraulics of the full scale ozonation system assessed in our study may also limit the reduction of adenovirus site specific source water data and full scale removal data incorporated into quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra could be used to evaluate drinking water treatment plant operation and investigate whether adenovirus is removed to an acceptably low level especially if chlorine disinfection is not performed for maintaining a residual 4 3 limitations for the quantification of virus concentrations spatial heterogeneity and aggregation of viruses may have an impact on the quantification log removal during full scale treatment in this study viral genome copies were assumed to be fully disaggregated and thus randomly dispersed in all samples overdispersion was not evaluated because sample replicates were not collected still large volume samples were used for concentrating the viruses in the samples 300 l which should minimize this source of uncertainty owing to the limitations in analytical viral recovery data in the full scale treatment the uncertainty in method recovery performance was incorporated in virus concentration estimates using a beta distribution of recovery rates reported by pang et al 2012 the same laboratory recently reported slightly lower recovery rates human adenovirus 2 4 n 28 mean 0 14 std 0 14 norovirus gii n 10 mean 0 10 std 0 06 for wastewater samples subjected to secondary treatment li et al 2019 monitoring the efficiency of the virus concentration step with a process control could increase the accuracy of virus concentration estimates in raw water during hydrometeorological events hata et al 2014 recovery rates for samples collected after treatment processes may differ from those measured in raw water because of changes in matrix composition however pang et al 2012 did not observe significant differences in recovery rates among pure tap and raw water samples for two rna viruses norovirus and echovirus and one dna virus adenovirus 41 nevertheless the presence of alum and silica sand in settled water may influence analytical recovery efficiencies the presence of viral genomes after ozonation and uv disinfection is challenging to interpret because encapsidated genomes and free nucleic acids can be detected infectious rotaviruses in raw water were usually not detected by icc qpcr unless high concentrations of those viruses were present in raw water 104 genome copies l 1 one of the reasons is that human rotavirus does not propagate efficiently in the continuous in vitro cell lines we used ma104 and bgm arnold et al 2009 ward et al 1984 icc qpcr has limited value to assess the inactivation of viruses in water samples because this method only indicates the absence presence of an infectious virus serial dilutions of wastewater and source water samples have recently been carried out to quantify human infectious virus concentrations by icc qpcr with the most probable number mpn method qiu et al 2018 schijven et al 2019 however the concentrations of naturally occurring viruses throughout full scale drinking water treatment train may be too low for quantification using dilutions considering these limitations the fact that positive infectious adenoviruses were found in treated water after a combination of advanced treatment processes point to the need to develop improved infectious virus detection methods 5 conclusions two full scale drinking water treatment plants in quebec canada were selected to investigate short term fluctuations in virus concentrations in source water and their removal by full scale drinking water treatment processes under different source water conditions the following conclusions are drawn event based sampling targeted by online β d glucuronidase activity monitoring allowed detecting increases in adenovirus and rotavirus concentrations of approximately 0 5 log during two snowmelt rainfall episodes and 1 0 log following a planned wastewater discharge upstream of the drinking water intake and during a β d glucuronidase activity peak in dry weather conditions detailed investigations in other urban areas and under different environmental conditions are needed to evaluate whether the β d glucuronidase activity could be a general useful trigger for viral contamination sampling the concentration of large water volumes allowed characterizing the full scale removal performance of coagulation flocculation processes for rotavirus and adenovirus but not for norovirus enterovirus and jc virus these results indicate that rotavirus and adenovirus should preferably be selected as reference viruses to quantify the removal of enteric viruses by full scale treatment processes increases in the removal of adenovirus by floc blanket clarification and of adenovirus and rotavirus by ballasted clarification were observed during peak virus concentrations in source water these findings suggest that coagulation flocculation processes do not operate under steady state conditions but dynamic conditions in response to source water conditions limited effectiveness of uv disinfection against naturally occurring adenovirus was observed at current operative doses of 40 mj cm 2 after a combination of ballasted clarification ozonation gac filtration this finding is consistent with results from previous inactivation studies under bench scale conditions more full scale performance demonstrations are needed to quantitatively and reproducibly evaluate virus removal achieved by drinking water treatment plants that may be susceptible to de

19959,this study investigates short term fluctuations in virus concentrations in source water and their removal by full scale drinking water treatment processes under different source water conditions transient peaks in raw water faecal contamination were identified using in situ online β d glucuronidase activity monitoring at two urban drinking water treatment plants during these peaks sequential grab samples were collected at the source and throughout the treatment train to evaluate concentrations of rotavirus adenovirus norovirus enterovirus jc virus reovirus astrovirus and sapovirus by reverse transcription and real time quantitative pcr virus infectivity was assessed through viral culture by measurement of cytopathic effect and integrated cell culture qpcr virus concentrations increased by approximately 0 5 log during two snowmelt rainfall episodes and approximately 1 0 log following a planned wastewater discharge upstream of the drinking water intake and during a β d glucuronidase activity peak in dry weather conditions increases in the removal of adenovirus and rotavirus by coagulation flocculation processes were observed during peak virus concentrations in source water suggesting that these processes do not operate under steady state conditions but dynamic conditions in response to source water conditions rotavirus and enterovirus detected in raw and treated water samples were predominantly negative in viral culture at one site infectious adenoviruses were detected in raw water and water treated by a combination of ballasted clarification ozonation gac filtration and uv disinfection operated at a dose of 40 mj cm 2 the proposed sampling strategy can inform the understanding of the dynamics associated with virus concentrations at drinking water treatment plants susceptible to de facto wastewater reuse graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water enteric viruses β d glucuronidase risk assessment 1 introduction accurate data on the physical removal and inactivation of enteric viruses by engineered water treatment processes is essential to the implementation of risk based preventive approaches to ensure drinking water safety who 2017 virus removal performances are commonly assessed by spiking cultured or isolated virus stocks these performances have been estimated at bench and pilot plant scales by plaque assays hijnen and medema 2010 or quantitative pcr qpcr assays kato et al 2018 shirasaki et al 2017 a limited number of studies also investigated the removal of viruses under full scale operating conditions in drinking water treatment plants dwtps albinana gimenez et al 2009 teunis et al 2009 however these removal performances are usually measured under random raw water quality conditions and little is known about specific removal performances during hydrometeorological events coagulation and flocculation are critical steps defining the efficacy of settling and chemically assisted filtration especially during intermittent changes in raw water quality inadequate floc formation floc breakdown and filter overloading can lead to increased amounts of particles in finished water which can render virus disinfection ineffective hejkal et al 1979 natural organic matter nom concentration in raw water can increase following rainfall events hurst et al 2004 which can interfere with virus flocculation performance nasser et al 1995 furthermore coagulation with hydrolyzing metal salts can perform less well at low water temperature due to lower solubility and slower kinetics of the metal hydroxides driscoll and letterman 1988 kang and cleasby 1995 and poor floc formation hanson and cleasby 1990 morris and knocke 1984 snowmelt episodes associated with high virus concentrations in river water during cold months could thus represent periods of higher viral risks for drinking water consumers sokolova et al 2015 however the identification and characterization of peaks in raw water viral contamination at drinking water intakes remain challenging westrell et al 2006 the automatization of rapid methods for detecting indicators of faecal contamination in surface water koschelnik et al 2015 ryzinska paier et al 2014 is stimulating the development of new strategies to characterize short term variations in raw water contamination at drinking water intakes online near real time monitoring of β d glucuronidase gluc activity has recently been used to measure the frequency duration and amplitude of faecal contamination peaks at an urban dwtp burnet et al 2019b furthermore event based monitoring strategies triggered by gluc activity were recently developed to characterize escherichia coli e coli peaks sylvestre et al 2020a and protozoan pathogens peaks sylvestre et al 2020b at dwtps however it is unclear whether online gluc activity can be used to identify peaks in source water viral contamination this knowledge gap limits the application of online gluc activity monitoring for water safety management and warrants further investigations demeter et al 2020 therefore the main objective of this work is to quantitatively describe short term fluctuations in virus concentrations in source water and their removal by full scale drinking water treatment processes under different source water conditions baseline background conditions and peak conditions during snowmelt periods online β d glucuronidase gluc activity measurements and local meteorological conditions were considered to inform sampling strategies large volumes of raw water 50 2200 l and treated water throughout the treatment train were concentrated to quantify multiple enteric viruses including norovirus rotavirus reovirus sapovirus astrovirus enterovirus adenovirus and a non enteric virus john cunningham jc virus by reverse transcription rt and real time quantitative pcr qpcr virus infectivity of cultivable viruses was also assessed using the cytopathic effect in cell culture and integrated cell culture with qpcr icc qpcr 2 materials and methods 2 1 catchment description sampling campaigns were carried out at two drinking water treatment plants dwtps treating water from the milles iles river in the greater montreal area in quebec canada the river has a length of 40 km an average water discharge of 286 m3 s 1 it is one of the major rivers of the montreal archipelago where the ottawa river meets the saint lawrence river drinking water intakes a and b are located at the middle point and the end of the river respectively locally this river and its tributaries are under the direct influence of a series of small watersheds totalling 1190 km2 there are 184 combined sewer overflows csos outfalls and 14 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps outfalls located in these small watersheds csos discharges can occur intermittently during rainfall or heavy snowmelt events most of these wwtps are using aerated ponds or combined biological and physicochemical treatment processes diffuse pollution sources may also contribute to viral contamination of animal origin in drinking water supplies because river tributaries are draining agricultural lands spring snowmelt freshet usually occurs between february and april in southern quebec and it is the critical period for microbial peaks at drinking water intakes located in this river burnet et al 2019b 2 2

measurements in raw water and local meteorological conditions temperature precipitation gluc activity was used as an indicator of the faecal contamination level an automated rapid monitoring system coliminder vwms gmbh vienna austria was installed at each dwtp in february 1 2 months before significant snowmelt episodes to monitor variations of gluc activity in raw water gluc activity was measured every 1 3 h and was reported online in modified fishman units mmfu 100 ml 1 turbidity levels were measured continuously in raw water and every 4 h in settled water individual filter effluents and combined effluent from all filters at dwtp a the event based sampling strategy was based on meteorological conditions daily rainfall 20 mm or air temperature 5 c over 24 h and gluc activity levels variation 5 mmfu 100 ml 1 over 1 h two events event a1 in february and event a2 in april were captured with this sampling strategy sequential grab raw water samples 110 500 l were collected at a frequency of 4 6 h for around 24 h to obtain a virus concentration profile over time sequential grab samples of settled and filtered waters 300 600 l were collected to match theoretical mean hydraulic residence times through clarification 3 h and filtration 2 h c durivage personal communication samples were not collected under baseline conditions at dwtp b four sampling campaigns were carried out under peak conditions 2 and baseline conditions 2 on february 7 2018 a planned discharge of raw sewage 4 h was undertaken to maintain the main sewer system at a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp located 5 km upstream of dwtp b the wwtp serves a population of 37 000 residents and treats on average 28 000 m3 of raw sewage per day in normal conditions the wastewater is treated using aerated lagoons the impact of this discharge on raw water quality at dwtp b was evaluated using gluc activity to trigger grab sampling of raw water event b1 in march 2018 a rapid increase in gluc activity 20 mmfu 100 ml was observed in dry weather conditions results from event based sampling campaigns at dwtp a in 2017 showed that such variations in gluc activity could indicate short term variations 0 5 log in virus concentrations we thus assumed that this period of high gluc activity represented peak conditions in source water microbial concentrations event b2 even if local meteorological conditions did not suggest a significant impact of rainfall or rapid snowmelt on source water quality sequential grab samples of raw 50 200 l settled 350 520 l filtered 1000 2000 l and uv disinfected 1200 2700 l waters were collected over four days during event b2 baseline conditions were defined as periods of low gluc activity level 20 mmfu 100 ml and dry weather conditions daily rainfall 1 mm and air temperature 5 c over 24 h grab samples of settled filtered and uv disinfected waters were collected under baseline conditions theoretical mean hydraulic residence times throughout clarification 1 5 h filtration and uv disinfection 1 5 h were matched for each raw water sample m marchand personal communication 2 4 virus concentration method an adsorption elution method was applied to concentrate viruses from water samples using electropositive filters nanoceram vs2 5 5 argonide corp sanford fl usa samples were filtered on site at the dwtps under a constant flow rate of 5 15 l min 1 pre filters were not used in this study a decontamination protocol was applied to prevent cross contamination during the repeated use of the filtration system before each use the intake and cartridge housing modules were sterilized with 6 naocl for 30 min rinsed with sterile ddh2o and then dechlorinated with a sodium thiosulfate solution after filtration cartridges were stored and kept cool between 1 and 10 c in a transport cooler and shipped to the university alberta hospital in edmonton ab canada for processing within 48 h after the start of the field sample collection eight samples collected at dwtp b on february 28 2018 could only be processed 96 h after the collection due to shipment delay the elution and flocculation steps after filtration were performed to concentrate the viruses in the samples as previously described pang et al 2012 in brief viruses retained by the positively charged filter were eluted with 1 l of 1 5 beef extract be buffer ph 9 75 the eluate was further flocculated with fecl3 and ph adjustment to 3 5 followed by centrifugation the water concentrate was suspended in glycine buffer 0 5 mol l glycine ph 9 0 with a final volume of 15 ml the ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 2 0 2 the concentrate was stored at 70 c until assayed 2 5 nucleic acid extraction and quantification of enteric viruses by qpcr total nucleic acids were extracted from 200 μl of concentrated water samples and eluted in 50 μl rnase free water using the magazorb total rna prep kit promega wi usa nucleic acid extracts were tested for norovirus genogroup i and gii gi gii rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus generic adenovirus enterovirus jc polyomavirus and reovirus quantification of viruses was performed by a two step reaction rt and qpcr with the abi prism 7500 sequence detection system abi as previously described qiu et al 2015 2016 the primer and probes used for qpcr were published previously pang et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 2018 rt and qpcr were carried out as described previously pang et al 2012 salmon dna was included as an internal control to monitor inhibition an external standard curve was established for quantification of all eight viruses using the 875 bp dna fragment of norovirus gii by 10 fold dilution from 10 to 1 106 genome copies qiu et al 2016 optimization of the panel qpcr assay for the eight viruses was performed by adjusting thermal cycler conditions and concentration of primers and probes to achieve similar qpcr efficiencies based on the standard curves and the cycle threshold values the virus concentration free or encapsidated genomes was expressed as genome copies per litre sample specific recovery rates were not measured but the recovery rates of qpcr based assays were described in a previous study pang et al 2012 the limit of detection lod of qpcr based assays was one genome copy per pcr reaction which was equal to 2 140 genome copies per 100 ml based on each sample s volume and their concentrate volume 2 6 virus cell culture viral replication in cultures was determined by monitoring cytopathic effects cpe infectivity of rotavirus enterovirus adenovirus and reovirus was assessed in each sample using buffalo green monkey kidney cells bgm and african rhesus monkey kidney cells ma104 grown separately on eagle s mem medium sigma on canada as previously described qiu et al 2015 integrated cell culture icc qpcr assay was used to evaluate the presence of infectious virions in the sample as detailed by qiu et al 2015 2 7 quantification of virus concentrations a hierarchical bayesian framework was adopted to evaluate virus concentrations two levels of analysis were specified to describe uncertainties related to the random error in sample collection and the analytical recovery due to losses during sample processing purified virus nucleic acids in each pcr n p were assumed to be poisson distributed with a mean λ p varughese et al 2018 this model assumes that virus nucleic acids are fully disaggregated and randomly distributed in the water i e homogeneous concentration within the time and space from which the sample was collected the virus to genome copy ratio was assumed to be 1 1 the expected analytical recovery of the detection method was assumed to vary randomly among samples according to a beta distribution wu et al 2014 the model can be written as 1 n p i poisson λ p i 2 λ p i v i v s i v p c r i v p i r i 3 r i beta α β where v is the virus concentration v s is the volume of raw of treated water filtered with the nanoceram filter v p c r is the volume for the pcr reaction v p is the volume of the pellet i e concentrated sample for the nucleic acid extraction and r is the expected analytical recovery shape parameters α β of the beta distribution were estimated from recovery rates previously published for adenovirus 41 n 3 mean 0 18 standard deviation std 0 03 and norovirus gii 4 n 3 mean 0 19 std 0 03 spiked and concentrated from 10 l of river water by nanoceram filtration and assayed by real time quantitative rt pcr and pcr pang et al 2012 beta distributions for adenovirus 41 and norovirus gii 4 were used to describe the recovery rates of other dna and rna viruses the bayesian analysis was conducted in r v3 4 1 via rjags v4 6 plummer 2013 the uncertainty in parameter values was evaluated using a markov chain monte carlo procedure four markov chains were run for 104 iterations after a burn in phase of 103 iterations the brooks gelman rubin scale reduction factor was considered to monitor the convergence of the four chains gelman and shirley 2011 a conjugate gamma prior was selected to describe the virus concentration v of the poisson model the shape and rate parameters of the gamma prior were both set to 0 001 this prior reflects practically no prior knowledge the posterior mean of the estimate virus concentration and its 95 credibility interval were reported the r code used to quantify virus concentrations is provided in the supplementary material 2 8 quantification of virus removal treatment removal performances were quantified using an empirical approach point estimates of the log removal lr across a treatment unit paired sample were calculated as follows 4 lr log 10 c i n c o u t where c i n and c o u t are the best estimate virus concentration per sample genome copies l 1 before and after treatment respectively the uncertainty in virus concentrations was not considered in the quantification of lr the limit of detection was considered in the calculation when c o u t was not quantified when multiple grab samples were collected in sequence over an event the mean effective log removal lr effective was calculated as follows 5 lr effective log 10 c i n c o u t each treatment step of the dwtp was assumed to behave as a plug flow reactor operated hydraulically at a steady state the theoretical hydraulic residence time was assumed to be a valid approximation of the retention time of the viruses 3 results 3 1 short term fluctuations in virus concentrations in source water short and long term time series of gluc activity turbidity ammonia and hydrometeorological variables at drinking water intakes a and b are presented in fig 2 and supplementary fig 1 at dwtp a the sampling strategy was triggered by local meteorological conditions and short term gluc activity variations the turbidity level and the river flow rate peaked several days after the gluc activity for the two targeted events supplementary fig 1 rotavirus adenovirus norovirus gii and jc virus were detected in most samples during the two snowmelt events table 1 raw water concentrations peaked at around 104 genome copies l 1 for adenovirus and rotavirus and 103 genome copies l 1 for norovirus gii and jc virus fig 3 a rotavirus and adenovirus concentrations increased by approximately 0 5 and 1 0 log respectively during these 24 h periods the uncertainties related to the random error in sample collection and the analytical error are shown with credible intervals in fig 4 these 95 credibility intervals indicate that the uncertainty on the virus concentration per sample is approximately 0 5 log at dwtp b the sampling strategy to capture peak events in raw water viral contamination was based on increases in gluc activity only local meteorological conditions were not considered to trigger sampling during peak conditions on february 7 raw water gluc activity increased from 20 to 40 mmfu 100 ml 1 about 10 h following the planned wastewater discharge event b1 this peak had a duration of approximately 24 h fig 2b in march the raw water gluc activity gradually increased from 20 to 50 mmfu 100 ml 1 over five days without significant cumulative rainfall 10 mm and cumulative snowmelt 10 cm over the ten days preceding the gluc activity peak event b2 baseline conditions gluc activity level 20 mmfu 100 ml and dry weather conditions were assessed approximately two weeks after event b2 turbidity and ammonia levels did not peak following the planned wastewater discharge and during the gluc activity peak in dry weather conditions supplementary fig 1 concentrations of rotavirus adenovirus norovirus gii and jc virus were about 1 0 log higher during peak event conditions than during baseline conditions fig 3b enterovirus astrovirus and sapovirus were sporadically measured in event based samples raw water concentrations peaked at around 105 genome copies l 1 for adenovirus and rotavirus and 104 genome copies l 1 for norovirus gii and jc virus these concentrations were approximately 1 0 log lower than treated wastewater effluent concentrations and approximately 2 0 log lower than raw sewage concentrations as measured at the upstream wwtp supplementary fig 1 3 2 removal by full scale treatment processes using qpcr data time series of removal of viruses throughout the treatment trains are presented in figs 4 and 5 error bars represent the 95 credibility interval on the concentration due to the analytical error and the random distribution of the genome copies in the sample at both dwtps the concentration of 300 520 l of settled water allowed the quantification of rotavirus and adenovirus 300 genome copies l in all samples norovirus gii was sporadically detected in settled water at dwtp a but not at dwtp b at both dwtps reovirus sapovirus astrovirus and enteroviruses were not detected in any samples collected throughout the treatment train variations in removal performance for rotavirus adenovirus norovirus gi and gii jc virus during baseline and event conditions are presented in supplementary table 1 raw and settled water turbidity levels during sample collection are shown in supplementary table 2 for adenovirus log removals varied from 0 3 to 1 3 log for floc blanket clarification dwtp a and from 1 2 to 1 7 log for ballasted clarification dwtp b for rotavirus and norovirus gii log removals by floc blanket clarification were negligible 0 5 log in contrast log removals by ballasted clarification varied from 0 5 to 1 6 log for rotavirus and from 0 9 to 2 5 log for norovirus gii overall enteric viruses were removed to a higher degree by ballasted clarification than floc blanket clarification results from sequential grab samples show that the coagulation flocculation of viruses did not deteriorate during these snowmelt episodes fig 6 peak concentrations of adenovirus were buffered by coagulation flocculation at both dwtps a buffering effect was also observed for rotavirus and jc virus at dwtp b the concentration of 500 to 2200 l did not allow us to quantify the log removal of enteric viruses by filtration accurately however virus concentrations were sporadically quantified at dwtp a after filtration rotavirus fig 4 and at dwtp b after a combination of ozonation and gac filtration adenovirus and rotavirus and uv disinfection rotavirus fig 5 3 3 inactivation of viruses using cell culture the evaluation of virus infectivity using icc qpcr shows that rotavirus and enterovirus were predominantly negative in viral culture in raw and treated water samples at dwtps a and b table 2 reovirus was mostly positive in raw water samples but not in treated water samples at dwtps a and b at dwtp b infectious adenoviruses were detected in 50 of the raw water samples 4 8 and 33 of the uv disinfected water samples 2 6 4 discussion 4 1 characterization of viral contamination peaks in source water a monitoring strategy triggered by automated online gluc activity measurements and local meteorological conditions was proposed to characterize peaks in raw water viral contamination and their removal by treatment processes this monitoring strategy was designed to provide insights on the amplitude of viral contamination peaks during snowmelt episodes at dwtps located in highly urbanized areas the adequate characterization of these short term fluctuations is important in microbial risk assessment as the long term risk may be driven by the occurrence of pathogen concentration peaks smeets et al 2010 teunis et al 2004 gluc activity was selected to trigger virus sampling because recent technological development enables its automated near real time measurement koschelnik et al 2015 furthermore a high resolution gluc activity monitoring data set was available to study catchment dynamics at dwtp a burnet et al 2019b at dwtp a this sampling strategy allowed the detection of increases of approximately 0 5 log in adenovirus and rotavirus concentrations in raw water following two snowmelt rainfall events short term variations of approximatively 1 0 log in norovirus and adenovirus concentrations were previously reported in wet weather conditions in river water influenced by wastewater discharges hata et al 2014 at dwtp b gluc activity monitoring allowed measuring increases in virus concentrations of approximately 1 0 log following a planned wastewater discharge upstream of the drinking water intake and during a gluc activity peak in dry weather conditions concentrations of viruses in raw water during peak conditions were approximately 1 0 log higher at dwtp b downstream than dwtp a upstream although virus concentrations were not quantified during the same year at dwtp a 2017 and dwtp b 2018 findings from the current study suggest that virus concentrations increased along an urban river influenced by numerous wastewater discharges increases in detection frequency and virus concentrations along rivers were also reported for major urban centers in france prevost et al 2015 and in alberta canada pang et al 2019 in our study the monitoring of virus at a wwtp upstream dwtp b also indicated that peak concentrations in raw water were around 2 0 log lower than virus concentrations in raw sewage and around 1 0 log lower than virus concentrations in treated wastewater effluent aerated lagoons gluc activity and virus concentrations peaked at drinking water intakes following rainfall snowmelt events and dry weather conditions the latter short term trends may reflect faecal contamination transported over long distances and interfering enzymatic activity by non fecal compounds fiksdal and tryland 2008 it has been established that viable but non culturable vbnc e coli can contribute to the gluc activity signal burnet et al 2019a ender et al 2017 garcia armisen et al 2005 stadler et al 2016 and that vbnc e coli decreased much more slowly than culturable e coli servais et al 2009 in our study virus concentrations were quantified using a qpcr method which detects the dna rna from viable and nonviable viruses qualitative results presence or absence of infectious viruses obtained with icc qpcr indicated that adenovirus rotavirus and enterovirus found in samples of source water were mostly not infectious detailed investigations confirming these findings in other areas and under different environmental conditions are needed to determine whether gluc activity is a generally useful trigger for viral contamination sampling online physicochemical measurements or other microbial indicators might be used instead of gluc activity to trigger virus sampling in this study turbidity did not simultaneously peak with virus concentrations during captured events viral contamination during snowmelt and rainfall runoff events may be dominated by point sources cso and wwtp discharges whereas turbidity may come from the whole watershed 4 2 virus type specific removal by full scale treatment processes the concentration of large volumes 50 600 l of raw and settled water allowed characterizing the full scale removal performance of a floc blanket clarifier dwtp a and a ballasted clarifier dwtp b for rotavirus and adenovirus under different source water conditions other enteric viruses were only sporadically detected in settled water suggesting that rotavirus and adenovirus should preferably be selected as reference viruses to quantify the removal of enteric viruses by full scale treatment processes the removal performance of physical treatment processes log removal is commonly assumed to be a first order process with respect to the influent concentration of the virus i e the same fraction of viruses is removed regardless of the influent concentration haas and trussell 1998 however short term increases in the removal performances of coagulation flocculation processes were observed during raw water peak events for adenovirus at dwtp a and for adenovirus and rotavirus at dwtp b these results suggest that coagulation flocculation processes do not operate under steady state conditions but dynamic conditions in response to source water conditions according to the smoluchowski theory of flocculation variations in the influent particle concentrations may influence the aggregation rate of viruses during flocculation while such an evaluation would be interesting this study was not designed to investigate this hypothesis even if large volumes of water 300 2700 l were concentrated the quantification of virus removal performances by chemically assisted filtration and disinfection remained a challenge because of detection limits rotavirus and adenovirus genomes were sporadically detected after filtration ozonation and uv disinfection and infectious adenoviruses were detected after uv disinfection at dwtp b previous studies reported low removal of viruses and bacteriophages by gac filtration at pilot plant scale guy et al 1977 hijnen et al 2010 and high uv resistance of adenovirus at a dose of 40 mj cm 2 meng and gerba 1996 thurston enriquez et al 2003 however a viral ozonation study demonstrated that a ct value of 0 6 mg l 1 min 1 calculated ct value at dwtp b should be sufficient to inactivate adenovirus type 40 by at least 4 0 logs in treated water thurston enriquez et al 2005 the disparity between our results and those of thurston enriquez et al 2005 makes it difficult to conclude on the extent to which full scale ozonation processes may inactivate naturally occurring adenovirus poor mixing and hydraulic conditions have been found to reduce the inactivation of e coli by full scale ozonation processes smeets et al 2006 the hydraulics of the full scale ozonation system assessed in our study may also limit the reduction of adenovirus site specific source water data and full scale removal data incorporated into quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra could be used to evaluate drinking water treatment plant operation and investigate whether adenovirus is removed to an acceptably low level especially if chlorine disinfection is not performed for maintaining a residual 4 3 limitations for the quantification of virus concentrations spatial heterogeneity and aggregation of viruses may have an impact on the quantification log removal during full scale treatment in this study viral genome copies were assumed to be fully disaggregated and thus randomly dispersed in all samples overdispersion was not evaluated because sample replicates were not collected still large volume samples were used for concentrating the viruses in the samples 300 l which should minimize this source of uncertainty owing to the limitations in analytical viral recovery data in the full scale treatment the uncertainty in method recovery performance was incorporated in virus concentration estimates using a beta distribution of recovery rates reported by pang et al 2012 the same laboratory recently reported slightly lower recovery rates human adenovirus 2 4 n 28 mean 0 14 std 0 14 norovirus gii n 10 mean 0 10 std 0 06 for wastewater samples subjected to secondary treatment li et al 2019 monitoring the efficiency of the virus concentration step with a process control could increase the accuracy of virus concentration estimates in raw water during hydrometeorological events hata et al 2014 recovery rates for samples collected after treatment processes may differ from those measured in raw water because of changes in matrix composition however pang et al 2012 did not observe significant differences in recovery rates among pure tap and raw water samples for two rna viruses norovirus and echovirus and one dna virus adenovirus 41 nevertheless the presence of alum and silica sand in settled water may influence analytical recovery efficiencies the presence of viral genomes after ozonation and uv disinfection is challenging to interpret because encapsidated genomes and free nucleic acids can be detected infectious rotaviruses in raw water were usually not detected by icc qpcr unless high concentrations of those viruses were present in raw water 104 genome copies l 1 one of the reasons is that human rotavirus does not propagate efficiently in the continuous in vitro cell lines we used ma104 and bgm arnold et al 2009 ward et al 1984 icc qpcr has limited value to assess the inactivation of viruses in water samples because this method only indicates the absence presence of an infectious virus serial dilutions of wastewater and source water samples have recently been carried out to quantify human infectious virus concentrations by icc qpcr with the most probable number mpn method qiu et al 2018 schijven et al 2019 however the concentrations of naturally occurring viruses throughout full scale drinking water treatment train may be too low for quantification using dilutions considering these limitations the fact that positive infectious adenoviruses were found in treated water after a combination of advanced treatment processes point to the need to develop improved infectious virus detection methods 5 conclusions two full scale drinking water treatment plants in quebec canada were selected to investigate short term fluctuations in virus concentrations in source water and their removal by full scale drinking water treatment processes under different source water conditions the following conclusions are drawn event based sampling targeted by online β d glucuronidase activity monitoring allowed detecting increases in adenovirus and rotavirus concentrations of approximately 0 5 log during two snowmelt rainfall episodes and 1 0 log following a planned wastewater discharge upstream of the drinking water intake and during a β d glucuronidase activity peak in dry weather conditions detailed investigations in other urban areas and under different environmental conditions are needed to evaluate whether the β d glucuronidase activity could be a general useful trigger for viral contamination sampling the concentration of large water volumes allowed characterizing the full scale removal performance of coagulation flocculation processes for rotavirus and adenovirus but not for norovirus enterovirus and jc virus these results indicate that rotavirus and adenovirus should preferably be selected as reference viruses to quantify the removal of enteric viruses by full scale treatment processes increases in the removal of adenovirus by floc blanket clarification and of adenovirus and rotavirus by ballasted clarification were observed during peak virus concentrations in source water these findings suggest that coagulation flocculation processes do not operate under steady state conditions but dynamic conditions in response to source water conditions limited effectiveness of uv disinfection against naturally occurring adenovirus was observed at current operative doses of 40 mj cm 2 after a combination of ballasted clarification ozonation gac filtration this finding is consistent with results from previous inactivation studies under bench scale conditions more full scale performance demonstrations are needed to quantitatively and reproducibly evaluate virus removal achieved by drinking water treatment plants that may be susceptible to de
