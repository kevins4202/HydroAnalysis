8080,study region daheiting reservoir tangshan china study focus based on the recently sprouted high frequency measurement of water temperature an objective identification method for thermal structures is proposed and the optimal thermal threshold of the daheiting reservoir is further determined then this optimal threshold is adopted to identify the temporal and spatial evolutions of thermal structures combined with routine measurements new hydrological insights for the region the optimal thermal threshold of the daheiting reservoir is determined to be 1 5 c m 1 the identification result suggests that the thermal stratification lasted from early may to late october and reached its peak in late july following the rule of three stages the temperature differences between air and each stratified layer are decisive for the development direction of thermal structures and thermocline thickness and average strength could transform into each other during a period ranging from a week to half a month moreover the thermal structure is greatly influenced by the cascade reservoir operations the cold water discharged from the upper reservoir could significantly alter the thermal structures in the tail region of the study reservoir where abnormal thermoclines with extraordinary strength occur in contrast the water supply operation gently weakens the thermal stratification in the head region of the study reservoir by triggering continuous advection near the outlet keywords thermal structure high frequency measurement objective identification thermocline transformation cascade reservoir 1 introduction thermal stratification a perceptual depiction of thermal structure or temperature distribution refers to the uneven variation of water temperature in vertical profiles zhang et al 2014a this stratification is common in reservoirs zhang et al 2021a pu et al 2020 and has a significant impact on water quality and ecology because it influences a wide variety of physical chemical and biological processes scheu et al 2015 xenopoulos and schindler 2001 for example a stratified reservoir always acts to resist the vertical transport of dissolved oxygen leading to an underlying oxygen deficit and further deterioration of water quality branco et al 2009 beutel et al 2007 moreover the cold water released from dams alters the natural downstream thermograph and disrupts the ecological and agricultural rhythm daniels and danner 2020 farmer et al 2015 such effects could even accumulate along with cascade reservoirs zhang et al 2014b therefore identifying the stratified thermal structure and understanding its detailed evolution is necessary to foster the benefits of hydraulic projects and circumvent its negative impacts a number of studies have evaluated the overall thermal structure to study its response to external forces such as air temperature wind and rainfall for this purpose the schmidt index wang et al 2019 2012 winder and schindler 2004 rwcs relative water column stability zhang et al 2021b zhu et al 2013 rtrm relative thermal resistance to mixing pu et al 2020 wetzel and likens 2000 and other global indexes have been widely adopted however different layers within a stratified reservoir have characteristics that are worthy of further study the surface water epilimnion has a well mixed temperature distribution and sufficient air and solar radiation thus becoming the hotspot of phytoplankton and zooplankton studies berger et al 2006 in contrast temperatures at the bottom hypolimnion are low and stable where the contaminant deposited in sediment greatly threatens water quality zhang et al 2021b the thermocline which is observed as a region of sharp changes in temperature separates the epilimnion and the hypolimnion and significantly impacts water movement and vertical substance translocation hachaj and szlapa 2017 at present the gradient criterion is mostly used to identify these thermal layers as it distinguishes a region with a temperature gradient greater than a specific threshold as the thermocline and the remaining two layers are then determined this method is concise and practical but the threshold is given empirically and varies from 0 2 c m 1 yang et al 2020a zhang et al 2014a 1 0 c m 1 hadley et al 2014 wang et al 2012 and 2 0 c m 1 huang et al 2016 coloso et al 2011 with the environment as a result the thermal structure is always subjectively identified because an optimal solution for the threshold determination is rarely found zhang et al 2014a chu and fan 2011 which hinders a detailed understanding of thermal evolution in recent years in situ temperature measurements have been developed from a human powered routine manner to a high frequency pattern driven by automatic sensors liu et al 2019 this trend provides opportunities for the objective identification of thermal structures and the study of their detailed evolution routine observation is typically conducted weekly to monthly but usually covers decades coats et al 2006 therefore it is mainly used to examine the long term changes in thermal structures and to relate these changes to possible driving climatic variables wang et al 2012 winder and schindler 2004 in contrast high frequency observation is characterized by its sampling interval of minutes to hours pu et al 2020 yang et al 2020b wang et al 2019 which can even reach seconds to help researchers understand hydrodynamic processes yang et al 2018 2017 this novel pattern could efficiently accumulate a large amount of reliable data due to its high frequency high resolution and continuous work therefore we could take advantage of this extensive dataset to mine an optimal gradient threshold objectively and further reveal the detailed evolution of thermal structures on an annual or smaller time scale this is of great significance to reservoirs where delicate human operations could lead to short term thermal variations and further deteriorate water quality but it is poorly explored based on high frequency measurements this study aims to develop an objective method to determine the thermal gradient threshold and analyze the detailed spatio temporal evolution of the reservoir thermal structures we conducted both high frequency and routine measurements of water temperature synchronously in the daheiting reservoir an important source of water supply in northern china after determining the optimal threshold by integrating the high frequency dataset with the proposed method the thermal structures were identified and the temporal evolution was analyzed in different thermal layers this threshold also helped to extract the spatial thermal variation from the routine measurement and then we discussed the impact of cascade reservoir operations on thermal structures 2 study site and methods 2 1 study site the daheiting reservoir a large annual storage reservoir on the mainstream of the luanhe river is in the north of qianxi county hebei province china it is an important drinking reservoir that has delivered nearly 35 9 billion m3 of water to tianjin and tangshan in the past 30 years moreover it has multiple benefits such as flood control power generation irrigation and sightseeing having a storage capacity of 337 million m3 and a backwater length of 23 km this is a river reservoir because of its narrow and long topography with a maximum depth of 25 m in front of the dam fig 1 a as a result the daheiting reservoir shows a typical water temperature stratification in summer the daheiting reservoir receives both human regulated and natural water in its upper reaches fig 1 a which complicates its temperature structure this reservoir and the upstream panjiakou reservoir constitute the cascade development reservoirs the panjiakou reservoir is characterized by its pumped storage hydropower station whose lower pool stores low temperature water all year and discharges it to the daheiting reservoir under human operations in the meantime the daheiting reservoir receives water from the sahe river a natural mountain river with a typical annual water temperature and volume variation the water temperature and volume of the panjiakou s lower pool and the sahe river are shown in the appendix as well as the discharge water volume through the outlet of daheiting reservoir 2 2 measurement plan and data both high frequency and routine measurements were carried out to record the summer thermal structure of the daheiting reservoir the high frequency measurement station was located near the river center approximately 500 m in front of the daheiting dam fig 1 a this station adopted a vertical chain consisting of 7 8 temperature and oxygen sensors hobo u26 for continuous measurements these sensors were arranged at equal distances of 3 m and were encrypted in the surface area when the water level was low fig 1 b1 the high frequency measurement lasted from april to november 2019 except for a pause in august during which the sampling interval was 30 min with an accuracy of 0 02 c meanwhile to compensate for the spatial limitation of high frequency measurements full reservoir navigations were carried out by the routine measurements fig 1 b2 that is more than 20 sites on the preset route were measured monthly using a multi parameter water quality measurement instrument ysi exo1 with a precision of 0 01 c the route is shown in fig 1 a having compared several algorithms fig s1 the double cubic interpolation was used to encrypt the high frequency measured temperature profiles to improve the vertical resolution this interpolation adopts 16 data points around the target point to carry out cubic linear interpolation which belongs to the two dimensional interpolation algorithm huang and cao 2020 thus it takes temperature variations in both depth and time into consideration and obtains a relatively reliable encryption result to avoid the interpolation amplifying the local turning feature of the temperature profiles the encryption multiple was determined to be twice by trial calculations 2 3 identification of thermal structures referring to the thermal gradient method it was first calculated that the temperature gradients δ i i 1 2 3 n 1 were of each two adjacent points on the temperature profile with n points furthermore a point was regarded as in the thermocline if it had a gradient greater than the threshold r that is δ i r then several parameters that quantify the thermocline were calculated based on a mathematical profile model and the entire thermal structure could be identified the threshold determination method and thermal profile model are coupled and described as follows 1 objective determination of the thermal threshold fig 2 a1 because thermal stratification is a perceptual description of vertical temperature distributions the thermocline identification aims to distinguish a full region with different variations from the others there are many loose or strict thermal thresholds to distinguish the thermocline but an appropriate identification result should be sufficiently robust over time this result makes sense because it reflects regular variation rather than random noise considering that external forces such as wind light and air temperature that drive thermal structures always have substantial variation within a day we hypothesized that the thermocline evolution is relatively robust above the daily scale which provides a quantitative goal of the thermal threshold determination several trial identifications of thermocline evolution were conducted based on a series of thermal thresholds r j j 1 2 3 m combined with the thermal profile model every trial result was averaged daily to eliminate its intraday fluctuation and both trackability λ and stability χ of the thermocline evolution were introduced to evaluate whether this trial result is robust as fig 2 b shows fitting each averaged trial result with sextic polynomials where the fitting goodness was adopted to quantify the trackability λ j moreover calculating the detrended sequence by subtracting the averaged data from the fitted data and assessing the stability χ j by the standard deviation of the detrended sequence in negative correlations as a result the threshold r j whose trial result showed both the strongest trackability λ j and stability χ j was considered the optimal thermal threshold r 2 mathematical model of the thermal profiles fig 2 a2 the thermal stratification theory generally holds that the hypolimnion temperature is almost constant and the epilimnion temperature is uniformly distributed despiting it could be easily heated by solar radiation liu et al 2019 macintyre et al 1999 therefore both the hypolimnion and epilimnion could be regarded as zero gradient regions in the meantime the thermocline acts as a transition between the two and can be generalized by a linear thermal variation so that the thermal profile can be quantified by a piecewise model as shown in fig 2 c hao et al 2012 wetzel 2001 where h is the water depth moreover the thermocline depth thermocline thickness and thermocline strength were adopted to describe the thermocline features where thermocline depth refers to the depth of the upper thermocline boundary thermocline thickness indicates the difference between the upper and bottom thermocline boundaries liu et al 2019 the maximum and average thermocline strength is the maximum and mean thermal gradient of the entire thermocline respectively to solve this profile model thermocline points determined by the thermal threshold r j were regressed linearly where the regression slope was calculated as the average thermocline strength r and the maximum of gradient data δ i max i 1 2 3 n 1 was selected as the maximum strength r m then the average temperatures of the epilimnion and hypolimnion were calculated t 1 and t 2 which intersected with the regression line the intersections are h 1 and h 2 and determined the upper and lower thermocline boundaries respectively therefore the h 1 indicated the thermocline depth and the difference between h 2 and h 1 was the thermocline thickness h in this way this model balances the thermocline position depth and thickness and strength average and maximum strength parameters in the meantime the authenticity of the original data is retained because no smoothing process is further needed as a result this model is suitable for batch calculation of large and high frequency measured data 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of thermal threshold 3 1 1 threshold determination of the daheiting reservoir based on the high frequency measured data trial thresholds from 0 2 to 2 0 c m 1 were used to identify thermal structures at a step of 0 2 c m 1 and the thermocline evolution was mainly analyzed in the profile model the thermocline thickness was lastly calculated which accumulated errors of other parameters therefore the daily averaged thermocline thickness was adopted to analyze the trackability and stability of thermocline variations as shown in fig 3 a the results indicate that the threshold selection has a significant and regular influence on the thermocline identification result and r 1 5 c m 1 is the optimal threshold of the daheiting reservoir because this threshold reaches the most stable and trackable result moreover the thermocline thickness variation calculated by this optimal threshold is shown in fig 3 b which suggests that the proposed method for thermal structure identification could determine the optimal threshold objectively and then extract thermocline evolutions reasonably there is little difference between the daily averaged identification results processed by the arithmetic average and the running average fig 3 a that is the threshold determination result is not changed by the average method and the proposed hypothesis of a stable thermocline evolution over the daily scale is efficient considering that the thermal structure evolution can be decomposed into different time scale processes this hypothesis essentially assumes that thermal variations below the daily scale are noise with strong randomness compared with the measurement span of six months however the daily averaging process could eliminate this noise and obtain a stable sequence which acts as a frequency filter the reciprocal of the average window measurement interval and measurement span are denoted as the cut off frequency f c the measurement frequency f m and the span frequency f s respectively among them the f m and the f s indicate the minimum and the maximum time scale that could be captured in field measurements respectively averaging the measurement data at the frequency f c to eliminate noise does not mean that the original high frequency measurement is not necessary since f c is lower than f m on the contrary the data averaging process has reduced the randomness and uncertainty from the environment and resulted in a stable sequence at f c which is a significant advantage of high frequency measurements it is noteworthy that the time scale of noise judgment is relative and depends on the research goal for example the stable sequence considered here might be regarded as noise when the response of thermal evolution to climate changes has been studied over several decades 3 1 2 influence of measurement frequency on threshold determination to compare threshold determinations under different measurement frequencies or sampling intervals the original measured data were isometrically reduced in frequency to simulate scenarios from high frequency to routine measurements fig 4 if the sampling interval of the frequency reduced data was still less than 24 h the reduced frequency was denoted as f m i e f m f c and the daily arithmetic average was carried out before the trackability and stability were calculated as above the calculation results in such cases are shown in fig 4 a b when the sampling interval was 0 5 8 0 h the calculated trackability and stability based on different intervals were similar and the optimal threshold of 1 5 c m 1 could be easily selected however when the sampling interval increased to 12 24 h there were larger differences in the calculated indexes between those datasets and the variation of the two indexes to the trial threshold was growing less smooth or regular the optimal threshold could be determined by searching the peak of the calculated indexes in contrast if the frequency reduced data had a sampling interval exceeding 24 h the reduced frequency was denoted as f m i e f m f c when the daily average was not needed and the result is shown in fig 4 c at this time the difference of calculated indexes between different datasets further increased and multiple local extrema replaced the global one moreover the trackability and stability once indicated different extrema so it was difficult to determine the optimal threshold a total of ten scenarios with sampling intervals ranging from 0 5 h to 2 0 d determined the optimal threshold as 1 5 c m 1 the remaining three scenarios with intervals of no less than 4 0 d were either failed to select the optimal threshold or determined it as 1 4 c m 1 which should be attributed to the confusion of extremum determination since the thresholds of 1 4 c m 1 and 1 5 c m 1 had approximate values of trackability and stability therefore the proposed method has relatively strong robustness in determining the optimal threshold when the sampling interval is shortened the calculated variations of trackability and stability with trial thresholds generally approach two smooth curves and in order to determine the optimal threshold through these curves the sampling interval is recommended to be no more than 8 0 h and never exceeds 24 h to sum up high frequency measurements can capture multi scale thermal changes and then obtain more representative daily averaged data as well as more regular curves of thermocline evolution indexes with trial thresholds this measurement pattern provides a new approach for the objective determination of the optimal threshold by mining its massive measured data however there is no distinct boundary between high frequency and routine measurements and these two patterns are mainly characterized by their working mode the routine pattern driven by humans makes it difficult to carry out temperature measurements with a sampling interval of less than 8 0 h but it has the advantages of flexible schemes and long historical data which can verify and complement the high frequency measured dataset 3 1 3 influence of measurement environment on threshold determination the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic processes differ greatly between different aquatic environments leading to a remarkably varied optimal threshold among them at present most studies determined this threshold empirically and some representative studies are shown in table 1 where the optimal thresholds of 0 2 1 0 and 2 0 c m 1 are widely adopted the thresholds of 1 0 and 2 0 c m 1 also achieve acceptable and similar identification results in the daheiting reservoir but are inferior to the optimal value of 1 5 c m 1 fig 3 a therefore the objectively determined threshold in this study is compatible with the subjective determinations in relevant researches furthermore the influence of the measurement environment on the optimal threshold determination was analyzed by literature investigations as shown in fig 5 the determined optimal threshold has a good negative correlation with the water surface area and maximum water depth but a weak positive correlation with the environmental latitude large volume water generally has stronger resistance to external forces so it is more difficult to change its stratified thermal state and its thermal gradient has minor variations therefore their optimal threshold is relatively small however the empirically determined thresholds are usually clustered by the researchers nationality rather than the study environment in china an industrial standard recommended a thermal threshold of 0 2 c m 1 for oceans with a depth of less than 200 m in 1991 hao et al 2012 which was subsequently adopted in many inland freshwater environments in china moreover in canada and some european countries earlier studies suggested a thermal threshold of 1 0 c m 1 birge 1897 which was also widely used in later researches on lakes in those nations mironov 2008 referring to the criterion values of previous studies in this region is an efficient method to determine the threshold but it should also be noted that there are distinct differences between the environmental characteristics of different lakes and reservoirs which could be addressed by an objective determination of the optimal threshold 3 2 temporal evolution of thermal structures 3 2 1 identification results based on high frequency measurements the determined optimal threshold was adopted to extract temporal variations in thermal structures at 30 min intervals from the high frequency measurement data the thermocline parameters such as depth thickness average strength and maximum strength are shown in fig 6 the thermocline mostly existed in the middle and upper area of the reservoir while occupied the surface area in late july fig 6 a in addition to the periods of formation and weakening the thermocline thickness fluctuated greatly but its mean value was relatively stable without a significant maximum fig 6 b there was a significant positive correlation between the average and maximum thermocline strength with the pearson correlation coefficient of 0 904 these two strengths were highly coincidental in the overlap periods and reached their maximum in late july fig 6 c the thermal structure of the daheiting reservoir was generally in a positive stratification state with a single thermocline from early may to late october considering all parameters the thermocline evolution reached its peak in late july the thermocline was thin but strong before the peak while it was thick and mild thereafter moreover it is noteworthy that the thermocline evolution discussed in this research is aimed at the summer thermal stratification many relevant studies such as liu et al 2019 agree to divide the thermocline evolution into three stages but specific and universal dividing standards were rarely given in this study we examine the presence of thermocline within each day if the thermocline is detected at least once in one day the thermal stratification is regarded as existing on that day in addition if the thermocline is identified in all profiles in one day the stratification is considered mature on that day the formation period is defined from the day that the stratification first exists to the day that the stratification first matures conversely the weakening period is defined from the day that the stratification last matures to the day that the stratification last exists moreover the time between the formation and weakening periods is regarded as the stationary period as shown in fig 6 d the occurrence probability of the thermocline was relatively low near 0 and 12 o clock during the formation period while it was low in the daytime during the weakening period however thermocline parameters such as thickness and average strength had no noticeable intraday variations and the characteristics of thermocline evolution during each period are shown in table 2 3 2 2 characteristic temporal scales of thermal variations based on the identification results above the average temperatures of each layer were calculated and adopted to investigate the temporal scale of thermal variations as shown in fig 7 a because the overall variation of epilimnion and thermocline temperature lagged behind that of the air temperature the correlation coefficient between air and water temperature was not as large as that of water temperature in different stratified layers fig 7 a1 however there was good diurnal accordance of the epilimnion temperature to the air temperature as shown in fig 7 a2 the smoothed air temperature and epilimnion temperature intersected near the evolution peak of the thermal structures fig 6 c indicating that the temperature difference between air and surface water determines the development direction of thermal structures moreover the smoothed air and mean thermocline temperature intersected near the beginning of the weakening period fig 6 a after which the thermocline temperature quickly approached that of the epilimnion when the stratification ended the thermocline temperature met the epilimnion but was still significantly higher than that of the hypolimnion suggesting that more time is needed for the reservoir to form a uniform thermal structure after the stratification ends it is noteworthy that the mean thermocline temperature had a good correlation but a stronger fluctuation with the epilimnion temperature therefore the thermocline does not just passively change under the constraints of the epilimnion and hypolimnion but has its specific variation scales that need to be further discussed based on its characteristic parameters furthermore the average temperatures of the air and each stratified layer were transformed to the frequency domain using the fast fourier transform as shown in fig 7 b both the air and epilimnion temperature have prominent peaks around the frequency of f c 1 d 1 that is they exhibited significant periodic variations on a daily scale the hypolimnion temperature shows small amplitudes without a pronounced peak indicating that it was relatively constant and had no prominent variation frequency higher than the measurement span frequency f s in contrast a weak peak is identified near f c 1 d 1 for the mean thermocline temperature however it is difficult to judge diurnal or other variation scales because of the strong fluctuation of those spectral signals that may be resulted from wind rainfall and other disturbance zhang et al 2020 therefore further analysis based on thermocline parameters is required 3 2 3 characteristic temporal modes of thermocline evolutions to explore the indistinguishable evolution scale of the thermocline the parameters of thickness h and average strength r were adopted for analysis all calculated thickness and average strength data points are plotted in fig 8 a which shows negative correlations during periods of time the data density analysis in fig 8 b indicates that the thickness is concentrated in the range of 4 0 8 5 m while the average strength is mainly distributed from 1 5 to 3 5 c m 1 and they are also negatively correlated in the variation hotspot therefore we fitted these two parameters in the negative relationship of h a r 1 b within different periods where a and b are both fitting coefficients as shown in fig 8 c d there are six periods that fitted the relationship well whose goodness of fit are all greater than 0 750 and the highest is 0 899 moreover the variation of their fitting coefficient a is similar to the annual evolution of the mean thermocline temperature fig 7 a3 the durations of these six fitted periods are 8 5 9 0 10 1 10 5 8 8 and 18 2 days respectively indicating that the thermocline thickness and average strength can transform into each other within a week to half a month but follow the annual rules in table 2 over a longer period according to the thermal profile model the thermocline thickness h and the average strength r obey the relationship of h r t 1 t 2 where t 1 and t 2 are the epilimnion and hypolimnion temperature respectively and their difference is δt this equation can be rewritten as h δt r 1 and comparing it with the fitting formula above it can be found that the fitting process essentially assumes that the temperature difference between the epilimnion and hypolimnion δt is constant during the selected fitting period furthermore the fitting coefficient a quantifies the temperature difference δt and coefficient b compensates for the actual fluctuation of this difference in other words the essence of the transformation of thermocline parameters within a short period is the dynamic distribution of thermal energy under a specific temperature difference constraint therefore the driving force of this phenomenon should be found from hydrodynamic factors many studies have emphasized that wind plays an important role in the thermocline evolution fernández et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 georgiy 2010 sundaram and rehm 1971 proposed that the formation and maintenance of the thermocline can be explained in terms of the nonlinear interaction between wind induced turbulence and stable thermal gradients providing a basis for us to analyze the dynamic phenomenon of the thermocline the transformation of thermocline parameters could be attributed to the internal wave a common hydrodynamic phenomenon in stratified water when external forces such as wind act on water environments with narrow and long topography such as the daheiting reservoir the surface water is pushed to the leeward area leading to a thermocline inclination in this region when the external force weakens the thermocline vibrates near its equilibrium position resulting in reservoir scale internal waves moreover if this internal wave degenerates unstably into a sub reservoir scale shear flow is likely to occur in the thermocline area and promote the vertical mixing of stratified water boegman and ivey 2012 pannard et al 2011 the flume internal wave experiment results of chen et al 2007 are shown in fig 8 f which indicates that the internal wave increases the thermocline thickness but weakens the strength under the constraint of a particular density difference the period of the internal wave in a reservoir scale always varies from a few hours to several days so the characteristic temporal scale of thermocline evolution is difficult to determine by the spectral analysis like fig 7 b in summary the thermocline evolution is hydrodynamically driven in short periods of a week to half a month when the thermocline thickness and strength transform into each other but is mainly driven by external thermal variations in the monthly to annual period as illustrated in fig 8 e 3 3 spatial evolution of thermal structures 3 3 1 identification results based on routine measurements the optimal threshold determined from the high frequency dataset was also applied to the routine measurement data and the thermocline thickness h and average strength r were adopted to explore the spatial evolution of thermal structures as fig 9 shows the thermocline evolution in the entire reservoir meets the three temporal stages of formation stationary and weakening periods in table 2 taking the water depth local terrain human interference and other factors into consideration the daheiting reservoir area is divided into three regions tail middle and head as shown in fig 9 the tail region has a typical river feature of a narrow and shallow channel while the middle and head regions show a gradually enhanced characteristic of lakes and reservoirs because its channel broadens and the depth increases the tail and head regions are more interfered with human activities while the middle region is less disturbed it was found that the thermocline first appeared in the tail and middle regions of the reservoir and then developed towards the head region but the thermocline parameters had no distinct correlation between their spatial distributions except for july 25 when the thermocline was at its strongest state the thermocline did not exist all over the reservoir but it was more likely to be identified in areas with broader river channels and larger water depths moreover abnormal thermoclines with small thickness but extraordinary strength up to 30 c m 1 were detected in the tail region of the reservoir on june 27 and september 17 such magnitude of thermocline strength is far from the records of other regions of the daheiting reservoir and other water environments hadley et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a coloso et al 2011 but is close to the anthropogenic thermocline in the laboratory gao et al 2019 considering that daheiting is the adverse regulating reservoir of the panjiakou the identified spatial evolution of thermal structures is mostly discussed in terms of their joint operations 3 3 2 impact of panjiakou s water discharge on thermal structures both the low temperature water of the panjiakou reservoir and natural temperature water of the sahe river enter the daheiting reservoir from its tail region as shown in fig 10 a the flow volume from panjiakou s lower pool is always significantly greater than that from the sahe river during the non flood seasons fig s2 thus the thermal structures of the daheiting reservoir are inevitably impacted by low temperature water according to the volume dominance of the two water sources the routine measurement data were divided into cold water and temperate water affected groups and thermal structures within 20 km from the lower pool were analyzed as shown in fig 10 b taking the cold water affected group of june 27 for analysis when a sizeable cold flow of 155 2 m3 s 1 close to the maximum inflow of 163 m3 s 1 in 2019 was discharged into the daheiting reservoir uniform low temperature profiles without thermoclines were measured within 7 41 km from the lower pool fig 10 b1 then the low temperature flow dived and diffused due to gravity terrain and solar radiation at 9 24 and 11 0 km away from the lower pool where outlier thermoclines with extreme strength but thin thickness were identified in fig 9 finally the discharged cold flow was blended with the reservoir until 14 9 km from the lower pool and thermal structures remained almost unchanged within a later range the same trend holds in another cold water affected group with a volume of 88 96 m3 s 1 cold water entered the daheiting reservoir on september 17 as fig 10 b2 shows there was a uniform low temperature profile 1 88 km away from the lower pool and no significant difference existed between thermal structures after 11 0 km from the lower pool in contrast when the inflow was dominated by the temperate water like the two investigations on july 25 and august 15 in fig 10 b3 there were no significant differences in value or shape among all thermal profiles measured in the tail and middle regions therefore the thermal structures at the tail region undergo significant changes when the lower pool discharges cold water the tail to the middle region is first characterized by uniform low temperature profiles without a thermocline then extraordinary thermoclines with great strength but small thickness occur and finally transit to natural thermoclines in a relatively stable shape the spatial range of these changes is determined by the discharge water volume and temperature in this study this range is directly measured as 11 0 14 9 km which is the tail region of the reservoir moreover numerical simulations by liang et al 2012 and zhang et al 2014 verified the cumulative effect of the water temperature along with cascade reservoirs they found that the discharged cold water always weakens the thermal structures of the entire downstream reservoir and further promotes an isothermal effect between different reservoirs in other words the relatively stable thermal structures in the middle and head regions are inconspicuously weakened by the discharged cold water which is a global impact beyond the directly measured range 3 3 3 impact of daheiting s water supply on thermal structures the daheiting reservoir supplies water to tianjin tangshan and its downstream channel through the outlet near the right bank as shown in fig 10 a therefore the routine measurement data was divided into the low flow medium flow and high flow groups based on the supply flow rate then the impact of the water supply conditions of daheiting on its thermal structures was explored because there was no significant spatial correlation between the thermocline parameters the product of the thermocline thickness h and average strength r was adopted to quantify the thermocline evolution the identified thermoclines within 10 km from the outlet were statistically analyzed in fig 10 c suggesting regions near the outlet had a stronger thermocline than other areas in the low flow supply condition but it was suppressed with the increase in supplying water flow when the daheiting reservoir supplied water at 40 2 m3 s 1 there was no significant difference between the thermoclines near the outlet and those in the middle region however the thermal stratification near the outlet lagged in comparison to that of the middle region at a supply rate of no less than 87 5 m3 s 1 the area near the dam is more prone to be thermally stratified due to its greater water depths and lower flow rates but reservoir operations such as water supply can suppress and even adverse this trend by enhancing the local hydrodynamics of the head region gao et al 2019 the daheiting reservoir whose main task is supplying water has a relatively rough and stable drainage process the advection caused by its operations is continuous compared with the internal wave triggered by wind stress therefore the water supply operation can suppress the thermocline development rather than simply drive thermocline transformations in its parameters however for reservoirs that undertake important power generation tasks such as the china three gorges and the xiluodu project delicate operations are likely to cause water hammers and further trigger internal waves in the reservoir ji et al 2021 boegman et al 2012 the area with a weakened thermal structure due to the water supply operation is related to the thermal state water supply flow rate and water discharge mode the daheiting reservoir discharges water through its middle hole which affects an area approximately 5 km away from the outlet in the high flow condition namely the head region in summary comparing with the direct impact of panjiakou s discharged cold water daheiting s water supply condition inhibits thermal stratification within a more limited area and in a gentler way which is more favorable to the aquatic environment and should be given priority when regulating water quality by reservoir operations 4 conclusion both high frequency and routine measurements of water temperature were conducted in the daheiting reservoir and an objective identification method for thermal structures was proposed in this study trial calculations indicate that the thermal threshold significantly impacts the identification result of thermal stratifications the optimal threshold could be selected based on high frequency data with a recommended sampling interval of shorter than 8 0 h the optimal thermal threshold is objectively determined to be 1 5 c m 1 for the daheitng reservoir which has good compatibility with imperially determined thresholds in related studies and shows strong robustness to the data sampling frequency based on the high frequency measurements it is identified that the thermocline of the daheiting reservoir lasted from early may to late october and peaked in late july moreover by integrally considering the variation of thermocline parameters the temporal evolution of thermal structures could be divided into three stages formation stationary and weakening period the temperature differences between air and each stratified layer are decisive for the evolution stage of the thermal structures the epilimnion temperature has significant daily variations but the hypolimnion has no evident small temporal scale in temperature driven by hydrodynamic events such as internal waves the thermocline thickness and average strength could transform into each other within a short time of a week to half a month based on the routine measurements the spatial evolution of the thermal structures is identified and the suppression impact of cascade reservoir operations on thermocline is analyzed when a large amount of cold water flows into the daheiting reservoir from the panjiakou s lower pool it successively occurs that the spatial variation of no thermocline extraordinary thermoclines and natural thermoclines this phenomenon mainly emerges within 11 0 14 9 km from the panjiakou s lower pool on the other hand daheiting s water supplying operations lead to continuous

8080,study region daheiting reservoir tangshan china study focus based on the recently sprouted high frequency measurement of water temperature an objective identification method for thermal structures is proposed and the optimal thermal threshold of the daheiting reservoir is further determined then this optimal threshold is adopted to identify the temporal and spatial evolutions of thermal structures combined with routine measurements new hydrological insights for the region the optimal thermal threshold of the daheiting reservoir is determined to be 1 5 c m 1 the identification result suggests that the thermal stratification lasted from early may to late october and reached its peak in late july following the rule of three stages the temperature differences between air and each stratified layer are decisive for the development direction of thermal structures and thermocline thickness and average strength could transform into each other during a period ranging from a week to half a month moreover the thermal structure is greatly influenced by the cascade reservoir operations the cold water discharged from the upper reservoir could significantly alter the thermal structures in the tail region of the study reservoir where abnormal thermoclines with extraordinary strength occur in contrast the water supply operation gently weakens the thermal stratification in the head region of the study reservoir by triggering continuous advection near the outlet keywords thermal structure high frequency measurement objective identification thermocline transformation cascade reservoir 1 introduction thermal stratification a perceptual depiction of thermal structure or temperature distribution refers to the uneven variation of water temperature in vertical profiles zhang et al 2014a this stratification is common in reservoirs zhang et al 2021a pu et al 2020 and has a significant impact on water quality and ecology because it influences a wide variety of physical chemical and biological processes scheu et al 2015 xenopoulos and schindler 2001 for example a stratified reservoir always acts to resist the vertical transport of dissolved oxygen leading to an underlying oxygen deficit and further deterioration of water quality branco et al 2009 beutel et al 2007 moreover the cold water released from dams alters the natural downstream thermograph and disrupts the ecological and agricultural rhythm daniels and danner 2020 farmer et al 2015 such effects could even accumulate along with cascade reservoirs zhang et al 2014b therefore identifying the stratified thermal structure and understanding its detailed evolution is necessary to foster the benefits of hydraulic projects and circumvent its negative impacts a number of studies have evaluated the overall thermal structure to study its response to external forces such as air temperature wind and rainfall for this purpose the schmidt index wang et al 2019 2012 winder and schindler 2004 rwcs relative water column stability zhang et al 2021b zhu et al 2013 rtrm relative thermal resistance to mixing pu et al 2020 wetzel and likens 2000 and other global indexes have been widely adopted however different layers within a stratified reservoir have characteristics that are worthy of further study the surface water epilimnion has a well mixed temperature distribution and sufficient air and solar radiation thus becoming the hotspot of phytoplankton and zooplankton studies berger et al 2006 in contrast temperatures at the bottom hypolimnion are low and stable where the contaminant deposited in sediment greatly threatens water quality zhang et al 2021b the thermocline which is observed as a region of sharp changes in temperature separates the epilimnion and the hypolimnion and significantly impacts water movement and vertical substance translocation hachaj and szlapa 2017 at present the gradient criterion is mostly used to identify these thermal layers as it distinguishes a region with a temperature gradient greater than a specific threshold as the thermocline and the remaining two layers are then determined this method is concise and practical but the threshold is given empirically and varies from 0 2 c m 1 yang et al 2020a zhang et al 2014a 1 0 c m 1 hadley et al 2014 wang et al 2012 and 2 0 c m 1 huang et al 2016 coloso et al 2011 with the environment as a result the thermal structure is always subjectively identified because an optimal solution for the threshold determination is rarely found zhang et al 2014a chu and fan 2011 which hinders a detailed understanding of thermal evolution in recent years in situ temperature measurements have been developed from a human powered routine manner to a high frequency pattern driven by automatic sensors liu et al 2019 this trend provides opportunities for the objective identification of thermal structures and the study of their detailed evolution routine observation is typically conducted weekly to monthly but usually covers decades coats et al 2006 therefore it is mainly used to examine the long term changes in thermal structures and to relate these changes to possible driving climatic variables wang et al 2012 winder and schindler 2004 in contrast high frequency observation is characterized by its sampling interval of minutes to hours pu et al 2020 yang et al 2020b wang et al 2019 which can even reach seconds to help researchers understand hydrodynamic processes yang et al 2018 2017 this novel pattern could efficiently accumulate a large amount of reliable data due to its high frequency high resolution and continuous work therefore we could take advantage of this extensive dataset to mine an optimal gradient threshold objectively and further reveal the detailed evolution of thermal structures on an annual or smaller time scale this is of great significance to reservoirs where delicate human operations could lead to short term thermal variations and further deteriorate water quality but it is poorly explored based on high frequency measurements this study aims to develop an objective method to determine the thermal gradient threshold and analyze the detailed spatio temporal evolution of the reservoir thermal structures we conducted both high frequency and routine measurements of water temperature synchronously in the daheiting reservoir an important source of water supply in northern china after determining the optimal threshold by integrating the high frequency dataset with the proposed method the thermal structures were identified and the temporal evolution was analyzed in different thermal layers this threshold also helped to extract the spatial thermal variation from the routine measurement and then we discussed the impact of cascade reservoir operations on thermal structures 2 study site and methods 2 1 study site the daheiting reservoir a large annual storage reservoir on the mainstream of the luanhe river is in the north of qianxi county hebei province china it is an important drinking reservoir that has delivered nearly 35 9 billion m3 of water to tianjin and tangshan in the past 30 years moreover it has multiple benefits such as flood control power generation irrigation and sightseeing having a storage capacity of 337 million m3 and a backwater length of 23 km this is a river reservoir because of its narrow and long topography with a maximum depth of 25 m in front of the dam fig 1 a as a result the daheiting reservoir shows a typical water temperature stratification in summer the daheiting reservoir receives both human regulated and natural water in its upper reaches fig 1 a which complicates its temperature structure this reservoir and the upstream panjiakou reservoir constitute the cascade development reservoirs the panjiakou reservoir is characterized by its pumped storage hydropower station whose lower pool stores low temperature water all year and discharges it to the daheiting reservoir under human operations in the meantime the daheiting reservoir receives water from the sahe river a natural mountain river with a typical annual water temperature and volume variation the water temperature and volume of the panjiakou s lower pool and the sahe river are shown in the appendix as well as the discharge water volume through the outlet of daheiting reservoir 2 2 measurement plan and data both high frequency and routine measurements were carried out to record the summer thermal structure of the daheiting reservoir the high frequency measurement station was located near the river center approximately 500 m in front of the daheiting dam fig 1 a this station adopted a vertical chain consisting of 7 8 temperature and oxygen sensors hobo u26 for continuous measurements these sensors were arranged at equal distances of 3 m and were encrypted in the surface area when the water level was low fig 1 b1 the high frequency measurement lasted from april to november 2019 except for a pause in august during which the sampling interval was 30 min with an accuracy of 0 02 c meanwhile to compensate for the spatial limitation of high frequency measurements full reservoir navigations were carried out by the routine measurements fig 1 b2 that is more than 20 sites on the preset route were measured monthly using a multi parameter water quality measurement instrument ysi exo1 with a precision of 0 01 c the route is shown in fig 1 a having compared several algorithms fig s1 the double cubic interpolation was used to encrypt the high frequency measured temperature profiles to improve the vertical resolution this interpolation adopts 16 data points around the target point to carry out cubic linear interpolation which belongs to the two dimensional interpolation algorithm huang and cao 2020 thus it takes temperature variations in both depth and time into consideration and obtains a relatively reliable encryption result to avoid the interpolation amplifying the local turning feature of the temperature profiles the encryption multiple was determined to be twice by trial calculations 2 3 identification of thermal structures referring to the thermal gradient method it was first calculated that the temperature gradients δ i i 1 2 3 n 1 were of each two adjacent points on the temperature profile with n points furthermore a point was regarded as in the thermocline if it had a gradient greater than the threshold r that is δ i r then several parameters that quantify the thermocline were calculated based on a mathematical profile model and the entire thermal structure could be identified the threshold determination method and thermal profile model are coupled and described as follows 1 objective determination of the thermal threshold fig 2 a1 because thermal stratification is a perceptual description of vertical temperature distributions the thermocline identification aims to distinguish a full region with different variations from the others there are many loose or strict thermal thresholds to distinguish the thermocline but an appropriate identification result should be sufficiently robust over time this result makes sense because it reflects regular variation rather than random noise considering that external forces such as wind light and air temperature that drive thermal structures always have substantial variation within a day we hypothesized that the thermocline evolution is relatively robust above the daily scale which provides a quantitative goal of the thermal threshold determination several trial identifications of thermocline evolution were conducted based on a series of thermal thresholds r j j 1 2 3 m combined with the thermal profile model every trial result was averaged daily to eliminate its intraday fluctuation and both trackability λ and stability χ of the thermocline evolution were introduced to evaluate whether this trial result is robust as fig 2 b shows fitting each averaged trial result with sextic polynomials where the fitting goodness was adopted to quantify the trackability λ j moreover calculating the detrended sequence by subtracting the averaged data from the fitted data and assessing the stability χ j by the standard deviation of the detrended sequence in negative correlations as a result the threshold r j whose trial result showed both the strongest trackability λ j and stability χ j was considered the optimal thermal threshold r 2 mathematical model of the thermal profiles fig 2 a2 the thermal stratification theory generally holds that the hypolimnion temperature is almost constant and the epilimnion temperature is uniformly distributed despiting it could be easily heated by solar radiation liu et al 2019 macintyre et al 1999 therefore both the hypolimnion and epilimnion could be regarded as zero gradient regions in the meantime the thermocline acts as a transition between the two and can be generalized by a linear thermal variation so that the thermal profile can be quantified by a piecewise model as shown in fig 2 c hao et al 2012 wetzel 2001 where h is the water depth moreover the thermocline depth thermocline thickness and thermocline strength were adopted to describe the thermocline features where thermocline depth refers to the depth of the upper thermocline boundary thermocline thickness indicates the difference between the upper and bottom thermocline boundaries liu et al 2019 the maximum and average thermocline strength is the maximum and mean thermal gradient of the entire thermocline respectively to solve this profile model thermocline points determined by the thermal threshold r j were regressed linearly where the regression slope was calculated as the average thermocline strength r and the maximum of gradient data δ i max i 1 2 3 n 1 was selected as the maximum strength r m then the average temperatures of the epilimnion and hypolimnion were calculated t 1 and t 2 which intersected with the regression line the intersections are h 1 and h 2 and determined the upper and lower thermocline boundaries respectively therefore the h 1 indicated the thermocline depth and the difference between h 2 and h 1 was the thermocline thickness h in this way this model balances the thermocline position depth and thickness and strength average and maximum strength parameters in the meantime the authenticity of the original data is retained because no smoothing process is further needed as a result this model is suitable for batch calculation of large and high frequency measured data 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of thermal threshold 3 1 1 threshold determination of the daheiting reservoir based on the high frequency measured data trial thresholds from 0 2 to 2 0 c m 1 were used to identify thermal structures at a step of 0 2 c m 1 and the thermocline evolution was mainly analyzed in the profile model the thermocline thickness was lastly calculated which accumulated errors of other parameters therefore the daily averaged thermocline thickness was adopted to analyze the trackability and stability of thermocline variations as shown in fig 3 a the results indicate that the threshold selection has a significant and regular influence on the thermocline identification result and r 1 5 c m 1 is the optimal threshold of the daheiting reservoir because this threshold reaches the most stable and trackable result moreover the thermocline thickness variation calculated by this optimal threshold is shown in fig 3 b which suggests that the proposed method for thermal structure identification could determine the optimal threshold objectively and then extract thermocline evolutions reasonably there is little difference between the daily averaged identification results processed by the arithmetic average and the running average fig 3 a that is the threshold determination result is not changed by the average method and the proposed hypothesis of a stable thermocline evolution over the daily scale is efficient considering that the thermal structure evolution can be decomposed into different time scale processes this hypothesis essentially assumes that thermal variations below the daily scale are noise with strong randomness compared with the measurement span of six months however the daily averaging process could eliminate this noise and obtain a stable sequence which acts as a frequency filter the reciprocal of the average window measurement interval and measurement span are denoted as the cut off frequency f c the measurement frequency f m and the span frequency f s respectively among them the f m and the f s indicate the minimum and the maximum time scale that could be captured in field measurements respectively averaging the measurement data at the frequency f c to eliminate noise does not mean that the original high frequency measurement is not necessary since f c is lower than f m on the contrary the data averaging process has reduced the randomness and uncertainty from the environment and resulted in a stable sequence at f c which is a significant advantage of high frequency measurements it is noteworthy that the time scale of noise judgment is relative and depends on the research goal for example the stable sequence considered here might be regarded as noise when the response of thermal evolution to climate changes has been studied over several decades 3 1 2 influence of measurement frequency on threshold determination to compare threshold determinations under different measurement frequencies or sampling intervals the original measured data were isometrically reduced in frequency to simulate scenarios from high frequency to routine measurements fig 4 if the sampling interval of the frequency reduced data was still less than 24 h the reduced frequency was denoted as f m i e f m f c and the daily arithmetic average was carried out before the trackability and stability were calculated as above the calculation results in such cases are shown in fig 4 a b when the sampling interval was 0 5 8 0 h the calculated trackability and stability based on different intervals were similar and the optimal threshold of 1 5 c m 1 could be easily selected however when the sampling interval increased to 12 24 h there were larger differences in the calculated indexes between those datasets and the variation of the two indexes to the trial threshold was growing less smooth or regular the optimal threshold could be determined by searching the peak of the calculated indexes in contrast if the frequency reduced data had a sampling interval exceeding 24 h the reduced frequency was denoted as f m i e f m f c when the daily average was not needed and the result is shown in fig 4 c at this time the difference of calculated indexes between different datasets further increased and multiple local extrema replaced the global one moreover the trackability and stability once indicated different extrema so it was difficult to determine the optimal threshold a total of ten scenarios with sampling intervals ranging from 0 5 h to 2 0 d determined the optimal threshold as 1 5 c m 1 the remaining three scenarios with intervals of no less than 4 0 d were either failed to select the optimal threshold or determined it as 1 4 c m 1 which should be attributed to the confusion of extremum determination since the thresholds of 1 4 c m 1 and 1 5 c m 1 had approximate values of trackability and stability therefore the proposed method has relatively strong robustness in determining the optimal threshold when the sampling interval is shortened the calculated variations of trackability and stability with trial thresholds generally approach two smooth curves and in order to determine the optimal threshold through these curves the sampling interval is recommended to be no more than 8 0 h and never exceeds 24 h to sum up high frequency measurements can capture multi scale thermal changes and then obtain more representative daily averaged data as well as more regular curves of thermocline evolution indexes with trial thresholds this measurement pattern provides a new approach for the objective determination of the optimal threshold by mining its massive measured data however there is no distinct boundary between high frequency and routine measurements and these two patterns are mainly characterized by their working mode the routine pattern driven by humans makes it difficult to carry out temperature measurements with a sampling interval of less than 8 0 h but it has the advantages of flexible schemes and long historical data which can verify and complement the high frequency measured dataset 3 1 3 influence of measurement environment on threshold determination the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic processes differ greatly between different aquatic environments leading to a remarkably varied optimal threshold among them at present most studies determined this threshold empirically and some representative studies are shown in table 1 where the optimal thresholds of 0 2 1 0 and 2 0 c m 1 are widely adopted the thresholds of 1 0 and 2 0 c m 1 also achieve acceptable and similar identification results in the daheiting reservoir but are inferior to the optimal value of 1 5 c m 1 fig 3 a therefore the objectively determined threshold in this study is compatible with the subjective determinations in relevant researches furthermore the influence of the measurement environment on the optimal threshold determination was analyzed by literature investigations as shown in fig 5 the determined optimal threshold has a good negative correlation with the water surface area and maximum water depth but a weak positive correlation with the environmental latitude large volume water generally has stronger resistance to external forces so it is more difficult to change its stratified thermal state and its thermal gradient has minor variations therefore their optimal threshold is relatively small however the empirically determined thresholds are usually clustered by the researchers nationality rather than the study environment in china an industrial standard recommended a thermal threshold of 0 2 c m 1 for oceans with a depth of less than 200 m in 1991 hao et al 2012 which was subsequently adopted in many inland freshwater environments in china moreover in canada and some european countries earlier studies suggested a thermal threshold of 1 0 c m 1 birge 1897 which was also widely used in later researches on lakes in those nations mironov 2008 referring to the criterion values of previous studies in this region is an efficient method to determine the threshold but it should also be noted that there are distinct differences between the environmental characteristics of different lakes and reservoirs which could be addressed by an objective determination of the optimal threshold 3 2 temporal evolution of thermal structures 3 2 1 identification results based on high frequency measurements the determined optimal threshold was adopted to extract temporal variations in thermal structures at 30 min intervals from the high frequency measurement data the thermocline parameters such as depth thickness average strength and maximum strength are shown in fig 6 the thermocline mostly existed in the middle and upper area of the reservoir while occupied the surface area in late july fig 6 a in addition to the periods of formation and weakening the thermocline thickness fluctuated greatly but its mean value was relatively stable without a significant maximum fig 6 b there was a significant positive correlation between the average and maximum thermocline strength with the pearson correlation coefficient of 0 904 these two strengths were highly coincidental in the overlap periods and reached their maximum in late july fig 6 c the thermal structure of the daheiting reservoir was generally in a positive stratification state with a single thermocline from early may to late october considering all parameters the thermocline evolution reached its peak in late july the thermocline was thin but strong before the peak while it was thick and mild thereafter moreover it is noteworthy that the thermocline evolution discussed in this research is aimed at the summer thermal stratification many relevant studies such as liu et al 2019 agree to divide the thermocline evolution into three stages but specific and universal dividing standards were rarely given in this study we examine the presence of thermocline within each day if the thermocline is detected at least once in one day the thermal stratification is regarded as existing on that day in addition if the thermocline is identified in all profiles in one day the stratification is considered mature on that day the formation period is defined from the day that the stratification first exists to the day that the stratification first matures conversely the weakening period is defined from the day that the stratification last matures to the day that the stratification last exists moreover the time between the formation and weakening periods is regarded as the stationary period as shown in fig 6 d the occurrence probability of the thermocline was relatively low near 0 and 12 o clock during the formation period while it was low in the daytime during the weakening period however thermocline parameters such as thickness and average strength had no noticeable intraday variations and the characteristics of thermocline evolution during each period are shown in table 2 3 2 2 characteristic temporal scales of thermal variations based on the identification results above the average temperatures of each layer were calculated and adopted to investigate the temporal scale of thermal variations as shown in fig 7 a because the overall variation of epilimnion and thermocline temperature lagged behind that of the air temperature the correlation coefficient between air and water temperature was not as large as that of water temperature in different stratified layers fig 7 a1 however there was good diurnal accordance of the epilimnion temperature to the air temperature as shown in fig 7 a2 the smoothed air temperature and epilimnion temperature intersected near the evolution peak of the thermal structures fig 6 c indicating that the temperature difference between air and surface water determines the development direction of thermal structures moreover the smoothed air and mean thermocline temperature intersected near the beginning of the weakening period fig 6 a after which the thermocline temperature quickly approached that of the epilimnion when the stratification ended the thermocline temperature met the epilimnion but was still significantly higher than that of the hypolimnion suggesting that more time is needed for the reservoir to form a uniform thermal structure after the stratification ends it is noteworthy that the mean thermocline temperature had a good correlation but a stronger fluctuation with the epilimnion temperature therefore the thermocline does not just passively change under the constraints of the epilimnion and hypolimnion but has its specific variation scales that need to be further discussed based on its characteristic parameters furthermore the average temperatures of the air and each stratified layer were transformed to the frequency domain using the fast fourier transform as shown in fig 7 b both the air and epilimnion temperature have prominent peaks around the frequency of f c 1 d 1 that is they exhibited significant periodic variations on a daily scale the hypolimnion temperature shows small amplitudes without a pronounced peak indicating that it was relatively constant and had no prominent variation frequency higher than the measurement span frequency f s in contrast a weak peak is identified near f c 1 d 1 for the mean thermocline temperature however it is difficult to judge diurnal or other variation scales because of the strong fluctuation of those spectral signals that may be resulted from wind rainfall and other disturbance zhang et al 2020 therefore further analysis based on thermocline parameters is required 3 2 3 characteristic temporal modes of thermocline evolutions to explore the indistinguishable evolution scale of the thermocline the parameters of thickness h and average strength r were adopted for analysis all calculated thickness and average strength data points are plotted in fig 8 a which shows negative correlations during periods of time the data density analysis in fig 8 b indicates that the thickness is concentrated in the range of 4 0 8 5 m while the average strength is mainly distributed from 1 5 to 3 5 c m 1 and they are also negatively correlated in the variation hotspot therefore we fitted these two parameters in the negative relationship of h a r 1 b within different periods where a and b are both fitting coefficients as shown in fig 8 c d there are six periods that fitted the relationship well whose goodness of fit are all greater than 0 750 and the highest is 0 899 moreover the variation of their fitting coefficient a is similar to the annual evolution of the mean thermocline temperature fig 7 a3 the durations of these six fitted periods are 8 5 9 0 10 1 10 5 8 8 and 18 2 days respectively indicating that the thermocline thickness and average strength can transform into each other within a week to half a month but follow the annual rules in table 2 over a longer period according to the thermal profile model the thermocline thickness h and the average strength r obey the relationship of h r t 1 t 2 where t 1 and t 2 are the epilimnion and hypolimnion temperature respectively and their difference is δt this equation can be rewritten as h δt r 1 and comparing it with the fitting formula above it can be found that the fitting process essentially assumes that the temperature difference between the epilimnion and hypolimnion δt is constant during the selected fitting period furthermore the fitting coefficient a quantifies the temperature difference δt and coefficient b compensates for the actual fluctuation of this difference in other words the essence of the transformation of thermocline parameters within a short period is the dynamic distribution of thermal energy under a specific temperature difference constraint therefore the driving force of this phenomenon should be found from hydrodynamic factors many studies have emphasized that wind plays an important role in the thermocline evolution fernández et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 georgiy 2010 sundaram and rehm 1971 proposed that the formation and maintenance of the thermocline can be explained in terms of the nonlinear interaction between wind induced turbulence and stable thermal gradients providing a basis for us to analyze the dynamic phenomenon of the thermocline the transformation of thermocline parameters could be attributed to the internal wave a common hydrodynamic phenomenon in stratified water when external forces such as wind act on water environments with narrow and long topography such as the daheiting reservoir the surface water is pushed to the leeward area leading to a thermocline inclination in this region when the external force weakens the thermocline vibrates near its equilibrium position resulting in reservoir scale internal waves moreover if this internal wave degenerates unstably into a sub reservoir scale shear flow is likely to occur in the thermocline area and promote the vertical mixing of stratified water boegman and ivey 2012 pannard et al 2011 the flume internal wave experiment results of chen et al 2007 are shown in fig 8 f which indicates that the internal wave increases the thermocline thickness but weakens the strength under the constraint of a particular density difference the period of the internal wave in a reservoir scale always varies from a few hours to several days so the characteristic temporal scale of thermocline evolution is difficult to determine by the spectral analysis like fig 7 b in summary the thermocline evolution is hydrodynamically driven in short periods of a week to half a month when the thermocline thickness and strength transform into each other but is mainly driven by external thermal variations in the monthly to annual period as illustrated in fig 8 e 3 3 spatial evolution of thermal structures 3 3 1 identification results based on routine measurements the optimal threshold determined from the high frequency dataset was also applied to the routine measurement data and the thermocline thickness h and average strength r were adopted to explore the spatial evolution of thermal structures as fig 9 shows the thermocline evolution in the entire reservoir meets the three temporal stages of formation stationary and weakening periods in table 2 taking the water depth local terrain human interference and other factors into consideration the daheiting reservoir area is divided into three regions tail middle and head as shown in fig 9 the tail region has a typical river feature of a narrow and shallow channel while the middle and head regions show a gradually enhanced characteristic of lakes and reservoirs because its channel broadens and the depth increases the tail and head regions are more interfered with human activities while the middle region is less disturbed it was found that the thermocline first appeared in the tail and middle regions of the reservoir and then developed towards the head region but the thermocline parameters had no distinct correlation between their spatial distributions except for july 25 when the thermocline was at its strongest state the thermocline did not exist all over the reservoir but it was more likely to be identified in areas with broader river channels and larger water depths moreover abnormal thermoclines with small thickness but extraordinary strength up to 30 c m 1 were detected in the tail region of the reservoir on june 27 and september 17 such magnitude of thermocline strength is far from the records of other regions of the daheiting reservoir and other water environments hadley et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a coloso et al 2011 but is close to the anthropogenic thermocline in the laboratory gao et al 2019 considering that daheiting is the adverse regulating reservoir of the panjiakou the identified spatial evolution of thermal structures is mostly discussed in terms of their joint operations 3 3 2 impact of panjiakou s water discharge on thermal structures both the low temperature water of the panjiakou reservoir and natural temperature water of the sahe river enter the daheiting reservoir from its tail region as shown in fig 10 a the flow volume from panjiakou s lower pool is always significantly greater than that from the sahe river during the non flood seasons fig s2 thus the thermal structures of the daheiting reservoir are inevitably impacted by low temperature water according to the volume dominance of the two water sources the routine measurement data were divided into cold water and temperate water affected groups and thermal structures within 20 km from the lower pool were analyzed as shown in fig 10 b taking the cold water affected group of june 27 for analysis when a sizeable cold flow of 155 2 m3 s 1 close to the maximum inflow of 163 m3 s 1 in 2019 was discharged into the daheiting reservoir uniform low temperature profiles without thermoclines were measured within 7 41 km from the lower pool fig 10 b1 then the low temperature flow dived and diffused due to gravity terrain and solar radiation at 9 24 and 11 0 km away from the lower pool where outlier thermoclines with extreme strength but thin thickness were identified in fig 9 finally the discharged cold flow was blended with the reservoir until 14 9 km from the lower pool and thermal structures remained almost unchanged within a later range the same trend holds in another cold water affected group with a volume of 88 96 m3 s 1 cold water entered the daheiting reservoir on september 17 as fig 10 b2 shows there was a uniform low temperature profile 1 88 km away from the lower pool and no significant difference existed between thermal structures after 11 0 km from the lower pool in contrast when the inflow was dominated by the temperate water like the two investigations on july 25 and august 15 in fig 10 b3 there were no significant differences in value or shape among all thermal profiles measured in the tail and middle regions therefore the thermal structures at the tail region undergo significant changes when the lower pool discharges cold water the tail to the middle region is first characterized by uniform low temperature profiles without a thermocline then extraordinary thermoclines with great strength but small thickness occur and finally transit to natural thermoclines in a relatively stable shape the spatial range of these changes is determined by the discharge water volume and temperature in this study this range is directly measured as 11 0 14 9 km which is the tail region of the reservoir moreover numerical simulations by liang et al 2012 and zhang et al 2014 verified the cumulative effect of the water temperature along with cascade reservoirs they found that the discharged cold water always weakens the thermal structures of the entire downstream reservoir and further promotes an isothermal effect between different reservoirs in other words the relatively stable thermal structures in the middle and head regions are inconspicuously weakened by the discharged cold water which is a global impact beyond the directly measured range 3 3 3 impact of daheiting s water supply on thermal structures the daheiting reservoir supplies water to tianjin tangshan and its downstream channel through the outlet near the right bank as shown in fig 10 a therefore the routine measurement data was divided into the low flow medium flow and high flow groups based on the supply flow rate then the impact of the water supply conditions of daheiting on its thermal structures was explored because there was no significant spatial correlation between the thermocline parameters the product of the thermocline thickness h and average strength r was adopted to quantify the thermocline evolution the identified thermoclines within 10 km from the outlet were statistically analyzed in fig 10 c suggesting regions near the outlet had a stronger thermocline than other areas in the low flow supply condition but it was suppressed with the increase in supplying water flow when the daheiting reservoir supplied water at 40 2 m3 s 1 there was no significant difference between the thermoclines near the outlet and those in the middle region however the thermal stratification near the outlet lagged in comparison to that of the middle region at a supply rate of no less than 87 5 m3 s 1 the area near the dam is more prone to be thermally stratified due to its greater water depths and lower flow rates but reservoir operations such as water supply can suppress and even adverse this trend by enhancing the local hydrodynamics of the head region gao et al 2019 the daheiting reservoir whose main task is supplying water has a relatively rough and stable drainage process the advection caused by its operations is continuous compared with the internal wave triggered by wind stress therefore the water supply operation can suppress the thermocline development rather than simply drive thermocline transformations in its parameters however for reservoirs that undertake important power generation tasks such as the china three gorges and the xiluodu project delicate operations are likely to cause water hammers and further trigger internal waves in the reservoir ji et al 2021 boegman et al 2012 the area with a weakened thermal structure due to the water supply operation is related to the thermal state water supply flow rate and water discharge mode the daheiting reservoir discharges water through its middle hole which affects an area approximately 5 km away from the outlet in the high flow condition namely the head region in summary comparing with the direct impact of panjiakou s discharged cold water daheiting s water supply condition inhibits thermal stratification within a more limited area and in a gentler way which is more favorable to the aquatic environment and should be given priority when regulating water quality by reservoir operations 4 conclusion both high frequency and routine measurements of water temperature were conducted in the daheiting reservoir and an objective identification method for thermal structures was proposed in this study trial calculations indicate that the thermal threshold significantly impacts the identification result of thermal stratifications the optimal threshold could be selected based on high frequency data with a recommended sampling interval of shorter than 8 0 h the optimal thermal threshold is objectively determined to be 1 5 c m 1 for the daheitng reservoir which has good compatibility with imperially determined thresholds in related studies and shows strong robustness to the data sampling frequency based on the high frequency measurements it is identified that the thermocline of the daheiting reservoir lasted from early may to late october and peaked in late july moreover by integrally considering the variation of thermocline parameters the temporal evolution of thermal structures could be divided into three stages formation stationary and weakening period the temperature differences between air and each stratified layer are decisive for the evolution stage of the thermal structures the epilimnion temperature has significant daily variations but the hypolimnion has no evident small temporal scale in temperature driven by hydrodynamic events such as internal waves the thermocline thickness and average strength could transform into each other within a short time of a week to half a month based on the routine measurements the spatial evolution of the thermal structures is identified and the suppression impact of cascade reservoir operations on thermocline is analyzed when a large amount of cold water flows into the daheiting reservoir from the panjiakou s lower pool it successively occurs that the spatial variation of no thermocline extraordinary thermoclines and natural thermoclines this phenomenon mainly emerges within 11 0 14 9 km from the panjiakou s lower pool on the other hand daheiting s water supplying operations lead to continuous advection movements in front of the dam which further weakens the thermal stratification within an affected area of 5 0 km from the outlet funding the national key r d program of china 2016yfc0401701

the south regions its climate is characterized by the geographical conditions of forming expansive plains that stretch from the charyeong range the entire area of the city is surrounded by many high and low mountains to the south and the west late middle age and old age hills are spread while there are many plains due to the development of rivers study focus in this study machine learning algorithms were used based on convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm to generate a groundwater potential map in anseong south korea a total of 295 wells locations were divided by the median value of transmissivity data t and produced 1 point with high groundwater productivity data and 0 as the point with the low groundwater productivity and divided into 70 30 for training and validation the model 14 groundwater potential related factors were used in this study such as topo hydrological and geo environmental factors to define the spatial correlation with the high groundwater productivity data the validation of the model is evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics roc curve analysis method the area under the roc curve auc is calculated to test the model new hydrological insight for the region the results shows a good accuracy as the auc values were all higher than 0 8 finally the groundwater potential maps generated by cnn and lstm can be used to analyze the areas that potentially provided groundwater in anseong south korea this study could help the local environment to manage groundwater resources and can be used to assist development planners and decision makers in groundwater sustainability planning keywords groundwater potential mapping convolutional neural network cnn long short term memory lstm 1 introduction water stored inside soil pores and porous rock aquifers known as groundwater has greatly contributed to water resources for human use famiglietti 2014 the freshwater required to sustain life is expected to substantially increase as population density increases fitts 2013 freshwater used as potable water for private agricultural and industrial uses is generally sourced from groundwater aral and taylor 2011 the sustainability of groundwater depends on the groundwater recharge process kotchoni et al 2019 groundwater recharge induced by rainfall is influenced by evapotranspiration runoff and soil infiltration putranto and rüde 2011 yeh et al 2007 climate change influences the water cycle and plays an important role in reducing groundwater recharge because of the increased runoff caused by greater rainfall intensity dourte et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 those problems can be solved through implementation of effective groundwater management systems to prevent drought in various regions aral and taylor 2011 gorelick and zheng 2015 such groundwater management systems can be developed from groundwater potential maps tolche 2021 in south korea groundwater is a major source of water during the dry season and groundwater demand has increased along with economic and agricultural development lee and kwon 2016 because of this increased demand for groundwater quantitative methods are required to identify areas with the potential to become sources of groundwater lee and lee 2015a however traditional approaches for groundwater exploration e g drilling hydrogeological methods and geophysical methods are costly and time consuming for data acquisition over a wide area nampak et al 2014 the most reliable approach for identifying areas with high groundwater potential is groundwater potential mapping which combines remote sensing based field data with geographic information systems gis analysis methods to identify factors that influence the spatial distribution of groundwater aquifers arabameri et al 2020a remote sensing techniques and gis based methods play important roles in rapidly providing spatial information for inaccessible areas arabameri et al 2019 this advantage can be used to obtain data related to potential groundwater resource areas in general groundwater exploration is conducted using field surveys and geophysical methods which require experienced workers and have high costs in terms of both money and time fadhillah et al 2021 in addition conventional groundwater exploration methods do not always consider the various factors that control the occurrence and movement of groundwater oh et al 2011 therefore a groundwater survey method that can overcome those limitations is needed groundwater potential mapping studies are useful for clarifying the hydrological relationships of direct groundwater potential indicators based on hydraulic constants such as specific capacity and transmissivity t with groundwater yield in a manner that can be integrated with remote sensing data and processed using gis based methods lee et al 2018 lee and lee 2015a over the past decade the remote sensing data used to generate groundwater potential maps have included topographic geological hydrological and environmental factors these are considered the main factors affecting the groundwater potential distribution arabameri et al 2019 lee and lee 2015a lee and rezaie 2020 lee et al 2020b oh et al 2011 several methods have been used for groundwater potential mapping these include bivariate and multivariate statistical models such as the frequency ratio fr elmahdy and mohamed 2015 lee and panahi 2021 logistic regression chen et al 2018 oh and lee 2011 park et al 2017 weight of evidence arabameri et al 2019 and evidential belief function methods khoshtinat et al 2019 kim et al 2018 pourghasemi and beheshtirad 2015 the popularity of those statistical models is replaced by machine learning methods that have the ability to solve problems of nonlinear data sets bui et al 2019b nhu et al 2020 oh et al 2018 in addition machine learning algorithms have been used to determine the factors that correlated with groundwater field data for groundwater potential mapping mart 2019 the machine learning algorithms employed for groundwater potential mapping include the boosted classification tree lee et al 2019 2020b artificial neural network lee et al 2018 support vector regression fadhillah et al 2021 and support vector machine methods arabameri et al 2019 panahi et al 2020b rizeei et al 2019 those methods were proven to improve the accuracy of the groundwater potential area because the machine learning method can handle a large dataset with suitable effectiveness chen et al 2018 naghibi et al 2017 recent studies show the potential of deep learning to become more popular in groundwater potential mapping due to its effectiveness in the process of generating groundwater potential maps and resulting in higher accuracy than the accuracy of machine learning algorithms chen et al 2021 panahi et al 2020b xu et al 2020 the convolutional neural network cnn shows an interesting result by overcoming the effectiveness in predicting the groundwater potential map compared to the machine learning algorithm panahi et al 2020b xu et al 2020 another study implemented a hybrid deep learning algorithm with neural network decision tree and boosting to generate groundwater potential map and those algorithms have satisfactory predicted accuracy chen et al 2021 thus the ability of the deep learning algorithm was suitable to be used as the method to predict the groundwater potential map in anseong south korea another deep learning algorithm that has good performance and has not been used as a groundwater potential prediction method is the long short term memory lstm method hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the capability of lstm has been used in flood susceptibility mapping fang et al 2021 landslide susceptibility mapping xiao et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 and habitat potential mapping lee and rezaie 2021 the lstm algorithm has the advantage to learn hidden long term sequential dependencies data the effectiveness of the lstm method was promising to be applied in groundwater potential mapping yang et al 2017 therefore the main objective of this study was to generate a groundwater potential map for anseong south korea using two algorithms based on the convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm methods to our knowledge this is the first study to describe groundwater potential mapping via cnn and lstm algorithms in this study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed in the anseong si area located in the southernmost part of gyeonggi do province at 127 19 e 36 82 n fig 1 it borders pyeongtaek in the west icheon in the northeast cheonan jincheon and eumseong in the south and yongin in the north in general the northeastern part of the study area has considerably higher elevation compared with the southwestern part the charyeong range which stretches from south to north divides the region into eastern and western portions the cheongmicheon river flows to the east the ancheongcheon joryeongcheon and hancheon rivers flow westward before entering the yellow sea to the south mt seounsan 547 m forms the provincial border with chungcheongbuk do and chungcheongnam do the entire area of the city is surrounded by high and low mountains with the appearance of folding screens to the south and the west hills of moderate to old age are present along with plains formed through the action of rivers the geology of anseong is mostly composed of daebo granite from the jurassic period in addition precambrian gneisses are found in the south schists belonging to the dansan formation are present in the north in the areas of juksan myeon geumgwang myeon and seoun myeon alternating layers of precambrian shale and sandstones were apparently affected by gneissification forming the rock formations visible today the rock floors in this area consist of biotite and gneiss they are of neutral quality showing well developed foliation located in the central region of south korea anseong has a transitional climate between that the northern and southern regions of the country its climate is characterized by local geographic conditions including expansive plains that stretch from the charyeong range the region s climate is characterized by a wide temperature range with hot and humid summers as well as winters that are cold and dry because of its geographic location the study area has a continental climate anseong has a precipitation level suitable for cultivation of paddy rice and other crops the amount of rainfall increases during the rice growth period of june july and august supporting the production of high quality gyeonggi rice 2 2 groundwater potential inventory map training and testing dataset construction in this study a groundwater potential inventory map was produced using groundwater productivity data calculated from groundwater transmissivity t data which were obtained from 295 groundwater wells in anseong si area the data were acquired through national groundwater surveys conducted by the korea water resource corporation lee et al 2020b the t values greater than the median value were selected to identify groundwater potential areas then converted those values into binary data of 1 the remaining 0 values represented t values less than the median value arabameri et al 2019 fadhillah et al 2021 thus a value of 1 represented above median t values while 0 represented below median t values oh et al 2011 data with binary values of 1 were separated from data with values of 0 each resulting dataset was randomly divided such that 70 of the input values became training data while the remaining 30 of values were used as testing data next the training datasets consisting of 1 and 0 values were combined as were the testing datasets of 1 and 0 values the proportions of groundwater data used for the training 70 and testing 30 datasets were suitable for generating a groundwater potential map arabameri et al 2021a chen et al 2019 lee et al 2020b transmissivity represents the flow rate in hydraulic units and specific capacity has been strongly correlated with hydrogeological factors lee et al 2018 the empirical relationship between specific capacity and transmissivity can be calculated using eq 1 razack and huntley 1991 1 t k q s 0 67 where t is aquifer transmissivity k is the common measure of transmissivity and specific capacity q is the constant discharge rate of a well and s is drawdown in the pumping well a decrease in drawdown of the pumping well and a higher discharge rate produce high t values razack and huntley 1991 2 3 groundwater potential related factors based on a literature review 14 factors related to groundwater were identified for use in this study table 1 these included the topo hydrological factors of elevation slope aspect slope length ls factor valley depth terrain ruggedness index tri and topographic wetness index twi altafi dadgar et al 2017 arabameri et al 2020a 2019 bui et al 2019a condon and maxwell 2015 in addition the geo environmental factors of lithology forest factors e g forest type forest density forest diameter and forest age and land use were considered in this study arabameri et al 2020b 2020a huajie et al 2016 serele et al 2020 topo hydrological maps of elevation slope aspect ls factor valley depth tri and twi were derived from a digital elevation model from the shuttle radar topography mission with resolution of 30 m construction of the topo hydrological factor maps was conducted using basic terrain analysis tools in gis software hakim et al 2020 lee and kim 2020 elevation fig 2a was associated with precipitation levels in regions with higher elevations runoff is greater and infiltration is low despite greater precipitation abdollahi et al 2019 duan et al 2016 the level of groundwater recharge was associated with the infiltration rate and the two factors that influence the infiltration rate were slope fig 2b and aspect fig 2c on a steeper slope the water flow rate is high which reduces the infiltration rate over time oikonomidis et al 2015 preeja et al 2011 furthermore aspect is related to groundwater recharge because aspect can affect moisture preservation and the amount of vegetation over an area pradhan et al 2014 the ls factor fig 2d represents the effect of slope length and can be used to determine water behavior that affects groundwater potential fadhillah et al 2021 valley depth fig 2e is the elevation difference between the base level and the upstream ridge level tri fig 2f is a parameter that quantifies surface roughness valley depth and tri have been used in previous several studies to construct groundwater potential maps arabameri et al 2020b kim et al 2019 lee et al 2020b panahi et al 2020b twi fig 2g provides information regarding the spatial distributions of hydrological variables such as infiltration potential and soil moisture twi can also reflect the relationship between water accumulation at any location and the gravitational force driving water downslope sørensen et al 2006 higher values of twi are positively correlated with groundwater availability nampak et al 2014 lithology is an important factor for describing groundwater in a particular area yeh et al 2016 lithology can affect groundwater recharge because of its influence on water movement through porous material hong et al 2015 mandal et al 2016 the lithology of the study area was divided into 3 main lithologies fig 2h qa quarternary alluvium pcetgn precambrian tourmaline gneiss and jggr jurassic hornblende biotite granite in addition to lithology groundwater was closely associated with land use which can affect groundwater recharge and groundwater extraction lerner and harris 2009 miraki et al 2019 yeh et al 2016 land use types were divided into seven categories fig 2i agricultural area 39 49 barren land 1 49 forest area 43 89 grassland 3 99 marshland 0 81 urban area 8 49 and water body 1 85 the lithology and land use maps used in this study were provided by the korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources lee et al 2019 the soil material type in anseong was dominated by metamorphic rock acid rock and quaternary alluvium fig 2j the soil factor was influenced porosity and controls the infiltration to the aquifers system fadhillah et al 2021 lee and lee 2015b the forest factors were important because the largest area 43 89 area in anseong was covered with forest anseong included 6 types of forest fig 2k pk nut pine forest 4 14 d pine forest 3 55 pr pitch pine forest 7 49 m mixed forest 15 13 pl larch 2 93 and h deciduous trees 10 76 as shown in fig 2l the forest density could be divided into low 0 33 moderate 11 76 and high density areas 29 90 forest diameter was divided into 3 classes fig 2m small 2 41 medium 24 11 and large 17 91 forest age was divided into 6 classes fig 2n from 1 to 51 years old 2 4 general methodology the methodology employed in this study involved four main steps preparation of the database analysis of spatial correlation development and training of the model for groundwater potential mapping and assessment of model performance based on accuracy fig 3 database preparation began with groundwater yield data based on transmissivity values collected from 295 wells the groundwater data were randomly divided into datasets of 70 training data and 30 testing data the training data were used to generate groundwater potential maps and the testing data were used to validate the model the distributions of training and testing data are shown in fig 1 gis factors related to groundwater potential were identified using the fr model which can predict potential probabilistic correlations between the presence of groundwater and each class of every factor hakim and lee 2020 kadirhodjaev et al 2020 the ratio between the proportion of pixels for each groundwater potential related factor and the proportion of pixels showing groundwater potential was obtained using eq 2 as follows 2 fr pixel of groundwater productivity pixel of groundwater class the fr values obtained for each class of groundwater potential related factors were used to generate groundwater potential maps by employing a deep learning algorithm based on cnn and lstm methods finally the groundwater potential models were validated through receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis based on area under the roc curve auc values 2 5 cnn the cnn deep learning algorithm is based on a neural network a cnn includes 4 main layers convolutional process activation process pooling process and fully connected li et al 2021 thi ngo et al 2021 wang et al 2019 the convolutional process layer can identify connections among feature classes simultaneously based on features extracted from the input images khosravi et al 2020 the second layer is the activation layer in this study the rectified linear unit was used in the activation layer because this unit can effectively improve the non linear properties of the neural network lee et al 2020a panahi et al 2021b sameen et al 2020 thi ngo et al 2021 the third layer is the pooling layer which can prevent the problem of overfitting in the neural network by using downsampling to reduce the dimensions of feature classes before all classes are processed in the fully connected layer lee et al 2020a the last layer is the fully connected layer which integrates data in the neural network and produces the final output khosravi et al 2020 panahi et al 2021b 2 6 lstm the lstm deep learning algorithm is based on a recurrent neural network this algorithm was designed to process sequential data across intervals in excess of one thousand steps hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 lstm consists of memory blocks containing memory cells that remember or store the temporal state of information in the network they are controlled by units known as gates azzouni and pujolle 2017 the lstm integrates memory units to allow the network to learn when to forget a previous hidden state and when to update a hidden state with new information ismail et al 2018 the lstm unit contains three main gates the input gate i t responsible for controlling the flow of incoming information the forget gate f t responsible for controlling the amount of information retained from the previous memory state and the output gate o t responsible for controlling the flow of outgoing information ismail et al 2018 vu et al 2021 the processes occurring among these three gates are described by eq 3 as follows 3 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f o t σ w i h t 1 x t b 0 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b f c t f t c t 1 i i c t h t o t tanh c t where i t is the input gate f t is the forget gate o t is the output gate c t is the input modulation gate c t is the memory cell and h t is a hidden unit at a specific time point t the input for a lstm cell is x t and h t 1 ct 1 is its previous cell state consisting of previously obtained information in the lstm architecture w b σ and tanh are the weighted matrices bias vector sigmoid function and hyperbolic tangent function respectively azzouni and pujolle 2017 ismail et al 2018 lee and rezaie 2021 vu et al 2021 yang et al 2017 3 results 3 1 relationships of groundwater potential with related factors the relationships of groundwater potential related factors with groundwater productivity can be assessed through the calculation of fr values as shown in table 2 fr values greater than 1 indicate that the class is closely correlated with the inventory map pradhan et al 2014 the 4 classes in areas with elevations of 5 208 m had fr values greater than 1 indicating that lower elevation areas of anseong city have greater potential to contain groundwater aquifers the three lowest slope classes namely 0 3 3 8 and 8 17 also had high fr values of 1 52 1 07 and 1 34 respectively the aspect data indicated that the probability of groundwater potential is concentrated in the flat northern southwestern and western portions of the study area which had fr values of approximately 1 17 1 55 1 30 and 1 12 respectively the ls factor classes of 0 2 and 10 26 had fr values of approximately 1 59 and 1 17 respectively the highest class of valley depth 166 280 had a high fr value of 1 96 the highest fr values for tri were assigned to the classes of 0 8 and 18 36 for twi the highest fr values were assigned to the classes of 7 8 and 8 23 among geological factors kmz cretaceous mineralized zone pcepgn precambrian porphyroblastic gneiss and kad cretaceous acidic dike were the lithological classes with the highest fr values for groundwater potential land use classes of marsh urban area barren land and agriculture area were associated with high probabilities of groundwater potential based on fr values soil material of the acid rock type was likely to be found in groundwater potential areas forest of the pitch pine type had the highest fr value among forest types for forest factors e g type density diameter and age the non forest areas had the highest fr value among classes indicating that the non forest areas of anseong have the highest probability of groundwater potential 3 2 groundwater potential maps groundwater potential maps of anseong were generated using 14 groundwater potential related factors model results for the cnn and lstm algorithms are shown in fig 4a b respectively the groundwater potential indices were divided into five classes through classification of each pixel using quantile methods to create five probability classes very low low moderate high and very high 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of variable importance assessment of variable importance was conducted to remove factors with poor predictive power from the models to increase model predictive accuracy based on information gain ratio igr analysis arabameri et al 2020b mori 2002 panahi et al 2021a igr is a commonly used method for feature selection in which a high value represents a strong influence on the predictions of the model arabameri et al 2021b dodangeh et al 2020 panahi et al 2020a as a feature selection method igr is an entropy based method that considers only important factors and ranks the results in decreasing order bui et al 2018 igr was calculated using eq 4 where t is the training data rf is the related factor and s plit entropy t rf is the information acquired via division of the training data by the groundwater potential related factor 4 igr t rf entropy t entropy t rf split entropy t rf the igr values representing a ranking of factor influences are shown in fig 5 according to those results forest type is the most important factor with an igr value of 0 58 followed by forest age 0 51 forest diameter 0 49 forest density 0 45 land use 0 43 tri 0 41 slope 0 40 elevation 0 33 lithology 0 33 ls factor 0 28 soil material 0 27 twi 0 25 valley depth 0 17 and aspect 0 03 the most meaningful factors in this study which were used to generate the groundwater potential map were the forest factors and land use our analysis showed that non forest areas which consist of agriculture area barren land marsh and urban areas were highly likely to be groundwater potential areas the forest area in this study area was located in a mountainous area that has a high elevation and steeper slope the higher the elevation area was possibly having the lower seasonal distribution precipitation gain abdollahi et al 2019 the steeper slope can increase the runoff and the water flow and decrease the infiltration rate oikonomidis et al 2015 preeja et al 2011 the train and test data from the field surveys were acquired from an accessible area those areas with the forest were located in the hilly area that makes the distribution of the train and test was less in the forest area 4 2 model performance evaluation the validation step of assessing the model accuracy achieved using cnn and lstm algorithms was conducted using roc curve analysis fawcett 2006 saha et al 2021 roc curve analysis is the standard method used to evaluate the performance of predictive models based on auc values along with training and validation datasets it has been used in several potential mapping applications including groundwater potential mapping arabameri et al 2020a falah and zeinivand 2019 panahi et al 2020b and habitat potential mapping choi et al 2011 lee et al 2015 lee and rezaie 2021 auc values were determined to compare the performance of groundwater potential models through model validation using 30 of the total dataset i e test data roc curve analysis as shown in fig 6 indicated that the lstm algorithm orange line had the highest accuracy whereas the cnn algorithm blue line had the lowest accuracy the lstm model with an auc value of approximately 0 809 had better predictive ability than did the cnn model with an auc value of approximately 0 801 the lstm model has the benefit of having the forget gate in the process to filter out the non necessary information from the input data and resulting in higher accuracy from the predicted models fang et al 2021 nevertheless the accuracy of cnn can be achieved because of its ability to handle the complex process without prior information of the input data with larger scale features due to convolution and pooling layer zuo et al 2019 in addition the optimization to the process of selecting the parameter input of both algorithms could improve the accuracy of the predicted models 5 conclusion groundwater potential maps were generated for anseong using the cnn and lstm algorithms in total 14 groundwater potential related factors including topo hydrological and geo environmental factors were used in this study the spatial correlations of these factors with groundwater productivity data were assessed through fr analysis groundwater inventory maps consisting of groundwater productivity data from 295 wells were divided into training and testing data at a ratio of 70 30 igr analysis was performed to identify the most influential factors affecting groundwater potential area the igr results indicated that non forest area e g agricultural area barren land marshland and urban areas had the greatest influence on increasing the probability of groundwater potential in a particular area the probability models generated using the lstm algorithm slightly outperformed the probability models generated using the cnn algorithm based on auc values greater than 0 5 groundwater potential maps generated using the cnn and lstm algorithms can be used for prediction of areas with good groundwater potential future research should include the development of an ensemble method that uses a metaheuristic optimization algorithm to improve model performance finally the groundwater potential maps produced in this study can be used by local governments and decision makers to assist with development planning and identification of adequate groundwater resources to meet daily needs credit authorship contribution statement wahyu luqmanul hakim writing

divided by the median value of transmissivity data t and produced 1 point with high groundwater productivity data and 0 as the point with the low groundwater productivity and divided into 70 30 for training and validation the model 14 groundwater potential related factors were used in this study such as topo hydrological and geo environmental factors to define the spatial correlation with the high groundwater productivity data the validation of the model is evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics roc curve analysis method the area under the roc curve auc is calculated to test the model new hydrological insight for the region the results shows a good accuracy as the auc values were all higher than 0 8 finally the groundwater potential maps generated by cnn and lstm can be used to analyze the areas that potentially provided groundwater in anseong south korea this study could help the local environment to manage groundwater resources and can be used to assist development planners and decision makers in groundwater sustainability planning keywords groundwater potential mapping convolutional neural network cnn long short term memory lstm 1 introduction water stored inside soil pores and porous rock aquifers known as groundwater has greatly contributed to water resources for human use famiglietti 2014 the freshwater required to sustain life is expected to substantially increase as population density increases fitts 2013 freshwater used as potable water for private agricultural and industrial uses is generally sourced from groundwater aral and taylor 2011 the sustainability of groundwater depends on the groundwater recharge process kotchoni et al 2019 groundwater recharge induced by rainfall is influenced by evapotranspiration runoff and soil infiltration putranto and rüde 2011 yeh et al 2007 climate change influences the water cycle and plays an important role in reducing groundwater recharge because of the increased runoff caused by greater rainfall intensity dourte et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 those problems can be solved through implementation of effective groundwater management systems to prevent drought in various regions aral and taylor 2011 gorelick and zheng 2015 such groundwater management systems can be developed from groundwater potential maps tolche 2021 in south korea groundwater is a major source of water during the dry season and groundwater demand has increased along with economic and agricultural development lee and kwon 2016 because of this increased demand for groundwater quantitative methods are required to identify areas with the potential to become sources of groundwater lee and lee 2015a however traditional approaches for groundwater exploration e g drilling hydrogeological methods and geophysical methods are costly and time consuming for data acquisition over a wide area nampak et al 2014 the most reliable approach for identifying areas with high groundwater potential is groundwater potential mapping which combines remote sensing based field data with geographic information systems gis analysis methods to identify factors that influence the spatial distribution of groundwater aquifers arabameri et al 2020a remote sensing techniques and gis based methods play important roles in rapidly providing spatial information for inaccessible areas arabameri et al 2019 this advantage can be used to obtain data related to potential groundwater resource areas in general groundwater exploration is conducted using field surveys and geophysical methods which require experienced workers and have high costs in terms of both money and time fadhillah et al 2021 in addition conventional groundwater exploration methods do not always consider the various factors that control the occurrence and movement of groundwater oh et al 2011 therefore a groundwater survey method that can overcome those limitations is needed groundwater potential mapping studies are useful for clarifying the hydrological relationships of direct groundwater potential indicators based on hydraulic constants such as specific capacity and transmissivity t with groundwater yield in a manner that can be integrated with remote sensing data and processed using gis based methods lee et al 2018 lee and lee 2015a over the past decade the remote sensing data used to generate groundwater potential maps have included topographic geological hydrological and environmental factors these are considered the main factors affecting the groundwater potential distribution arabameri et al 2019 lee and lee 2015a lee and rezaie 2020 lee et al 2020b oh et al 2011 several methods have been used for groundwater potential mapping these include bivariate and multivariate statistical models such as the frequency ratio fr elmahdy and mohamed 2015 lee and panahi 2021 logistic regression chen et al 2018 oh and lee 2011 park et al 2017 weight of evidence arabameri et al 2019 and evidential belief function methods khoshtinat et al 2019 kim et al 2018 pourghasemi and beheshtirad 2015 the popularity of those statistical models is replaced by machine learning methods that have the ability to solve problems of nonlinear data sets bui et al 2019b nhu et al 2020 oh et al 2018 in addition machine learning algorithms have been used to determine the factors that correlated with groundwater field data for groundwater potential mapping mart 2019 the machine learning algorithms employed for groundwater potential mapping include the boosted classification tree lee et al 2019 2020b artificial neural network lee et al 2018 support vector regression fadhillah et al 2021 and support vector machine methods arabameri et al 2019 panahi et al 2020b rizeei et al 2019 those methods were proven to improve the accuracy of the groundwater potential area because the machine learning method can handle a large dataset with suitable effectiveness chen et al 2018 naghibi et al 2017 recent studies show the potential of deep learning to become more popular in groundwater potential mapping due to its effectiveness in the process of generating groundwater potential maps and resulting in higher accuracy than the accuracy of machine learning algorithms chen et al 2021 panahi et al 2020b xu et al 2020 the convolutional neural network cnn shows an interesting result by overcoming the effectiveness in predicting the groundwater potential map compared to the machine learning algorithm panahi et al 2020b xu et al 2020 another study implemented a hybrid deep learning algorithm with neural network decision tree and boosting to generate groundwater potential map and those algorithms have satisfactory predicted accuracy chen et al 2021 thus the ability of the deep learning algorithm was suitable to be used as the method to predict the groundwater potential map in anseong south korea another deep learning algorithm that has good performance and has not been used as a groundwater potential prediction method is the long short term memory lstm method hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the capability of lstm has been used in flood susceptibility mapping fang et al 2021 landslide susceptibility mapping xiao et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 and habitat potential mapping lee and rezaie 2021 the lstm algorithm has the advantage to learn hidden long term sequential dependencies data the effectiveness of the lstm method was promising to be applied in groundwater potential mapping yang et al 2017 therefore the main objective of this study was to generate a groundwater potential map for anseong south korea using two algorithms based on the convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm methods to our knowledge this is the first study to describe groundwater potential mapping via cnn and lstm algorithms in this study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed in the anseong si area located in the southernmost part of gyeonggi do province at 127 19 e 36 82 n fig 1 it borders pyeongtaek in the west icheon in the northeast cheonan jincheon and eumseong in the south and yongin in the north in general the northeastern part of the study area has considerably higher elevation compared with the southwestern part the charyeong range which stretches from south to north divides the region into eastern and western portions the cheongmicheon river flows to the east the ancheongcheon joryeongcheon and hancheon rivers flow westward before entering the yellow sea to the south mt seounsan 547 m forms the provincial border with chungcheongbuk do and chungcheongnam do the entire area of the city is surrounded by high and low mountains with the appearance of folding screens to the south and the west hills of moderate to old age are present along with plains formed through the action of rivers the geology of anseong is mostly composed of daebo granite from the jurassic period in addition precambrian gneisses are found in the south schists belonging to the dansan formation are present in the north in the areas of juksan myeon geumgwang myeon and seoun myeon alternating layers of precambrian shale and sandstones were apparently affected by gneissification forming the rock formations visible today the rock floors in this area consist of biotite and gneiss they are of neutral quality showing well developed foliation located in the central region of south korea anseong has a transitional climate between that the northern and southern regions of the country its climate is characterized by local geographic conditions including expansive plains that stretch from the charyeong range the region s climate is characterized by a wide temperature range with hot and humid summers as well as winters that are cold and dry because of its geographic location the study area has a continental climate anseong has a precipitation level suitable for cultivation of paddy rice and other crops the amount of rainfall increases during the rice growth period of june july and august supporting the production of high quality gyeonggi rice 2 2 groundwater potential inventory map training and testing dataset construction in this study a groundwater potential inventory map was produced using groundwater productivity data calculated from groundwater transmissivity t data which were obtained from 295 groundwater wells in anseong si area the data were acquired through national groundwater surveys conducted by the korea water resource corporation lee et al 2020b the t values greater than the median value were selected to identify groundwater potential areas then converted those values into binary data of 1 the remaining 0 values represented t values less than the median value arabameri et al 2019 fadhillah et al 2021 thus a value of 1 represented above median t values while 0 represented below median t values oh et al 2011 data with binary values of 1 were separated from data with values of 0 each resulting dataset was randomly divided such that 70 of the input values became training data while the remaining 30 of values were used as testing data next the training datasets consisting of 1 and 0 values were combined as were the testing datasets of 1 and 0 values the proportions of groundwater data used for the training 70 and testing 30 datasets were suitable for generating a groundwater potential map arabameri et al 2021a chen et al 2019 lee et al 2020b transmissivity represents the flow rate in hydraulic units and specific capacity has been strongly correlated with hydrogeological factors lee et al 2018 the empirical relationship between specific capacity and transmissivity can be calculated using eq 1 razack and huntley 1991 1 t k q s 0 67 where t is aquifer transmissivity k is the common measure of transmissivity and specific capacity q is the constant discharge rate of a well and s is drawdown in the pumping well a decrease in drawdown of the pumping well and a higher discharge rate produce high t values razack and huntley 1991 2 3 groundwater potential related factors based on a literature review 14 factors related to groundwater were identified for use in this study table 1 these included the topo hydrological factors of elevation slope aspect slope length ls factor valley depth terrain ruggedness index tri and topographic wetness index twi altafi dadgar et al 2017 arabameri et al 2020a 2019 bui et al 2019a condon and maxwell 2015 in addition the geo environmental factors of lithology forest factors e g forest type forest density forest diameter and forest age and land use were considered in this study arabameri et al 2020b 2020a huajie et al 2016 serele et al 2020 topo hydrological maps of elevation slope aspect ls factor valley depth tri and twi were derived from a digital elevation model from the shuttle radar topography mission with resolution of 30 m construction of the topo hydrological factor maps was conducted using basic terrain analysis tools in gis software hakim et al 2020 lee and kim 2020 elevation fig 2a was associated with precipitation levels in regions with higher elevations runoff is greater and infiltration is low despite greater precipitation abdollahi et al 2019 duan et al 2016 the level of groundwater recharge was associated with the infiltration rate and the two factors that influence the infiltration rate were slope fig 2b and aspect fig 2c on a steeper slope the water flow rate is high which reduces the infiltration rate over time oikonomidis et al 2015 preeja et al 2011 furthermore aspect is related to groundwater recharge because aspect can affect moisture preservation and the amount of vegetation over an area pradhan et al 2014 the ls factor fig 2d represents the effect of slope length and can be used to determine water behavior that affects groundwater potential fadhillah et al 2021 valley depth fig 2e is the elevation difference between the base level and the upstream ridge level tri fig 2f is a parameter that quantifies surface roughness valley depth and tri have been used in previous several studies to construct groundwater potential maps arabameri et al 2020b kim et al 2019 lee et al 2020b panahi et al 2020b twi fig 2g provides information regarding the spatial distributions of hydrological variables such as infiltration potential and soil moisture twi can also reflect the relationship between water accumulation at any location and the gravitational force driving water downslope sørensen et al 2006 higher values of twi are positively correlated with groundwater availability nampak et al 2014 lithology is an important factor for describing groundwater in a particular area yeh et al 2016 lithology can affect groundwater recharge because of its influence on water movement through porous material hong et al 2015 mandal et al 2016 the lithology of the study area was divided into 3 main lithologies fig 2h qa quarternary alluvium pcetgn precambrian tourmaline gneiss and jggr jurassic hornblende biotite granite in addition to lithology groundwater was closely associated with land use which can affect groundwater recharge and groundwater extraction lerner and harris 2009 miraki et al 2019 yeh et al 2016 land use types were divided into seven categories fig 2i agricultural area 39 49 barren land 1 49 forest area 43 89 grassland 3 99 marshland 0 81 urban area 8 49 and water body 1 85 the lithology and land use maps used in this study were provided by the korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources lee et al 2019 the soil material type in anseong was dominated by metamorphic rock acid rock and quaternary alluvium fig 2j the soil factor was influenced porosity and controls the infiltration to the aquifers system fadhillah et al 2021 lee and lee 2015b the forest factors were important because the largest area 43 89 area in anseong was covered with forest anseong included 6 types of forest fig 2k pk nut pine forest 4 14 d pine forest 3 55 pr pitch pine forest 7 49 m mixed forest 15 13 pl larch 2 93 and h deciduous trees 10 76 as shown in fig 2l the forest density could be divided into low 0 33 moderate 11 76 and high density areas 29 90 forest diameter was divided into 3 classes fig 2m small 2 41 medium 24 11 and large 17 91 forest age was divided into 6 classes fig 2n from 1 to 51 years old 2 4 general methodology the methodology employed in this study involved four main steps preparation of the database analysis of spatial correlation development and training of the model for groundwater potential mapping and assessment of model performance based on accuracy fig 3 database preparation began with groundwater yield data based on transmissivity values collected from 295 wells the groundwater data were randomly divided into datasets of 70 training data and 30 testing data the training data were used to generate groundwater potential maps and the testing data were used to validate the model the distributions of training and testing data are shown in fig 1 gis factors related to groundwater potential were identified using the fr model which can predict potential probabilistic correlations between the presence of groundwater and each class of every factor hakim and lee 2020 kadirhodjaev et al 2020 the ratio between the proportion of pixels for each groundwater potential related factor and the proportion of pixels showing groundwater potential was obtained using eq 2 as follows 2 fr pixel of groundwater productivity pixel of groundwater class the fr values obtained for each class of groundwater potential related factors were used to generate groundwater potential maps by employing a deep learning algorithm based on cnn and lstm methods finally the groundwater potential models were validated through receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis based on area under the roc curve auc values 2 5 cnn the cnn deep learning algorithm is based on a neural network a cnn includes 4 main layers convolutional process activation process pooling process and fully connected li et al 2021 thi ngo et al 2021 wang et al 2019 the convolutional process layer can identify connections among feature classes simultaneously based on features extracted from the input images khosravi et al 2020 the second layer is the activation layer in this study the rectified linear unit was used in the activation layer because this unit can effectively improve the non linear properties of the neural network lee et al 2020a panahi et al 2021b sameen et al 2020 thi ngo et al 2021 the third layer is the pooling layer which can prevent the problem of overfitting in the neural network by using downsampling to reduce the dimensions of feature classes before all classes are processed in the fully connected layer lee et al 2020a the last layer is the fully connected layer which integrates data in the neural network and produces the final output khosravi et al 2020 panahi et al 2021b 2 6 lstm the lstm deep learning algorithm is based on a recurrent neural network this algorithm was designed to process sequential data across intervals in excess of one thousand steps hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 lstm consists of memory blocks containing memory cells that remember or store the temporal state of information in the network they are controlled by units known as gates azzouni and pujolle 2017 the lstm integrates memory units to allow the network to learn when to forget a previous hidden state and when to update a hidden state with new information ismail et al 2018 the lstm unit contains three main gates the input gate i t responsible for controlling the flow of incoming information the forget gate f t responsible for controlling the amount of information retained from the previous memory state and the output gate o t responsible for controlling the flow of outgoing information ismail et al 2018 vu et al 2021 the processes occurring among these three gates are described by eq 3 as follows 3 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f o t σ w i h t 1 x t b 0 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b f c t f t c t 1 i i c t h t o t tanh c t where i t is the input gate f t is the forget gate o t is the output gate c t is the input modulation gate c t is the memory cell and h t is a hidden unit at a specific time point t the input for a lstm cell is x t and h t 1 ct 1 is its previous cell state consisting of previously obtained information in the lstm architecture w b σ and tanh are the weighted matrices bias vector sigmoid function and hyperbolic tangent function respectively azzouni and pujolle 2017 ismail et al 2018 lee and rezaie 2021 vu et al 2021 yang et al 2017 3 results 3 1 relationships of groundwater potential with related factors the relationships of groundwater potential related factors with groundwater productivity can be assessed through the calculation of fr values as shown in table 2 fr values greater than 1 indicate that the class is closely correlated with the inventory map pradhan et al 2014 the 4 classes in areas with elevations of 5 208 m had fr values greater than 1 indicating that lower elevation areas of anseong city have greater potential to contain groundwater aquifers the three lowest slope classes namely 0 3 3 8 and 8 17 also had high fr values of 1 52 1 07 and 1 34 respectively the aspect data indicated that the probability of groundwater potential is concentrated in the flat northern southwestern and western portions of the study area which had fr values of approximately 1 17 1 55 1 30 and 1 12 respectively the ls factor classes of 0 2 and 10 26 had fr values of approximately 1 59 and 1 17 respectively the highest class of valley depth 166 280 had a high fr value of 1 96 the highest fr values for tri were assigned to the classes of 0 8 and 18 36 for twi the highest fr values were assigned to the classes of 7 8 and 8 23 among geological factors kmz cretaceous mineralized zone pcepgn precambrian porphyroblastic gneiss and kad cretaceous acidic dike were the lithological classes with the highest fr values for groundwater potential land use classes of marsh urban area barren land and agriculture area were associated with high probabilities of groundwater potential based on fr values soil material of the acid rock type was likely to be found in groundwater potential areas forest of the pitch pine type had the highest fr value among forest types for forest factors e g type density diameter and age the non forest areas had the highest fr value among classes indicating that the non forest areas of anseong have the highest probability of groundwater potential 3 2 groundwater potential maps groundwater potential maps of anseong were generated using 14 groundwater potential related factors model results for the cnn and lstm algorithms are shown in fig 4a b respectively the groundwater potential indices were divided into five classes through classification of each pixel using quantile methods to create five probability classes very low low moderate high and very high 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of variable importance assessment of variable importance was conducted to remove factors with poor predictive power from the models to increase model predictive accuracy based on information gain ratio igr analysis arabameri et al 2020b mori 2002 panahi et al 2021a igr is a commonly used method for feature selection in which a high value represents a strong influence on the predictions of the model arabameri et al 2021b dodangeh et al 2020 panahi et al 2020a as a feature selection method igr is an entropy based method that considers only important factors and ranks the results in decreasing order bui et al 2018 igr was calculated using eq 4 where t is the training data rf is the related factor and s plit entropy t rf is the information acquired via division of the training data by the groundwater potential related factor 4 igr t rf entropy t entropy t rf split entropy t rf the igr values representing a ranking of factor influences are shown in fig 5 according to those results forest type is the most important factor with an igr value of 0 58 followed by forest age 0 51 forest diameter 0 49 forest density 0 45 land use 0 43 tri 0 41 slope 0 40 elevation 0 33 lithology 0 33 ls factor 0 28 soil material 0 27 twi 0 25 valley depth 0 17 and aspect 0 03 the most meaningful factors in this study which were used to generate the groundwater potential map were the forest factors and land use our analysis showed that non forest areas which consist of agriculture area barren land marsh and urban areas were highly likely to be groundwater potential areas the forest area in this study area was located in a mountainous area that has a high elevation and steeper slope the higher the elevation area was possibly having the lower seasonal distribution precipitation gain abdollahi et al 2019 the steeper slope can increase the runoff and the water flow and decrease the infiltration rate oikonomidis et al 2015 preeja et al 2011 the train and test data from the field surveys were acquired from an accessible area those areas with the forest were located in the hilly area that makes the distribution of the train and test was less in the forest area 4 2 model performance evaluation the validation step of assessing the model accuracy achieved using cnn and lstm algorithms was conducted using roc curve analysis fawcett 2006 saha et al 2021 roc curve analysis is the standard method used to evaluate the performance of predictive models based on auc values along with training and validation datasets it has been used in several potential mapping applications including groundwater potential mapping arabameri et al 2020a falah and zeinivand 2019 panahi et al 2020b and habitat potential mapping choi et al 2011 lee et al 2015 lee and rezaie 2021 auc values were determined to compare the performance of groundwater potential models through model validation using 30 of the total dataset i e test data roc curve analysis as shown in fig 6 indicated that the lstm algorithm orange line had the highest accuracy whereas the cnn algorithm blue line had the lowest accuracy the lstm model with an auc value of approximately 0 809 had better predictive ability than did the cnn model with an auc value of approximately 0 801 the lstm model has the benefit of having the forget gate in the process to filter out the non necessary information from the input data and resulting in higher accuracy from the predicted models fang et al 2021 nevertheless the accuracy of cnn can be achieved because of its ability to handle the complex process without prior information of the input data with larger scale features due to convolution and pooling layer zuo et al 2019 in addition the optimization to the process of selecting the parameter input of both algorithms could improve the accuracy of the predicted models 5 conclusion groundwater potential maps were generated for anseong using the cnn and lstm algorithms in total 14 groundwater potential related factors including topo hydrological and geo environmental factors were used in this study the spatial correlations of these factors with groundwater productivity data were assessed through fr analysis groundwater inventory maps consisting of groundwater productivity data from 295 wells were divided into training and testing data at a ratio of 70 30 igr analysis was performed to identify the most influential factors affecting groundwater potential area the igr results indicated that non forest area e g agricultural area barren land marshland and urban areas had the greatest influence on increasing the probability of groundwater potential in a particular area the probability models generated using the lstm algorithm slightly outperformed the probability models generated using the cnn algorithm based on auc values greater than 0 5 groundwater potential maps generated using the cnn and lstm algorithms can be used for prediction of areas with good groundwater potential future research should include the development of an ensemble method that uses a metaheuristic optimization algorithm to improve model performance finally the groundwater potential maps produced in this study can be used by local governments and decision makers to assist with development planning and identification of adequate groundwater resources to meet daily needs credit authorship contribution statement wahyu luqmanul hakim writing

8082,study region the salar del huasco is an undeveloped basin in the arid chilean altiplano study focus this study aims to investigate potential impacts of climate change on the aquifer of the salar del huasco basin to better manage groundwater resources in the chilean altiplano with this purpose precipitation and temperature projections from multiple general circulation models were statistically downscaled using the hybrid delta approach to produce ensemble scenarios groundwater recharge was estimated for each scenario based on a rainfall runoff model that was used to drive a numerical groundwater model whose results were used to evaluate the future behavior of the aquifer under each scenario from 2020 to 2100 new hydrological insights for the study region this study found that higher precipitation would contribute to larger groundwater recharge rates additionally results showed that the aquifer is able to withstand the impacts of climate change through the balance of its water components maintaining thus stable levels in areas of ecological value since the study site is one of the few remaining undeveloped groundwater basins the results obtained represent the natural response of the system to climate change without interference from anthropogenic factors and thus serve as a baseline basin that could be used for comparative purposes this contributes to a better quantification of aquifer dynamics in the altiplano allowing the evaluation of future protective measures to ensure survival of similar groundwater dependent ecosystems in the area graphical abstract

third of the planet s fresh water for domestic agricultural and industrial uses bloomfield et al 2019 taylor et al 2013 velis et al 2017 predicted climate change poses a threat for groundwater resources most of which are non renewable on meaningful timescales for humans and ecosystems kløve et al 2013 future projections predict an increase in the mean global temperatures as well as an increase in the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events ipcc 2014 nkhonjera and dinka 2017 on one hand central chile latitude 30ºs has experienced a drying trend since the mid 20th century which is expected to continue in the future leading to a reduction in average annual precipitation of up to 40 relative to current values garreaud et al 2020 this region has experienced a significant decrease in rainfall since the late 1970s which has been evidenced by more frequent drought events rivera et al 2020 on the other hand increasing trends have been found in average annual precipitation in the bolivian altiplano torres batlló and martí cardona 2020 and in annual precipitation in northern chile dga 2017 souvignet et al 2012 however there is still great uncertainty concerning future precipitation changes across the andes urrutia and vuille 2009 while there is general agreement on future increasing temperature trends in the region dga 2017 given these projections understanding the effects of climate change on groundwater becomes of utmost importance different studies have evaluated potential consequences of climate change on groundwater decreased snowpack given a reduction in snow accumulation due to more precipitation in the form of rain is likely to reduce river flow in summer months and greater evaporation rates will increase water demand of crops thus increasing groundwater extraction and leading to its depletion alam et al 2019 amanambu et al 2020 nkhonjera and dinka 2017 taylor et al 2013 water shortage problems derived from changes in perception lead to groundwater depletion which is particularly critical in arid and semi arid environments where groundwater discharge dominates the water balance rossman et al 2018 velis et al 2017 and becomes even more crucial since population and groundwater demand in arid regions are expected to increase huang et al 2015 nkhonjera and dinka 2017 scanlon et al 2006 taylor et al 2013 additionally arid zones are projected to expand to cover up to half of the terrestrial surface by the end of the century which will diminish the natural retention or sequestration of carbon huang et al 2015 koutroulis 2019 prăvălie 2016 prăvălie et al 2019 general circulation models gcms have become the primary tool for the study of projected climate change impacts on hydrological systems persaud et al 2020 gcms simulate the behavior and interaction of flow systems in the biosphere hydrosphere cryosphere atmosphere and geosphere in the climate system green et al 2011 huang et al 2015 scanlon et al 2006 taylor et al 2013 climate change scenarios established in the fifth report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc are expressed in terms of representative concentration pathways rcp which provide quantitative information of the concentration in time of contaminants associated to climate change however the coarse resolution of gcm outputs prevents them from being used directly with local basin scale models because they do not represent processes taking place at scales finer than their own grids which are generally of the order of 200 km fowler et al 2007 green et al 2011 persaud et al 2020 wilby et al 1998 therefore downscaling techniques are required to bring the gcm s raw data into the local scale for them to be applicable in basin scale models previous studies have used gcm projections to evaluate potential effects of climate change on hydrogeological systems through different approaches studies by crosbie et al 2011 2013 hartmann et al 2017 hashemi et al 2015 holman 2006 mckenna and sala 2018 rossman et al 2018 tillman et al 2016 and zhang et al 2019 focused on groundwater recharge or unsaturated zone processes but differed in the number of gcms and scenarios considered for future projections as well as in the methodology applied for estimating recharge other studies have assessed groundwater recharge uncertainty under future conditions goderniaux et al 2015 shen et al 2018 xie et al 2018 groundwater modeling has been applied to investigate future impacts of climate change on aquifers and their interaction with surface waters persaud

usman et al 2020 xu and su 2019 nevertheless there will always be uncertainty associated with climate models particularly in mountainous regions such as the central andes where the topography changes abruptly hindering its correct representation in models with large grids vuille et al 2008 therefore studies that incorporate multiple scenarios to investigate hydrological and hydrogeological systems in arid catchments with complex topography such as the chilean altiplano are still scarce recent studies have investigated the hydrological processes occurring in the andean chilean altiplano to evaluate groundwater recharge herrera et al 2016 2021 uribe et al 2015 urrutia et al 2019 to assess evaporation de la fuente et al 2021 hernández lópez et al 2014 mosre and suárez 2021 suárez et al 2020 water table fluctuations viguier et al 2019a 2019b and wetland dynamics de la fuente and meruane 2017 de la fuente et al 2021 additionally numerical groundwater modeling has been used to study the impacts of anthropogenic exploitation marazuela et al 2020 marazuela et al 2019b 2019a samuel et al 2020 scheihing and tröger 2018 scheihing et al 2017 nonetheless to the best of the authors knowledge there are no studies that have used numerical groundwater modeling to study and quantify the impacts of climate change in the chilean altiplano despite this being essential to manage water resources in a sustainable way and to ensure the survival of groundwater dependent ecosystems the main objective of this research is to develop a methodology that allows a proper management of groundwater resources in the chilean altiplano by 1 accounting for future uncertainty of climatic variables through ensemble scenarios and 2 assessing potential impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge groundwater levels and groundwater discharge fluxes to achieve this objective this research uses statistical downscaling techniques to process gcm outputs from different rcps to the local scale in an arid region in northern chile the downscaled outputs are used as input to a hydrological model for groundwater recharge estimation which is then used in a hydrogeological model to simulate the aquifer s response to future climate change scenarios defined in this study our analysis considers two main time spans a reference period 1981 2010 against which a future period 2020 2100 is evaluated therefore even when the incidence of climate is important in long term aquifer recharge in the central andes during the holocene herrera et al 2018 sáez et al 2016 our work focuses on time scales on the order of decades furthermore the focus of this research is to evaluate potential changes particularly in groundwater resources due to climate change in terms of water table changes and flow balance of the hydrogeological system therefore even though recharge is a fundamental process related to groundwater its particular aspects such as timing shifts and intersessional behavior of sub processes taking place in the vadose zone are not the main focus of this research the salar del huasco basin located in the chilean altiplano was chosen as our study site the basin lies in the presence of groundwater fed wetlands that sustain the life of unique flora and fauna de la fuente et al 2021 johnson et al 2010 the wetlands are located in the boundaries of the salt flat nucleus where groundwater springs form a shallow lake of 5 15 cm deep de la fuente and meruane 2016 lobos roco et al 2021 the salar del huasco is ecologically important because it is the home of three out of the six species of flamingos that exist in the world the andean flamingo the chilean flamingo and the james s flamingo which come to the salt flat to create their nests conaf 2005 it also shelters unique species such as andean foxes lamas vicuñas pumas among others as a result of this diversity the salt flat was declared a ramsar zone of protected wetlands in 1996 and a national park by the chilean government in 2020 given the importance of these wetlands in the study area the achieving of our objective is focused on the assessment of groundwater changes that could threaten future life in these groundwater dependent ecosystem due to climate change groundwater resources in the salar del huasco basin have had no human intervention and therefore all results obtained in this study represent the natural response of the system to the environmental forcing consequently this basin could be considered as a baseline against which to compare other basins in the area where intervention exists and thus be able to quantify the effects of such interventions in contrast with the natural response of the salar del huasco additionally we expect that our results could be further extended and be a helpful reference for groundwater assessment in similar areas worldwide 2 study area the salar del huasco is an endorheic basin located in the andean plateau of northern chile latitude 20 28 s and longitude 68 85 w fig 1 the basin extends over an area of 1470 km2 and it has a mean elevation of 4165 m asl its shallow lake is at the end of a well developed alluvial system draining from the north of the basin and constitutes the main water source that sustains life of unique flora and fauna species under extreme arid conditions de la fuente et al 2020 suárez et al 2020 2 1 geological settings the salar del huasco basin is bordered to the west by the altos de pica plateau which represents the water divide from pampa del tamarugal viguier et al 2019a 2019b and by the andes mountain range to the east that separates it from the bolivian basins of coipasa and empexa the salar del huasco basin was formed by volcanic activity that caused the emergence of mesozoic and paleozoic rocks to form the depressed basement area on which alluvial and lacustrine sedimentary materials were deposited as basin fill subsequently miocene rhyolitic tuffs with high degrees of welding originated from volcanic eruptions and deposited in the basin being the huasco ignimbrite the most important geological formation due to its extension and volume gardeweg and sellés 2015 tapia et al 2020 this volcanic activity gave rise to the andes mountain range closing the basin to the east which continued to fill with volcanic debris and pyroclastic materials dga 2009 in general the basin is considered a closed basin with little to no hydrologic connection to the neighboring basins previous studies using isotope and geochemical information have discarded a possible connection between the salar del huasco and the aquifer of pica risacher et al 1999 uribe et al 2015 however scheihing et al 2017 discarded this connection arguing that water from salar del huasco would have to travel a long way under the mountain range passing through geothermal deposits that would raise the temperature of water that discharge to pica since that is not the case they concluded that such connection does not exist consequently in this study the salar del huasco is considered a hydrogeologically closed basin until there is more evidence to confirm otherwise 2 2 climate two types of climates can be identified in the salar del huasco according to köppen classification system the tundra climate due to high altitudes of the andes and the cold desert climate the former is in the northeastern part of the basin while the latter is mainly in the southwestern part mean daily temperatures are around 4 14ºc depending on the altitude with great thermal oscillation between day and night in winter months the lowest temperatures reach 20ºc dga 2009 evaporation is the main water discharge mechanism of the basin with a mean annual potential evaporation of 1200 mm year de la fuente and meruane 2016 precipitation in this part of the altiplano occurs in the austral summer november through march as heavy convective storms originated by the intense surface heating that destabilizes the local troposphere and by the establishment of upper level easterly winds that transport moist air from the interior of the continent sáez et al 2016 garreaud 2009 garreaud et al 2003 interannual precipitation is highly variable ranging from 11 to 400 mm year garreaud et al 2003 hernández lópez et al 2014 although marked wet and dry periods can be identified on the millennial time scales sáez et al 2016 the el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon is the major source of the interannual variability in the altiplano garreaud 2009 it directly affects the coasts of ecuador perú and northern chile causing indirect effects on most of subtropical south america and higher latitudes garreaud et al 2009 given the large scale nature of this phenomenon in terms of its spatial and temporal extents its assessment is beyond the scope of this study however note that gcms used to study climate change do include these large scale phenomena in their formulation stocker 2014 2 3 hydrology the collacagua river is the main surface watercourse in the basin fig 1 it runs from north to south with daily flow rates that vary throughout the year in response to precipitation despite this the average monthly flow rates do not vary significantly throughout the year the upper section of the river at the río piga en collacagua fluviometric station has a daily average flow rate of 0 13 m 3 s while the downstream section at the río collacagua en peñablanca fluviometric station has an average of 0 15 m 3 s the river between these two fluviometric stations gains water during most of the year however downstream río collacagua en peñablanca the water from the river infiltrates as it gets near the salt flat nucleus the seasonal river flow dynamics are shown in the supplementary material section a in the topographic lowest point of the basin a salt flat nucleus that originated due to long term phreatic evaporation extends over 50 60 km2 the flow paths of mineral enriched groundwater converge and are discharged to the atmosphere through evaporation corenthal et al 2016 the salar del huasco aquifer discharges mainly into four springs that feed the wetlands located in the borders of the salt flat nucleus fig 1 records at gauging stations at these four springs provided by the chilean national water division dirección general de aguas dga show relatively stable discharges throughout the year with annual averages ranging from 8 10 3 to 23 10 3 m 3 s for the lowest and highest discharges respectively dga 2009 3 methods the general methodology followed in this study is based on three major steps the first step is to downscale temperature and precipitation outputs from multiple gcms so they can be used at the basin scale the projected scenarios used for climate change impacts assessment are also established in this step to represent different future conditions up to the end of the century the second step is to calculate groundwater recharge using the downscaled meteorological data for each projected climate scenario and the hydrologic model developed by uribe et al 2015 in the third step the groundwater recharge rates are used as inputs in the hydrogeological model of the salar del huasco aquifer the model then simulates the behavior of groundwater over time under each projected scenario 3 1 climate projections simulations of projected climate scenarios were carried out using the hybrid delta hd approach with precipitation and temperature offsets based on the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 multi model ensemble output ensemble models include all four rcps scenarios the hd method combines two well established downscaling techniques bias correction and spatial downscaling bcsd reclamation 2014 and the delta method dm approach tohver and hamlet 2014 here we briefly describe both techniques and how they are applied in the hd statistical downscaling as a first step of the hd approach the bcsd method is applied in the bcsd technique statistical properties of the cumulative distribution function cdf of climatic simulations from the gcms are adjusted according to the statistical properties of the observed cdf in a baseline period thus systematic bias of the gcm relative to the observed probability distribution is removed tohver and hamlet 2014 wood et al 2002 the second step consists of applying the dm in the dm monthly changes of variables projected by the gcms are determined and applied to monthly means of observations to do this the future is divided into time windows of equal length as the baseline observational period for that purpose the collacagua station was chosen given it was the only one with enough precipitation and temperature records in fact from 1980 to 2010 there is a complete temperature record and only one month february 1992 with no precipitation records in this case 30 year windows were defined according to the available data in the station 1981 2010 baseline period 2011 2040 near future 2041 2070 mid future and 2071 2100 far future these windows were defined so there are no time gaps between the baseline and the distant future therefore the downscaling results are continuously applied in the hydrological processes the changes or deltas are calculated for temperature and precipitation according to the following equations camici et al 2014 hamlet et al 2010 tohver and hamlet 2014 1 t dm fut t obs t gcm fut t gcm base 2 p dm fut p obs p gcm fut p gcm base where t is temperature and p is precipitation the subindices in eqs 1 and 2 are as follows obs corresponds to the observed variables dm is related to the variables corrected by that method and gcm base and gcm fut refer to the variables simulated by the climate models in the baseline period and in the future respectively the overbar reflects that the variables are monthly means for a step by step description of the hd method see hamlet et al 2010 and tohver and hamlet 2014 the final step in the hd approach is the temporal disaggregation from which future daily series of the downscaled variables are obtained daily time series are then used as input to the hydrological model this temporal disaggregation was performed according to tohver et al 2014 and vormoor and skaugen 2013 3 t fut daily t obs daily t fut monthly t obs monthly 4 p fut daily p obs daily p fut monthly p obs monthly where t fut daily and p fut daily are the daily future variables t obs daily and p obs daily are the observed daily temperature and precipitation data t fut monthly and p fut monthly are the future monthly values obtained by the hd method and t obs monthly and p obs monthly are the observed monthly temperature and precipitation data consequently the hd method perturbs the entire cdf as opposed to the traditional use of the dm that only perturbs the monthly means of the observed variable tohver and hamlet 2014 thereby future time series of temperature and precipitation represent the changes projected by the gcm while preserving at the same time its characteristics and behavior e g duration location interarrival time of storms given by the observed data at a local scale hamlet et al 2010 in this study the hd approach was applied to 219 climate models that include emission scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 to cover a larger range of climate projections and in the absence of a justification for choosing a particular rcp scenario hausner et al 2014 subsequently the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles of the downscaled variables were calculated to generate hybrid scenarios of temperature and precipitation that are not subjected to a particular radiative forcing but instead are a compound of different emission scenarios simulated by different models hausner et al 2016 to have a broader spectrum of possible future scenarios all precipitation and temperature percentiles were combined in the scenario definition as shown in table 1 where the 10th percentile sub index was replaced by min 50th by med and 90th by max for simplicity in doing so the hybrid scenarios take into consideration the large uncertainty that comes along with projected precipitation in the altiplano due to the coarse resolution of gcms that hinders an adequate representation of climatic gradients given by complex topographies urrutia and vuille 2009 3 2 groundwater recharge estimations the semi distributed hydrological model developed by uribe et al 2015 for the salar del huasco catchment was used to predict groundwater recharge under the climate change scenarios previously defined the model uses as inputs the downscaled mean temperature and precipitation estimates of reference evaporation et o at a daily basis are also used to obtain groundwater recharge et o mm day was calculated using the fao modified blaney criddle 1950 equation doorenbos and pruitt 1977 5 e t o a b c 0 46 t mean 8 13 where a and b are fitting parameters c is the mean annual percentage of daylight hours and t mean is the monthly mean temperature the fitting parameters a and b were estimated using observed monthly pan evaporation data at collacagua station in the period between january 1981 and december 2010 corrected by a pan factor of 0 7 as suggested by dga 2009 eq 5 was selected to estimate future projections of et o since it is a simple approach that uses t mean as an input variable in climate ensembles t mean is more reliable than other variables that are required for estimating et o with more sophisticated models e g the penman monteith thornwaite or hargreaves equations allen et al 2011 the rainfall runoff model used in this study was previously developed and validated by uribe et al 2015 for the salar del huasco basin and it is based on the soil moisture accounting routine sma of the hec hms model feldman 2000 hydrologic engineering center us 2001 for its development they defined five hydrologic response units hru fig 2b according to the hydrogeological characteristics of the basin whose connectivity was set using a 90 m resolution digital model elevation dem from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm hru r1 was defined as rocks with very low effective porosity and without fractures r2 represents fractured rocks with significant effective porosity s1 represents lacustrine and evaporite deposits s2 corresponds to alluvial and colluvial deposits and s3 represents fluvial deposits a set of 15 parameters were defined for representing the hydrological processes at each hru which were calibrated and validated using stream flow records between 1978 and 2010 at station río piga en collacagua here we provide a brief description of this model for a detailed description of the model structure the reader is referred to section b of the supplementary material and to uribe et al 2015 for details on the model configuration such as hru definition the parameters involved and their calibration long term recharge characterization and model performance the rainfall runoff model simulates the hydraulic processes occurring at the surface and soil in hrus through mass balance relationships in four reservoirs that represent the different levels of the system at daily time steps fig 2a the reservoirs simulate 1 canopy storage 2 surface detention 3 unsaturated soil processes and 4 the saturated zone the basic mechanism behind the balance in each reservoir is that the incoming water can change its storage evaporate become runoff or percolate into the next reservoir uribe et al 2015 in the canopy storage reservoir precipitation intercepted by vegetation s foliage evaporates while the remaining precipitation that was not captured passes as input to the next reservoir since vegetation species that develop in this arid zone have little or no foliage canopy storage is almost negligible modifications made by uribe et al 2015 to adjust the model to the climatic conditions of the salar del huasco consisted in the simulation of freezing at the unsaturated zone by introducing a temporal lag if the daily mean temperature is below 0 ºc and the simulation of groundwater routing using a series of linear reservoirs to better represent the generated hydrograph the former modification was meant to represent the general behavior of the basin at low temperatures sublimation or a more detailed representation of snow melting are not included in this model to justify the use of a simplified mechanism instead of a more complex representation of snow related processes we used landsat images acquired from usgs s earth explorer earthexplorer usgs gov to estimate the number of pixels with snow in the months in which it occurs in the baseline period to do this we calculated the normalized difference snow index ndsi and estimated the percentage of area that the pixels with snow represent of the total basin we found that the average snow coverage between 1986 and 2010 is of 1 52 of the total basin and the median value is of 0 46 which supports the simplification of uribe et al 2015 already validated model the mass balance in the vadose zone reservoir depends on the soil s storage capacity the percolation rate to the next reservoir and the meteorological conditions of the day being analyzed additionally a temporal lag in evaporation and infiltration processes is represented when temperatures are too low the outputs of the balance in the saturated zone are the deep percolation and the baseflow the latter calculated as a series of linear reservoirs to simulate the routing hydrograph through the basin groundwater recharge is defined as the total amount of water entering the saturated zone which can become deep percolation or baseflow uribe et al 2015 the usefulness of the saturated zone reservoir is that it allows simulating the processes of deep percolation and baseflow separately allowing the latter to be used to calibrate the parameters of the hydrological model in the sma routine of the hec hms model hydrologic engineering center us 2001 the rate of percolation between the soil profile storage and the saturated zone i e groundwater recharge depends on the volume in the source and receiving reservoirs it is calculated as a function of a maximum percolation rate and the contents of the storage from which percolation is occurring bennett and peters 2004 the maximum percolation rate and maximum storage capacity of each reservoir are parameters that are different for each hru of the model their values are determined after calibrating the model and future simulations of groundwater recharge are performed under the assumption that they remain constant in time since changes in vegetation would impact soil parameters due to root uptake and transpiration it is assumed that variations in vegetation patches in the basin does not change dramatically in the future actual evaporation from the subsurface e a is among the calculations performed by the hydrological model to obtain groundwater recharge this value is further used to calculate how much water remains from et o that is still available to be evaporated in the aquifer which we define as remnant evaporation e rem note that recharge resulting from the hydrological model is used as input to the groundwater flow model and is therefore considered as actual recharge as it reaches the water table de silva and rushton 2007 scanlon et al 2002 3 3 groundwater flow model development the groundwater flow model used to simulate the behavior of the aquifer under each scenario was developed in modflow harbaugh et al 2000 which is a widely used numerical model that solves the groundwater flow equation through a porous media in three dimensions and can represent groundwater and surface water interactions the main focus of our research is to assess the effects of climate change by analyzing changes in future simulations with respect a baseline period rather than analyzing absolute values of potentiometric surfaces and therefore effects of variable density were not considered since they are not expected to affect such changes furthermore given the ecological importance that exists in the surroundings of the wetlands we gave especial attention to this area the model was built using the open source interface modelmuse winston 2009 the geometry of the model consists of 270 rows 253 columns and 10 layers fig 3 that discretize three main aquifers the vertical discretization of the three aquifers into 10 layers was defined to avoid convergence problems associated with cell dimensions which was done using the uniform spacing option in modelmuse winston 2009 no flow boundary condition were set at the edges of the model according to previous hydrogeological and geochemical studies risacher et al 1999 scheihing et al 2017 the model was run under steady state conditions for the baseline period and under transient conditions for the future projections in the latter monthly stress periods were used from 2020 to 2100 the spatially distributed monthly groundwater recharge projections obtained from the hydrological model were incorporated in the groundwater flow model using modflow s recharge package rch harbaugh et al 2000 more specifically monthly recharge rates calculated with the rainfall runoff model described in section 3 2 were imported to modelmuse using a shapefile to distribute them throughout the model domain according to the sub basin spatial distribution fig 2b the collacagua river was represented in the groundwater model using the river package riv harbaugh et al 2000 an average river depth of 10 cm and conductance of 0 06 0 12 m2 s were assigned along the course of the collacagua river these values were defined after the steady state calibration to represent the flux interacting with the aquifer acosta 2004 the four springs located near the wetlands were represented in the model using the drain package drn harbaugh et al 2000 the stage and conductance of each drain were defined and calibrated using dga s records of fluviometric stations at the springs which are available at www dga cl groundwater evaporation was modeled with the evapotranspiration package evt harbaugh et al 2000 and was defined near the wetlands and streambed of the collacagua river where the water table is shallow enough to allow groundwater evaporation a potential evaporation of 6 3 mm day was defined in the steady state simulation according to pan evaporation records in collacagua meteorological station between april 1994 and may 2007 acosta and custodio 2008 uribe 2012 in the transient simulations monthly evaporation rates were introduced corresponding to the simulated e rem which represents the water available for evaporation in the aquifer the extinction depth was set to 3 m beneath the surface typical for arid saline soils shanafield et al 2015 and in agreement with et measurements performed in the basin with the portable chamber method dga 2009 johnson et al 2010 to avoid confusion in the rest of the document we use the term groundwater evaporation to refer to this discharge while the term groundwater recharge refers to the output of the hydrological model which includes the evaporation at the subsurface i e e a 3 4 groundwater flow model calibration and simulations a steady state simulation was performed to represent the long term historical last 40 years behavior of the aquifer to ensure the adequate representation of conceptual model inflows and outflows of the groundwater system according to previous studies acosta and custodio 2008 dga 2009 johnson et al 2010 uribe et al 2015 a manual calibration of hydraulic conductivity was performed using observed levels at 44 monitoring wells fig 4 using the minimum of the mean absolute error mae as objective function bennett et al 2013 an ideal model would achieve a mae of 0 nevertheless the model is considered accurate if the mae is less than 5 of the largest difference of observed data sea 2012 the performance of the model was then evaluated with the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 indicators bennett et al 2013 due to the state of conservation that protects the salar del huasco basin from human intervention there is little data on aquifer levels over the baseline period which are required to perform a transient calibration thus hydraulic conductivities were calibrated through a steady state calibration and storage values in the aquifer were assigned based on previous studies acosta and custodio 2008 dga 2009 despite not having long time series of groundwater level information over the baseline period records from 2005 and 2014 sea 2019 along with isolated records from november 2018 suárez et al 2020 were used to validate the model the available groundwater levels are presented in section a of the supplementary material the groundwater model was used to simulate the aquifer s behavior in the baseline period january 1981 december 2010 and in different future scenarios starting in the near future until the end of the century january 2020 december 2100 the results of this simulation characterized the aquifer behavior in a reference period against which future climate change simulations were compared 4 results 4 1 climate projections future precipitation and temperature scenarios 10th percentile denoted by subscript min 50th percentile med and 90th percentile max projected with the hd approach are compared at a daily basis with observations in the baseline period table 2 scenarios percentile from min to max are chosen to set guidelines for determining the system sensitivity to climate change future temperature scenarios in all three time windows project a daily increasing trend in maximum mean and median temperatures in comparison with the baseline period differences can be noted between scenarios though where projected values increase from t min to t max unlike temperatures projected precipitation behaves differently in each scenario substantial differences are observed in the mean and maximum statistics where in all three future windows p max s mean and maximum exceed those in the baseline period while in p min the opposite occurs increasing and decreasing trends can also be easily distinguished between scenarios at monthly basis fig 5 where all temperature scenarios project a total increase while precipitation varies throughout the scenarios defined in table 1 4 2 groundwater recharge 4 2 1 baseline period the hydrological model was run first for the baseline period to simulate historical groundwater recharge the model took approximately seven years to stabilize and after this spin up period groundwater recharge is relatively stable in time with an estimated value of 42 9 27 9 mm yr mean standard deviation fig 6 over the model domain groundwater recharge varies with seasons with peaks occurring mostly during summer months which means that summer precipitation is transformed almost immediately into groundwater recharge 4 2 2 future projections scenarios that project an increase in recharge represent those with the highest precipitation input p max corresponding to the cross wet and extreme high scenarios fig 7 both scenarios differ in their temperature inputs which greatly affects seasonal variability of recharge higher temperatures in the extreme high scenario allow for higher percolation in winter months in comparison with the cross wet scenario reducing the differences between summer and winter recharge as opposed to what occurs in the cross wet scenario however an overall greater recharge is generated in the cross wet since the higher temperatures of the extreme high scenario produce higher evaporation rates in the surface reducing the amount of water that infiltrates and transforms into recharge temperature effects can also be observed in scenarios with the lowest precipitation input p min as mentioned before higher temperatures mean that groundwater recharge does not decrease as much in winter months due to the relatively warmer temperatures as a result the cross dry scenario has an overall greater recharge in comparison with extreme low which is the scenario that projects the lowest recharge rates table 3 shows projected changes in groundwater recharge for the mid and far future periods with respect to the baseline period the near future period was not included in table 3 since future simulations start in 2020 positive changes are projected in both periods in scenarios with increasing recharge while negative changes are projected otherwise finally fig 8 shows seasonal changes projected per each scenario by the end of the century in terms of monthly mean recharge throughout the year over the far future period 2071 2100 in comparison with the baseline simulation blue dashed line fig 8 allows assessing groundwater recharge changes not only in magnitude but also in terms of its behavior between seasons taking that into account the groundwater recharge behavior in the cross wet scenario is the one that most closely resembles that of the baseline but with higher magnitudes regarding magnitudes recharge in the median and cross dry scenario are closest to the baseline in winter months may through august while in summer recharge in the extreme high scenario is the closest also the effect of temperature in recharge in winter in scenarios with higher temperatures cross dry and extreme high mentioned above can also be observed in fig 8 where less variations between winter and summer can be observed 4 3 groundwater model 4 3 1 steady state simulation the mae in the steady state simulation was of 6 4 m which corresponds to 4 2 of the largest observed difference rmse and r 2 values of 9 55 m and 0 98 m respectively indicate a good model performance with an overall good fit simulated levels close to the 1 1 line the map in fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the calibration performance at each well given by the size of the circular marker that increases along with the difference between observations and simulations it can be thus noted that groundwater levels are being better represented at lower altitudes in the basin which includes the area of the wetlands and their surroundings using the groundwater levels registered in nine observation wells in the november 2018 field campaign a mae of 9 m which corresponds to 5 8 of the largest observed difference and a r 2 of 0 90 were obtained 4 3 2 baseline period water discharge from the springs and the river are the fluxes that remain most stable in time while evaporation is the discharge with the largest variation fig 9 the median evaporation rate is null signifying half of the time water is not being discharged through this process but when evaporation occurs its magnitude varies greatly reaching up to 1 8 m 3 s 38 6 mm yr zero groundwater evaporation means that the water table is below the extinction depth of evaporation and consequently the aquifer is not discharging by evaporation in the stress periods when that occurs thus despite the high magnitudes that can be reached by evaporation its average is below that of the groundwater recharge 4 3 3 future projections the groundwater model was used to simulate future behavior of the system using the projected recharge for each scenario the obtained results are analyzed in terms of mass balance components and equipotential contours groundwater recharge corresponds to the only external source of water entering the aquifer groundwater surface water interactions vary along the river course starting from the northern most elevated alluvial parts of the basin where the river has a gaining reach until the river reaches the lowest elevations near the salt flat nucleus where it becomes a losing river however the net interaction between the river and the aquifer results in a groundwater discharge towards the river referred to from here on as river discharge in most scenarios changes projected in mass balance components with respect to the baseline period in the mid and far future periods are presented in table 3 which shows 25th 50th and 75th percentiles of flow changes note that the 25th and 50th percentiles of groundwater evaporation are zero which means that most of the time evaporation is not from the aquifer but it is only occurring at ground surface both in the baseline and future scenarios positive changes in the 75th percentile result from the scenarios that project an increase in recharge while negative changes are observed in the ones where recharge decreases see section c of the supplementary material additionally despite the slight projected changes reported in table 3 spring discharge is the most stable flux in both future periods with the lowest percentage of change with respect the baseline period scenarios with increasing recharge are the ones that project greater changes in all discharge fluxes showing the buffering behavior of the basin table 3 fig 11 shows the simulated equipotential contours of climate change scenarios by the end of the year 2100 as well as the contours resulting from the baseline simulation by the end of 2010 in the sector of the wetlands looking at the shape of this equipotential line it is possible to observe that the 2100 equipotential map of the extreme high scenario is the one that most closely resembles that of 2010 in the baseline simulation while the rest of the future maps show changes in the shape of this contour 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater recharge future projections precipitation occurs mainly at higher altitudes and thus infiltration is greater in higher areas higher subbasins contributing thus to the overall increase in the total groundwater recharge temperature also plays a role although minor on groundwater recharge since the process of evaporation from the soil depends on it when higher temperatures are projected at higher elevations where temperatures are lowest within the basin more water is evaporated in the root zone increasing the space available in the soil reservoir for the incoming infiltration this increases the potential infiltration rate enhancing infiltration in areas where low temperatures normally limit the process nevertheless the effect of temperature on groundwater recharge is smaller than that of precipitation more details on the groundwater recharge produced in higher and lower subbasins and their contribution to the total recharge can be found in section d of the supplementary material other studies have also concluded that warmer temperatures reduce the amount of ground frost allowing more water infiltration that leads to increased groundwater recharge in cold regions jyrkama and sykes 2007 kovalevskii 2007 evaporation depends on two aspects the amount of precipitation entering the system and the et o defined for each scenario calculated with eq 5 for the three temperature percentiles as expected scenarios with higher precipitation i e cross wet and extreme high produced the largest e a rates since not all precipitation can be transformed into groundwater recharge in the same time step 5 2 groundwater model steady state simulation elevated parts of the basin as shown in fig 4 is where the greatest differences between observed and simulated heads occur the steady state simulation underestimates the observed head in these elevated areas consequently river discharge is likely to be underestimated in the elevated areas 5 3 groundwater model future projections groundwater evaporation is the main discharge mechanism that balances recharge inputs being thus a major contributor in the equilibrium of the basin consequently when recharge increases groundwater evaporation increases due to a higher water table eliminating the excess of water entering to the system however as shown in fig 10d across all model runs the median evaporation rate was zero signifying that during half the simulation period no groundwater evaporation was occurring but during the other half of the period groundwater evaporation is occurring with greater variability than the other mass balance discharge components therefore although groundwater evaporation reaches the highest discharge half of the time it has a null value when evaporation is zero river discharge is the main mechanism with which the basin stabilizes the recharge input results show that river and spring discharge are strongly related to the amount of recharge entering the system in each scenario fig 10 groundwater recharge is higher in the most elevated parts of the basin where river discharge occurs therefore when groundwater recharge increases the aquifer discharges more water into the river to maintain its balance consequently scenarios with higher groundwater recharge project an increase in the median of this flux in comparison with the baseline period whereas river discharge decreases as a result of a reduction in groundwater recharge however only in the extreme low scenario does the river becomes a water source for groundwater thus maintaining the balance in the system spring discharge shows a similar behavior but with much less variation between scenarios this result implies that groundwater evaporation and river discharge balance groundwater recharge without significant changes in springs discharge thus protecting this area from potentially big impacts table 3 shows that scenarios projecting greater changes in recharge are the ones that also project greater changes in all discharge fluxes evidencing thus the buffering capacity of the groundwater system future changes in the water table at the wetlands are analyzed in detail given the ecological interest of this area de la fuente et al 2021 suárez et al 2020 by analyzing how the shape of the 3780 6 m asl equipotential line changes between scenarios fig 11 direct comparisons can be made of their forecasts in terms of wetter or drier conditions in the wetlands this equipotential line represents the minimum value of the water table simulated in all scenarios and in the baseline period note the surface enclosed by this equipotential line referred to herein as water table surface of lowest level is not necessarily the lake surface since topography might be higher in fact a larger surface enclosed by this contour represents a lowering of the water table across the wetlands leading to a drier surface condition across the study site on the contrary when the surface enclosed by this contour is smaller the water table is on average higher across the wetlands leading to wetter surface conditions and an increase in lake levels the changes in the extension of this surface will surely affect the size of the wetlands and therefore the fauna and plant communities that depend on groundwater as our focus is related to potential impacts of climate change on aquifer dynamics i e impacts on potentiometric surface and water balance it is critical to monitor how ecosystems can be impacted as the wetlands size changes we refer the reader to the work of others fu et al 2020 mao et al 2020 mu et al 2020 peng et al 2020 shen et al 2019 weise et al 2020 wu and zheng 2020 low precipitation scenarios p min and p med project an increase in the water table surface of lowest level i e deeper water table forecasting slightly drier surface conditions in the wetlands in comparing these scenarios the 2100 equipotential map that most closely resembles that of 2010 is the extreme high map followed closely by the cross wet map this means the water table in the aquifer would remain stable with slight increases in future scenarios that project 38 increase in precipitation while decreases in precipitation of 15 onwards would result in lower future groundwater levels in the salar del huasco although there are changes in groundwater levels in the wetlands area these changes are slight and the overall behavior of the spring discharge is stable over time fig 10 these projections are in accordance with the stable behavior of the water levels observed in the basin between 2000 and 2016 fig a1 in supplementary material from which the buffering capacity maintained its balance despite the climatic changes i e increasing temperature trends mostly this is consistent with other studies such as that of cuthbert et al 2019 who found that groundwater fluxes in arid regions and particularly groundwater discharge to wetlands in dry landscapes are unaffected by climate change showing lower response to climate variability than humid regions regarding the groundwater modeling approach our model does not consider variable density flow therefore in reality the absolute value of the potentiometric surface is likely to be affected in the salt flat margin where a fresh salt water interface develops marazuela et al 2019c however as this occurs in a system with no anthropogenic perturbation for the timescales investigated in this research the projected changes between the baseline and future simulations which are the focus of assessment in our research should not be affected as a final remark model results are subject to the imposed boundary conditions as well as to the mechanisms defined to represent the system s sinks and sources through which water exchange between the aquifer and its surroundings takes place the quality of the representation of sinks and sources will depend on the available information in the study area and the objective of the modeling in this case the main purpose of the model was to quantify the behavior of the groundwater system in the basin and its potential future changes therefore further improvements may consider using additional remote sensing resources to fill the scarce available in situ information in the study site to better represent such elements that simulate important water balance components such as evaporation river infiltration and river discharge 5 4 future work as part of future work regarding future groundwater recharge it would be valuable to assess not only changes in its magnitude but also in its interannual variability and potential timing shifts additionally it would be interesting to assess potential impacts of climate change using the new future scenarios of cmip6 6 conclusions this study investigated potential impacts of climate change by the end of the century in the aquifer of the salar del huasco basin located in the high mountains of the chilean altiplano characterized by its arid climatic conditions the main conclusions of this work are future climate scenarios in the salar del huasco basin project an increasing trend in mean temperature while precipitation shows varying trends between scenarios however all scenarios agree that there will be an increase in the magnitude of extreme events precipitation is the main driver of larger groundwater recharges resulting in higher groundwater evaporation rates additionally the expected increase in future temperatures would likely lead to recharge with less seasonal variability groundwater evaporation is the main discharge mechanism that counterbalances the recharge inputs being thus a key element in the system s balance the aquifer responded to the different external conditions represented in each scenario by discharging and storing water accordingly which results in different potentiometric levels in scenarios where a lower groundwater recharge is projected results in lower groundwater levels and drier surface conditions near the wetlands wetter surface conditions are expected when larger groundwater recharge is projected however these changes in the potentiometric surface are almost negligible in the area of the wetlands where the groundwater dependent systems are located as a result of the balance between recharge and discharge fluxes which manages to keep the water table generally stable in this area results from this research demonstrate the salar del huasco aquifer would be able to buffer the impacts of climate change by balancing the inputs with outputs maintaining the levels in the lake and wetlands thus ensuring the conservation of unique ecosystems in the chilean altiplano it is important to note however that the resilient capacity of the aquifer may be due to its protected status and different results could be obtained if anthropogenic factors were interfering with the response of the system therefore the advantages of being able to carry out this type of study in a protected area of the arid altiplano are that 1 it could contribute to better manage the exploitation of other altiplano groundwater dependent ecosystems and even to define if any protection measures are necessary 2 it could serve as a baseline of systems without anthropogenic action allowing it to be compared with developed basins such as those used in the mining industry to distinguish the effects purely associated with climate change and those intensified by anthropogenic effects and finally 3 the results obtained could be generalized to regions of similar characteristics which would contribute to a wider knowledge of what will happen in these areas and thus be able to manage groundwater resources more efficiently credit authorship contribution

8082,study region the salar del huasco is an undeveloped basin in the arid chilean altiplano study focus this study aims to investigate potential impacts of climate change on the aquifer of the salar del huasco basin to better manage groundwater resources in the chilean altiplano with this purpose precipitation and temperature projections from multiple general circulation models were statistically downscaled using the hybrid delta approach to produce ensemble scenarios groundwater recharge was estimated for each scenario based on a rainfall runoff model that was used to drive a numerical groundwater model whose results were used to evaluate the future behavior of the aquifer under each scenario from 2020 to 2100 new hydrological insights for the study region this study found that higher precipitation would contribute to larger groundwater recharge rates additionally results showed that the aquifer is able to withstand the impacts of climate change through the balance of its water components maintaining thus stable levels in areas of ecological value since the study site is one of the few remaining undeveloped groundwater basins the results obtained represent the natural response of the system to climate change without interference from anthropogenic factors and thus serve as a baseline basin that could be used for comparative purposes this contributes to a better quantification of aquifer dynamics in the altiplano allowing the evaluation of future protective measures to ensure survival of similar groundwater dependent ecosystems in the area graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change groundwater modeling chilean altiplano statistical downscaling arid regions groundwater recharge 1 introduction groundwater is a vital global resource that provides one third of the planet s fresh water for domestic agricultural and industrial uses bloomfield et al 2019 taylor et al 2013 velis et al 2017 predicted climate change poses a threat for groundwater resources most of which are non renewable on meaningful timescales for humans and ecosystems kløve et al 2013 future projections predict an increase in the mean global temperatures as well as an increase in the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events ipcc 2014 nkhonjera and dinka 2017 on one hand central chile latitude 30ºs has experienced a drying trend since the mid 20th century which is expected to continue in the future leading to a reduction in average annual precipitation of up to 40 relative to current values garreaud et al 2020 this region has experienced a significant decrease in rainfall since the late 1970s which has been evidenced by more frequent drought events rivera et al 2020 on the other hand increasing trends have been found in average annual precipitation in the bolivian altiplano torres batlló and martí cardona 2020 and in annual precipitation in northern chile dga 2017 souvignet et al 2012 however there is still great uncertainty concerning future precipitation changes across the andes urrutia and vuille 2009 while there is general agreement on future increasing temperature trends in the region dga 2017 given these projections understanding the effects of climate change on groundwater becomes of utmost importance different studies have evaluated potential consequences of climate change on groundwater decreased snowpack given a reduction in snow accumulation due to more precipitation in the form of rain is likely to reduce river flow in summer months and greater evaporation rates will increase water demand of crops thus increasing groundwater extraction and leading to its depletion alam et al 2019 amanambu et al 2020 nkhonjera and dinka 2017 taylor et al 2013 water shortage problems derived from changes in perception lead to groundwater depletion which is particularly critical in arid and semi arid environments where groundwater discharge dominates the water balance rossman et al 2018 velis et al 2017 and becomes even more crucial since population and groundwater demand in arid regions are expected to increase huang et al 2015 nkhonjera and dinka 2017 scanlon et al 2006 taylor et al 2013 additionally arid zones are projected to expand to cover up to half of the terrestrial surface by the end of the century which will diminish the natural retention or sequestration of carbon huang et al 2015 koutroulis 2019 prăvălie 2016 prăvălie et al 2019 general circulation models gcms have become the primary tool for the study of projected climate change impacts on hydrological systems persaud et al 2020 gcms simulate the behavior and interaction of flow systems in the biosphere hydrosphere cryosphere atmosphere and geosphere in the climate system green et al 2011 huang et al 2015 scanlon et al 2006 taylor et al 2013 climate change scenarios established in the fifth report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc are expressed in terms of representative concentration pathways rcp which provide quantitative information of the concentration in time of contaminants associated to climate change however the coarse resolution of gcm outputs prevents them from being used directly with local basin scale models because they do not represent processes taking place at scales finer than their own grids which are generally of the order of 200 km fowler et al 2007 green et al 2011 persaud et al 2020 wilby et al 1998 therefore downscaling techniques are required to bring the gcm s raw data into the local scale for them to be applicable in basin scale models previous studies have used gcm projections to evaluate potential effects of climate change on hydrogeological systems through different approaches studies by crosbie et al 2011 2013 hartmann et al 2017 hashemi et al 2015 holman 2006 mckenna and sala 2018 rossman et al 2018 tillman et al 2016 and zhang et al 2019 focused on groundwater recharge or unsaturated zone processes but differed in the number of gcms and scenarios considered for future projections as well as in the methodology applied for estimating recharge other studies have assessed groundwater recharge uncertainty under future conditions goderniaux et al 2015 shen et al 2018 xie et al 2018 groundwater modeling has been applied to investigate future impacts of climate change on aquifers and their interaction with surface waters persaud et al 2020 scibek et al 2007 scibek and allen 2006 taheri tizro et al 2019 usman et al 2020 and remote sensing has been used to study historical climate change impacts on groundwater resources e g usman et al 2020 xu and su 2019 nevertheless there will always be uncertainty associated with climate models particularly in mountainous regions such as the central andes where the topography changes abruptly hindering its correct representation in models with large grids vuille et al 2008 therefore studies that incorporate multiple scenarios to investigate hydrological and hydrogeological systems in arid catchments with complex topography such as the chilean altiplano are still scarce recent studies have investigated the hydrological processes occurring in the andean chilean altiplano to evaluate groundwater recharge herrera et al 2016 2021 uribe et al 2015 urrutia et al 2019 to assess evaporation de la fuente et al 2021 hernández lópez et al 2014 mosre and suárez 2021 suárez et al 2020 water table fluctuations viguier et al 2019a 2019b and wetland dynamics de la fuente and meruane 2017 de la fuente et al 2021 additionally numerical groundwater modeling has been used to study the impacts of anthropogenic exploitation marazuela et al 2020 marazuela et al 2019b 2019a samuel et al 2020 scheihing and tröger 2018 scheihing et al 2017 nonetheless to the best of the authors knowledge there are no studies that have used numerical groundwater modeling to study and quantify the impacts of climate change in the chilean altiplano despite this being essential to manage water resources in a sustainable way and to ensure the survival of groundwater dependent ecosystems the main objective of this research is to develop a methodology that allows a proper management of groundwater resources in the chilean altiplano by 1 accounting for future uncertainty of climatic variables through ensemble scenarios and 2 assessing potential impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge groundwater levels and groundwater discharge fluxes to achieve this objective this research uses statistical downscaling techniques to process gcm outputs from different rcps to the local scale in an arid region in northern chile the downscaled outputs are used as input to a hydrological model for groundwater recharge estimation which is then used in a hydrogeological model to simulate the aquifer s response to future climate change scenarios defined in this study our analysis considers two main time spans a reference period 1981 2010 against which a future period 2020 2100 is evaluated therefore even when the incidence of climate is important in long term aquifer recharge in the central andes during the holocene herrera et al 2018 sáez et al 2016 our work focuses on time scales on the order of decades furthermore the focus of this research is to evaluate potential changes particularly in groundwater resources due to climate change in terms of water table changes and flow balance of the hydrogeological system therefore even though recharge is a fundamental process related to groundwater its particular aspects such as timing shifts and intersessional behavior of sub processes taking place in the vadose zone are not the main focus of this research the salar del huasco basin located in the chilean altiplano was chosen as our study site the basin lies in the presence of groundwater fed wetlands that sustain the life of unique flora and fauna de la fuente et al 2021 johnson et al 2010 the wetlands are located in the boundaries of the salt flat nucleus where groundwater springs form a shallow lake of 5 15 cm deep de la fuente and meruane 2016 lobos roco et al 2021 the salar del huasco is ecologically important because it is the home of three out of the six species of flamingos that exist in the world the andean flamingo the chilean flamingo and the james s flamingo which come to the salt flat to create their nests conaf 2005 it also shelters unique species such as andean foxes lamas vicuñas pumas among others as a result of this diversity the salt flat was declared a ramsar zone of protected wetlands in 1996 and a national park by the chilean government in 2020 given the importance of these wetlands in the study area the achieving of our objective is focused on the assessment of groundwater changes that could threaten future life in these groundwater dependent ecosystem due to climate change groundwater resources in the salar del huasco basin have had no human intervention and therefore all results obtained in this study represent the natural response of the system to the environmental forcing consequently this basin could be considered as a baseline against which to compare other basins in the area where intervention exists and thus be able to quantify the effects of such interventions in contrast with the natural response of the salar del huasco additionally we expect that our results could be further extended and be a helpful reference for groundwater assessment in similar areas worldwide 2 study area the salar del huasco is an endorheic basin located in the andean plateau of northern chile latitude 20 28 s and longitude 68 85 w fig 1 the basin extends over an area of 1470 km2 and it has a mean elevation of 4165 m asl its shallow lake is at the end of a well developed alluvial system draining from the north of the basin and constitutes the main water source that sustains life of unique flora and fauna species under extreme arid conditions de la fuente et al 2020 suárez et al 2020 2 1 geological settings the salar del huasco basin is bordered to the west by the altos de pica plateau which represents the water divide from pampa del tamarugal viguier et al 2019a 2019b and by the andes mountain range to the east that separates it from the bolivian basins of coipasa and empexa the salar del huasco basin was formed by volcanic activity that caused the emergence of mesozoic and paleozoic rocks to form the depressed basement area on which alluvial and lacustrine sedimentary materials were deposited as basin fill subsequently miocene rhyolitic tuffs with high degrees of welding originated from volcanic eruptions and deposited in the basin being the huasco ignimbrite the most important geological formation due to its extension and volume gardeweg and sellés 2015 tapia et al 2020 this volcanic activity gave rise to the andes mountain range closing the basin to the east which continued to fill with volcanic debris and pyroclastic materials dga 2009 in general the basin is considered a closed basin with little to no hydrologic connection to the neighboring basins previous studies using isotope and geochemical information have discarded a possible connection between the salar del huasco and the aquifer of pica risacher et al 1999 uribe et al 2015 however scheihing et al 2017 discarded this connection arguing that water from salar del huasco would have to travel a long way under the mountain range passing through geothermal deposits that would raise the temperature of water that discharge to pica since that is not the case they concluded that such connection does not exist consequently in this study the salar del huasco is considered a hydrogeologically closed basin until there is more evidence to confirm otherwise 2 2 climate two types of climates can be identified in the salar del huasco according to köppen classification system the tundra climate due to high altitudes of the andes and the cold desert climate the former is in the northeastern part of the basin while the latter is mainly in the southwestern part mean daily temperatures are around 4 14ºc depending on the altitude with great thermal oscillation between day and night in winter months the lowest temperatures reach 20ºc dga 2009 evaporation is the main water discharge mechanism of the basin with a mean annual potential evaporation of 1200 mm year de la fuente and meruane 2016 precipitation in this part of the altiplano occurs in the austral summer november through march as heavy convective storms originated by the intense surface heating that destabilizes the local troposphere and by the establishment of upper level easterly winds that transport moist air from the interior of the continent sáez et al 2016 garreaud 2009 garreaud et al 2003 interannual precipitation is highly variable ranging from 11 to 400 mm year garreaud et al 2003 hernández lópez et al 2014 although marked wet and dry periods can be identified on the millennial time scales sáez et al 2016 the el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon is the major source of the interannual variability in the altiplano garreaud 2009 it directly affects the coasts of ecuador perú and northern chile causing indirect effects on most of subtropical south america and higher latitudes garreaud et al 2009 given the large scale nature of this phenomenon in terms of its spatial and temporal extents its assessment is beyond the scope of this study however note that gcms used to study climate change do include these large scale phenomena in their formulation stocker 2014 2 3 hydrology the collacagua river is the main surface watercourse in the basin fig 1 it runs from north to south with daily flow rates that vary throughout the year in response to precipitation despite this the average monthly flow rates do not vary significantly throughout the year the upper section of the river at the río piga en collacagua fluviometric station has a daily average flow rate of 0 13 m 3 s while the downstream section at the río collacagua en peñablanca fluviometric station has an average of 0 15 m 3 s the river between these two fluviometric stations gains water during most of the year however downstream río collacagua en peñablanca the water from the river infiltrates as it gets near the salt flat nucleus the seasonal river flow dynamics are shown in the supplementary material section a in the topographic lowest point of the basin a salt flat nucleus that originated due to long term phreatic evaporation extends over 50 60 km2 the flow paths of mineral enriched groundwater converge and are discharged to the atmosphere through evaporation corenthal et al 2016 the salar del huasco aquifer discharges mainly into four springs that feed the wetlands located in the borders of the salt flat nucleus fig 1 records at gauging stations at these four springs provided by the chilean national water division dirección general de aguas dga show relatively stable discharges throughout the year with annual averages ranging from 8 10 3 to 23 10 3 m 3 s for the lowest and highest discharges respectively dga 2009 3 methods the general methodology followed in this study is based on three major steps the first step is to downscale temperature and precipitation outputs from multiple gcms so they can be used at the basin scale the projected scenarios used for climate change impacts assessment are also established in this step to represent different future conditions up to the end of the century the second step is to calculate groundwater recharge using the downscaled meteorological data for each projected climate scenario and the hydrologic model developed by uribe et al 2015 in the third step the groundwater recharge rates are used as inputs in the hydrogeological model of the salar del huasco aquifer the model then simulates the behavior of groundwater over time under each projected scenario 3 1 climate projections simulations of projected climate scenarios were carried out using the hybrid delta hd approach with precipitation and temperature offsets based on the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 multi model ensemble output ensemble models include all four rcps scenarios the hd method combines two well established downscaling techniques bias correction and spatial downscaling bcsd reclamation 2014 and the delta method dm approach tohver and hamlet 2014 here we briefly describe both techniques and how they are applied in the hd statistical downscaling as a first step of the hd approach the bcsd method is applied in the bcsd technique statistical properties of the cumulative distribution function cdf of climatic simulations from the gcms are adjusted according to the statistical properties of the observed cdf in a baseline period thus systematic bias of the gcm relative to the observed probability distribution is removed tohver and hamlet 2014 wood et al 2002 the second step consists of applying the dm in the dm monthly changes of variables projected by the gcms are determined and applied to monthly means of observations to do this the future is divided into time windows of equal length as the baseline observational period for that purpose the collacagua station was chosen given it was the only one with enough precipitation and temperature records in fact from 1980 to 2010 there is a complete temperature record and only one month february 1992 with no precipitation records in this case 30 year windows were defined according to the available data in the station 1981 2010 baseline period 2011 2040 near future 2041 2070 mid future and 2071 2100 far future these windows were defined so there are no time gaps between the baseline and the distant future therefore the downscaling results are continuously applied in the hydrological processes the changes or deltas are calculated for temperature and precipitation according to the following equations camici et al 2014 hamlet et al 2010 tohver and hamlet 2014 1 t dm fut t obs t gcm fut t gcm base 2 p dm fut p obs p gcm fut p gcm base where t is temperature and p is precipitation the subindices in eqs 1 and 2 are as follows obs corresponds to the observed variables dm is related to the variables corrected by that method and gcm base and gcm fut refer to the variables simulated by the climate models in the baseline period and in the future respectively the overbar reflects that the variables are monthly means for a step by step description of the hd method see hamlet et al 2010 and tohver and hamlet 2014 the final step in the hd approach is the temporal disaggregation from which future daily series of the downscaled variables are obtained daily time series are then used as input to the hydrological model this temporal disaggregation was performed according to tohver et al 2014 and vormoor and skaugen 2013 3 t fut daily t obs daily t fut monthly t obs monthly 4 p fut daily p obs daily p fut monthly p obs monthly where t fut daily and p fut daily are the daily future variables t obs daily and p obs daily are the observed daily temperature and precipitation data t fut monthly and p fut monthly are the future monthly values obtained by the hd method and t obs monthly and p obs monthly are the observed monthly temperature and precipitation data consequently the hd method perturbs the entire cdf as opposed to the traditional use of the dm that only perturbs the monthly means of the observed variable tohver and hamlet 2014 thereby future time series of temperature and precipitation represent the changes projected by the gcm while preserving at the same time its characteristics and behavior e g duration location interarrival time of storms given by the observed data at a local scale hamlet et al 2010 in this study the hd approach was applied to 219 climate models that include emission scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 to cover a larger range of climate projections and in the absence of a justification for choosing a particular rcp scenario hausner et al 2014 subsequently the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles of the downscaled variables were calculated to generate hybrid scenarios of temperature and precipitation that are not subjected to a particular radiative forcing but instead are a compound of different emission scenarios simulated by different models hausner et al 2016 to have a broader spectrum of possible future scenarios all precipitation and temperature percentiles were combined in the scenario definition as shown in table 1 where the 10th percentile sub index was replaced by min 50th by med and 90th by max for simplicity in doing so the hybrid scenarios take into consideration the large uncertainty that comes along with projected precipitation in the altiplano due to the coarse resolution of gcms that hinders an adequate representation of climatic gradients given by complex topographies urrutia and vuille 2009 3 2 groundwater recharge estimations the semi distributed hydrological model developed by uribe et al 2015 for the salar del huasco catchment was used to predict groundwater recharge under the climate change scenarios previously defined the model uses as inputs the downscaled mean temperature and precipitation estimates of reference evaporation et o at a daily basis are also used to obtain groundwater recharge et o mm day was calculated using the fao modified blaney criddle 1950 equation doorenbos and pruitt 1977 5 e t o a b c 0 46 t mean 8 13 where a and b are fitting parameters c is the mean annual percentage of daylight hours and t mean is the monthly mean temperature the fitting parameters a and b were estimated using observed monthly pan evaporation data at collacagua station in the period between january 1981 and december 2010 corrected by a pan factor of 0 7 as suggested by dga 2009 eq 5 was selected to estimate future projections of et o since it is a simple approach that uses t mean as an input variable in climate ensembles t mean is more reliable than other variables that are required for estimating et o with more sophisticated models e g the penman monteith thornwaite or hargreaves equations allen et al 2011 the rainfall runoff model used in this study was previously developed and validated by uribe et al 2015 for the salar del huasco basin and it is based on the soil moisture accounting routine sma of the hec hms model feldman 2000 hydrologic engineering center us 2001 for its development they defined five hydrologic response units hru fig 2b according to the hydrogeological characteristics of the basin whose connectivity was set using a 90 m resolution digital model elevation dem from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm hru r1 was defined as rocks with very low effective porosity and without fractures r2 represents fractured rocks with significant effective porosity s1 represents lacustrine and evaporite deposits s2 corresponds to alluvial and colluvial deposits and s3 represents fluvial deposits a set of 15 parameters were defined for representing the hydrological processes at each hru which were calibrated and validated using stream flow records between 1978 and 2010 at station río piga en collacagua here we provide a brief description of this model for a detailed description of the model structure the reader is referred to section b of the supplementary material and to uribe et al 2015 for details on the model configuration such as hru definition the parameters involved and their calibration long term recharge characterization and model performance the rainfall runoff model simulates the hydraulic processes occurring at the surface and soil in hrus through mass balance relationships in four reservoirs that represent the different levels of the system at daily time steps fig 2a the reservoirs simulate 1 canopy storage 2 surface detention 3 unsaturated soil processes and 4 the saturated zone the basic mechanism behind the balance in each reservoir is that the incoming water can change its storage evaporate become runoff or percolate into the next reservoir uribe et al 2015 in the canopy storage reservoir precipitation intercepted by vegetation s foliage evaporates while the remaining precipitation that was not captured passes as input to the next reservoir since vegetation species that develop in this arid zone have little or no foliage canopy storage is almost negligible modifications made by uribe et al 2015 to adjust the model to the climatic conditions of the salar del huasco consisted in the simulation of freezing at the unsaturated zone by introducing a temporal lag if the daily mean temperature is below 0 ºc and the simulation of groundwater routing using a series of linear reservoirs to better represent the generated hydrograph the former modification was meant to represent the general behavior of the basin at low temperatures sublimation or a more detailed representation of snow melting are not included in this model to justify the use of a simplified mechanism instead of a more complex representation of snow related processes we used landsat images acquired from usgs s earth explorer earthexplorer usgs gov to estimate the number of pixels with snow in the months in which it occurs in the baseline period to do this we calculated the normalized difference snow index ndsi and estimated the percentage of area that the pixels with snow represent of the total basin we found that the average snow coverage between 1986 and 2010 is of 1 52 of the total basin and the median value is of 0 46 which supports the simplification of uribe et al 2015 already validated model the mass balance in the vadose zone reservoir depends on the soil s storage capacity the percolation rate to the next reservoir and the meteorological conditions of the day being analyzed additionally a temporal lag in evaporation and infiltration processes is represented when temperatures are too low the outputs of the balance in the saturated zone are the deep percolation and the baseflow the latter calculated as a series of linear reservoirs to simulate the routing hydrograph through the basin groundwater recharge is defined as the total amount of water entering the saturated zone which can become deep percolation or baseflow uribe et al 2015 the usefulness of the saturated zone reservoir is that it allows simulating the processes of deep percolation and baseflow separately allowing the latter to be used to calibrate the parameters of the hydrological model in the sma routine of the hec hms model hydrologic engineering center us 2001 the rate of percolation between the soil profile storage and the saturated zone i e groundwater recharge depends on the volume in the source and receiving reservoirs it is calculated as a function of a maximum percolation rate and the contents of the storage from which percolation is occurring bennett and peters 2004 the maximum percolation rate and maximum storage capacity of each reservoir are parameters that are different for each hru of the model their values are determined after calibrating the model and future simulations of groundwater recharge are performed under the assumption that they remain constant in time since changes in vegetation would impact soil parameters due to root uptake and transpiration it is assumed that variations in vegetation patches in the basin does not change dramatically in the future actual evaporation from the subsurface e a is among the calculations performed by the hydrological model to obtain groundwater recharge this value is further used to calculate how much water remains from et o that is still available to be evaporated in the aquifer which we define as remnant evaporation e rem note that recharge resulting from the hydrological model is used as input to the groundwater flow model and is therefore considered as actual recharge as it reaches the water table de silva and rushton 2007 scanlon et al 2002 3 3 groundwater flow model development the groundwater flow model used to simulate the behavior of the aquifer under each scenario was developed in modflow harbaugh et al 2000 which is a widely used numerical model that solves the groundwater flow equation through a porous media in three dimensions and can represent groundwater and surface water interactions the main focus of our research is to assess the effects of climate change by analyzing changes in future simulations with respect a baseline period rather than analyzing absolute values of potentiometric surfaces and therefore effects of variable density were not considered since they are not expected to affect such changes furthermore given the ecological importance that exists in the surroundings of the wetlands we gave especial attention to this area the model was built using the open source interface modelmuse winston 2009 the geometry of the model consists of 270 rows 253 columns and 10 layers fig 3 that discretize three main aquifers the vertical discretization of the three aquifers into 10 layers was defined to avoid convergence problems associated with cell dimensions which was done using the uniform spacing option in modelmuse winston 2009 no flow boundary condition were set at the edges of the model according to previous hydrogeological and geochemical studies risacher et al 1999 scheihing et al 2017 the model was run under steady state conditions for the baseline period and under transient conditions for the future projections in the latter monthly stress periods were used from 2020 to 2100 the spatially distributed monthly groundwater recharge projections obtained from the hydrological model were incorporated in the groundwater flow model using modflow s recharge package rch harbaugh et al 2000 more specifically monthly recharge rates calculated with the rainfall runoff model described in section 3 2 were imported to modelmuse using a shapefile to distribute them throughout the model domain according to the sub basin spatial distribution fig 2b the collacagua river was represented in the groundwater model using the river package riv harbaugh et al 2000 an average river depth of 10 cm and conductance of 0 06 0 12 m2 s were assigned along the course of the collacagua river these values were defined after the steady state calibration to represent the flux interacting with the aquifer acosta 2004 the four springs located near the wetlands were represented in the model using the drain package drn harbaugh et al 2000 the stage and conductance of each drain were defined and calibrated using dga s records of fluviometric stations at the springs which are available at www dga cl groundwater evaporation was modeled with the evapotranspiration package evt harbaugh et al 2000 and was defined near the wetlands and streambed of the collacagua river where the water table is shallow enough to allow groundwater evaporation a potential evaporation of 6 3 mm day was defined in the steady state simulation according to pan evaporation records in collacagua meteorological station between april 1994 and may 2007 acosta and custodio 2008 uribe 2012 in the transient simulations monthly evaporation rates were introduced corresponding to the simulated e rem which represents the water available for evaporation in the aquifer the extinction depth was set to 3 m beneath the surface typical for arid saline soils shanafield et al 2015 and in agreement with et measurements performed in the basin with the portable chamber method dga 2009 johnson et al 2010 to avoid confusion in the rest of the document we use the term groundwater evaporation to refer to this discharge while the term groundwater recharge refers to the output of the hydrological model which includes the evaporation at the subsurface i e e a 3 4 groundwater flow model calibration and simulations a steady state simulation was performed to represent the long term historical last 40 years behavior of the aquifer to ensure the adequate representation of conceptual model inflows and outflows of the groundwater system according to previous studies acosta and custodio 2008 dga 2009 johnson et al 2010 uribe et al 2015 a manual calibration of hydraulic conductivity was performed using observed levels at 44 monitoring wells fig 4 using the minimum of the mean absolute error mae as objective function bennett et al 2013 an ideal model would achieve a mae of 0 nevertheless the model is considered accurate if the mae is less than 5 of the largest difference of observed data sea 2012 the performance of the model was then evaluated with the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 indicators bennett et al 2013 due to the state of conservation that protects the salar del huasco basin from human intervention there is little data on aquifer levels over the baseline period which are required to perform a transient calibration thus hydraulic conductivities were calibrated through a steady state calibration and storage values in the aquifer were assigned based on previous studies acosta and custodio 2008 dga 2009 despite not having long time series of groundwater level information over the baseline period records from 2005 and 2014 sea 2019 along with isolated records from november 2018 suárez et al 2020 were used to validate the model the available groundwater levels are presented in section a of the supplementary material the groundwater model was used to simulate the aquifer s behavior in the baseline period january 1981 december 2010 and in different future scenarios starting in the near future until the end of the century january 2020 december 2100 the results of this simulation characterized the aquifer behavior in a reference period against which future climate change simulations were compared 4 results 4 1 climate projections future precipitation and temperature scenarios 10th percentile denoted by subscript min 50th percentile med and 90th percentile max projected with the hd approach are compared at a daily basis with observations in the baseline period table 2 scenarios percentile from min to max are chosen to set guidelines for determining the system sensitivity to climate change future temperature scenarios in all three time windows project a daily increasing trend in maximum mean and median temperatures in comparison with the baseline period differences can be noted between scenarios though where projected values increase from t min to t max unlike temperatures projected precipitation behaves differently in each scenario substantial differences are observed in the mean and maximum statistics where in all three future windows p max s mean and maximum exceed those in the baseline period while in p min the opposite occurs increasing and decreasing trends can also be easily distinguished between scenarios at monthly basis fig 5 where all temperature scenarios project a total increase while precipitation varies throughout the scenarios defined in table 1 4 2 groundwater recharge 4 2 1 baseline period the hydrological model was run first for the baseline period to simulate historical groundwater recharge the model took approximately seven years to stabilize and after this spin up period groundwater recharge is relatively stable in time with an estimated value of 42 9 27 9 mm yr mean standard deviation fig 6 over the model domain groundwater recharge varies with seasons with peaks occurring mostly during summer months which means that summer precipitation is transformed almost immediately into groundwater recharge 4 2 2 future projections scenarios that project an increase in recharge represent those with the highest precipitation input p max corresponding to the cross wet and extreme high scenarios fig 7 both scenarios differ in their temperature inputs which greatly affects seasonal variability of recharge higher temperatures in the extreme high scenario allow for higher percolation in winter months in comparison with the cross wet scenario reducing the differences between summer and winter recharge as opposed to what occurs in the cross wet scenario however an overall greater recharge is generated in the cross wet since the higher temperatures of the extreme high scenario produce higher evaporation rates in the surface reducing the amount of water that infiltrates and transforms into recharge temperature effects can also be observed in scenarios with the lowest precipitation input p min as mentioned before higher temperatures mean that groundwater recharge does not decrease as much in winter months due to the relatively warmer temperatures as a result the cross dry scenario has an overall greater recharge in comparison with extreme low which is the scenario that projects the lowest recharge rates table 3 shows projected changes in groundwater recharge for the mid and far future periods with respect to the baseline period the near future period was not included in table 3 since future simulations start in 2020 positive changes are projected in both periods in scenarios with increasing recharge while negative changes are projected otherwise finally fig 8 shows seasonal changes projected per each scenario by the end of the century in terms of monthly mean recharge throughout the year over the far future period 2071 2100 in comparison with the baseline simulation blue dashed line fig 8 allows assessing groundwater recharge changes not only in magnitude but also in terms of its behavior between seasons taking that into account the groundwater recharge behavior in the cross wet scenario is the one that most closely resembles that of the baseline but with higher magnitudes regarding magnitudes recharge in the median and cross dry scenario are closest to the baseline in winter months may through august while in summer recharge in the extreme high scenario is the closest also the effect of temperature in recharge in winter in scenarios with higher temperatures cross dry and extreme high mentioned above can also be observed in fig 8 where less variations between winter and summer can be observed 4 3 groundwater model 4 3 1 steady state simulation the mae in the steady state simulation was of 6 4 m which corresponds to 4 2 of the largest observed difference rmse and r 2 values of 9 55 m and 0 98 m respectively indicate a good model performance with an overall good fit simulated levels close to the 1 1 line the map in fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the calibration performance at each well given by the size of the circular marker that increases along with the difference between observations and simulations it can be thus noted that groundwater levels are being better represented at lower altitudes in the basin which includes the area of the wetlands and their surroundings using the groundwater levels registered in nine observation wells in the november 2018 field campaign a mae of 9 m which corresponds to 5 8 of the largest observed difference and a r 2 of 0 90 were obtained 4 3 2 baseline period water discharge from the springs and the river are the fluxes that remain most stable in time while evaporation is the discharge with the largest variation fig 9 the median evaporation rate is null signifying half of the time water is not being discharged through this process but when evaporation occurs its magnitude varies greatly reaching up to 1 8 m 3 s 38 6 mm yr zero groundwater evaporation means that the water table is below the extinction depth of evaporation and consequently the aquifer is not discharging by evaporation in the stress periods when that occurs thus despite the high magnitudes that can be reached by evaporation its average is below that of the groundwater recharge 4 3 3 future projections the groundwater model was used to simulate future behavior of the system using the projected recharge for each scenario the obtained results are analyzed in terms of mass balance components and equipotential contours groundwater recharge corresponds to the only external source of water entering the aquifer groundwater surface water interactions vary along the river course starting from the northern most elevated alluvial parts of the basin where the river has a gaining reach until the river reaches the lowest elevations near the salt flat nucleus where it becomes a losing river however the net interaction between the river and the aquifer results in a groundwater discharge towards the river referred to from here on as river discharge in most scenarios changes projected in mass balance components with respect to the baseline period in the mid and far future periods are presented in table 3 which shows 25th 50th and 75th percentiles of flow changes note that the 25th and 50th percentiles of groundwater evaporation are zero which means that most of the time evaporation is not from the aquifer but it is only occurring at ground surface both in the baseline and future scenarios positive changes in the 75th percentile result from the scenarios that project an increase in recharge while negative changes are observed in the ones where recharge decreases see section c of the supplementary material additionally despite the slight projected changes reported in table 3 spring discharge is the most stable flux in both future periods with the lowest percentage of change with respect the baseline period scenarios with increasing recharge are the ones that project greater changes in all discharge fluxes showing the buffering behavior of the basin table 3 fig 11 shows the simulated equipotential contours of climate change scenarios by the end of the year 2100 as well as the contours resulting from the baseline simulation by the end of 2010 in the sector of the wetlands looking at the shape of this equipotential line it is possible to observe that the 2100 equipotential map of the extreme high scenario is the one that most closely resembles that of 2010 in the baseline simulation while the rest of the future maps show changes in the shape of this contour 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater recharge future projections precipitation occurs mainly at higher altitudes and thus infiltration is greater in higher areas higher subbasins contributing thus to the overall increase in the total groundwater recharge temperature also plays a role although minor on groundwater recharge since the process of evaporation from the soil depends on it when higher temperatures are projected at higher elevations where temperatures are lowest within the basin more water is evaporated in the root zone increasing the space available in the soil reservoir for the incoming infiltration this increases the potential infiltration rate enhancing infiltration in areas where low temperatures normally limit the process nevertheless the effect of temperature on groundwater recharge is smaller than that of precipitation more details on the groundwater recharge produced in higher and lower subbasins and their contribution to the total recharge can be found in section d of the supplementary material other studies have also concluded that warmer temperatures reduce the amount of ground frost allowing more water infiltration that leads to increased groundwater recharge in cold regions jyrkama and sykes 2007 kovalevskii 2007 evaporation depends on two aspects the amount of precipitation entering the system and the et o defined for each scenario calculated with eq 5 for the three temperature percentiles as expected scenarios with higher precipitation i e cross wet and extreme high produced the largest e a rates since not all precipitation can be transformed into groundwater recharge in the same time step 5 2 groundwater model steady state simulation elevated parts of the basin as shown in fig 4 is where the greatest differences between observed and simulated heads occur the steady state simulation underestimates the observed head in these elevated areas consequently river discharge is likely to be underestimated in the elevated areas 5 3 groundwater model future projections groundwater evaporation is the main discharge mechanism that balances recharge inputs being thus a major contributor in the equilibrium of the basin consequently when recharge increases groundwater evaporation increases due to a higher water table eliminating the excess of water entering to the system however as shown in fig 10d across all model runs the median evaporation rate was zero signifying that during half the simulation period no groundwater evaporation was occurring but during the other half of the period groundwater evaporation is occurring with greater variability than the other mass balance discharge components therefore although groundwater evaporation reaches the highest discharge half of the time it has a null value when evaporation is zero river discharge is the main mechanism with which the basin stabilizes the recharge input results show that river and spring discharge are strongly related to the amount of recharge entering the system in each scenario fig 10 groundwater recharge is higher in the most elevated parts of the basin where river discharge occurs therefore when groundwater recharge increases the aquifer discharges more water into the river to maintain its balance consequently scenarios with higher groundwater recharge project an increase in the median of this flux in comparison with the baseline period whereas river discharge decreases as a result of a reduction in groundwater recharge however only in the extreme low scenario does the river becomes a water source for groundwater thus maintaining the balance in the system spring discharge shows a similar behavior but with much less variation between scenarios this result implies that groundwater evaporation and river discharge balance groundwater recharge without significant changes in springs discharge thus protecting this area from potentially big impacts table 3 shows that scenarios projecting greater changes in recharge are the ones that also project greater changes in all discharge fluxes evidencing thus the buffering capacity of the groundwater system future changes in the water table at the wetlands are analyzed in detail given the ecological interest of this area de la fuente et al 2021 suárez et al 2020 by analyzing how the shape of the 3780 6 m asl equipotential line changes between scenarios fig 11 direct comparisons can be made of their forecasts in terms of wetter or drier conditions in the wetlands this equipotential line represents the minimum value of the water table simulated in all scenarios and in the baseline period note the surface enclosed by this equipotential line referred to herein as water table surface of lowest level is not necessarily the lake surface since topography might be higher in fact a larger surface enclosed by this contour represents a lowering of the water table across the wetlands leading to a drier surface condition across the study site on the contrary when the surface enclosed by this contour is smaller the water table is on average higher across the wetlands leading to wetter surface conditions and an increase in lake levels the changes in the extension of this surface will surely affect the size of the wetlands and therefore the fauna and plant communities that depend on groundwater as our focus is related to potential impacts of climate change on aquifer dynamics i e impacts on potentiometric surface and water balance it is critical to monitor how ecosystems can be impacted as the wetlands size changes we refer the reader to the work of others fu et al 2020 mao et al 2020 mu et al 2020 peng et al 2020 shen et al 2019 weise et al 2020 wu and zheng 2020 low precipitation scenarios p min and p med project an increase in the water table surface of lowest level i e deeper water table forecasting slightly drier surface conditions in the wetlands in comparing these scenarios the 2100 equipotential map that most closely resembles that of 2010 is the extreme high map followed closely by the cross wet map this means the water table in the aquifer would remain stable with slight increases in future scenarios that project 38 increase in precipitation while decreases in precipitation of 15 onwards would result in lower future groundwater levels in the salar del huasco although there are changes in groundwater levels in the wetlands area these changes are slight and the overall behavior of the spring discharge is stable over time fig 10 these projections are in accordance with the stable behavior of the water levels observed in the basin between 2000 and 2016 fig a1 in supplementary material from which the buffering capacity maintained its balance despite the climatic changes i e increasing temperature trends mostly this is consistent with other studies such as that of cuthbert et al 2019 who found that groundwater fluxes in arid regions and particularly groundwater discharge to wetlands in dry landscapes are unaffected by climate change showing lower response to climate variability than humid regions regarding the groundwater modeling approach our model does not consider variable density flow therefore in reality the absolute value of the potentiometric surface is likely to be affected in the salt flat margin where a fresh salt water interface develops marazuela et al 2019c however as this occurs in a system with no anthropogenic perturbation for the timescales investigated in this research the projected changes between the baseline and future simulations which are the focus of assessment in our research should not be affected as a final remark model results are subject to the imposed boundary conditions as well as to the mechanisms defined to represent the system s sinks and sources through which water exchange between the aquifer and its surroundings takes place the quality of the representation of sinks and sources will depend on the available information in the study area and the objective of the modeling in this case the main purpose of the model was to quantify the behavior of the groundwater system in the basin and its potential future changes therefore further improvements may consider using additional remote sensing resources to fill the scarce available in situ information in the study site to better represent such elements that simulate important water balance components such as evaporation river infiltration and river discharge 5 4 future work as part of future work regarding future groundwater recharge it would be valuable to assess not only changes in its magnitude but also in its interannual variability and potential timing shifts additionally it would be interesting to assess potential impacts of climate change using the new future scenarios of cmip6 6 conclusions this study investigated potential impacts of climate change by the end of the century in the aquifer of the salar del huasco basin located in the high mountains of the chilean altiplano characterized by its arid climatic conditions the main conclusions of this work are future climate scenarios in the salar del huasco basin project an increasing trend in mean temperature while precipitation shows varying trends between scenarios however all scenarios agree that there will be an increase in the magnitude of extreme events precipitation is the main driver of larger groundwater recharges resulting in higher groundwater evaporation rates additionally the expected increase in future temperatures would likely lead to recharge with less seasonal variability groundwater evaporation is the main discharge mechanism that counterbalances the recharge inputs being thus a key element in the system s balance the aquifer responded to the different external conditions represented in each scenario by discharging and storing water accordingly which results in different potentiometric levels in scenarios where a lower groundwater recharge is projected results in lower groundwater levels and drier surface conditions near the wetlands wetter surface conditions are expected when larger groundwater recharge is projected however these changes in the potentiometric surface are almost negligible in the area of the wetlands where the groundwater dependent systems are located as a result of the balance between recharge and discharge fluxes which manages to keep the water table generally stable in this area results from this research demonstrate the salar del huasco aquifer would be able to buffer the impacts of climate change by balancing the inputs with outputs maintaining the levels in the lake and wetlands thus ensuring the conservation of unique ecosystems in the chilean altiplano it is important to note however that the resilient capacity of the aquifer may be due to its protected status and different results could be obtained if anthropogenic factors were interfering with the response of the system therefore the advantages of being able to carry out this type of study in a protected area of the arid altiplano are that 1 it could contribute to better manage the exploitation of other altiplano groundwater dependent ecosystems and even to define if any protection measures are necessary 2 it could serve as a baseline of systems without anthropogenic action allowing it to be compared with developed basins such as those used in the mining industry to distinguish the effects purely associated with climate change and those intensified by anthropogenic effects and finally 3 the results obtained could be generalized to regions of similar characteristics which would contribute to a wider knowledge of what will happen in these areas and thus be able to manage groundwater resources more efficiently credit authorship contribution

8083,study region marikina pasig basin philippines study focus a multiscale rainfall runoff and inundation model was developed to simulate the severe flooding caused by a high intensity short duration storm rainfall event in the urban domain the model used the 2d shallow water flow and finite volume schemes with second order space time accuracy to automatically incorporate the runoff into the flood inundation the adaptive mesh refinement scheme a variable grid sizing technique was implemented to dynamically refine the mesh from a watershed scale to a more precise inundation in a subcatchment floodplain the digital terrain and surface models were used to represent the variations in flood propagation along buildings and artificial barriers in the urban area additionally the simulated flood depths and extent were validated by comparison with the observed data new hydrological insight the severe inundation produced by the extreme rainfall event was perceived to be caused by a combination of fluvial and pluvial flooding exacerbated by the domain s flat and low lying elevation and its geographical features acting as a flood water receiving catchment accrued from the adjacent mountainous regions the proposed method can be used to identify the flood depth and water accumulation estimated peak time potential flash flood prone areas and imperceptible flood origins without the need to establish first the water level and stream discharge boundary conditions the domain specific flood simulations can be used for early warning and to identify a broader scope of possible evacuation points during storm based flooding events graphical abstract ga1 keywords multiscale inundation modeling rainfall runoff inundation modeling adaptive mesh refinement extreme rainfall events 1 introduction storm driven urban flooding has disastrous effects on society as it causes loss of lives infrastructural damage and economic disruption in a global scale southeast asia pacific countries in particular are especially susceptible to urban flooding due to climate conditions exposure to monsoonal rains and tropical cyclones chen et al 2020 tierolf et al 2021 torti 2012 with the potential effect of changing climate in the pattern and intensity of extreme rainfall events flooding is expected to be frequently experienced in these regions in the future in addition to this due to the physical causes of urban flooding which includes landuse change with the continuous construction of impervious surfaces unorganized urbanization river encroachment and poorly constructed drainage systems the adverse effects of flood inundation are especially high in developing countries inspite of this only a limited number of studies related to flood risk management have been reported in these countries over the years nkwunonwo et al 2020 the ongoing efforts in alleviating the negative effects of flooding have highlighted the requirement of developing advance numerical flood models such advanced models are required to predict the associated flood hazards perform risk mapping post assessment analysis flood protection and prevention water resource management and real time flood forecasting in rural areas larger and coarser resolution models can be used for mapping flood hazards in urban areas however flood simulation is heavily dependent on the accurate simulation of the superficial flow which requires much more detailed elevation models as a result the urban flood simulation models are constrained by limited simulation times and real time data assimilation teng et al 2017 in the absence of sufficient historical data modeling techniques based on the hydrodynamic approach are rapidly gaining preference for flood simulation the conventional approaches used for modeling regional flooding which is primarily caused by the surrounding watersheds provide independent or integrated simulations of the catchment hydrological and hydraulic processes for example the hec ras 1d 2d unsteady flow model where 1d and 2d are the abbreviations of one dimensional and two dimensional respectively computes the 2d flood inundation using the connecting upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the 1d river flow usace 2021 some of the related modeling techniques include the integrated rainfall runoff and inundation modeling i e anselmo et al 1996 nastiti et

encountered while running individual computations of runoff and inundation analyzing the data and reproducing the results in a multiscale domain is a more challenging and significant problem in the available literature multiscale modeling is mostly described as the simulation of an inundation using spatial grids at different scales bradbook 2006 developed the jflow 2d dynamic flood model bradbook 2006 and applied it to simulate a large scale fluvial and drainage flooding using 10 m and 1 m grids respectively scorpio et al 2016 identified the flood prone areas in alluvial fans by developing a model based on medium scale 1 50 000 1 10 000 and large scale approaches 1 5000 1 1000 viterbo et al 2020 conducted a comprehensive assessment of the hydro meteorological processes in watershed scale and urban domain scale flooding from a synoptic perspective the grid nesting approach has also been applied to simulate coastal flooding by olbert et al 2017 they developed a dynamically linked ocean and coastal flood models to produce a cascade of nested grids at different spatial scales 90 30 6 and 2 m for capturing the urban coastal flood consequently a recent study done by hashimoto et al 2021 also performed multiscale 2d nested grid approach in flood simulation calculated inter district district and regional scale for a flat land multiscale nesting is applied to perform accurate high resolution flood modeling with reduced computational expenses as it compensates the lower modeling accuracy using coarser resolution grids in this study the adaptive mesh refinement amr scheme was implemented to adjust the grid resolution by following the flow features or focusing areas instead of creating a uniform fine resolution grid for the whole domain the multiscale nesting and adaptive mesh approach are different in a sense that the former is performed by simulating coarser grids and then focusing on detailed grids in separate computations while amr performs simultaneous simulations of grid elements the amr technique has been used in a wide number of applications related to shallow water flow dynamics including river hydrodynamic predictions estuarine dynamics lake circulation and bed morphodynamic changes liang et al 2007 tsunami modeling furuyama and maihara 2014 pons et al 2017 popinet 2011 wave run up due to storm surge park et al

several advances have been made in the rainfall runoff inundation and multiscale flooding models kim et al 2012 developed a coupling framework between the hydrological and hydrodynamic models this coupling framework uses the triangular irregular network based integrated basin simulator for flood modeling by considering a spatially distributed hydrological process over the surface and subsurface busaman et al 2015 utilized a raster based digital elevation model dem that uses subgrids for 2d flood simulations savant et al 2019 developed a model for simulating riverine and overland flooding with diffusive waves within a dynamically adaptive mesh hu et al 2019 used an anisotropic and unstructured adaptive mesh technique to develop a model for urban flooding triggered by extreme rainfall and rising sea level kirstetter et al 2020 presented a real time flood mapping method for a coastal catchment area using the amr and 2d hydraulic modeling tools with the exception of the reported study of busaman et al 2015 these studies highlighted the use of adaptive mesh in capturing flash flood events in smaller catchments 100 km2 however studies on advances on adaptive integration of watershed scale surface runoff into an urban subbasin are very limited coupled flood models such as lisflood bates 2021 and hec ras usace 2021 simulate floodplain inundation incorporating the watershed kinematic channel flow into the overland flooding the hydrodynamic simulation is processed with discharge and water level input parameters which are obtained from separate computations of the hydrologic model however independent computations can impose complications self contained simulations of localized independent domains can often introduce unnatural boundaries cutting off the flood flow links between the inside and outside part of the domain which oftentimes leads to unreliable results xing et al 2018 in this paper we propose a framework for integrating the hydrological runoff routing and hydrodynamics of inundation flow this proposed integrated framework incorporates a large scale spatially coarse grid for a watershed 1215 km2 and a high resolution hydrodynamic inundation model for an urban subbasin 40 km2 eliminating the necessity to include the upstream and downstream boundary conditions as prerequisites for the flood simulation the main objectives of this study are 1 to simulate urban flooding within the framework of the adaptive mesh based rainfall runoff inundation model and 2 test the applicability of the developed model to an urban subbasin domain in marikina pasig river basin philippines providing insights on the topographical characteristics that had contributed to the severity of the flooding during typhoon ketsana 2009 moreover urban flood modeling is particularly challenging owing to the unavailability of suitable representations for natural flow paths and manmade structures hapuarachchi et al 2011 the urban environment that includes buildings and barriers as well as open areas strongly impacts the flow dynamics and hence should be included in the calculations paquier et al 2015 thus to introduce a proper representation of flooding in an urban area the high resolution digital terrain model dtm and digital surface model dsm were used in this study to simulate urban flooding the flood prediction performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the flood depth points observed during the rainfall event furthermore the advantages potential shortcomings and prospective improvements of the proposed model are also discussed in this paper 2 model theory 2 1 rainfall runoff inundation model a conceptual rainfall runoff model in general is based on the water balance formula that describes the rainfall runoff as an equivalent of the estimated amount of excess water from precipitation after discounting the effect of evapotranspiration soil moisture infiltration and groundwater storage sitterson et al 2017 however according to haan et al 1994 in spite of the high total percentage of rainfall involved in the evapotranspiration process the evapotranspiration in individual storms is generally a minor factor and is usually not included in the storm water computations to include the infiltration process in the simulations we utilized the green and ampt method green and ampt 1911 the green ampt infiltration model is one of the most widely used methods to estimate the infiltration flow in hydrological models van den putte et al 2013 the equation has been incorporated in recent studies in flood modelling particularly in southeast asia luo et al 2018 perera et al 2017 shrestha et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2021 yu et al 2016 the cumulative infiltration is determined by the values of hydraulic conductivity k s ms 1 wetting front suction head ψ m and the change in soil moisture content δ θ which can be calculated from the soil type data in this study the corresponding values of the hydraulic conductivity suction head and change in moisture content were obtained from chow et al 1988 table 1 for the catchment basin the direction of flow within the discretized square grid cells is calculated based on the elevation and steepness using the developed model the hydraulic domain is set according to the area of interest red square in fig 1 the grids are refined fig 1a and regularized fig 1b until the flood routing cells each cell denoted by h and hydraulic cells each cell denoted by h are established restrictions are set to evaluate the interaction between the flood routing and inundation cells during the integration process for the most part the model follows the shallow water flow hydrological scheme from upstream to downstream flow direction as shown in fig 2 routing cells are assumed in the majority of the watershed areas as these areas are mostly mountainous with conventionally 1d flow directions however for flat plains hydraulic cells are used to characterize the interaction between the flow in neighboring cells 2 2 governing equations the cumulative infiltration f t calculated using the green and ampt 1911 equation is derived as 1 f t k s t ψ δ θ ln 1 f t ψ δ θ where t is the time step of rainfall intensity further the potential infiltration rate f t can be derived as 2 f t k s ψ δ θ f t 1 due to the non linear characteristics of the green ampt equations eqs 1 and 2 are solved using newton s iteration method chow et al 1988 the overland flow can be assumed as shallow water wave propagation which can be represented using the saint venant equation dynamic wave propagation or inertia free and kinematic approximations katapodes 1982 the previously reported hydrological models were based on simplified approximations in which flood wave propagation was applied in steep terrains owing to its less complex computational requirements kim et al 2012 in our case the governing equation of the flood routing model is based on the kinematic wave concept of flow on a plane the equation is expressed as 3 h t q x r where h is the flow depth q is the discharge unit width x is the distance from the top of the plane and r is the rainfall intensity the depth discharge relationship is defined using the manning equation as 4 q 1 n s 1 2 h 2 3 where 1 n s 1 2 is the depth discharge coefficient n is the manning coefficient and s is the slope kim et al 2012 had reiterated that these simplified models are not suitable for calculating the flow over flat slopes into large reservoirs reversal and under backwater conditions therefore the dynamic wave concept is applied in this study for flood simulation under these conditions the 2d shallow water equations are implemented for inundation simulation because the horizontal floodplain scale is generally more significant than the water depth vertical acceleration can be neglected and hydrostatic pressure can be assumed liang et al 2008 thus the conservative form of the equations can be represented as follows 5 q t f x g y s where t denotes time x and y are distance in x and y direction respectively q represents the conservative variable in vector form f and g represent the x and y direction fluxes respectively s and s f are the source and friction terms respectively these variables are written as follows 6 q h h u h v f h u h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v g h v h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 s 0 h g z x s f x h g z y s f y where u and v are the x and y direction depth averaged velocity components respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity and z x z x and z y z y are the bed slopes in x and y direction respectively s f x and s f y are the fiction slopes in x and y direction respectively in general the dynamic wave equation is used for flood routing computations whereas a simplified version of the kinematic wave equation is used in the hydrological models in the kinematic wave theory the inertial and pressure terms are assumed to be insignificant consequently the kinematic wave equation is represented as h g z x s f x 0 h g z y s f y 0 furthermore the gravitational and frictional forces balance each other therefore no backwater effect is considered 2 3 spatial and temporal discretization the mesh refinement is based on finite volume discretization in which the rate of flow between two adjacent control volumes is evaluated in terms of cell pressures the continuity equation is spatially discretized using staggered control volumes integrated over each grid cell borthwick et al 2001a the second order discretization scheme for 2d grids can be written as an et al 2018 7 a i j δ t q i j n 1 q i j n f i j s i j s c i j where a i j is the cell area i j δ t is the time step n denotes the time level f i j is the numerical flux in x and y direction s i j is the source term and s c i j is a term added to balance the second order scheme this equation is divided into two steps using the predictor corrector time stepping scheme as follows 8 a i j q i j n 1 2 a i j q i j n δ t 2 f i j n s i j s c i j 9 a i j q i j n 1 a i j q i j n δ t f i j n 1 2 s i j s c i j eq 8 is the predictor step that calculates the value of the temporary cell center over t 2 time step the corrector step i e eq 9 updates the conservative values over t time step this scheme describes the second order accuracy in space and time for further details on the well balanced scheme and discretization used in this study the reader may refer to an and yu 2011 2 4 grid refinement and model integration framework the amr method is implemented to adaptively generate finer grids for areas with steep gradients or discontinuities for such areas approximating the solution over a coarse mesh covering the domain is a challenging concept berger and oliger 1984 in the computational implementation of the amr technique quadtree grids are used these quadtree grids are structured by subdividing the recursive domain around the seeding points where the location can be determined through the discretization of boundary and bathymetric flow features borthwick 2001b liang et al 2008 liang et al 2008 reported the details on the regularization of quadtree grids the corresponding steps are as follows 1 the domain of interest is normalized to fit in the initial square panel 2 the root is subdivided into four quadrants the seeding points are checked for each panel and further subdivided if more than a specific number are found the process is finally terminated when the desired level of grid resolution is attained 3 a factor of 2 is imposed as the constraint to limit the maximum difference between the adjacent cell dimensions this step prevents excessive variation in flow between the larger cells and neighboring cells 4 integral number of grids and cell refinement level are specified 5 the tree structure is then saved as an integer vector with pointers between parent and offspring cells the schematic process of the model which was developed using c programming language is shown in fig 3 the preliminary steps include the preparation of grid cells i e face cells computational cells and slope cells and setup of the rainfall station and simulation time step the rainfall in individual flood cell is calculated based on the computed topography and flooding is considered for either a hillslope or flat plain for the inundation domains the 2d shallow water equation is used to calculate the water flow and flooding in the computational cells conversely the kinematic wave equation is used for computing the flow and flooding in the slope cells thus the time varying 2d shallow water variables can be calculated using this rainfall to flood cell integration the spatial flood raster output is computed by implementing the mesh adaptation within the flood model in this process target cells are generated for dynamic refinement and merging using the first order temporal discretization scheme the first order face flux is computed for the first order spatial discretization while the face flux is computed for the second order spatial discretization subsequently the flux source sink term manning friction and number of merged small sized cells are calculated 3 model application 3 1 data acquisition and study domain for the past century various torrential rainfall events have been consistently occurring in metropolitan manila philippines the daily rainfall records at a station within the marikina pasig watershed for the years 2009 2020 fig 4 show that intense rainfall episodes have been occurring for the past few years these extreme rainfalls were triggered by typhoon ketsana in 2009 455 mm 12 h monsoon surges 2012 and 2013 978 mm 72 h and 407 mm 96 h the tropical storm yagi in 2018 270 mm 24 h and most recently typhoon vamco in 2020 356 mm 24 h these values were recorded at a different station the climate of metropolitan manila is described as dry from november to april and rainy from june to november because of typhoons and the monsoon the average monthly precipitation during the wettest month is 474 mm this conveys that the rainfall events had produced more or less equivalent to a month worth of rain in the span of few hours to a couple of days in addition to the intense rainfall several reasons exacerbate the effect of flooding to an exceptional level according to lagmay et al 2010 the urban landscape alterations that include encroachment of concrete surfaces densification of residential industrial and commercial buildings river siltation obstruction of waterways by informal settlers river narrowing due to floodplain development forest degradation etc are some of the reasons that heightened the adverse effects of flooding in manila accordingly different solutions have been suggested by researchers working in this field and various actions have been taken by the government to tackle this situation the suggested solutions are based on flood modeling which includes flood analysis through flood routing modeling lagmay et al 2017 semidistributed flood modeling badilla 2008 and river analysis flood modeling santillan et al 2013 as well as physical improvements and risk assessments such as river and sewer system renovation iglesias and yu 2008 jica 2005 jica 2014 meti 2018 impact assessment muto et al 2011 disaster risk prawiranegara 2014 and hazard mapping bautista et al 2014 since the event the philippine government has initiated nationwide statistical mapping of extreme rainfall frequencies and return period hazards using the hec hms and hec ras rainfall runoff and river analysis models bautista et al 2014 and flo2d flood routing model lagmay et al 2017 respectively fig 5 the multiscale hydro dynamic inundation model was used in this study to simulate the flooding caused by the severe rainfall during typhoon ketsana in 2009 in a highly urbanized region in the marikina river basin philippines fig 6 the susceptibility of the region to flooding as well as the analysis of the anomalous meteorological event of 2009 had been a topic of interest among earlier researchers as well abon et al 2011 de lara tuprio et al 2018 lagmay et al 2010 prawiranegara 2014 santillan et al 2013 sato and nakasu 2011 the catchment area has a mountainous region in the east and northeast laguna lake in the southeast and manila bay in the west the country s capital and principal city metro manila estimated population in 2020 of 13 984 656 is part of the catchment basin severe flooding in this region has huge negative impacts on the economic activities damages infrastructure and in serious cases results in loss of lives the subcatchment area fig 6 red polygon in particular was severely affected during the flood event while the previous researches had successfully provided flood assessments that aided with hazard mapping and disaster management this research shall discuss some of the domain s geographical and topographical characteristics that contributed to the severity of the flooding the research also aims to present supplementary information that can be used as an additional tool for early warning using the amr method the highest level of refinement was applied on the subcatchment and river channel areas while coarser resolution cells were implemented for the rest of the watershed area the model input and validation data as well as its description and sources are listed in table 2 the hourly rainfall data of the 2009 weather event is shown in fig 7 to demonstrate the difference between the flood propagation influenced by buildings and that by artificial barriers in the urban area 5 m grids are used in dtm and dsm the interferometric synthetic aperture radar ifsar data are used as the model inputs thus the watershed slope and flow direction are derived from dem and the watershed manning coefficient is calculated using the landcover data taken from philgis and calibrated using the remote sensing data the land use was converted to manning coefficient following chow s 1959 translation of roughness coefficient values i e forest land 0 7 cropland and pasture 0 035 streams and rivers 0 03 industrial commercial land 0 015 and residential land 0 012 the simulated flood inundation is validated using crowd sourced flood depths surveyed during the 2009 weather event although dtms are commonly used for flood hazard mapping of large areas more detailed inundation results derived through dsms are also considered priestnall et al 2000 in highly urbanized domains the dynamics of floodwater are largely influenced by the distribution of roads buildings levees etc wedajo 2017 moreover catchments with natural vegetation transformed into concrete and asphalt surfaces also significantly impact the urban hydrology by increasing the surface runoff volumes therefore proper representation of roads as preferential paths of flood propagation is necessary for high resolution flood modeling using dsms and accurate flood risk calculations dsms have been used in numerous studies for high resolution urban flood modeling mason et al 2007 meesuk et al 2015 priestnall et al 2000 wang et al 2018 yalcin 2018 therefore we utilized both dtm and dsm as base topographies for the simulations in this study fig 8 to explore the possibility of generating an appropriate representation of the inundation that occurred during the urban flood event 3 2 simulation procedure the model is initialized following the prerequired conditions initially digital elevation data of different resolutions 200 m watershed scale 30 m middle scale and 5 m subcatchment scale are prepared the higher resolution dtm and dsm data are used for computing the hydraulic flooding in the subdomain the rescaled dem data flow direction and slope and manning coefficient of the watershed are generated through the use of geographic information system gis softwares next the user dependent information such as the simulation duration raster range grid size and refinement levels for the river streamline and inundation domain are set up the watershed grids are automatically assigned for the gis generated parameters grids with initial spatial dimensions of 200 m 200 m are set for the watershed area as shown in fig 6 and refinements are applied in the target regions the generated mesh is then used as the floodplain basis for the runoff simulation additionally the rainfall intensity time series data i e time t and intensity v of a source point location x y are also added the model follows the procedure described in section 2 4 under these conditions to compute the flood inundation 3 3 results and analysis numerical simulations were performed to replicate the flood inundation observed during the extreme rainfall event of 2009 in a subcatchment region in the marikina pasig river basin the start and end period are set considering the time at which the rainfall intensity started increasing significantly september 26 00 1800 h ideally the grid size of the origin cells is based on the resolution of the kinematic domain in this case 200 m by 200 m the cells are then refined for the areas of streams and inundation region for this specific watershed subcatchment a maximum refinement level of 4 was identified this implies that the model can generate a flood cell with a resolution of 12 5 m 12 5 m without encountering a numerical error the difference in grid resolution of the hydrologic and hydraulic cells may cause some discrepancies in the boundaries for example greater discharge is simulated when the difference between the elevation of the lower resolution watershed and the higher resolution subbasin is higher subsequently flow is weaker on the boundaries where the elevation of watershed dem is lesser than the elevation of the subbasin however these discrepancies are minimal and does not impose problem on the overall simulation 3 3 1 flood depth and flow velocity figs 9 and 10 show the flood depth extent and flow velocity simulated using dtm and dsm as base topographies respectively the flood simulations based on dtm show that floodwater is accumulated in the subcatchment areas with relatively lower elevations fig 9 t 12 15 h while the dsm based flood simulations indicate that the inundation is evenly distributed and mostly contained along the natural and artificial barriers throughout the domain fig 10 t 15 18 h the flood propagation derived via the dtm simulations shows inundations with greater depth in the surroundings of the stream and river in contrast low to no flooding is observed in the rest of the areas however the dsm simulations show clustered inundations in the pseudo catchment areas all over the domain dsm calculations also cannot capture the barely visible streams the dtm simulations on the other hand can capture these flooding due to the streams being treated as lower elevated areas and thus flood flow towards these regions the developed model can also calculate the flood flow velocity and therefore identify the flash flood susceptible areas which were severely affected during the 2009 extreme rainfall event the flood flow that exceeds a flow velocity of 3 0 m s is considered risky for people and property cox et al 2010 hou et al 2020 lumbroso and gaume 2012 in figs 9 and 10 the flash flood susceptible areas with steep elevation slopes surrounding the river are indicated by black arrows compared to the results of dtm simulation in fig 9 the elevated structures observed in the dsm simulations fig 10 seem to disrupt the flow and reduce the flow velocity the simulations based on dtm and dsm models also provided information on the source of the initial flood flow while the upstream river is highlighted as the main source of floodwater figs 9 and 10 the interim streams coming from the east and northeast where the subcatchment is bounded to the mountainous regions are also perceived to be the preliminary sources of flood with this in mind the severe flooding can be attributed to i the subdomain s position as the receiving catchment end for the floodwater coming from the elevated mountainous regions and ii a large percentage of the flat and low lying elevation of the most affected areas within the subbasin fig 6 the stream was not able to accommodate the sudden increase of rainfall about 200 mm in the span of 3 h fig 7 which results flood to flow towards the flat plains 3 3 2 validation of simulation results the comparison of observed and simulated maximum flood depth are shown in fig 11 and table 3 fig 11 shows that maximum flood depth generated using dtm simulations could capture the inundation surrounding the river streams and lower elevation areas dsm simulations on the other hand adequately represented the floodwater accumulated in the pseudo enclosures while majority of the observed flood points are consistent with the simulation results table 3 some additional observations are also noted for instance the results from dtm simulations are slightly underestimated on the floodplains away from the river although dsm calculations can capture these floods it may overestimate the flood depth in some of the enclosed small catchments the overestimations of flood depth in these areas are presumed to be caused by the absence of distinguishable flood outlets such as distinctly defined roads and canals that would act as a flood flow paths towards the river coming from the confined areas the performance of the flood model is highly dependent on the accuracy of the elevation data this case has been emphasized in a number of researches in recent years de almeida et al 2018 hawker et al 2018 kim et al 2020 the use of dsm in urban modelling allows the calculation of flow dynamics along critical micro features of building configurations that significantly influences the flow in this research the inundation accumulated within a distance from the streams has been captured in the dsm simulations which is not possible if only a traditional dem data is utilized however flood overestimations are likely to be expected for dsm simulations of this resolution in some cases the resolution of the dem is lesser than the size of the flood grid this condition prohibits the flood to freely flow from higher to lower elevation grids thus resulting to overestimations the integration of drainage system on the calculations is also important in simulating a detailed urban flood inundation the impact of sewer system might not be as effective for extreme flood events nevertheless the integration has a probability to lessen the initial inundation which might have an influence to the overall simulation for this case incorporating sewer system and utilizing higher resolution dsms are recommended 3 3 3 determination of total affected area and flow volume the time dependent changes in the total inundated area 0 01 m flood depth flood hazard area 1 5 m flood depth and flow volume are shown in fig 12 the maximum inundated area is recorded between t 10 and 13 h for both the dtm and dsm based flood simulations even though rainfall peak is not observed until t 11 h fig 7 the maximum flow volume arrives from the upstream where the continuous flow from higher elevation areas are occuring fig 12 indicates that the dtm simulations generated more inundated areas than dsm flood depth with values 0 01 m the total flood volume km3 is computed by multiplying the values of inundated area and flood depth comparison on the changes of dtm and dsm flood volume with respect to time fig 12 blue and red bar graph illustrates that dsm simulations generates flooding with greater depth as compared to dtm simulations producing extensive but more shallow inundation dsms have more complex elevation allowing the flood water to accumulate in lower elevated pseudo catchments within the urban domain additionally the hazard areas 1 5 m flood depth are also calculated using the flood simulations based on dtm and dsm hazard areas are indicative of definite unsafe areas with respect to flooding during storm rainfall events table 4 lists the maximum total hazard area of the simulated flood depths and the mapped flood hazard area currently used in the philippines fig 5 the amount of rainfall obtained during typhoon ketsana in 2009 i e 455 mm 12 h is classified as 100 year return period rainfall according to the typhoon ketsana induced rainfall data the mapped hazard areas 1 5 m flood depth constitute approximately 41 07 of the whole urban domain however the dtm and dsm calculated hazard areas are found to be 10 94 and 25 05 respectively the existing return period flood hazard maps have been an integral part of flood disaster planning and mitigation in the country however these methods are not practical to be used for predicting short duration urban flooding the watershed scale high resolution flood hazard modeling usually requires long simulation period therefore the hazard maps are generated and set in advance according to the equivalent rainfall return period in addition during floods the dwellers living in multistorey buildings tend to refuse evacuation because of various reasons including physical disability fear of losing material properties owing to looting and overcrowded evacuation facilities petrolia and bhattacharjee 2010 stephens et al 2009 walsh 2018 the method proposed in this paper will provide the necessary information to create relatively safer temporary shelters to take refuge during flood events 3 3 4 water level comparison the calculated water level through dtm and dsm simulations are compared with the recorded values taking an assumption that the initial water level at this station is 12 24 m observed and simulated water level at sto nino station fig 8 during the storm event is shown in fig 13 figure shows that the simulated maximum water level for the station are 20 20 m t 12 h and 22 38 m t 13 h for dtm and dsm simulations respectively the observed maximum water level at the same station is 20 34 m recorded at t 16 h although the maximum water level obtained using dtm simulations is closer to that of observed the time varying fluctuation of water level is more closely represented using dsm simulations whilst the behavior of water level can be properly modeled a time difference between the observed and simulated maximum peak is still significant possible reasons for the discrepancies in the simulations include the exclusion of small scale effect of dams and levees in the upstream which was not adequately captured in the coarse resolution kinematic computation on that account the use detailed river cross section data is recommended the limited data on the spatial distribution of rainfall throughout the watershed may have also contributed to the deviation of observed and simulated results in addition since the watershed roughness coefficient is only roughly estimated outside the hydraulic domain a kind of manning corrector or control value is needed to be established in order to recreate the water level as close as possible 4 conclusions the major conclusions and implications of this study are summarized below the implementation of the amr technique in multiscale rainfall runoff and inundation flood modeling yielded flood hydrodynamics at varying grid scales this approach provides the possibility to simulate overland inundation from watershed scale to subdomain scale without the requirement of stream boundary conditions this is achieved by applying a simplified kinematic equation to the coarser spatial resolution outer grids and the 2d shallow water flow equation to the higher resolution hydraulic domain the flooding in the urban subcatchment is evaluated using digital terrain and surface modeled images with 5 m resolution the simulation results for flood depth and extent are validated using the observed flood point data the flood and no flood area identification performance of dsm r2 value of 0 875 is better represented than that of dtm r2 value of 0 275 moreover a refinement threshold of 4 is identified based on the size and proportion of the watershed and subbasin higher level refinements are also possible for small scale domains for the simulations of water level results from dtm simulations was able to represent the maximum water level more closely however the water level trend was more adequately characterized in dsm simulations to capture the precise peak time of the maximum water level the use of more detailed river cross section data spatial distribution of rainfall and a watershed roughness coefficient corrector is recommended results showed that in addition to the intense rainfall the severity of the flood during the 2009 event is attributed to the subdomain s location acting as a receiving catchment for the floodwater coming from the connecting mountains and due to the topographical features of the urban area which is generally flat and low lying without environmental interventions sudden intense rainfall episodes are then expected to cause river overflow in this areas of the urban domain the ability to simulate urban inundation without the need to require observed discharge boundary conditions opens a possibility of the use of rainfall forecast data for real time flood prediction this would allow a more detailed urban flood forecasting for intense short duration storms in addition the developed model can provide critical flood information such as the concentration of flood estimated peak time flood source point and flow velocity this information can be used as supplementary tools to aid for early warning and flood prevention several advantages of the integrated model in flood analysis have been highlighted in this paper however some model limitations and study constraints may require further improvements the proposed model is a simplified form of the surface rainfall runoff and inundation model the influence of interception percolation evapotranspiration and groundwater dynamics are not considered in the calculations the calculation of sediment transport a fundamental component in characterizing the environmental and morphological changes during flood events is also not included in the simulations incorporating these processes into the model is essential in interpreting the hydrological processes that occur within the watershed however the interdependence between surface hydraulics and subsurface hydrology was not explored in this study in addition although the dsm used in this study could reproduce the building obstructions and barriers the precise outline of the road network is not perfectly captured thus higher resolution 5 m resolution or modified dsm based simulations are required for accurately representing the flood propagation along buildings and road networks more importantly the effects of integration of the sewer system on urban flooding was not examined in this study the inclusion of the influence of sewer network is critical for properly representing the onset and recession of floodwater in urban inundations the efficiency of the proposed model in simulating integrated watershed scale rainfall runoff and subcatchment scale hydrodynamics is demonstrated from the simulation results the inclusion of dsm in the flood modeling provides information that aids in securing safe evacuation spaces during flood events the simulated inundations with finer resolutions will be useful in forecasting short duration and minor urban floods thereby aiding in traffic advisories road constructions and canal renovations with the use of the flood simulations flood control actions can be done such as river bed desiltation analysis on the optimization of levee height designing sewer pipe capacity identifying flood prone locations for constructing pump stations improving the accuracy of the flood warning system etc the incorporation of these aspects in regional flood modeling is still less ventured declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8083,study region marikina pasig basin philippines study focus a multiscale rainfall runoff and inundation model was developed to simulate the severe flooding caused by a high intensity short duration storm rainfall event in the urban domain the model used the 2d shallow water flow and finite volume schemes with second order space time accuracy to automatically incorporate the runoff into the flood inundation the adaptive mesh refinement scheme a variable grid sizing technique was implemented to dynamically refine the mesh from a watershed scale to a more precise inundation in a subcatchment floodplain the digital terrain and surface models were used to represent the variations in flood propagation along buildings and artificial barriers in the urban area additionally the simulated flood depths and extent were validated by comparison with the observed data new hydrological insight the severe inundation produced by the extreme rainfall event was perceived to be caused by a combination of fluvial and pluvial flooding exacerbated by the domain s flat and low lying elevation and its geographical features acting as a flood water receiving catchment accrued from the adjacent mountainous regions the proposed method can be used to identify the flood depth and water accumulation estimated peak time potential flash flood prone areas and imperceptible flood origins without the need to establish first the water level and stream discharge boundary conditions the domain specific flood simulations can be used for early warning and to identify a broader scope of possible evacuation points during storm based flooding events graphical abstract ga1 keywords multiscale inundation modeling rainfall runoff inundation modeling adaptive mesh refinement extreme rainfall events 1 introduction storm driven urban flooding has disastrous effects on society as it causes loss of lives infrastructural damage and economic disruption in a global scale southeast asia pacific countries in particular are especially susceptible to urban flooding due to climate conditions exposure to monsoonal rains and tropical cyclones chen et al 2020 tierolf et al 2021 torti 2012 with the potential effect of changing climate in the pattern and intensity of extreme rainfall events flooding is expected to be frequently experienced in these regions in the future in addition to this due to the physical causes of urban flooding which includes landuse change with the continuous construction of impervious surfaces unorganized urbanization river encroachment and poorly constructed drainage systems the adverse effects of flood inundation are especially high in developing countries inspite of this only a limited number of studies related to flood risk management have been reported in these countries over the years nkwunonwo et al 2020 the ongoing efforts in alleviating the negative effects of flooding have highlighted the requirement of developing advance numerical flood models such advanced models are required to predict the associated flood hazards perform risk mapping post assessment analysis flood protection and prevention water resource management and real time flood forecasting in rural areas larger and coarser resolution models can be used for mapping flood hazards in urban areas however flood simulation is heavily dependent on the accurate simulation of the superficial flow which requires much more detailed elevation models as a result the urban flood simulation models are constrained by limited simulation times and real time data assimilation teng et al 2017 in the absence of sufficient historical data modeling techniques based on the hydrodynamic approach are rapidly gaining preference for flood simulation the conventional approaches used for modeling regional flooding which is primarily caused by the surrounding watersheds provide independent or integrated simulations of the catchment hydrological and hydraulic processes for example the hec ras 1d 2d unsteady flow model where 1d and 2d are the abbreviations of one dimensional and two dimensional respectively computes the 2d flood inundation using the connecting upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the 1d river flow usace 2021 some of the related modeling techniques include the integrated rainfall runoff and inundation modeling i e anselmo et al 1996 nastiti et

encountered while running individual computations of runoff and inundation analyzing the data and reproducing the results in a multiscale domain is a more challenging and significant problem in the available literature multiscale modeling is mostly described as the simulation of an inundation using spatial grids at different scales bradbook 2006 developed the jflow 2d dynamic flood model bradbook 2006 and applied it to simulate a large scale fluvial and drainage flooding using 10 m and 1 m grids respectively scorpio et al 2016 identified the flood prone areas in alluvial fans by developing a model based on medium scale 1 50 000 1 10 000 and large scale approaches 1 5000 1 1000 viterbo et al 2020 conducted a comprehensive assessment of the hydro meteorological processes in watershed scale and urban domain scale flooding from a synoptic perspective the grid nesting approach has also been applied to simulate coastal flooding by olbert et al 2017 they developed a dynamically linked ocean and coastal flood models to produce a cascade of nested grids at different spatial scales 90 30 6 and 2 m for capturing the urban coastal flood consequently a recent study done by hashimoto et al 2021 also performed multiscale 2d nested grid approach in flood simulation calculated inter district district and regional scale for a flat land multiscale nesting is applied to perform accurate high resolution flood modeling with reduced computational expenses as it compensates the lower modeling accuracy using coarser resolution grids in this study the adaptive mesh refinement amr scheme was implemented to adjust the grid resolution by following the flow features or focusing areas instead of creating a uniform fine resolution grid for the whole domain the multiscale nesting and adaptive mesh approach are different in a sense that the former is performed by simulating coarser grids and then focusing on detailed grids in separate computations while amr performs simultaneous simulations of grid elements the amr technique has been used in a wide number of applications related to shallow water flow dynamics including river hydrodynamic predictions

and rising sea level kirstetter et al 2020 presented a real time flood mapping method for a coastal catchment area using the amr and 2d hydraulic modeling tools with the exception of the reported study of busaman et al 2015 these studies highlighted the use of adaptive mesh in capturing flash flood events in smaller catchments 100 km2 however studies on advances on adaptive integration of watershed scale surface runoff into an urban subbasin are very limited coupled flood models such as lisflood bates 2021 and hec ras usace 2021 simulate floodplain inundation incorporating the watershed kinematic channel flow into the overland flooding the hydrodynamic simulation is processed with discharge and water level input parameters which are obtained from separate computations of the hydrologic model however independent computations can impose complications self contained simulations of localized independent domains can often introduce unnatural boundaries cutting off the flood flow links between the inside and outside part of the domain which oftentimes leads to unreliable results xing et al 2018 in this paper we propose a framework for integrating the hydrological runoff routing and hydrodynamics of inundation flow this proposed integrated framework incorporates a large scale spatially coarse grid for a watershed 1215 km2 and a high resolution hydrodynamic inundation model for an urban subbasin 40 km2 eliminating the necessity to include the upstream and downstream boundary conditions as prerequisites for the flood simulation the main objectives of this study are 1 to simulate urban flooding within the framework of the adaptive mesh based rainfall runoff inundation model and 2 test the applicability of the developed model to an urban subbasin domain in marikina pasig river basin philippines providing insights on the topographical characteristics that had contributed to the severity of the flooding during typhoon ketsana 2009 moreover urban flood modeling is particularly challenging owing to the unavailability of suitable representations for natural flow paths and manmade structures hapuarachchi et al 2011 the urban environment that includes buildings and barriers as well as open areas strongly impacts the flow dynamics and hence should be included in the calculations paquier et al 2015 thus to introduce a proper representation of flooding in an urban area the high resolution digital terrain model dtm and digital surface model dsm were used in this study to simulate urban flooding the flood prediction performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the flood depth points observed during the rainfall event furthermore the advantages potential shortcomings and prospective improvements of the proposed model are also discussed in this paper 2 model theory 2 1 rainfall runoff inundation model a conceptual rainfall runoff model in general is based on the water balance formula that describes the rainfall runoff as an equivalent of the estimated amount of excess water from precipitation after discounting the effect of evapotranspiration soil moisture infiltration and groundwater storage sitterson et al 2017 however according to haan et al 1994 in spite of the high total percentage of rainfall involved in the evapotranspiration process the evapotranspiration in individual storms is generally a minor factor and is usually not included in the storm water computations to include the infiltration process in the simulations we utilized the green and ampt method green and ampt 1911 the green ampt infiltration model is one of the most widely used methods to estimate the infiltration flow in hydrological models van den putte et al 2013 the equation has been incorporated in recent studies in flood modelling particularly in southeast asia luo et al 2018 perera et al 2017 shrestha et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2021 yu et al 2016 the cumulative infiltration is determined by the values of hydraulic conductivity k s ms 1 wetting front suction head ψ m and the change in soil moisture content δ θ which can be calculated from the soil type data in this study the corresponding values of the hydraulic conductivity suction head and change in moisture content were obtained from chow et al 1988 table 1 for the catchment basin the direction of flow within the discretized square grid cells is calculated based on the elevation and steepness using the developed model the hydraulic domain is set according to the area of interest red square in fig 1 the grids are refined fig 1a and regularized fig 1b until the flood routing cells each cell denoted by h and hydraulic cells each cell denoted by h are established restrictions are set to evaluate the interaction between the flood routing and inundation cells during the integration process for the most part the model follows the shallow water flow hydrological scheme from upstream to downstream flow direction as shown in fig 2 routing cells are assumed in the majority of the watershed areas as these areas are mostly mountainous with conventionally 1d flow directions however for flat plains hydraulic cells are used to characterize the interaction between the flow in neighboring cells 2 2 governing equations the cumulative infiltration f t calculated using the green and ampt 1911 equation is derived as 1 f t k s t ψ δ θ ln 1 f t ψ δ θ where t is the time step of rainfall intensity further the potential infiltration rate f t can be derived as 2 f t k s ψ δ θ f t 1 due to the non linear characteristics of the green ampt equations eqs 1 and 2 are solved using newton s iteration method chow et al 1988 the overland flow can be assumed as shallow water wave propagation which can be represented using the saint venant equation dynamic wave propagation or inertia free and kinematic approximations katapodes 1982 the previously reported hydrological models were based on simplified approximations in which flood wave propagation was applied in steep terrains owing to its less complex computational requirements kim et al 2012 in our case the governing equation of the flood routing model is based on the kinematic wave concept of flow on a plane the equation is expressed as 3 h t q x r where h is the flow depth q is the discharge unit width x is the distance from the top of the plane and r is the rainfall intensity the depth discharge relationship is defined using the manning equation as 4 q 1 n s 1 2 h 2 3 where 1 n s 1 2 is the depth discharge coefficient n is the manning coefficient and s is the slope kim et al 2012 had reiterated that these simplified models are not suitable for calculating the flow over flat slopes into large reservoirs reversal and under backwater conditions therefore the dynamic wave concept is applied in this study for flood simulation under these conditions the 2d shallow water equations are implemented for inundation simulation because the horizontal floodplain scale is generally more significant than the water depth vertical acceleration can be neglected and hydrostatic pressure can be assumed liang et al 2008 thus the conservative form of the equations can be represented as follows 5 q t f x g y s where t denotes time x and y are distance in x and y direction respectively q represents the conservative variable in vector form f and g represent the x and y direction fluxes respectively s and s f are the source and friction terms respectively these variables are written as follows 6 q h h u h v f h u h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v g h v h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 s 0 h g z x s f x h g z y s f y where u and v are the x and y direction depth averaged velocity components respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity and z x z x and z y z y are the bed slopes in x and y direction respectively s f x and s f y are the fiction slopes in x and y direction respectively in general the dynamic wave equation is used for flood routing computations whereas a simplified version of the kinematic wave equation is used in the hydrological models in the kinematic wave theory the inertial and pressure terms are assumed to be insignificant consequently the kinematic wave equation is represented as h g z x s f x 0 h g z y s f y 0 furthermore the gravitational and frictional forces balance each other therefore no backwater effect is considered 2 3 spatial and temporal discretization the mesh refinement is based on finite volume discretization in which the rate of flow between two adjacent control volumes is evaluated in terms of cell pressures the continuity equation is spatially discretized using staggered control volumes integrated over each grid cell borthwick et al 2001a the second order discretization scheme for 2d grids can be written as an et al 2018 7 a i j δ t q i j n 1 q i j n f i j s i j s c i j where a i j is the cell area i j δ t is the time step n denotes the time level f i j is the numerical flux in x and y direction s i j is the source term and s c i j is a term added to balance the second order scheme this equation is divided into two steps using the predictor corrector time stepping scheme as follows 8 a i j q i j n 1 2 a i j q i j n δ t 2 f i j n s i j s c i j 9 a i j q i j n 1 a i j q i j n δ t f i j n 1 2 s i j s c i j eq 8 is the predictor step that calculates the value of the temporary cell center over t 2 time step the corrector step i e eq 9 updates the conservative values over t time step this scheme describes the second order accuracy in space and time for further details on the well balanced scheme and discretization used in this study the reader may refer to an and yu 2011 2 4 grid refinement and model integration framework the amr method is implemented to adaptively generate finer grids for areas with steep gradients or discontinuities for such areas approximating the solution over a coarse mesh covering the domain is a challenging concept berger and oliger 1984 in the computational implementation of the amr technique quadtree grids are used these quadtree grids are structured by subdividing the recursive domain around the seeding points where the location can be determined through the discretization of boundary and bathymetric flow features borthwick 2001b liang et al 2008 liang et al 2008 reported the details on the regularization of quadtree grids the corresponding steps are as follows 1 the domain of interest is normalized to fit in the initial square panel 2 the root is subdivided into four quadrants the seeding points are checked for each panel and further subdivided if more than a specific number are found the process is finally terminated when the desired level of grid resolution is attained 3 a factor of 2 is imposed as the constraint to limit the maximum difference between the adjacent cell dimensions this step prevents excessive variation in flow between the larger cells and neighboring cells 4 integral number of grids and cell refinement level are specified 5 the tree structure is then saved as an integer vector with pointers between parent and offspring cells the schematic process of the model which was developed using c programming language is shown in fig 3 the preliminary steps include the preparation of grid cells i e face cells computational cells and slope cells and setup of the rainfall station and simulation time step the rainfall in individual flood cell is calculated based on the computed topography and flooding is considered for either a hillslope or flat plain for the inundation domains the 2d shallow water equation is used to calculate the water flow and flooding in the computational cells conversely the kinematic wave equation is used for computing the flow and flooding in the slope cells thus the time varying 2d shallow water variables can be calculated using this rainfall to flood cell integration the spatial flood raster output is computed by implementing the mesh adaptation within the flood model in this process target cells are generated for dynamic refinement and merging using the first order temporal discretization scheme the first order face flux is computed for the first order spatial discretization while the face flux is computed for the second order spatial discretization subsequently the flux source sink term manning friction and number of merged small sized cells are calculated 3 model application 3 1 data acquisition and study domain for the past century various torrential rainfall events have been consistently occurring in metropolitan manila philippines the daily rainfall records at a station within the marikina pasig watershed for the years 2009 2020 fig 4 show that intense rainfall episodes have been occurring for the past few years these extreme rainfalls were triggered by typhoon ketsana in 2009 455 mm 12 h monsoon surges 2012 and 2013 978 mm 72 h and 407 mm 96 h the tropical storm yagi in 2018 270 mm 24 h and most recently typhoon vamco in 2020 356 mm 24 h these values were recorded at a different station the climate of metropolitan manila is described as dry from november to april and rainy from june to november because of typhoons and the monsoon the average monthly precipitation during the wettest month is 474 mm this conveys that the rainfall events had produced more or less equivalent to a month worth of rain in the span of few hours to a couple of days in addition to the intense rainfall several reasons exacerbate the effect of flooding to an exceptional level according to lagmay et al 2010 the urban landscape alterations that include encroachment of concrete surfaces densification of residential industrial and commercial buildings river siltation obstruction of waterways by informal settlers river narrowing due to floodplain development forest degradation etc are some of the reasons that heightened the adverse effects of flooding in manila accordingly different solutions have been suggested by researchers working in this field and various actions have been taken by the government to tackle this situation the suggested solutions are based on flood modeling which includes flood analysis through flood routing modeling lagmay et al 2017 semidistributed flood modeling badilla 2008 and river analysis flood modeling santillan et al 2013 as well as physical improvements and risk assessments such as river and sewer system renovation iglesias and yu 2008 jica 2005 jica 2014 meti 2018 impact assessment muto et al 2011 disaster risk prawiranegara 2014 and hazard mapping bautista et al 2014 since the event the philippine government has initiated nationwide statistical mapping of extreme rainfall frequencies and return period hazards using the hec hms and hec ras rainfall runoff and river analysis models bautista et al 2014 and flo2d flood routing model lagmay et al 2017 respectively fig 5 the multiscale hydro dynamic inundation model was used in this study to simulate the flooding caused by the severe rainfall during typhoon ketsana in 2009 in a highly urbanized region in the marikina river basin philippines fig 6 the susceptibility of the region to flooding as well as the analysis of the anomalous meteorological event of 2009 had been a topic of interest among earlier researchers as well abon et al 2011 de lara tuprio et al 2018 lagmay et al 2010 prawiranegara 2014 santillan et al 2013 sato and nakasu 2011 the catchment area has a mountainous region in the east and northeast laguna lake in the southeast and manila bay in the west the country s capital and principal city metro manila estimated population in 2020 of 13 984 656 is part of the catchment basin severe flooding in this region has huge negative impacts on the economic activities damages infrastructure and in serious cases results in loss of lives the subcatchment area fig 6 red polygon in particular was severely affected during the flood event while the previous researches had successfully provided flood assessments that aided with hazard mapping and disaster management this research shall discuss some of the domain s geographical and topographical characteristics that contributed to the severity of the flooding the research also aims to present supplementary information that can be used as an additional tool for early warning using the amr method the highest level of refinement was applied on the subcatchment and river channel areas while coarser resolution cells were implemented for the rest of the watershed area the model input and validation data as well as its description and sources are listed in table 2 the hourly rainfall data of the 2009 weather event is shown in fig 7 to demonstrate the difference between the flood propagation influenced by buildings and that by artificial barriers in the urban area 5 m grids are used in dtm and dsm the interferometric synthetic aperture radar ifsar data are used as the model inputs thus the watershed slope and flow direction are derived from dem and the watershed manning coefficient is calculated using the landcover data taken from philgis and calibrated using the remote sensing data the land use was converted to manning coefficient following chow s 1959 translation of roughness coefficient values i e forest land 0 7 cropland and pasture 0 035 streams and rivers 0 03 industrial commercial land 0 015 and residential land 0 012 the simulated flood inundation is validated using crowd sourced flood depths surveyed during the 2009 weather event although dtms are commonly used for flood hazard mapping of large areas more detailed inundation results derived through dsms are also considered priestnall et al 2000 in highly urbanized domains the dynamics of floodwater are largely influenced by the distribution of roads buildings levees etc wedajo 2017 moreover catchments with natural vegetation transformed into concrete and asphalt surfaces also significantly impact the urban hydrology by increasing the surface runoff volumes therefore proper representation of roads as preferential paths of flood propagation is necessary for high resolution flood modeling using dsms and accurate flood risk calculations dsms have been used in numerous studies for high resolution urban flood modeling mason et al 2007 meesuk et al 2015 priestnall et al 2000 wang et al 2018 yalcin 2018 therefore we utilized both dtm and dsm as base topographies for the simulations in this study fig 8 to explore the possibility of generating an appropriate representation of the inundation that occurred during the urban flood event 3 2 simulation procedure the model is initialized following the prerequired conditions initially digital elevation data of different resolutions 200 m watershed scale 30 m middle scale and 5 m subcatchment scale are prepared the higher resolution dtm and dsm data are used for computing the hydraulic flooding in the subdomain the rescaled dem data flow direction and slope and manning coefficient of the watershed are generated through the use of geographic information system gis softwares next the user dependent information such as the simulation duration raster range grid size and refinement levels for the river streamline and inundation domain are set up the watershed grids are automatically assigned for the gis generated parameters grids with initial spatial dimensions of 200 m 200 m are set for the watershed area as shown in fig 6 and refinements are applied in the target regions the generated mesh is then used as the floodplain basis for the runoff simulation additionally the rainfall intensity time series data i e time t and intensity v of a source point location x y are also added the model follows the procedure described in section 2 4 under these conditions to compute the flood inundation 3 3 results and analysis numerical simulations were performed to replicate the flood inundation observed during the extreme rainfall event of 2009 in a subcatchment region in the marikina pasig river basin the start and end period are set considering the time at which the rainfall intensity started increasing significantly september 26 00 1800 h ideally the grid size of the origin cells is based on the resolution of the kinematic domain in this case 200 m by 200 m the cells are then refined for the areas of streams and inundation region for this specific watershed subcatchment a maximum refinement level of 4 was identified this implies that the model can generate a flood cell with a resolution of 12 5 m 12 5 m without encountering a numerical error the difference in grid resolution of the hydrologic and hydraulic cells may cause some discrepancies in the boundaries for example greater discharge is simulated when the difference between the elevation of the lower resolution watershed and the higher resolution subbasin is higher subsequently flow is weaker on the boundaries where the elevation of watershed dem is lesser than the elevation of the subbasin however these discrepancies are minimal and does not impose problem on the overall simulation 3 3 1 flood depth and flow velocity figs 9 and 10 show the flood depth extent and flow velocity simulated using dtm and dsm as base topographies respectively the flood simulations based on dtm show that floodwater is accumulated in the subcatchment areas with relatively lower elevations fig 9 t 12 15 h while the dsm based flood simulations indicate that the inundation is evenly distributed and mostly contained along the natural and artificial barriers throughout the domain fig 10 t 15 18 h the flood propagation derived via the dtm simulations shows inundations with greater depth in the surroundings of the stream and river in contrast low to no flooding is observed in the rest of the areas however the dsm simulations show clustered inundations in the pseudo catchment areas all over the domain dsm calculations also cannot capture the barely visible streams the dtm simulations on the other hand can capture these flooding due to the streams being treated as lower elevated areas and thus flood flow towards these regions the developed model can also calculate the flood flow velocity and therefore identify the flash flood susceptible areas which were severely affected during the 2009 extreme rainfall event the flood flow that exceeds a flow velocity of 3 0 m s is considered risky for people and property cox et al 2010 hou et al 2020 lumbroso and gaume 2012 in figs 9 and 10 the flash flood susceptible areas with steep elevation slopes surrounding the river are indicated by black arrows compared to the results of dtm simulation in fig 9 the elevated structures observed in the dsm simulations fig 10 seem to disrupt the flow and reduce the flow velocity the simulations based on dtm and dsm models also provided information on the source of the initial flood flow while the upstream river is highlighted as the main source of floodwater figs 9 and 10 the interim streams coming from the east and northeast where the subcatchment is bounded to the mountainous regions are also perceived to be the preliminary sources of flood with this in mind the severe flooding can be attributed to i the subdomain s position as the receiving catchment end for the floodwater coming from the elevated mountainous regions and ii a large percentage of the flat and low lying elevation of the most affected areas within the subbasin fig 6 the stream was not able to accommodate the sudden increase of rainfall about 200 mm in the span of 3 h fig 7 which results flood to flow towards the flat plains 3 3 2 validation of simulation results the comparison of observed and simulated maximum flood depth are shown in fig 11 and table 3 fig 11 shows that maximum flood depth generated using dtm simulations could capture the inundation surrounding the river streams and lower elevation areas dsm simulations on the other hand adequately represented the floodwater accumulated in the pseudo enclosures while majority of the observed flood points are consistent with the simulation results table 3 some additional observations are also noted for instance the results from dtm simulations are slightly underestimated on the floodplains away from the river although dsm calculations can capture these floods it may overestimate the flood depth in some of the enclosed small catchments the overestimations of flood depth in these areas are presumed to be caused by the absence of distinguishable flood outlets such as distinctly defined roads and canals that would act as a flood flow paths towards the river coming from the confined areas the performance of the flood model is highly dependent on the accuracy of the elevation data this case has been emphasized in a number of researches in recent years de almeida et al 2018 hawker et al 2018 kim et al 2020 the use of dsm in urban modelling allows the calculation of flow dynamics along critical micro features of building configurations that significantly influences the flow in this research the inundation accumulated within a distance from the streams has been captured in the dsm simulations which is not possible if only a traditional dem data is utilized however flood overestimations are likely to be expected for dsm simulations of this resolution in some cases the resolution of the dem is lesser than the size of the flood grid this condition prohibits the flood to freely flow from higher to lower elevation grids thus resulting to overestimations the integration of drainage system on the calculations is also important in simulating a detailed urban flood inundation the impact of sewer system might not be as effective for extreme flood events nevertheless the integration has a probability to lessen the initial inundation which might have an influence to the overall simulation for this case incorporating sewer system and utilizing higher resolution dsms are recommended 3 3 3 determination of total affected area and flow volume the time dependent changes in the total inundated area 0 01 m flood depth flood hazard area 1 5 m flood depth and flow volume are shown in fig 12 the maximum inundated area is recorded between t 10 and 13 h for both the dtm and dsm based flood simulations even though rainfall peak is not observed until t 11 h fig 7 the maximum flow volume arrives from the upstream where the continuous flow from higher elevation areas are occuring fig 12 indicates that the dtm simulations generated more inundated areas than dsm flood depth with values 0 01 m the total flood volume km3 is computed by multiplying the values of inundated area and flood depth comparison on the changes of dtm and dsm flood volume with respect to time fig 12 blue and red bar graph illustrates that dsm simulations generates flooding with greater depth as compared to dtm simulations producing extensive but more shallow inundation dsms have more complex elevation allowing the flood water to accumulate in lower elevated pseudo catchments within the urban domain additionally the hazard areas 1 5 m flood depth are also calculated using the flood simulations based on dtm and dsm hazard areas are indicative of definite unsafe areas with respect to flooding during storm rainfall events table 4 lists the maximum total hazard area of the simulated flood depths and the mapped flood hazard area currently used in the philippines fig 5 the amount of rainfall obtained during typhoon ketsana in 2009 i e 455 mm 12 h is classified as 100 year return period rainfall according to the typhoon ketsana induced rainfall data the mapped hazard areas 1 5 m flood depth constitute approximately 41 07 of the whole urban domain however the dtm and dsm calculated hazard areas are found to be 10 94 and 25 05 respectively the existing return period flood hazard maps have been an integral part of flood disaster planning and mitigation in the country however these methods are not practical to be used for predicting short duration urban flooding the watershed scale high resolution flood hazard modeling usually requires long simulation period therefore the hazard maps are generated and set in advance according to the equivalent rainfall return period in addition during floods the dwellers living in multistorey buildings tend to refuse evacuation because of various reasons including physical disability fear of losing material properties owing to looting and overcrowded evacuation facilities petrolia and bhattacharjee 2010 stephens et al 2009 walsh 2018 the method proposed in this paper will provide the necessary information to create relatively safer temporary shelters to take refuge during flood events 3 3 4 water level comparison the calculated water level through dtm and dsm simulations are compared with the recorded values taking an assumption that the initial water level at this station is 12 24 m observed and simulated water level at sto nino station fig 8 during the storm event is shown in fig 13 figure shows that the simulated maximum water level for the station are 20 20 m t 12 h and 22 38 m t 13 h for dtm and dsm simulations respectively the observed maximum water level at the same station is 20 34 m recorded at t 16 h although the maximum water level obtained using dtm simulations is closer to that of observed the time varying fluctuation of water level is more closely represented using dsm simulations whilst the behavior of water level can be properly modeled a time difference between the observed and simulated maximum peak is still significant possible reasons for the discrepancies in the simulations include the exclusion of small scale effect of dams and levees in the upstream which was not adequately captured in the coarse resolution kinematic computation on that account the use detailed river cross section data is recommended the limited data on the spatial distribution of rainfall throughout the watershed may have also contributed to the deviation of observed and simulated results in addition since the watershed roughness coefficient is only roughly estimated outside the hydraulic domain a kind of manning corrector or control value is needed to be established in order to recreate the water level as close as possible 4 conclusions the major conclusions and implications of this study are summarized below the implementation of the amr technique in multiscale rainfall runoff and inundation flood modeling yielded flood hydrodynamics at varying grid scales this approach provides the possibility to simulate overland inundation from watershed scale to subdomain scale without the requirement of stream boundary conditions this is achieved by applying a simplified kinematic equation to the coarser spatial resolution outer grids and the 2d shallow water flow equation to the higher resolution hydraulic domain the flooding in the urban subcatchment is evaluated using digital terrain and surface modeled images with 5 m resolution the simulation results for flood depth and extent are validated using the observed flood point data the flood and no flood area identification performance of dsm r2 value of 0 875 is better represented than that of dtm r2 value of 0 275 moreover a refinement threshold of 4 is identified based on the size and proportion of the watershed and subbasin higher level refinements are also possible for small scale domains for the simulations of water level results from dtm simulations was able to represent the maximum water level more closely however the water level trend was more adequately characterized in dsm simulations to capture the precise peak time of the maximum water level the use of more detailed river cross section data spatial distribution of rainfall and a watershed roughness coefficient corrector is recommended results showed that in addition to the intense rainfall the severity of the flood during the 2009 event is attributed to the subdomain s location acting as a receiving catchment for the floodwater coming from the connecting mountains and due to the topographical features of the urban area which is generally flat and low lying without environmental interventions sudden intense rainfall episodes are then expected to cause river overflow in this areas of the urban domain the ability to simulate urban inundation without the need to require observed discharge boundary conditions opens a possibility of the use of rainfall forecast data for real time flood prediction this would allow a more detailed urban flood forecasting for intense short duration storms in addition the developed model can provide critical flood information such as the concentration of flood estimated peak time flood source point and flow velocity this information can be used as supplementary tools to aid for early warning and flood prevention several advantages of the integrated model in flood analysis have been highlighted in this paper however some model limitations and study constraints may require further improvements the proposed model is a simplified form of the surface rainfall runoff and inundation model the influence of interception percolation evapotranspiration and groundwater dynamics are not considered in the calculations the calculation of sediment transport a fundamental component in characterizing the environmental and morphological changes during flood events is also not included in the simulations incorporating these processes into the model is essential in interpreting the hydrological processes that occur within the watershed however the interdependence between surface hydraulics and subsurface hydrology was not explored in this study in addition although the dsm used in this study could reproduce the building obstructions and barriers the precise outline of the road network is not perfectly captured thus higher resolution 5 m resolution or modified dsm based simulations are required for accurately representing the flood propagation along buildings and road networks more importantly the effects of integration of the sewer system on urban flooding was not examined in this study the inclusion of the influence of sewer network is critical for properly representing the onset and recession of floodwater in urban inundations the efficiency of the proposed model in simulating integrated watershed scale rainfall runoff and subcatchment scale hydrodynamics is demonstrated from the simulation results the inclusion of dsm in the flood modeling provides information that aids in securing safe evacuation spaces during flood events the simulated inundations with finer resolutions will be useful in forecasting short duration and minor urban floods thereby aiding in traffic advisories road constructions and canal renovations with the use of the flood simulations flood control actions can be done such as river bed desiltation analysis on the optimization of levee height designing sewer pipe capacity identifying flood prone locations for constructing pump stations improving the accuracy of the flood warning system etc the incorporation of these aspects in regional flood modeling is still less ventured declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

malysia and their results showed quite satisfactory accurancy of 84 74 with 0 063 standard error for the frequency ratio model the application of shannon entropy model in gwp delineation performed well and produced higer accurancy than fr model which depicts the excellence and ability of this model in producing gpms naghibi et al 2014 mohsen et al 2015 saeed et al 2018 ahp offers for complicated decision making problems a flexible low cost and easily understandable output saaty 1980 its dependency on the expert s knowledge represents the main source of uncertaincy of this model chowdary et al 2013 in recent case studies the implementation of ahp model combined with gis and spatial remote sensing in gwp mapping showed good functionality with good predictive accurancy the outputs of these researches demonstrated the effectiveness of ahp model chenini et al 2010 madrucci et al 2008 razandi et al 2015 todd and mays 2005 even though these approaches have been widely used and successfully applied for groundwater studies in arid and semi arid areas they have rarely been assessed on groundwater potential mapping in hard rock environment such that of the méiganga area cameroon the purpose of this study is to integrate these three approaches ahp fr se in a rapid but reliable manner for the assessment of groundwater potentiality in an area where previous groundwater studies have never been done in hard rock terrains availability of groundwater is of limited extent and the occurrence of groundwater in such rocks is essentially confined to fractured and weathered horizons nagarajan sujitsingh 2009 the yoyo river basin is occupied by hard rock terrain in which groundwater availability is limited and restricted to weathered and fractured regions for this reason mapping groundwater potentiality in such area is more complex and challenging hence this study aimed firstly to delineate and classify groundwater potential areas in the yoyo river basin by using multicriteria modelling analytical hierarchy process frequency ratio shannon entropy in gis environment and secondly to compare the performance of the aforementioned models to ensure effectiveness in implementation for this purpose various thematic items such as geology geomorphology soil texture lineament concentration drainage density regional slope rainfall distribution plan profile curvature and land use cover have been evaluated in order to prepare groundwater potential maps and provide policy makers and managers with a guide map for future hydrogeological research and implementation of future boreholes or dug wells in the yoyo basin and consequently reduce the costs of hydrogeological investigation 2 study area 2 1 geographical location and hydrogeological background of the study area the yoyo river basin is localized in the central part of méiganga city the study area is located geographically between 6 22 n to 6 40 n latitude and 14 08 e to 14 27 e longitude the basin lies over an area of 697 3 km2 the surface elevation ranges between 892 m and 1158 m msl above mean sea level with an average of 1034 m msl fig 1a groundwater is the main water supply sources in the area and is used for both domestical duties and drinking water through drilling and pumping wells a sudano guinean subhumid climate prevails in this region with an average annual rainfall of 1662 mm and an irregular annual distribution more than 80 of annual rainfall occurs from march to october the mean temperature ranges between 21 c and 25 c méiganga meteorological service 2013 fig 1b hydrogeologically the study area is characterized by two main aquifers meying et al 2018 the unconfined aquifer is formed of thick and weathered lateritic blanket highly altered and fractured rocks with thickness of 8 20 m the confined aquifer is formed of fractured rocks with low permeability the top aquifer is widely exploited by rural communities 2 2 local geological settings the méiganga area is part of the adamaoua yadé domain ayd which has a general trend of ene wsw fig 1c and covers central cameroon southern chad and northern central african republic ganwa et al 2016 the ayd is hosted in the intermediate zone between the sahara metacraton in the north and the congo craton in the south ganwa et al 2016 its basement has undergone four phases of deformation d1 d2 d3 and d4 each characterized by linear planar and plano linear structures ganwa 2005 njonfang et al 1998 njonfang et al 2006 ganwa et al 2016 the works of toteu et al 2006 have shown that the ayd is underlain by syn tectonic late tectonic and post tectonic granitoids embedded in metamorphic formations in the northern part of meiganga partial melting of gneiss led to crystallization of leucogranites ganwa 2005 the formation of mafic dykes and dykelets syenitic micro granitic quartzo feldspathic and quartz rich veins brecciated shear zones and mylonites are due to magmatism cataclastic deformation rock fracturing and partial melting of basement rocks dou 2015 ganwa 2005 known petrographic types include metadiorites pyroxene granites biotite and muscovite granites metasedimentary sequences of amphibole and pyroxene gneisses and metal bearing granites ganwa 2005 ganwa et al 2011a ganwa et al 2016 ganwa et al 2008 kepnamou et al 2017 ganwa et al 2011b lasserre 1961 fig 1c mineralogically ganwa et al 2008 2011a b 2016 2018 and kankeu et al 2009 reported that orthogneisses are composed of quartz k feldsptaths plagioclase biotite amphibole apatite and opaque minerals such as zircon titanite and pyrites micaschists are made of quartz biotite and feldspar with calcite epidote pyrite and opaque minerals granites also contain quartz k feldspar plagioclase biotite and muscovite with apatite titanite zircon and pyrites while chlorite calcite epidote and other opaque minerals behave as secondary minerals resulting from hydrothermal alteration quartzite veins contain mainly quartz and muscovite but biotite plagioclase and opaque minerals may be present in small quantities 3 materials and methods in the present work groundwater potential assessment in the yoyo river basin has been done by using various types of data table 1 gives details sources of the database this section is made of three main steps 1 geospatial database construction 2 groundwater prospecting factors weights calculation and 3 results validation groundwater availability in an area is controlled by different interrelated factors such as geology structure topography and climate studying these factors and their interrelationship the aquifer system potentiality of an area could be evaluated al aney 1983 in this study thirteen factors were chosen for groundwater prospect zones delineation in the yoyo river basin they were taken depending on data availability literature reviews and local conditions these factors are ground surface elevation above mean sea level slope angle in degree plan curvature profile curvature topographic wetness index twi soil texture geology geomorphology fault density lineament density drainage density rainfall land use land cover arcgis 10 4 microsoft office software and spss software were used for data processing 3 1 groundwater influencing factors in a given aquifer groundwater presence and productivity is generally function of a multiplicity of factors razandi et al 2015 therefore 13 groundwater influencing factors were used and classified into four categories within a gis framework namely topographical hydrological geological and others factors 3 1 1 topographical factors the elevation regional slope plan curvature and profile curvature are presented as topographical factors the elevation factor is a crucial factor in groundwater potential zone delineation plain areas generally have high infiltration rate than moderate and high elevated points thapa et al 2017a 2017b the elevation map was generated from srtm 30 m dem data in arcgis environment high and low elevation values ranges from 892 to 1158 m above msl were observed in the northern part and sse part of the study area fig 2a the elevation was classified into nine subclasses viz 892 2 937 5 m 937 6 965 4 m 965 5 989 1 m 989 2 1012 m 1013 1032 m 1033 1053 m 1054 1075 m 1076 1102 m and 1103 1155 m a high priority was given to plain areas followed by moderate and high elevated points the slope is one of key parameters favourable for water infiltration because areas of low slope are characterized by low surface runoff and high percolation rates while steep slopes favour runoff and fast evacuation of meteoric waters by drainage mogaji et al 2015 slope map was prepared in the arcgis software using the srtm 30 m dem data slope ranges between 0 01 and 15 for a major part of the basin fig 2b based on degree of slope the present study area was categorized into five slope classes viz nearly level 0 01 1 9 very gentle 2 3 2 gentle 3 3 4 7 moderate 4 8 6 6 and steep 6 7 15 low slope is favourable for groundwater recharge whereas high slope of hilly areas is the main obstacle to groundwater recharge a higher priority was given to nearly level followed by very gentle gentle moderate moderately steep steep and very steep slope classes ground curvature is important because concave surface is more suitable for holding surface water therefore helps in recharging the area profile and plan are the two aspects of curvature which represents the morphology of the topography plan curvature help to determine water convergence and divergence during the flow affecting slope erosion processes ercanoglu and gokceoglu 2002 oh and pradhan 2011 plan curvature fig 2c is known as the flow acceleration and erosion deposition rate the flow velocity variation down the slope is affected by profile curvature talebi et al 2007 fig 2d these factors were extracted from the dem data using arcgis software spatial analysis tool 3 1 2 hydrological factors here drainage density topographic wetness index twi and rainfall are taken as hydrological factors and were considered into account for groundwater potential estimation twi plays a crucial role in influencing runoff accumulation and movement at the soil surface elmahdy and mohamed 2015 it has been widely used to quantify the topographic control of hydrologic processes and represent potential groundwater exfiltration caused by topographic effects bahareh et al 2018 mallick et al 2019 kindie et al 2018 therefore a higher twi value describes a higher potential groundwater value arulbalaji et al 2019 eq 1 given below was used for the computation of twi beven and kirkby 1979 1 twi ln α tan β here α is the upslope contributing area and β is the topographic slope the values of twi range from 5 8 to 18 twi was reclassified into three categories 5 8 8 4 8 5 11 and 11 18 using quantile algorithms fig 2e shows the twi map of the yoyo river basin higher weights were assigned to higher twi values rainfall data for 4 years 2008 2012 was collected from the mbéré météorologic station based on these data spatial distribution maps were drawn using inverse distance weighting idw tool in the arcgis environment the study area has an average annual rainfall of around 1500 mm fig 2f illustrates the mean annual distribution of precipitation in the study area the precipitation data has been classified into five categories and their spatial extent ranging from 1431 6 to 1619 2 mm areas receiving 1431 6 mm of precipitation were given a low weight assuming areas of low potential and are mainly located in the south eastern part while areas receiving 1619 2 mm of precipitation received a high weight and are situated in the north eastern part of the study area weights rankings of each factor and subclasses were assigned based on the intensity of precipitation and its groundwater recharge the drainage density map in the study area was generated using the méiganga topographic sheet and updated from srtm 30 m dem data fig 3 the 30 m srtm dem data were used for rapid automated delineation of the drainage network and to derive slopes using appropriate algorithms and following a set of topographic functions as described in arcgis esri 2015 the drainage density map was made in three stages firstly a drainage map was computed from the 30 m srtm dem data then watersheds were delimited base on the reference topographic maps of méiganga and finally the drainage density was calculated in each of the squares of the grid using the equation murthy 2000 2 dd ltr abv where dd drainage density ltc the length per square kilometer and abv the per square kilometer area of the watershed the estimated drainage density in the study area reveals a very dense drainage network with values of 6 61 km km2 areas of very low to low drainage density constitute approximately 48 75 of the basin area and have been assigned relatively high weights the areas of moderate and high drainage density had lower weights and would constitute about 42 96 of the total surface higher drainage density areas involve potentially medium infiltration and recharge and cover approximately 8 29 of the study area consequently they contribute little to the global potential of recharge of the aquifer 3 1 3 geological factors lineaments come from tectonics activities and describe the surface topography and structural characteristics of subsoil as well as an increase in secondary porosity where faults and fractures are greatest magesh et al 2012 rajaveni et al 2015 the lineaments of particularly hard rocky terrain are pathways for the movement of groundwater sectors with high linearity indicate areas of high groundwater potential haridas et al 1998 the lineaments were identified and mapped from two sources namely the geological map of méiganga and satellite data the present study used the lineament density ld which represents the total length of lineaments per unit area generated by the following formula greenbaum 1985 3 ld l n l l a where ll is the total lineament lengths in km a is the area of the basin in km2 the lineaments mainly reflect the weakness of topographies in lithology hard rocks due to a lower porosity of the ground have a groundwater potential depending generally on other structural elements kumanan and ramasamy 2003 avtar et al 2011b singh et al 2011b das 2017 das and pardeshi 2018b das et al 2018 fig 4a shows lineament density distribution map of the study area dense lineaments concentration is observed within the central part of the study area thus higher weights were given to areas of higher lineament density meanwhile low weights were given to low lineament density areas the rose directional diagram of the lineaments extracted from the satellite image fig 4c and from the outcrop structure lineament fig 4d shows that certain families of lineaments stand out from the others they are n0 10 n20 60 and n110 150 the comparison of these major lineament families from satellite images with those from the fracturing noted from outcrop lineament measurements shows that the directions n0 10 n30 40 n60 70 and n70 80 are the most representative to validate the influence of this major direction n40 all faults were extracted from the 1 500000 scale geological map of méiganga which covers the entire study area the results are computed in form of fracture density map that allows us to verify the reliability of our linear analysis fig 4b it confirms the true dominance of these directions detected by the filter on the satellite image but shows a second direction nw se which is probably dominant in the north western sector of the watershed fig 4e the presence and movement of groundwater depend on rocks nature and parameters porosity and permeability balaji et al 2019a ghasemizadeh et al 2012 geological characteristics fig 5a are withdrawn from the ngaoundéré east geological map lasserre 1962 and updated as vector image in the arcgis environment the study area consists mostly of crystalline rocky terrain from the archean period which consists of granites granitic gneisses granodiorites migmatite individual weights for each lithologic unit were given based on mineral assemblage weathering fractures and conditions rocks prone to high infiltration and high runoff resistance have a high rank value likewise low rank values were assigned to rock subject to less weathering hard rocks such as mixed composite gneisses granitic gneisses and granitoid mica gneisses are desired as less favourable to the presence of groundwater than younger rocks the geomorphological characteristics provide important indications on groundwater available resources and as well provide indirect information on groundwater presence movement and evolution machiwal et al 2010 the reliefs were digitized from an aster dem image using visual interpretation and ground verification six geomorphological features have been identified based on their origin fig 5b namely mountains plateaus structural hills alluvial and flood plains water bodies and valleys for the yoyo river basin high altitude rocky field which includes the inselberg complex pediment structural and residual hills plateau and slopes of the piedmont has medium to low groundwater potentials and therefore were assigned low weights on the other hand alluvial and floodplains generally have good potential for groundwater due to higher infiltration rate thapa et al 2017a 2017b and a higher weight were given to these areas these include valleys plains and open waters 3 1 4 other factors land use and land cover lulc can be considered as one of the important factors for groundwater occurrence supervised classification of maximum likelihood classification mlc algorithm was performed to realize lulc map nicholas et al 2018 validation of the classification result was done using a confusion or error matrix lillesand et al 2007 with good achievement overall accuracy 89 38 and kappa coefficient 0 8711 fig 5c shows the lulc map of the yoyo river basin it has been analyzed and mapped using landsat 7 etm worldview 2 image data and ground verification open waters and cropland were given high weights as they are primarily associated with water bodies that were identified by light blue tone and fine medium texture the main models of land use in the yoyo basin are gallery forest 48 8 grassy savannah 9 fields and burns 30 2 wooded savannah 3 9 water open 5 2 and buildings and bare lands 2 9 areas with very tall buildings and concrete constructions are poor for potential groundwater occurrence due to surface runoff meanwhile fields and burns agricultural land are good due to lose soil availability on ground surface singh et al 2010 2011a das et al 2017 the soil types are the prevailing factor influencing groundwater recharge and agricultural production in the yoyo river basin mainly the soil texture map was drawn from the méiganga soil map in arcgis environment and been analyzed by ground verification soil texture st is a primary controller of the percolation of water through the flow spaces and filtration processes to reach the water bearing aquifer this map was categorized using the average size of soil grains weights were assigned to each soil unit based on infiltration rate three pedological units such as ferralitic red and armored soils hydromorphic soils and reworked and indurated ferralitic soils fig 5d fig 5d shows the dominance of reworked and indurated ferralitic soils in the study area they cover most of the granite and schist areas the soils most often encountered are gravely reworked soils over a fairly large thickness they can be clay depleted in their upper horizons indurated at shallow depth or modal they are generally located in a plateau or top of slope position on a slope reworked colluviated soils develop very generally impoverished in clay and sometimes indurated it is noted that modal reworked ferrallitic and slightly depleted reworked soils are particularly conducive to the establishment of the forest this seems to be due both to the depth of these soils and their relatively clay texture and therefore their good water reserve shrub savannah vegetation most frequently grows on depleted colluviated ferrallitic soils this is due to their sandy texture and their low water reserves thus a high priority was given to modal reworked and modal reworked ferrallitic soils followed by hydromorphic soils and finally the colluviated and indurated reworked ferrallitic soils 3 2 analytic hierarchy process ahp model ahp is a tool used in multi criteria decision making to solve multi attribute decision making problems in real life situations saaty 1980 it is a robust technique in solving complex and unstructured problems having interactions and correlations with different objectives and goals talib et al 2011 ahp provide crutial assistance in organizing the critical aspects of a problem under a hierarchical structure similar to a family tree zaim et al 2012 determining the weights of the thematic layers as well as their corresponding classes using ahp approach involves respecting the following steps step 1 model development based on the literature review several models were identified for groundwater potential mapping in building a model the problem must be clearly defined the problem as a hierarchy and divided into several thematic layers containing the different characteristics classes of the individual themes so that they form a network of the model agarwal et al 2013 this step is crucial and requires the experts input to ensure that all possible criteria and alternatives have been taking into account step 2 determination and normalization of weights priorities for the criteria in this work weights for groundwater influencing factors were derived from a pairwise comparison matrix considering the relative importance of two criteria for the ability to characterize groundwater potential localizations relative importance values were determined using saaty scale of 1 9 table 2 where equal importance between the two themes takes a score of 1 and extreme importance of one theme compared to the other one takes a score of 9 saaty 1980 table 4 presents a class comparison matrix to achieve priority through the principal eigenvalue and the consistency index the ahp methodology can be based on the idea of uncertainty in judgements saaty 2004 the normalization process reduces the subjectivity associated with the assigned weights of the thematic maps and their features the normalized weights of the thematic layers and those of their features were examined for consistency as recommended by saaty 1980 the calculation of normalized weight was done using the equation 4 w n gm n n 1 n gm n where gm n is the geometric mean of the i th row of the judgment matrices and is calculated as 5 gm n p 1 n p 2 n p nn n where p n denote the n th indicator element with p nn being the judgment matrix element step 3 check for incoherency of the developed matrix saaty defined the consistency index ci as deviation or degree of consistency it s a measure of consistency and it s given by the equation 6 ci λ max i i n n 1 i i i i i i i i i i i λ max largest i eigenvalue i of i the i pairwise i comparison i matrix n number i of i groundwater i condition i factors the measure of consistency of pairwise comparison matrix is known as consistency ratio cr and it s given by the equation 7 cr i ci ri where ri represents the ratio index table 3 presents value of ri for different values of n according to saaty 2012 a consistency ratio cr of 0 10 or less is acceptable to continue the ahp analysis meanwhile a consistency ratio greater than 0 10 need judgments revision in order to locate the cause of the inconsistency and correct it for this work ci was computed for λmax 14 592 n 13 and ri 1 57 the estimated consistency ratio was cr 0 085 and it s less than 0 10 which means a reasonable level of consistency in the pairwise comparison matrix is was achieved the detailed criteria or subclasses normalized weights are presented in table 5 3 3 frequency ratio fr the frequency ratio is a populist statistical approach used in geospatial evaluation of probabilistic relationship between different variables many studies have shown the use of frequency ratio for determining the groundwater potential of a region manap et al 2011 pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 the model is based on observed relationship and correlation between the different conditioning factors and the availability of wells in each factor table 6 the mathematical representation of fr is given by the following equation pham et al 2015 8 fr n i p n n i l p n l where n i p number of pixels with wells for each contributing factor n total number of all pixels in the total study area n i i l p i number of pixels in each class of a contributing factor and n l total number of pixels in a contributing factor 3 4 shannon entropy se method entropy measures the abnormally changeability unstable behaviour degree of disorder and uncertainty of a system relative to its likely initial state massey and nancy 1988 naghibi et al 2014 farzin et al 2021 al abadi et al 2016b in general the concept of entropy describes the amount of abnormality between causes and outcomes or the degree of abnormality in various subjects the entropy refers to an estimate of the difference between the average shares of the individual groups in the overall system pei yue et al 2010 amiri et al 2014 the se model thus benefits from an extremely close relationship between entropy and the quantity called boltzmann used to show the thermodynamic conditions of a system yufeng and fengxiang 2009 v j represents the ratio between the value of parameters and the total value given by the equations bednarik et al 2010 constantin et al 2011 9 e ij fr j 1 m j fr where fr represents the value of the frequency ratio and e ij is the probability density for each class the formulae below are used to compute the information coefficient 10 h j i 1 m j e ij log 2 e ij i i j 1 n 11 h j max log 2 m j 12 i j h j max h j h j max i i 0 1 i j 1 n 13 v j i j fr where h j and h j max are the value of entropy i j is the information coefficient m j is the number of classes in each conditioning factor and v j is the achieved weight value for the given parameter the range is between 0 and 1 table 6 values close to 1show greater inconsistency and imbalance 3 5 generation of groundwater potential index gwpi firstly weights and classes were given to all influencing factors as well as their relative subclasses using the ahp fr and se approaches these factors were used for the identification of groundwater potential areas by weighted linear combination in the arcgis environment according the following equation 14 gwpi i 1 n j 1 m α ij x ij where α ij is the weight of the j th class of th theme n is the total number of thematic layers and m is the total number of classes in a thematic layer x ij is the pixel value of the j th class of the i th theme 3 6 validation techniques several statistical indices has been suggested and used for validation performance of a model naghibi et al 2016a 2016b miraki et al 2019 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 ma et al 2019 abedini et al 2019 pham et al 2018 for

to verify the veracity results the data used for this evaluation must obey the principle of independence jourda et al 2006 this principle requires that this data did not occur during the development of the map submitted for evaluation to validate the groundwater potential areas of the yoyo basin field survey was carried out in 2018 and 2019 during the pre and post drought seasons in this field survey 279 wells and boreholes data were collected and distributed randomly along with gps locations wells are used as an indirect indicator of groundwater yield since in general in areas with high groundwater yield there are a very large number of wells these wells were randomly divided into two sets a training set area 70 having 195 points 149 with yield 5 m3 h and 46 with yield 5 m3 h and a test set area 30 having 84 points 55 with yield 5 m3 h and 29 with yield 5 m3 h no specific limit exists in the determination of the distribution of training set and test set hence greater is the percentage of datasets for analysis higher the validation value auc is obtained silalahi et al 2019 a ratio of 70 30 is used for the current study because 70 is considered sufficient to represent analysis and 30 is considered sufficient to validate the model wang et al 2016 meena et al 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 mapping potential groundwater zones the potential groundwater maps of the yoyo basin evaluated using integrated approaches of analytical hierarchy process frequency ratio and shannon entropy by weighted linear combination in the arcgis environment fig 6 reveal four main classes representing poor moderate good and excellent the computed results revealed for each approach the percentage of area covered by these classes as it s shown in table 7 according to the groundwater potential map produced from the frequency ratio method 34 97 of the total area is found to be of good groundwater potential poor moderate and excellent susceptible zones represent 28 38 20 39 and 15 08 of the total area respectively the fr model fig 6b confirmed that the excellent groundwater potential zones are found in the regions that are underlined by weathered and fractured granite with lineament density ranging from 6 47 to 9 16 high fault density 12 3 flat to gentle slope condition mostly part of cropland and alluvial plain low to high drainage density and the soil of fine coarse sand the results indicated that the groundwater potential is controlled mostly by lithology land use cover lineaments fault density slope angle elevation and drainage density the groundwater potential map generated with ahp which included 29 07 of total area is determined to be of poor groundwater moderate susceptible zones make up 22 28 and 23 73 of the total area the good and excellent susceptible zones values are close to each other 23 73 and 23 75 respectively from the ahp model fig 6a the slope area of 0 01 1 9 drainage density of 6 older and younger alluvial plain areas valley terrace deposits agricultural field fault density 4 8 areas with altitude ranging 892 2 1062 and weathered granite are found to be moderate to excellent zone for groundwater potential the results confirmed that the groundwater potential is controlled mostly by lithology geomorphology lineament density fault density land use cover slope angle rainfall elevation and drainage density the groundwater potential map created in accordance with the se method contains 31 14 of the total area which is designated to be moderate groundwater potential the value is near to the good category in relation to the fr method poor good and excellent prospective zones constitute 25 36 23 14 and 19 17 of the total area respectively it can be seen from fig 6c that the groundwater potential from the shannon entropy model is controlled mostly by lithology land use cover lineaments fault density slope angle elevation and drainage density and are approximately consistent with results of the fr model overall results of the three models indicated that the most important factors in groundwater potential are lithology geomorphology lineament density slope angle soils elevation drainage density rainfall and land use cover respectively by mogaji et al 2015 reliability analysis of the maps showed that most of high yield well locations were observed in good and excellent groundwater potential classes indicating that the models performed well in classifying the study area with respect to well locations a close look over these maps shows areas of good and excellent groundwater potential in the central south eastern north western a tiny eastern and southern parts of the study area these regions are marked by a high density of fracturing and also low medium slopes this confirms that in the middle of the granitic basement only the fractures are the real underground water corridors these results are matching with the work of algaydi et al 2019 adeyeye et al 2019 lasm et al 2004 and das 2017 the moderate groundwater zones were observed in the far north eastern western southern eastern and south eastern of the study area areas of poor groundwater potential were found in the north western northern south eastern and eastern part however the poor groundwater potential areas are mainly limited to hilly terrain and in settlements but can also be due to the anthropogenic activities leading to the low prospect these regions are marked by the presence of steeply sloping dunes and gneissic and granite outcrops thus a higher yield from an aquifer would indicate a great groundwater potential therefore the areas identified in this study are ideally suited to areas of artificial groundwater recharge the integrated groundwater potential maps generated herein give information about the sites where groundwater could be renewed under normal rainfall conditions and could be useful for various decision making processes to better management of groundwater resources 4 2 validation of results to validate these potential groundwater maps fieldwork was carried out during the period 2018 2019 in this field study 279 data from wells observation stations boreholes were collected as well as their gps coordinates the static level of the observed wells varied between 1 0 and 15 5 m meanwhile the yield of the boreholes range between 0 5 and 13 8 m3 h depending on these characteristics wells and borehole were randomly divided into two classes training wells 7 m and 5 m3 h validation wells 7 0 m and 5 m3 h this is how a relationship has been established between potential groundwater areas and wells arrangement in the study area wells are used as indirect indicator of groundwater inflow since very large numbers of wells are found in areas with high groundwater flow in addition an evaluation of the precision was done in order to know the correlation between the groundwater potential zones and the data of wells and boreholes observed using an error confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic roc curves and area under curves auc 4 2 1 confusion matrix the data from the observation wells were used as reference points for the calculation of the precision the overall precision op is given by this equation jensen 1996 18 op number of correct observation well locations total umber of observation wells x 100 the overall precision and the kappa coefficient table 8 for the three models are respectively 1 ahp 87 46 and 79 53 2 fr 84 and 74 62 3 se 87 14 and 77 75 respectively hence a strong agreement landis and koch 1977 this robustness reveals good correlation between potential groundwater maps and observed well data in addition table 8 shows that the ahp model achieved the highest values of tp 0 98 tn 0 75 precision 97 32 acc 99 61 and lowest values of fp 0 fn 0 0068 these results revealed that the ahp model correctly classified 99 1 of all pixels in potential class 90 3 of all pixels in non potential class 99 31 of groundwater pixels into the potential class 96 48 of non groundwater pixels in the non potential class with a perfect kappa 0 7953 agreement between predicted and observed well locations 4 2 2 receiver operating characteristic roc curves and area under roc curves auc the prediction and success rates were provided by the area under the curves of the three models fig 7 model 1 used the ahp factor ranking weights using all 13 conditioning factors fig 6a model 2 integrated all the predictor rate weights of fr with all 13 conditioning factors fig 6b model 3 integrated the weights of se only with conditioning factors fig 6c approximately 70 of wells 195 wells were used for the model training and 30 of the wells 84 wells were used for posterior action on model validation model 1 integrated the ahp factor weights by pairwise comparison and shows a total success rate percentage of 87 09 whereas the prediction rate is about 82 40 which is considered the best mapping model result model 2 preceded by fr shows a success rate percentage of 77 21 with a prediction rate of 76 68 model 3 used the factor weight of se with a total success rate percentage of 75 78 and a prediction rate of 70 61 which is considered the worse prediction result among the three processed models in general auc predictability of groundwater potential zones was found to be good to excellent in the study area furthermore the total number of boreholes and wells location was compared with gpi for the three models as shown in fig 8 for fr model the test revealed that 73 84 206 wells falls into good and excellent potential zones 7 27 21 wells falls into moderate class and 2 51 7 wells in poor zones with respect to the shannon entropy model this test revealed that 76 70 214 wells falls into good excellent zones 9 32 26 wells falls into moderate zone 1 79 5 wells falls into poor zone finally for ahp this test revealed that 77 42 216 wells falls into good excellent zones 6 81 19 wells falls into moderate zone 3 23 9 wells falls into poor zone it can be seen from these results that all models have good prediction efficacy because most of the borehole locations are correctly predicted by gpi map produced by models but again the ahp model is more effectiveness than fr model and se model 5 conclusion groundwater represents the main source of potable water and also of domestic and agricultural activities in the méiganga area overexploitation of this mineral resource has led to a lowering of groundwater levels in some parts of the study area thereby aggravating the water problem in the city therefore detailed investigations are needed in the study area for the effective and sustainable management of this scarce natural resource the present study was undertaken to identify and classify the groundwater potential zones in the yoyo river basin the delineation was successfully achieved by integrating the analytical hierarchy process technique frequency ratio theory and shannon entropy model along with gis and rs thirteen groundwater conditioning factors derived from spatial database geology geomorphology soil texture lineament concentration drainage density fault density regional slope rainfall distribution plan profile curvature elevation land use cover and twi were chosen and by overlay weighted linear combination in the arcgis environment groundwater potential maps gwp was obtained the spatial association values between groundwater productivity data and each related factors using 195 70 wells as training data set and 84 30 wells for validation purposes were also calculated the final groundwater potential maps gwp were classified based on natural break classification scheme into four classes poor moderate good and excellent potential these results showed that most of high yielding wells were observed in zones of good to excellent groundwater potential indicating that the models performed well in classifying the study area with respect to well locations the reliability analysis revealed that ahp model kappa 79 53 auc 76 21 performs better than se model kappa 77 75 auc 73 62 and fr model kappa 74 62 auc 73 62 the outputs of these results revealed that the models have good accurancy demonstrating the effectiveness excellence and ability of these approaches in gwp demarcation these resulting groundwater potential maps could be useful for various decision making processes for groundwater resources sustainable management in the yoyo river basin furthermore groundwater potential maps validation should be improved by using recent drilling data in order to better reproduce the realities on the ground the identification of areas with good groundwater potential does not guarantee a 100 drilling success rate although the probability seems good about 65 2 depth of investigation was also poorly understood in the framework of the proposed approach in this study indeed the hydrodynamic behavior at depth could not be explained by the analysis of the criteria used and was limited to hypothetical interpolations of surface data the hydrodynamic functioning of the subsoil was indeed more complex to ensure the sustainability and productivity of the hydraulics structures however new boreholes should be installed in each zone for which the thematic class indicated a given potential class for a reliable validation and verification of the productivity therefore sufficient resources are necessary future works should highlight the integration of mathematical based approaches such as the artificial neural network or decision trees with the pairwise comparison of ahp the efficacity of remote sensing methodology in groundwater delineation could be further improved by considering sufficient amounts of information and data with direct or indirect

keywords groundwater potential gis and remote sensing ahp frequency ratio shannon entropy sustainable management 1 introduction the importance of water as indispensable resource for life is undeniable chandra 2006 indeed population growth aging infrastructure increasingly stringent water quality standards and climate change are the four main aspects that prove it the need to guarantee access to a sufficient quantity of water to a constantly increasing population is becoming more and more urgent the challenges of water scarcity being a problem that often lasts for centuries one can anticipate the increase in water demand through innovative solutions that optimize the exploitation of available water resources therefore it is very important to fundamentally under stand the groundwater resources scenario for sustainable development of a region furthermore groundwater studies not only became primordial for groundwater potential zones targeting but also for conserving and monitoring this fundamental resource selvam et al 2014 subsurface groundwater in aquifers are highly localized and varies spatially satpathy and kanungo 1976 mugerwa and jeyavel raja kumar 2015 dushiyanthan et

climate conditions and mutual relationship between these factors selvam et al 2014 a good assessment of these parameters provides a good understanding of groundwater potentiality in a region das and pardeshi 2018a therefore proper tools are required for groundwater potential zones assessment monitoring and conservation the geoinformation techniques are one of the commonly used methods for rapid delineation of potential groundwater areas with ground checks al adamat et al 2003 dar et al 2010 ganapuram et al 2009 saha et al 2010 solomon and quiel 2006 geoinformation techniques are simple reliable and cost effective for the assessment of groundwater reserves than conventional approaches such as borehole hydrogeological and geological field surveys and geophysical methods which require important work in exploration activities which are expensive in terms of money time and resources and also require the participation of experts arkoprovo et al 2012 thapa et al 2017a 2017b over the

malysia and their results showed quite satisfactory accurancy of 84 74 with 0 063 standard error for the frequency ratio model the application of shannon entropy model in gwp delineation performed

complicated decision making problems a flexible low cost and easily understandable output saaty 1980 its dependency on the expert s knowledge represents the main source of uncertaincy of this model chowdary et al 2013 in recent case studies the implementation of ahp model combined with gis and spatial remote sensing in gwp mapping showed good functionality with good predictive accurancy the outputs of these researches demonstrated the effectiveness of ahp model chenini et al 2010 madrucci et al 2008 razandi et al 2015 todd and mays 2005 even though these approaches have been widely used and successfully applied for groundwater studies in arid and semi arid areas they have rarely been assessed on groundwater potential mapping in hard rock environment such that of the méiganga area cameroon the purpose of this study is to integrate these three approaches ahp fr se in a rapid but reliable manner for the assessment of groundwater potentiality in an area where previous groundwater studies have never been done in hard rock terrains availability of groundwater is of limited extent and the occurrence of groundwater in such rocks is essentially confined to fractured and weathered horizons nagarajan sujitsingh 2009 the yoyo river basin is occupied by hard rock terrain in which groundwater availability is limited and restricted to weathered and fractured regions for this reason mapping groundwater potentiality in such area is more complex and challenging hence this study aimed firstly to delineate and classify groundwater potential areas in the yoyo river basin by using multicriteria modelling analytical hierarchy process frequency ratio shannon entropy in gis environment and secondly to compare the performance of the aforementioned models to ensure effectiveness in implementation for this purpose various thematic items such as geology geomorphology soil texture lineament concentration drainage density regional slope rainfall distribution plan profile curvature and land use cover have been evaluated in order to prepare groundwater potential maps and provide policy makers and managers with a guide map for future hydrogeological research and implementation of future boreholes or dug wells in the yoyo basin and consequently reduce the costs of hydrogeological investigation 2 study area 2 1 geographical location and hydrogeological background of the study area the yoyo river basin is localized in the central part of méiganga city the study area is located geographically between 6 22 n to 6 40 n latitude and 14 08 e to 14 27 e longitude the basin lies over an area of 697 3 km2 the surface elevation ranges between 892 m and 1158 m msl above mean sea level with an average of 1034 m msl fig 1a groundwater is the main water supply sources in the area and is used for both domestical duties and drinking water through drilling and pumping wells a sudano guinean subhumid climate prevails in this region with an average annual rainfall of 1662 mm and an irregular annual distribution more than 80 of annual rainfall occurs from march to october the mean temperature ranges between 21 c and 25 c méiganga meteorological service 2013 fig 1b hydrogeologically the study area is characterized by two main aquifers meying et al 2018 the unconfined aquifer is formed of thick and weathered lateritic blanket highly altered and fractured rocks with thickness of 8 20 m the confined aquifer is formed of fractured rocks with low permeability the top aquifer is widely exploited by rural communities 2 2 local geological settings the méiganga area is part of the adamaoua yadé domain ayd which has a general trend of ene wsw fig 1c and covers central cameroon southern chad and northern central african republic ganwa et al 2016 the ayd is hosted in the intermediate zone between the sahara metacraton in the north and the congo craton in the south ganwa et al 2016 its basement has undergone four phases of deformation d1 d2 d3 and d4 each characterized by linear planar and plano linear structures ganwa 2005 njonfang et al 1998 njonfang et al 2006 ganwa et al 2016 the works of toteu et al 2006 have shown that the ayd is underlain by syn tectonic late tectonic and post tectonic granitoids embedded in metamorphic formations in the northern part of meiganga partial melting of gneiss led to crystallization of leucogranites ganwa 2005 the formation of mafic dykes and dykelets syenitic micro granitic quartzo feldspathic and quartz rich veins brecciated shear zones and mylonites are due to magmatism cataclastic deformation rock fracturing and partial melting of basement rocks dou 2015 ganwa 2005 known petrographic types include metadiorites pyroxene granites biotite and muscovite granites metasedimentary sequences of amphibole and pyroxene gneisses and metal bearing granites ganwa 2005 ganwa et al 2011a ganwa et al 2016 ganwa et al 2008 kepnamou et al 2017 ganwa et al 2011b lasserre 1961 fig 1c mineralogically ganwa et al 2008 2011a b 2016 2018 and kankeu et al 2009 reported that orthogneisses are composed of quartz k feldsptaths plagioclase biotite amphibole apatite and opaque minerals such as zircon titanite and pyrites micaschists are made of quartz biotite and feldspar with calcite epidote pyrite and opaque minerals granites also contain quartz k feldspar plagioclase biotite and muscovite with apatite titanite zircon and pyrites while chlorite calcite epidote and other opaque minerals behave as secondary minerals resulting from hydrothermal alteration quartzite veins contain mainly quartz and muscovite but biotite plagioclase and opaque minerals may be present in small quantities 3 materials and methods in the present work groundwater potential assessment in the yoyo river basin has been done by using various types of data table 1 gives details sources of the database this section is made of three main steps 1 geospatial database construction 2 groundwater prospecting factors weights calculation and 3 results validation groundwater availability in an area is controlled by different interrelated factors such as geology structure topography and climate studying these factors and their interrelationship the aquifer system potentiality of an area could be evaluated al aney 1983 in this study thirteen factors were chosen for groundwater prospect zones delineation in the yoyo river basin they were taken depending on data availability literature reviews and local conditions these factors are ground surface elevation above mean sea level slope angle in degree plan curvature profile curvature topographic wetness index twi soil texture geology geomorphology fault density lineament density drainage density rainfall land use land cover arcgis 10 4 microsoft office software and spss software were used for data processing 3 1 groundwater influencing factors in a given aquifer groundwater presence and productivity is generally function of a multiplicity of factors razandi et al 2015 therefore 13 groundwater influencing factors were used and classified into four categories within a gis framework namely topographical hydrological geological and others factors 3 1 1 topographical factors the elevation regional slope plan curvature and profile curvature are presented as topographical factors the elevation factor is a crucial factor in groundwater potential zone delineation plain areas generally have high infiltration rate than moderate and high elevated points thapa et al 2017a 2017b the elevation map was generated from srtm 30 m dem data in arcgis environment high and low elevation values ranges from 892 to 1158 m above msl were observed in the northern part and sse part of the study area fig 2a the elevation was classified into nine subclasses viz 892 2 937 5 m 937 6 965 4 m 965 5 989 1 m 989 2 1012 m 1013 1032 m 1033 1053 m 1054 1075 m 1076 1102 m and 1103 1155 m a high priority was given to plain areas followed by moderate and high elevated points the slope is one of key parameters favourable for water infiltration because areas of low slope are characterized by low surface runoff and high percolation rates while steep slopes favour runoff and fast evacuation of meteoric waters by drainage mogaji et al 2015 slope map was prepared in the arcgis software using the srtm 30 m dem data slope ranges between 0 01 and 15 for a major part of the basin fig 2b based on degree of slope the present study area was categorized into five slope classes viz nearly level 0 01 1 9 very gentle 2 3 2 gentle 3 3 4 7 moderate 4 8 6 6 and steep 6 7 15 low slope is favourable for groundwater recharge whereas high slope of hilly areas is the main obstacle to groundwater recharge a higher priority was given to nearly level followed by very gentle gentle moderate moderately steep steep and very steep slope classes ground curvature is important because concave surface is more suitable for holding surface water therefore helps in recharging the area profile and plan are the two aspects of curvature which represents the morphology of the topography plan curvature help to determine water convergence and divergence during the flow affecting slope erosion processes ercanoglu and gokceoglu 2002 oh and pradhan 2011 plan curvature fig 2c is known as the flow acceleration and erosion deposition rate the flow velocity variation down the slope is affected by profile curvature talebi et al 2007 fig 2d these factors were extracted from the dem data using arcgis software spatial analysis tool 3 1 2 hydrological factors here drainage density topographic wetness index twi and rainfall are taken as hydrological factors and were considered into account for groundwater potential estimation twi plays a crucial role in influencing runoff accumulation and movement at the soil surface elmahdy and mohamed 2015 it has been widely used to quantify the topographic control of hydrologic processes and represent potential groundwater exfiltration caused by topographic effects bahareh et al 2018 mallick et al 2019 kindie et al 2018 therefore a higher twi value describes a higher potential groundwater value arulbalaji et al 2019 eq 1 given below was used for the computation of twi beven and kirkby 1979 1 twi ln α tan β here α is the upslope contributing area and β is the topographic slope the values of twi range from 5 8 to 18 twi was reclassified into three categories 5 8 8 4 8 5 11 and 11 18 using quantile algorithms fig 2e shows the twi map of the yoyo river basin higher weights were assigned to higher twi values rainfall data for 4 years 2008 2012 was collected from the mbéré météorologic station based on these data spatial distribution maps were drawn using inverse distance weighting idw tool in the arcgis environment the study area has an average annual rainfall of around 1500 mm fig 2f illustrates the mean annual distribution of precipitation in the study area the precipitation data has been classified into five categories and their spatial extent ranging from 1431 6 to 1619 2 mm areas receiving 1431 6 mm of precipitation were given a low weight assuming areas of low potential and are mainly located in the south eastern part while areas receiving 1619 2 mm of precipitation received a high weight and are situated in the north eastern part of the study area weights rankings of each factor and subclasses were assigned based on the intensity of precipitation and its groundwater recharge the drainage density map in the study area was generated using the méiganga topographic sheet and updated from srtm 30 m dem data fig 3 the 30 m srtm dem data were used for rapid automated delineation of the drainage network and to derive slopes using appropriate algorithms and following a set of topographic functions as described in arcgis esri 2015 the drainage density map was made in three stages firstly a drainage map was computed from the 30 m srtm dem data then watersheds were delimited base on the reference topographic maps of méiganga and finally the drainage density was calculated in each of the squares of the grid using the equation murthy 2000 2 dd ltr abv where dd drainage density ltc the length per square kilometer and abv the per square kilometer area of the watershed the estimated drainage density in the study area reveals a very dense drainage network with values of 6 61 km km2 areas of very low to low drainage density constitute approximately 48 75 of the basin area and have been assigned relatively high weights the areas of moderate and high drainage density had lower weights and would constitute about 42 96 of the total surface higher drainage density areas involve potentially medium infiltration and recharge and cover approximately 8 29 of the study area consequently they contribute little to the global potential of recharge of the aquifer 3 1 3 geological factors lineaments come from tectonics activities and describe the surface topography and structural characteristics of subsoil as well as an increase in secondary porosity where faults and fractures are greatest magesh et al 2012 rajaveni et al 2015 the lineaments of particularly hard rocky terrain are pathways for the movement of groundwater sectors with high linearity indicate areas of high groundwater potential haridas et al 1998 the lineaments were identified and mapped from two sources namely the geological map of méiganga and satellite data the present study used the lineament density ld which represents the total length of lineaments per unit area generated by the following formula greenbaum 1985 3 ld l n l l a where ll is the total lineament lengths in km a is the area of the basin in km2 the lineaments mainly reflect the weakness of topographies in lithology hard rocks due to a lower porosity of the ground have a groundwater potential depending generally on other structural elements kumanan and ramasamy 2003 avtar et al 2011b singh et al 2011b das 2017 das and pardeshi 2018b das et al 2018 fig 4a shows lineament density distribution map of the study area dense lineaments concentration is observed within the central part of the study area thus higher weights were given to areas of higher lineament density meanwhile low weights were given to low lineament density areas the rose directional diagram of the lineaments extracted from the satellite image fig 4c and from the outcrop structure lineament fig 4d shows that certain families of lineaments stand out from the others they are n0 10 n20 60 and n110 150 the comparison of these major lineament families from satellite images with those from the fracturing noted from outcrop lineament measurements shows that the directions n0 10 n30 40 n60 70 and n70 80 are the most representative to validate the influence of this major direction n40 all faults were extracted from the 1 500000 scale geological map of méiganga which covers the entire study area the results are computed in form of fracture density map that allows us to verify the reliability of our linear analysis fig 4b it confirms the true dominance of these directions detected by the filter on the satellite image but shows a second direction nw se which is probably dominant in the north western sector of the watershed fig 4e the presence and movement of groundwater depend on rocks nature and parameters porosity and permeability balaji et al 2019a ghasemizadeh et al 2012 geological characteristics fig 5a are withdrawn from the ngaoundéré east geological map lasserre 1962 and updated as vector image in the arcgis environment the study area consists mostly of crystalline rocky terrain from the archean period which consists of granites granitic gneisses granodiorites migmatite individual weights for each lithologic unit were given based on mineral assemblage weathering fractures and conditions rocks prone to high infiltration and high runoff resistance have a high rank value likewise low rank values were assigned to rock subject to less weathering hard rocks such as mixed composite gneisses granitic gneisses and granitoid mica gneisses are desired as less favourable to the presence of groundwater than younger rocks the geomorphological characteristics provide important indications on groundwater available resources and as well provide indirect information on groundwater presence movement and evolution machiwal et al 2010 the reliefs were digitized from an aster dem image using visual interpretation and ground verification six geomorphological features have been identified based on their origin fig 5b namely mountains plateaus structural hills alluvial and flood plains water bodies and valleys for the yoyo river basin high altitude rocky field which includes the inselberg complex pediment structural and residual hills plateau and slopes of the piedmont has medium to low groundwater potentials and therefore were assigned low weights on the other hand alluvial and floodplains generally have good potential for groundwater due to higher infiltration rate thapa et al 2017a 2017b and a higher weight were given to these areas these include valleys plains and open waters 3 1 4 other factors land use and land cover lulc can be considered as one of the important factors for groundwater occurrence supervised classification of maximum likelihood classification mlc algorithm was performed to realize lulc map nicholas et al 2018 validation of the classification result was done using a confusion or error matrix lillesand et al 2007 with good achievement overall accuracy 89 38 and kappa coefficient 0 8711 fig 5c shows the lulc map of the yoyo river basin it has been analyzed and mapped using landsat 7 etm worldview 2 image data and ground verification open waters and cropland were given high weights as they are primarily associated with water bodies that were identified by light blue tone and fine medium texture the main models of land use in the yoyo basin are gallery forest 48 8 grassy savannah 9 fields and burns 30 2 wooded savannah 3 9 water open 5 2 and buildings and bare lands 2 9 areas with very tall buildings and concrete constructions are poor for potential groundwater occurrence due to surface runoff meanwhile fields and burns agricultural land are good due to lose soil availability on ground surface singh et al 2010 2011a das et al 2017 the soil types are the prevailing factor influencing groundwater recharge and agricultural production in the yoyo river basin mainly the soil texture map was drawn from the méiganga soil map in arcgis environment and been analyzed by ground verification soil texture st is a primary controller of the percolation of water through the flow spaces and filtration processes to reach the water bearing aquifer this map was categorized using the average size of soil grains weights were assigned to each soil unit based on infiltration rate three pedological units such as ferralitic red and armored soils hydromorphic soils and reworked and indurated ferralitic soils fig 5d fig 5d shows the dominance of reworked and indurated ferralitic soils in the study area they cover most of the granite and schist areas the soils most often encountered are gravely reworked soils over a fairly large thickness they can be clay depleted in their upper horizons indurated at shallow depth or modal they are generally located in a plateau or top of slope position on a slope reworked colluviated soils develop very generally impoverished in clay and sometimes indurated it is noted that modal reworked ferrallitic and slightly depleted reworked soils are particularly conducive to the establishment of the forest this seems to be due both to the depth of these soils and their relatively clay texture and therefore their good water reserve shrub savannah vegetation most frequently grows on depleted colluviated ferrallitic soils this is due to their sandy texture and their low water reserves thus a high priority was given to modal reworked and modal reworked ferrallitic soils followed by hydromorphic soils and finally the colluviated and indurated reworked ferrallitic soils 3 2 analytic hierarchy process ahp model ahp is a tool used in multi criteria decision making to solve multi attribute decision making problems in real life situations saaty 1980 it is a robust technique in solving complex and unstructured problems having interactions and correlations with different objectives and goals talib et al 2011 ahp provide crutial assistance in organizing the critical aspects of a problem under a hierarchical structure similar to a family tree zaim et al 2012 determining the weights of the thematic layers as well as their corresponding classes using ahp approach involves respecting the following steps step 1 model development based on the literature review several models were identified for groundwater potential mapping in building a model the problem must be clearly defined the problem as a hierarchy and divided into several thematic layers containing the different characteristics classes of the individual themes so that they form a network of the model agarwal et al 2013 this step is crucial and requires the experts input to ensure that all possible criteria and alternatives have been taking into account step 2 determination and normalization of weights priorities for the criteria in this work weights for groundwater influencing factors were derived from a pairwise comparison matrix considering the relative importance of two criteria for the ability to characterize groundwater potential localizations relative importance values were determined using saaty scale of 1 9 table 2 where equal importance between the two themes takes a score of 1 and extreme importance of one theme compared to the other one takes a score of 9 saaty 1980 table 4 presents a class comparison matrix to achieve priority through the principal eigenvalue and the consistency index the ahp methodology can be based on the idea of uncertainty in judgements saaty 2004 the normalization process reduces the subjectivity associated with the assigned weights of the thematic maps and their features the normalized weights of the thematic layers and those of their features were examined for consistency as recommended by saaty 1980 the calculation of normalized weight was done using the equation 4 w n gm n n 1 n gm n where gm n is the geometric mean of the i th row of the judgment matrices and is calculated as 5 gm n p 1 n p 2 n p nn n where p n denote the n th indicator element with p nn being the judgment matrix element step 3 check for incoherency of the developed matrix saaty defined the consistency index ci as deviation or degree of consistency it s a measure of consistency and it s given by the equation 6 ci λ max i i n n 1 i i i i i i i i i i i λ max largest i eigenvalue i of i the i pairwise i comparison i matrix n number i of i groundwater i condition i factors the measure of consistency of pairwise comparison matrix is known as consistency ratio cr and it s given by the equation 7 cr i ci ri where ri represents the ratio index table 3 presents value of ri for different values of n according to saaty 2012 a consistency ratio cr of 0 10 or less is acceptable to continue the ahp analysis meanwhile a consistency ratio greater than 0 10 need judgments revision in order to locate the cause of the inconsistency and correct it for this work ci was computed for λmax 14 592 n 13 and ri 1 57 the estimated consistency ratio was cr 0 085 and it s less than 0 10 which means a reasonable level of consistency in the pairwise comparison matrix is was achieved the detailed criteria or subclasses normalized weights are presented in table 5 3 3 frequency ratio fr the frequency ratio is a populist statistical approach used in geospatial evaluation of probabilistic relationship between different variables many studies have shown the use of frequency ratio for determining the groundwater potential of a region manap et al 2011 pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 the model is based on observed relationship and correlation between the different conditioning factors and the availability of wells in each factor table 6 the mathematical representation of fr is given by the following equation pham et al 2015 8 fr n i p n n i l p n l where n i p number of pixels with wells for each contributing factor n total number of all pixels in the total study area n i i l p i number of pixels in each class of a contributing factor and n l total number of pixels in a contributing factor 3 4 shannon entropy se method entropy measures the abnormally changeability unstable behaviour degree of disorder and uncertainty of a system relative to its likely initial state massey and nancy 1988 naghibi et al 2014 farzin et al 2021 al abadi et al 2016b in general the concept of entropy describes the amount of abnormality between causes and outcomes or the degree of abnormality in various subjects the entropy refers to an estimate of the difference between the average shares of the individual groups in the overall system pei yue et al 2010 amiri et al 2014 the se model thus benefits from an extremely close relationship between entropy and the quantity called boltzmann used to show the thermodynamic conditions of a system yufeng and fengxiang 2009 v j represents the ratio between the value of parameters and the total value given by the equations bednarik et al 2010 constantin et al 2011 9 e ij fr j 1 m j fr where fr represents the value of the frequency ratio and e ij is the probability density for each class the formulae below are used to compute the information coefficient 10 h j i 1 m j e ij log 2 e ij i i j 1 n 11 h j max log 2 m j 12 i j h j max h j h j max i i 0 1 i j 1 n 13 v j i j fr where h j and h j max are the value of entropy i j is the information coefficient m j is the number of classes in each conditioning factor and v j is the achieved weight value for the given parameter the range is between 0 and 1 table 6 values close to 1show greater inconsistency and imbalance 3 5 generation of groundwater potential index gwpi firstly weights and classes were given to all influencing factors as well as their relative subclasses using the ahp fr and se approaches these factors were used for the identification of groundwater potential areas by weighted linear combination in the arcgis environment according the following equation 14 gwpi i 1 n j 1 m α ij x ij where α ij is the weight of the j th class of th theme n is the total number of thematic layers and m is the total number of classes in a thematic layer x ij is the pixel value of the j th class of the i th theme 3 6 validation techniques several statistical indices has been suggested and used for validation performance of a model naghibi et al 2016a 2016b miraki et al 2019 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 ma et al 2019 abedini et al 2019 pham et al 2018 for the present study area under curve auc receiver operating characteristic curve roc janizadeh et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019 pham et al 2019 bui et al 2019 dou et al 2019 kappa coefficient and accuracy

given by jaafari et al 2017 2018 pham et al 2017 2019 15 acc tp tn tp fn fp tn 16 kappa n j 1 n m j j j 1 n g j c j n 2 j 1 n g j c j 17 auc tc td a b where tp true positive tn true negative fp false

incorrectly classified pixels a total number of groundwater pixels b total number of non groundwater pixels moreover data validation remains the most crutial tasks after the design of a model in order to verify the veracity results the data used for this evaluation must obey the principle of independence jourda et al 2006 this principle requires that this data did not occur during the development of the map submitted for evaluation to validate the groundwater potential areas of the yoyo basin field survey was carried out in 2018 and 2019 during the pre and post drought seasons in this field survey 279 wells and boreholes data were collected and distributed randomly along with gps locations wells are used as an indirect indicator of groundwater yield since in general in areas with high groundwater yield there are a very large number of wells these wells were randomly divided into two sets a training set area 70 having 195 points 149 with yield 5 m3 h and 46 with yield 5 m3 h and a test set area 30 having 84 points 55 with yield 5 m3 h and 29 with yield 5 m3 h no specific limit exists in the determination of the distribution of training set and test set hence greater is the percentage of datasets for analysis higher the validation value auc is obtained silalahi et al 2019 a ratio of 70 30 is used for the current study because 70 is considered sufficient to represent analysis and 30 is considered sufficient to validate the model wang et al 2016 meena et al 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 mapping potential groundwater zones the potential groundwater maps of the yoyo basin evaluated using integrated approaches of analytical hierarchy process frequency ratio and shannon entropy by weighted linear combination in the arcgis environment fig 6 reveal four main classes representing poor moderate good and excellent the computed results revealed for each approach the percentage of area covered by these classes as it s shown in table 7 according to the groundwater potential map produced from the frequency ratio method 34 97 of the total area is found to be of good groundwater potential poor moderate and excellent susceptible zones represent 28 38 20 39 and 15 08 of the total area respectively the fr model fig 6b confirmed that the excellent groundwater potential zones are found in the regions that are underlined by weathered and fractured granite with lineament density ranging from 6 47 to 9 16 high fault density 12 3 flat to gentle slope condition mostly part of cropland and alluvial plain low to high drainage density and the soil of fine coarse sand the results indicated that the groundwater potential is controlled mostly by lithology land use cover lineaments fault density slope angle elevation and drainage density the groundwater potential map generated with ahp which included 29 07 of total area is determined to be of poor groundwater moderate susceptible zones make up 22 28 and 23 73 of the total area the good and excellent susceptible zones values are close to each other 23 73 and 23 75 respectively from the ahp model fig 6a the slope area of 0 01 1 9 drainage density of 6 older and younger alluvial plain areas valley terrace deposits agricultural field fault density 4 8 areas with altitude ranging 892 2 1062 and weathered granite are found to be moderate to excellent zone for groundwater potential the results confirmed that the groundwater potential is controlled mostly by lithology geomorphology lineament density fault density land use cover slope angle rainfall elevation and drainage density the groundwater potential map created in accordance with the se method contains 31 14 of the total area which is designated to be moderate groundwater potential the value is near to the good category in relation to the fr method poor good and excellent prospective zones constitute 25 36 23 14 and 19 17 of the total area respectively it can be seen from fig 6c that the groundwater potential from the shannon entropy model is controlled mostly by lithology land use cover lineaments fault density slope angle elevation and drainage density and are approximately consistent with results of the fr model overall results of the three models indicated that the most important factors in groundwater potential are lithology geomorphology lineament density slope angle soils elevation drainage density rainfall and land use cover respectively by mogaji et al 2015 reliability analysis of the maps showed that most of high yield well locations were observed in good and excellent groundwater potential classes indicating that the models performed well in classifying the study area with respect to well locations a close look over these maps shows areas of good and excellent groundwater potential in the central south eastern north western a tiny eastern and southern parts of the study area these regions are marked by a high density of fracturing and also low medium slopes this confirms that in the middle of the granitic basement only the fractures are the real underground water corridors these results are matching with the work of algaydi et al 2019 adeyeye et al 2019 lasm et al 2004 and das 2017 the moderate groundwater zones were observed in the far north eastern western southern eastern and south eastern of the study area areas of poor groundwater potential were found in the north western northern south eastern and eastern part however the poor groundwater potential areas are mainly limited to hilly terrain and in settlements but can also be due to the anthropogenic activities leading to the low prospect these regions are marked by the presence of steeply sloping dunes and gneissic and granite outcrops thus a higher yield from an aquifer would indicate a great groundwater potential therefore the areas identified in this study are ideally suited to areas of artificial groundwater recharge the integrated groundwater potential maps generated herein give information about the sites where groundwater could be renewed under normal rainfall conditions and could be useful for various decision making processes to better management of groundwater resources 4 2 validation of results to validate these potential groundwater maps fieldwork was carried out during the period 2018 2019 in this field study 279 data from wells observation stations boreholes were collected as well as their gps coordinates the static level of the observed wells varied between 1 0 and 15 5 m meanwhile the yield of the boreholes range between 0 5 and 13 8 m3 h depending on these characteristics wells and borehole were randomly divided into two classes training wells 7 m and 5 m3 h validation wells 7 0 m and 5 m3 h this is how a relationship has been established between potential groundwater areas and wells arrangement in the study area wells are used as indirect indicator of groundwater inflow since very large numbers of wells are found in areas with high groundwater flow in addition an evaluation of the precision was done in order to know the correlation between the groundwater potential zones and the data of wells and boreholes observed using an error confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic roc curves and area under curves auc 4 2 1 confusion matrix the data from the observation wells were used as reference points for the calculation of the precision the overall precision op is given by this equation jensen 1996 18 op number of correct observation well locations total umber of observation wells x 100 the overall precision and the kappa coefficient table 8 for the three models are respectively 1 ahp 87 46 and 79 53 2 fr 84 and 74 62 3 se 87 14 and 77 75 respectively hence a strong agreement landis and koch 1977 this robustness reveals good correlation between potential groundwater maps and observed well data in addition table 8 shows that the ahp model achieved the highest values of tp 0 98 tn 0 75 precision 97 32 acc 99 61 and lowest values of fp 0 fn 0 0068 these results revealed that the ahp model correctly classified 99 1 of all pixels in potential class 90 3 of all pixels in non potential class 99 31 of groundwater pixels into the potential class 96 48 of non groundwater pixels in the non potential class with a perfect kappa 0 7953 agreement between predicted and observed well locations 4 2 2 receiver operating characteristic roc curves and area under roc curves auc the prediction and success rates were provided by the area under the curves of the three models fig 7 model 1 used the ahp factor ranking weights using all 13 conditioning factors fig 6a model 2 integrated all the predictor rate weights of fr with all 13 conditioning factors fig 6b model 3 integrated the weights of se only with conditioning factors fig 6c approximately 70 of wells 195 wells were used for the model training and 30 of the wells 84 wells were used for posterior action on model validation model 1 integrated the ahp factor weights by pairwise comparison and shows a total success rate percentage of 87 09 whereas the prediction rate is about 82 40 which is considered the best mapping model result model 2 preceded by fr shows a success rate percentage of 77 21 with a prediction rate of 76 68 model 3 used the factor weight of se with a total success rate percentage of 75 78 and a prediction rate of 70 61 which is considered the worse prediction result among the three processed models in general auc predictability of groundwater potential zones was found to be good to excellent in the study area furthermore the total number of boreholes and wells location was compared with gpi for the three models as shown in fig 8 for fr model the test revealed that 73 84 206 wells falls into good and excellent potential zones 7 27 21 wells falls into moderate class and 2 51 7 wells in poor zones with respect to the shannon entropy model this test revealed that 76 70 214 wells falls into good excellent zones 9 32 26 wells falls into moderate zone 1 79 5 wells falls into poor zone finally for ahp this test revealed that 77 42 216 wells falls into good excellent zones 6 81 19 wells falls into moderate zone 3 23 9 wells falls into poor zone it can be seen from these results that all models have good prediction efficacy because most of the borehole locations are correctly predicted by gpi map produced by models but again the ahp model is more effectiveness than fr model and se model 5 conclusion groundwater represents the main source of potable water and also of domestic and agricultural activities in the méiganga area overexploitation of this mineral resource has led to a lowering of groundwater levels in some parts of the study area thereby aggravating the water problem in the city therefore detailed investigations are needed in the study area for the effective and sustainable management of this scarce natural resource the present study was undertaken to identify and classify the groundwater potential zones in the yoyo river basin the delineation was successfully achieved by integrating the analytical hierarchy process technique frequency ratio theory and shannon entropy model along with gis and rs thirteen groundwater conditioning factors derived from spatial database geology geomorphology soil texture lineament concentration drainage density fault density regional slope rainfall distribution plan profile curvature elevation land use cover and twi were chosen and by overlay weighted linear combination in the arcgis environment groundwater potential maps gwp was obtained the spatial association values between groundwater productivity data and each related factors using 195 70 wells as training data set and 84 30 wells for validation purposes were also calculated the final groundwater potential maps gwp were classified based on natural break classification scheme into four classes poor moderate good and excellent potential these results showed that most of high yielding wells were observed in zones of good to excellent groundwater potential indicating that the models performed well in classifying the study area with respect to well locations the reliability analysis revealed that ahp model kappa 79 53 auc 76 21 performs better than se model kappa 77 75 auc 73 62 and fr model kappa 74 62 auc 73 62 the outputs of these results revealed that the models have good accurancy demonstrating the effectiveness excellence and ability of these approaches in gwp demarcation these resulting groundwater potential maps could be useful for various decision making processes for groundwater resources sustainable management in the yoyo river basin furthermore groundwater potential maps validation should be improved by using recent drilling data in order to better reproduce the realities on the ground the identification of areas with good groundwater potential does not guarantee a 100 drilling success rate although the probability seems good about 65 2 depth of investigation was also poorly understood in the framework of the proposed approach in this study indeed the hydrodynamic behavior at depth could not be explained by the analysis of the criteria used and was limited to hypothetical interpolations of surface data the hydrodynamic functioning of the subsoil was indeed more complex to ensure the sustainability and productivity of the hydraulics structures however new boreholes should be installed in each zone for which the thematic class indicated a given potential class for a reliable validation and verification of the productivity therefore sufficient resources are necessary future works should highlight the integration of mathematical based approaches such as the artificial neural network or decision trees with the pairwise comparison of ahp the efficacity of remote sensing methodology in groundwater delineation could be further improved by considering sufficient amounts of information and data with direct or indirect
