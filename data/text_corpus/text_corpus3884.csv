19420,the applicability of compound specific isotope analysis csia for assessing in situ hydrolysis of parathion was investigated in a contaminated aquifer at a former pesticide wastes landfill site stable isotope analysis of parathion extracted from groundwater taken from different monitoring wells revealed a maximum enrichment in carbon isotope ratio of 4 9 compared to the source of parathion providing evidence that in situ hydrolysis took place calculations based on the rayleigh equation approach indicated that the natural attenuation of parathion was up to 8 6 by hydrolysis under neutral and acidic conditions in degradation experiments with aerobic and anaerobic parathion degrading microbes no carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation of parathion were observed for the first time csia has been applied for the exclusive assessment of the hydrolysis of phosphorothioate containing organophosphorus pesticides at a contaminated field site graphical abstract image 1 keywords isotope fractionation parathion in situ hydrolysis field application csia 1 introduction organophosphorus pesticides ops have been used mainly as insecticides throughout the world since the decline in the use of organochlorine pesticides in the 1960s and 1970s ops exhibit acute toxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase ache in the nervous system today the consumption of ops ranks second relative to the total global pesticide usage fenner et al 2013 ops are considered to be degradable in the environment in contrast to organochlorines however continuous and excessive use of ops has led to environmental contaminations which raise public concerns usepa 2006 as the residues have repeatedly been detected in soils sediments waterbodies air samples fishes and humans aston and seiber 1996 kawahara et al 2005 pehkonen and zhang 2002 parathion o o diethyl o 4 nitrophenyl phosphorothioate was one of the most widely used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture in the past decades and was primarily used on fruit cotton wheat vegetables and nut crops fao 1990 due to its toxicity parathion has been banned or restricted in many countries however stockpiles and waste from previous manufacturing and former landfill sites often contain parathion lrsb 2014 nielsen et al 2014 forming serious point source contaminations which require management strategies thus it is important to understand the chemical fate of parathion for properly environmental risks assessment at landfill sites and for groundwater quality protection and management hydrolysis is believed to be one of the major pathways controlling the fate of ops in the environment hydrolysis of ops proceeds by a common mechanism where h2o and oh act as nucleophiles in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism sn2 mechanism pehkonen and zhang 2002 thatcher and kluger 1989 the ester bonds of ops can be hydrolyzed under acidic and alkaline conditions by two different pathways whereas the relative contribution of each hydrolysis pathway is ph dependent wu et al 2018 alkaline hydrolysis is much faster compared to acidic and neutral hydrolysis for example the half life of parathion is reported to be 133 days at ph 5 25 c 247 days at ph 7 25 c 102 days at ph 9 25 c fao 1990 and only 1 14 days at ph 12 20 c wu et al 2018 generally alkaline hydrolysis is unlikely to contribute significantly to the natural attenuation of parathion since mostly neutral and slightly acidic conditions are prevailing in the environment therefore hydrolysis under neutral or slightly acidic environmental conditions will lead to long half life of parathion the ph of seawater is typically limited to a range between 7 5 and 8 4 and seawater ingressions in dumpsites affected by tidal fluctuation may potentially contribute to increase in situ hydrolysis compound specific isotope analysis csia opens the door to the development of field based assessment of degradation reactions csia is one of the most promising fate investigative tools which enable the detection of in situ biodegradation of organic contaminants nijenhuis and richnow 2016 vogt et al 2016 it has been used to estimate the extent of biodegradation of a specific compound from changes in isotope ratios of field samples if the isotope enrichment factor ε of that compound is determined in laboratory experiments based on the rayleigh equation bashir et al 2015 hofstetter et al 2008 liu et al 2017 thullner et al 2012 the molecular size of many micropollutants such as pesticides consumer care products or pharmaceuticals is greater than of typical legacy contaminants chlorinated compounds benzene and toluene thus limiting the sensitivity of csia as only bond change reactions induce kinetic isotope effects which are used for characterizing degradation reactions large molecules exhibit more atoms which are not reacting thus changes in single element isotope ratios e g δ13c tend to become smaller with larger molecular size due to isotope dilution effects of non reacting atoms moreover single element isotope ratios in the field can be always influenced by masking of isotope fractionation which makes the identification of degradation pathways by single element isotope analysis more difficult elsner 2010 multi element isotope analysis offers an opportunity to circumvent the problem associated with single element csia as it allows characterizing bond change reactions of several elements in previous studies we analyzed the carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation of several ops upon chemical oxidation and hydrolysis in laboratory experiments wu et al 2014 2018 we could show that the rate limiting step of the uv h2o2 reaction of parathion is the oxidative attack of the oh radical on the p s bond as indicated by negligible carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation the hydrolysis of parathion under acidic and alkaline conditions resulted in distinct but different carbon isotope fractionation patterns principally allowing the distinction of the two different ph dependent pathways and giving the possibility for characterizing natural attenuation of parathion by hydrolysis in the environment using isotope fractionation concepts csia has been widely used for biodegradation assessment of different contaminant groups elsner 2010 thullner et al 2012 recently vogt and colleges summarized the concepts for applying csia for characterization of natural attenuation of hydrocarbons in field studies vogt et al 2016 in addition csia has been proposed as a useful approach for characterizing degradation processes of micropollutants such as pesticides at field scale elsner and imfeld 2016 however only in a few field studies csia has been applied to assess microbial degradation of different pesticides or herbicides bashir et al 2015 liu et al 2017 milosevic et al 2013 to our best knowledge csia has not yet been applied in field studies to assess the in situ degradation of ops in order to fill this research gap we selected parathion as a model compound of ops and investigated its natural attenuation by hydrolysis at a contaminated site using carbon and hydrogen isotope analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals parathion o o diethyl o 4 nitrophenyl phosphorothioate 99 7 was purchased from sigma aldrich and dichloromethane dcm 99 9 and 25 hcl solution were purchased from carl roth gmbh co kg germany anhydrous na2so4 99 was obtained from bernd kraft gmbh germany 2 2 field site and sampling groyne 42 is situated at harboøre tongue in denmark facing the north sea between 1950 and 1960 waste chemicals were disposed at the site the area is still heavily contaminated by approximately 100 tons of primarily ops mainly the highly toxic parathion northpestclean 2014a a complex dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl presenting in groyne 42 is a mixture of ops and intermediate products reactants and solvents used or produced in the manufacturing of ops the background information of this site has been described elsewhere bondgaard et al 2012 hvidberg et al 2008 in 2006 the contaminated area 20 000 m2 was encapsulated by installing a 600 m long and 14 m deep steel sheet piling and a plastic membrane cap in order to prevent further leaching of toxins to the seawater fig s1 northpestclean 2014a from 2007 to 2014 the central denmark region and the danish environmental protection agency conducted research to develop a new in situ treatment of the site the treatment consisted of in situ alkaline hydrolysis isah combined with pump and treat the demonstration experiments were carried out on site in controlled test cells tcs and test pipes tps more information can be found in the online reports from north pest clean northpestclean because of the demonstration experiments in the northpestclean project the site contained discrete areas which are the treated areas with sodium hydroxide ph 13 and the untreated areas with neutral to acidic conditions ph 2 7 by 2014 the total removal of contaminants from tcs and tps in treated areas is up to 85 from water and 76 from sediment by isah combined with pump and treat northpestclean 2014b however the natural attenuation of parathion in the untreated area remains unknown due to the lack of efficient assessment methods the locations of monitoring wells are indicated in fig 1 two free phase samples from the groyne 42 dnapl were taken in 2011 and 2014 and used to characterize the isotopic composition of the source of parathion the groyne 42 dnapl has a density of 1 16 g ml 1 and viscosity of 13 9 cp at 10 c muff et al 2016 the composition by weight of the dnapl was characterized to be 62 parathion 9 methyl parathion o o dimethyl o p nitrophenylphosphorothioate 7 mercury 5 sulfotep diethoxyphosphinothioyloxy diethoxy sulfanylidene λ5 phosphane 3 malathion diethyl 2 dimethoxyphosphorothioyl sulfanyl butanedioate and 14 other unknown contaminants northpestclean 2014a the free phase samples were dissolved in dcm and directly subjected for carbon and hydrogen isotope analysis to be used as the source signature of parathion 19 samples were collected from monitoring wells installed in the treated area and 17 samples were collected from the untreated area using a submersible electrical pump 1 l of brown glass bottles schott germany were used for sampling from the treated area where high concentrations of parathion were expected in order to avoid evaporation of parathion bottles were filled with groundwater almost completely and sealed with teflon coated caps schott germany without headspace the ph of groundwater samples was adjusted to neutral or slightly acidic conditions using 25 hcl solution to inhibit alkaline hydrolysis neutralization was monitored by universal ph indicator strips 0 14 ph indicator strips macherey nagel 2 5 l of brown glass bottles schott germany were used for sampling from the untreated area using the same procedures as described above but without adjusting the ph because parathion has a relative slow hydrolysis rate at neutral to acidic conditions the ground water level was measured on site by an el wa water level meters the concentrations of dissolved oxygen temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured on site during sampling using a multimeter wtw weilheim germany samples were sent to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until extraction the extraction of samples was processed within 2 weeks after sampling 2 3 sample preparation groundwater samples were transferred into a 2 l glass separation funnel each sample was extracted three times with 100 ml 50 ml and 50 ml of dcm respectively by shaking thoroughly the organic phases were combined and evaporated to 2 ml under a gentle stream of n2 in a turbovap concentrator turbovap ii biotage sweden the extraction and evaporation procedure did not result in significant changes in carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of parathion as shown elsewhere wu et al 2017 the concentrated sample from the untreated area was then transferred into a 4 ml glass vial by a glass pipette and reconstituted into 3 ml of dcm the concentrated sample from the treated area was transferred into a 20 ml glass vial by a glass pipette and reconstituted into 10 ml of dcm due to the high concentration of parathion before analysis approximately 1 5 g untreated area or 5 g treated area of anhydrous na2so4 were added in each vial to remove water 2 4 aerobic and anaerobic degradation of parathion in order to investigate the isotopic profiles of parathion during biodegradation experiments were conducted using two isolated aerobic strains teri op1 teri op2 and one anaerobic strain teri ana 1 respectively the strains were isolated from soil samples collected from nearby garden located in gwal pahari gurgaon haryana india the aerobic strains were isolated in mineral salt ms medium with compositions as described elsewhere rokade and mali 2013 enrichment and isolation of anaerobic parathion degraders was carried out under strictly anoxic conditions ms medium was prepared under anaerobic condition as described elsewhere junghare et al 2012 by simultaneous boiling for 10 min and purging with nitrogen flush to remove the dissolved oxygen 0 1 of resazurin was added as redox indicator and l cysteine hcl 2 5 was added as a reducing agent to maintain the anoxic conditions more details of the enrichment and isolation of strains were described in the supporting information section 3 1 3 2 and 4 1 batch experiments were conducted under oxic and anoxic conditions in 500 ml flasks containing 250 ml ms medium for studying parathion degradation kinetics for each batch experiment seven flasks containing 34 μm parathion spiked ms medium were inoculated with 1 ml of inoculum more information about inoculum preparation is provided in the supporting information section 3 3 sterile control flasks were prepared by the same procedures except adding inoculum all control and culture flasks were incubated at 150 rpm and 30 c in the dark at different time intervals 1 ml culture broth was taken for optical density and ph variation measurement residual parathion and potential metabolites in the medium were extracted by 10 ml of dcm containing naphthalene 6 5 mg l 1 as internal standard for further analysis 2 5 analytical methods and quantification 2 5 1 concentration measurement parathion was quantified using an agilent 6890 series gc agilent technologies usa equipped with a flame ionization detector fid as described elsewhere wu et al 2017 2018 a modified temperature program was used the column was initially held at 60 c for 2 min and increased at 8 c min 1 to 280 c and then held for 2 min 2 5 2 isotope analysis the carbon isotope compositions of parathion were analyzed by a gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometer gc c irms system which consists of a gc 7890a agilent technologies palo alto ca usa coupled via a conflo iv interface thermo fisher scientific germany to a mat 253 irms thermo fisher scientific germany via an open split high temperature pyrolysis was

spectrometer system gc htc irms a db 608 column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 5 μm agilent j w usa was used for sample separation the column was initially held at 60 c for 2 min and increased at 8 c min 1 to 280 c and then held for 2 min all samples were measured in triplicate the other analytical details are the same as described elsewhere wu et al 2017 2 5 3 quantification of parathion degradation in the field the carbon and hydrogen isotopic signatures are reported as δ values in parts per thousand relative to international reference materials which are vienna peedee belemnite vpdb for carbon and standard mean ocean water smow for hydrogen coplen 2011 coplen et al 2006 schimmelrnann et al 2016 a main objective of csia is to quantify the amount of chemical or biological degradation in the field supporting monitored natural attenuation mna as a site remedy the extent of degradation can be estimated for individual compounds using the isotope shifts between the source and the residual not yet degraded fraction of the reacting compound using eq 1 which is derived from the rearrangement of the logarithmic form of the rayleigh equation eq 2 meckenstock et al 2004 1 d 1 c t c 0 100 1 δ t 1 δ 0 1 1 ε 100 2 ln δ t 1 δ 0 1 ε ln c t c 0 where ct is the concentration at a given reaction time t or on a flow path downgradient a source c0 is the concentration at the beginning of a reaction or in source area δt and δ0 are the corresponding carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of the reacting compound ε is the isotope enrichment factor for a degradation process which can be obtained from reference experiment under laboratory condition using rayleigh equation eq 2 thus the extent of degradation d in the field can be retrieved from isotope values alone without additional information on concentrations or transformation products 3 results and discussion 3 1 parathion distribution and hydrogeochemical conditions the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater samples are listed in table 1 the groundwater level in the monitoring wells ranged from 1 40 to 5 15 m below surface the temperature was between 11 4 and 13 0 c concentrations of dissolved oxygen were always below 0 1 mg l 1 indicating almost anoxic conditions in the untreated area the ph ranged from 3 2 to 6 5 the acidic conditions were likely due to acid chemical waste deposition only one well in this area showed an alkaline ph of 9 4 well v03 2 parathion concentrations of samples from the untreated area were always lower than 5 mg l 1 in the treated area the ph ranged from 6 9 to 12 4 demonstrating the effectiveness of the remediation measure samples from well tc3 9 3 in the treated area were strongly acidic ph 2 2 indicating that this well is very close to the core of acid waste deposition and mixing of alkaline solutions with dnapl did not result in alkaline conditions the concentrations of parathion varied from 0 76 to 155 33 mg l 1 in the wells within the treated area table 1 the solubility of parathion is 10 4 mg l 1 in water at 8 c the average temperature of ground water in denmark which is calculated using the enthalpy of fusion for parathion as described elsewhere polatoğlu et al 2015 most of the parathion concentrations levels in the treated area are above its solubility this is due to that the treated area is located at the contamination hotspot fig 1 where free organic phases of a mixture of ops intermediate products reactants as well as solvents used in the manufacturing of ops are present free contaminant phases probably fill pore space of the sediment implying a limited contact to water phases thus reducing the mixing with alkaline water in the treated area the large variations of ph values and parathion concentrations in both areas illustrate rather heterogenic biogeochemical conditions at the investigated site potential transformation products of parathion were investigated in different treated and untreated areas of the site fig s2 and table s1 the relative abundance and frequency of detected aminoparathion 4 diethoxyphosphinothioyloxyaniline suggested reduction of the nitro group of parathion by chemical or microbial processes see also below compared to the treated area the higher abundance of aminoparathion in the untreated area table s1 showing neutral and acidic conditions indicates that the reduction of the nitro group is preferentially a biological process the presence of aminoparathion may point to reducing conditions prevailing at the dumpsite aminoparathion was detected in our biological degradation experiments under aerobic conditions using strain teri op1 and under anoxic conditions using strain teri ana 1 as described below in section 3 4 which is also in line with previous studies singh and walker 2006 p nitrophenol 4 nitrophenol is a typical alkaline hydrolysis product of parathion and was detected in both untreated and treated areas the relative abundance and detection frequency were higher in the treated area table s1 showing the hydrolytic cleavage of the o p bond the abundance of p nitrophenol in biodegradation studies suggests that biological hydrolysis may contribute to transformation of parathion 3 2 carbon and hydrogen isotope analysis of parathion from field samples the average value of all isotope analyses of source samples was taken as source signature of parathion resulting in 22 9 0 8 for δ13c n 10 and 212 15 for δ2h n 12 in the untreated area the obtained δ13c values differed from 22 1 to 18 0 and δ2h values differed from 226 to 208 table 1 in the treated area the δ13c values varied from 23 6 to 20 1 and δ2h values varied from 227 to 201 table 1 compared to the source signature of parathion the δ13c enrichment of 0 8 4 9 was obtained from the wells in the untreated area fig 2 a indicating in situ acidic and neutral hydrolysis was taking place in the treated area the δ13c values were almost identical with the source signature fig 2a showing that no carbon isotope fractionation of parathion occurs under strong alkaline conditions which is in agreement with the results of laboratory hydrolysis experiments wu et al 2018 δ13c enrichments of 2 8 and 2 1 were observed in samples from wells tc3 6 3 and tc3 7 2 respectively which are characterized by strongly alkaline ph values 11 7 12 4 this result might be explained by mixing of alkaline water and plumes during sampling mixing of water in porous media under laminar flow conditions in sandy aquifers is restricted which imply that alkaline solution will not mix easily with contaminant phases or highly contaminated water mass transfer processes are widely controlled by diffusive transport resulting in transversal dispersion along a flow path convective mixing in porous sediments practically can be neglected for example mixing of contaminants with electron donor or acceptor under laminar flow conditions can be limiting for biodegradation mixing during sampling need to be taken into account for interpreting isotope composition and lead to an underestimation of degradation reactions kopinke et al 2005 mixing of water bodies from different sections of an aquifer with specific reaction conditions should be considered for quantitative interpretation of isotope fractionation pattern thullner et al 2012 the isotope fractionation is an indication that the hydrolysis may have taken place under acidic neutral or slight alkaline conditions explaining the carbon isotope enrichment however in both treated and untreated areas the δ2h values were all overlapping with the source signature fig 2b because the hydrolysis of parathion is not associated to a detectable hydrogen isotope fractionation effect independent of the ph value 3 3 isotopic profiles of parathion during hydrolysis and chemical oxidation carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation patterns of hydrolysis and chemical oxidation of parathion have been investigated systematically in our previous study wu et al 2018 chemical oxidation of parathion occurs via oxidation of the p s bond to a p o bond by an oh radical in the first rate determining irreversible step fig 3 b the reaction is not linked to detectable hydrogen or carbon isotope fractionation in contrast the hydrolysis of parathion results in no detectable h isotope fractionation but significant c isotope fractionation corresponding to isotope enrichment factors of εc 6 9 0 8 at ph 2 6 7 0 4 at ph 5 6 0 0 2 at ph 7 3 5 0 4 at ph 9 and no detectable carbon isotope fractionation at ph 12 the different isotope fractionation patterns are due to two hydrolysis pathways of parathion fig 3a one is p o bond cleavage by nucleophilic attack at the phosphorus atom under strong alkaline condition resulting in no c and h isotope fractionation another one is c o bond cleavage by nucleophilic attack at the carbon atom under acidic neutral and slightly alkaline conditions resulting in a significant c but no h isotope fractionation the obtained εc at ph 2 ph 5 and ph 7 are identical when considering the confidence intervals this is due to the similar pathway taking place under neutral and acidic hydrolysis fig 3a1 which cannot be distinct by isotope fractionation analysis in the case of lower ph 7 the changes of ph have effects on the reaction rates for instance the hydrolysis half life of parathion at 25 c is reported to be 133 days at ph 5 and 247 days at ph 7 fao 1990 however no effects of ph changes on the reaction pathway and therefore the identical εc were obtained two hydrolysis pathways take place simultaneously in the range of 7 ph 10 with the increase of ph the contribution from c o bond cleavage pathway decreases resulting in smaller εc the reduction of the εc at ph 9 revealed that the contribution to parathion degradation via c o bond cleavage pathway is 51 58 wu et al 2018 using the extended rayleigh type equation derived by van breukelen van breukelen 2007 parathion is hydrolyzed completely by the p o bond cleavage pathway at ph 10 as shown experimentally wanamaker et al 2013 which is in agreement with the result that no detectable εc was obtained during hydrolysis at ph 12 therefore c isotope fractionation can be expected and applied to characterize parathion hydrolysis at ph 10 3 4 isotopic profiles of parathion during biodegradation isotopic profiles of parathion during biodegradation were investigated under laboratory cultivation using two isolated aerobic strains teri op1 teri op2 and one anaerobic strain teri ana 1 experimental details with regard to the microbiological investigations are described in the supporting information during aerobic degradation of more than 80 parathion no carbon and hydrogen isotope enrichment could be observed table s2 similarly under anoxic conditions no carbon and hydrogen isotope enrichment of parathion could be observed after 90 degradation table s3 thus the reactions were not associated with detectable carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation of parathion using the three tested strains the potential biodegradation metabolites of parathion were tentative analyzed via gc ms for analytical details see supporting information the tentative metabolites analyses suggested that p nitrophenol formed through the hydrolysis of the ester bond was one initial reaction product under aerobic conditions using strain teri op2 aminoparathion was detected in degradation experiments under aerobic conditions and anoxic conditions using strain teri op1 and strain teri ana 1 respectively this indicates that the biodegradation leads to the reduction of the nitro group to form the amino group in previous studies several microbial strains have been isolated capable of degrading parathion affiliated e g to the genera flavobacterium bacillus pseudomonas or arthrobacter singh and walker 2006 the previously proposed biodegradation mechanisms of parathion were summarized in fig 3c which are c1 hydrolysis of the phosphotriester bond to form p nitrophenol p o bond cleavage which is the major pathway c2 reduction of the nitro group acting as electron acceptor to form aminoparathion n o bond cleavage c3 oxidation of the sulfur group of parathion to form paraoxon diethyl 4 nitrophenyl phosphate p s bond cleavage no carbon or hydrogen bonds breaking is involved in the first rate determining irreversible step of all three proposed pathways thus no significant carbon and or hydrogen isotope fractionation is expected to be associated with the biodegradation of parathion therefore the microbial degradation is not likely to be characterized by carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation however only a limited number of studies exist on aerobic and anaerobic degradation of parathion it cannot be fully excluded that microorganisms could attack parathion by oxidizing a carbon entity leading to carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation 3 5 quantitative assessment of in situ hydrolysis at the investigated field site even though the formation of oh radicals is unlikely in an anoxic or oxygen limited aquifer the chemical oxidation of parathion leads to desulfurization in the rate limiting step and would not yield significant carbon or hydrogen isotope fractionation wu et al 2018 as discussed above it is unlikely that significant carbon or hydrogen isotope fractionation is associated with the biodegradation of parathion and moreover no carbon isotope fractionation can be expected during the hydrolysis of parathion at ph 10 hence the carbon isotope enrichment obtained in parathion at the groyne 42 site can be contributed exclusively to hydrolysis at ph 10 the extent of hydrolysis can be estimated by eq 1 using the εc determined in laboratory experiments based on the rayleigh equation however the accuracy of the degradation estimation in the field is highly dependent on the choice of an appropriate εc for the given field situation usepa 2008 the extent of in situ hydrolysis of parathion in the untreated area at the groyne 42 site was estimated using εc of 6 0 0 2 ph 7 6 7 0 4 ph 5 and 6 9 0 8 ph 2 respectively the estimation using carbon isotope enrichment revealed the evidence that up to 8 6 natural attenuation of parathion was contributed by hydrolysis under neutral and acidic conditions table 1 the εc of 3 5 0 4 ph 9 was used to estimate the extent of degradation in the untreated area considering the mixed hydrolysis pathways which resulted in up to 16 of natural attenuation of parathion was contributed by hydrolysis under slightly alkaline conditions table 1 the low extent of in situ hydrolysis is due to long half life of parathion under acidic and neutral conditions and low ground water temperature at the field site 11 13 c the initial concentration of parathion c0 in the untreated area was calculated by applying eq 1 using the measured concentrations ct and estimated extent of hydrolysis table 1 the initial concentrations of parathion in monitored wells in the untreated area were calculated to be below 5 17 mg l 1 which is below the solubility of 10 4 mg l 1 in water at 8 c the average temperature of ground water in denmark muff and colleagues investigated the influence of co solvents on the aqueous solubility and reactivity of the ops in the complex groyne 42 dnapl their results suggest that the hydrolysis reactions are limited by the rate of hydrolysis rather than napl dissolution muff et al 2016 chemical hydrolysis of parathion follows pseudo first order kinetics within the accuracy of measurement half life of the reactions conducted at ph 1 to 7 8 and temperatures from 0 to 90 c under different conditions from different studies are summarized in table s4 arrhenius plots are often used to analyze the effect of temperature on the rates of chemical reactions which displays the logarithm of kinetic constants ln κ plotted against inverse temperature 1 t the arrhenius plot of parathion hydrolysis using collected data in table s4 gave a straight line with r2 of 0 976 fig 4 from which the activation energy ea 92 04 kj mol 1 was determined the obtained ea is in the same order of the previous reported value of 22 35 kcal mol 1 93 52 kj mol 1 which was calculated from the hydrolysis of parathion at ph 7 8 at different temperatures weber 1976 the equation obtained in fig 3 shows the correlation of temperature and the rate constants of parathion hydrolysis at ph 7 8 from this a half life of 1521 days at the average ground water temperature in denmark 8 c can be roughly predicted the relative low temperature at the groyne 42 field site would lead to long retention time of parathion in the untreated area a previous study suggested that the enhancement of the average rate of hydrolysis could be achieved by a factor of 1 4 4 8 by increasing the reaction temperature from 10 to 30 c muff et al 2016 our results contradicts to some extent with the assumption that the rate of hydrolysis is the rate limiting step in the in situ degradation and believe that mixing is a major factor firstly we found indication for neutral and acidic hydrolysis even in the treated areas where someone would expect prevailing alkaline conditions secondly the high parathion concentrations clearly over the water solubility suggest that phases are present which are obviously not assessable to hydrolysis thirdly in spite of long half life the high concentrations suggest that phases not assessable to hydrolysis still provide a source of contamination leaching into the ground water thus the kinetic of hydrolytic transformation is expected to be controlled by mixing of alkaline water in the subsurface and mixing in porous media is slow similar assumption could be made for neutral and acidic hydrolysis mixing of alkaline solutions with dnapl seems to be a challenge for all in situ measures heterogenic reaction conditions could be expected as suggested by the carbon isotope enrichment of parathion even at places with high ph pointing to a predominance of neutral or acidic hydrolysis 4 conclusions carbon isotope fractionation can be used to characterize acidic and neutral hydrolysis of parathion at contaminated field sites anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation of parathion proceed via reduction of the nitro group to aminoparathion and or via enzymatic hydrolysis to p nitrophenol and chemical oxidation by radicals occurs via desulfurization of parathion to paraoxon both reaction mechanisms were shown to be not associated with carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation therefore the extent of hydrolysis under typical environmental ph values 3 10 can be quantified robustly using the rayleigh concept and the isotope enrichment factors obtained in laboratory hydrolysis experiments at ph smaller than 7 where the c o bond cleavage is the dominant hydrolysis pathway the ph changes will affect the reaction rate but has no effects on the carbon isotope enrichment factors of parathion in addition hydrolysis rates increase with increasing temperature for instance the half life of parathion at ph 7 is 247 days at 25 c fao 1990 and 75 h at 60 c wu et al 2018 however the mechanisms will not change and the isotope fractionation of sn2 reaction is considered to be not much effected by temperature a previous study reported that the hydrolysis rates of methyl halides increased with increasing temperature while carbon kinetic isotope effects for halide substitution were almost independent of temperature baesman and miller 2005 this suggest that when both temperature and ph adjustments are required for technical measures to improve parathion hydrolysis at contaminated sites the isotope enrichment factors obtained in laboratory hydrolysis experiments are still applicable to analyze the mode of hydrolysis conflicts of interest none acknowledgment langping wu is financially supported by the china scholarship council file no 201306460007

major pathways controlling the fate of ops in the environment hydrolysis of ops proceeds by a common mechanism where h2o and oh act as nucleophiles in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism sn2 mechanism pehkonen and zhang 2002 thatcher and kluger 1989 the ester bonds of ops can be hydrolyzed under acidic and alkaline conditions by two different pathways whereas the relative contribution of each hydrolysis pathway is ph dependent wu et al 2018 alkaline hydrolysis is much faster compared to acidic and neutral hydrolysis for example the half life of parathion is reported to be 133 days at ph 5 25 c 247 days at ph 7 25 c 102 days at ph 9 25 c fao 1990 and only 1 14 days at ph 12 20 c wu et al 2018 generally alkaline hydrolysis is unlikely to contribute significantly to the natural attenuation of parathion since mostly neutral and slightly acidic conditions are prevailing in the environment therefore hydrolysis under neutral or slightly acidic environmental conditions will lead to long half life of parathion the ph of seawater is typically limited to a range between 7 5 and 8 4 and seawater ingressions in dumpsites affected by tidal fluctuation may potentially contribute to increase in situ hydrolysis compound specific isotope analysis csia opens the door to the development of field based assessment of degradation reactions csia is one of the most promising fate investigative tools which enable the detection of in situ biodegradation of organic contaminants nijenhuis and richnow 2016 vogt et al 2016 it has been used to estimate the extent of biodegradation of a specific compound from changes in isotope ratios of field samples if the isotope enrichment factor ε of that compound is determined in laboratory experiments based on the rayleigh equation bashir et al 2015 hofstetter et al 2008 liu et al 2017 thullner et al 2012 the molecular size of many micropollutants such as pesticides consumer care products or pharmaceuticals is greater than of typical legacy contaminants chlorinated compounds benzene and toluene thus limiting the sensitivity of csia as only bond change reactions induce kinetic isotope effects which are used for characterizing degradation reactions large molecules exhibit more atoms which are not reacting thus changes in single element isotope ratios e g δ13c tend to become smaller with larger molecular size due to isotope dilution effects of non reacting atoms moreover single element isotope ratios in the field can be always influenced by masking of isotope fractionation which makes the identification of degradation pathways by single element isotope analysis more difficult elsner 2010 multi element isotope analysis offers an opportunity to circumvent the problem associated with single element csia as it allows characterizing bond change reactions of several elements in previous studies we analyzed the carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation of several ops upon chemical oxidation and hydrolysis in laboratory experiments wu et al 2014 2018 we could show that the rate limiting step of the uv h2o2 reaction of parathion is the oxidative attack of the oh radical on the p s bond as indicated by negligible carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation the hydrolysis of parathion under acidic and alkaline conditions resulted in distinct but different carbon isotope fractionation patterns principally allowing the distinction of the two different ph dependent pathways and giving the possibility for characterizing natural attenuation of parathion by hydrolysis in the environment using isotope fractionation concepts csia has been widely used for biodegradation assessment of different contaminant groups elsner 2010 thullner et al 2012 recently vogt and colleges summarized the concepts for applying csia for characterization of natural attenuation of hydrocarbons in field studies vogt et al 2016 in addition csia has been proposed as a useful approach for characterizing degradation processes of micropollutants such as pesticides at field scale elsner and imfeld 2016 however only in a few field studies csia has been applied to assess microbial degradation of different pesticides or herbicides bashir et al 2015 liu et al 2017 milosevic et al 2013 to our best knowledge csia has not yet been applied in field studies to assess the in situ degradation of ops in order to fill this research gap we selected parathion as a model compound of ops and investigated its natural attenuation by hydrolysis at a contaminated site using carbon and hydrogen isotope analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals parathion o o diethyl o 4 nitrophenyl phosphorothioate 99 7 was purchased from sigma aldrich and dichloromethane dcm 99 9 and 25 hcl solution were purchased from carl roth gmbh co kg germany anhydrous na2so4 99 was obtained from bernd kraft gmbh germany 2 2 field site and sampling groyne 42 is situated at harboøre tongue in denmark facing the north sea between 1950 and 1960 waste chemicals were disposed at the site the area is still heavily contaminated by approximately 100 tons of primarily ops mainly the highly toxic parathion northpestclean 2014a a complex dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl presenting in groyne 42 is a mixture of ops and intermediate products reactants and solvents used or produced in the manufacturing of ops the background information of this site has been described elsewhere bondgaard et al 2012 hvidberg et al 2008 in 2006 the contaminated area 20 000 m2 was encapsulated by installing a 600 m long and 14 m deep steel sheet piling and a plastic membrane cap in order to prevent further leaching of toxins to the seawater fig s1 northpestclean 2014a from 2007 to 2014 the central denmark region and the danish environmental protection agency conducted research to develop a new in situ treatment of the site the treatment consisted of in situ alkaline hydrolysis isah combined with pump and treat the demonstration experiments were carried out on site in controlled test cells tcs and test pipes tps more information can be found in the online reports from north pest clean northpestclean because of the demonstration experiments in the northpestclean project the site contained discrete areas which are the treated areas with sodium hydroxide ph 13 and the untreated areas with neutral to acidic conditions ph 2 7 by 2014 the total removal of contaminants from tcs and tps in treated areas is up to 85 from water and 76 from sediment by isah combined with pump and treat northpestclean 2014b however the natural attenuation of parathion in the untreated area remains unknown due to the lack of efficient assessment methods the locations of monitoring wells are indicated in fig 1 two free phase samples from the groyne 42 dnapl were taken in 2011 and 2014 and used to characterize the isotopic composition of the source of parathion the groyne 42 dnapl has a density of 1 16 g ml 1 and viscosity of 13 9 cp at 10 c muff et al 2016 the composition by weight of the dnapl was characterized to be 62 parathion 9 methyl parathion o o dimethyl o p nitrophenylphosphorothioate 7 mercury 5 sulfotep diethoxyphosphinothioyloxy diethoxy sulfanylidene λ5 phosphane 3 malathion diethyl 2 dimethoxyphosphorothioyl sulfanyl butanedioate and 14 other unknown contaminants northpestclean 2014a the free phase samples were dissolved in dcm and directly subjected for carbon and hydrogen isotope analysis to be used as the source signature of parathion 19 samples were collected from monitoring wells installed in the treated area and 17 samples were collected from the untreated area using a submersible electrical pump 1 l of brown glass bottles schott germany were used for sampling from the treated area where high concentrations of parathion were expected in order to avoid evaporation of parathion bottles were filled with groundwater almost completely and sealed with teflon coated caps schott germany without headspace the ph of groundwater samples was adjusted to neutral or slightly acidic conditions using 25 hcl solution to inhibit alkaline hydrolysis neutralization was monitored by universal ph indicator strips 0 14 ph indicator strips macherey nagel 2 5 l of brown glass bottles schott germany were used for sampling from the untreated area using the same procedures as described above but without adjusting the ph because parathion has a relative slow hydrolysis rate at neutral to acidic conditions the ground water level was measured on site by an el wa water level meters the concentrations of dissolved oxygen temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured on site during sampling using a multimeter wtw weilheim germany samples were sent to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until extraction the extraction of samples was processed within 2 weeks after sampling 2 3 sample preparation groundwater samples were transferred into a 2 l glass separation funnel each sample was extracted three times with 100 ml 50 ml and 50 ml of dcm respectively by shaking thoroughly the organic phases were combined and evaporated to 2 ml under a gentle stream of n2 in a turbovap concentrator turbovap ii biotage sweden the extraction and evaporation procedure did not result in significant changes in carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of parathion as shown elsewhere wu et al 2017 the concentrated sample from the untreated area was then transferred into a 4 ml glass vial by a glass pipette and reconstituted into 3 ml of dcm the concentrated sample from the treated area was transferred into a 20 ml glass vial by a glass pipette and reconstituted into 10 ml of dcm due to the high concentration of parathion before analysis approximately 1 5 g untreated area or 5 g treated area of anhydrous na2so4 were added in each vial to remove water 2 4 aerobic and anaerobic degradation of parathion in order to investigate the isotopic profiles of parathion during biodegradation experiments were conducted using two isolated aerobic strains teri op1 teri op2 and one anaerobic strain teri ana 1 respectively the strains were isolated from soil samples collected from nearby garden located in gwal pahari gurgaon haryana india the aerobic strains were isolated in mineral salt ms medium with compositions as described elsewhere rokade and mali 2013 enrichment and isolation of anaerobic parathion degraders was carried out under strictly anoxic conditions ms medium was prepared under anaerobic condition as described elsewhere junghare et al 2012 by simultaneous boiling for 10 min and purging with nitrogen flush to remove the dissolved oxygen 0 1 of resazurin was added as redox indicator and l cysteine hcl 2 5 was added as a reducing agent to maintain the anoxic conditions more details of the enrichment and isolation of strains were described in the supporting information section 3 1 3 2 and 4 1 batch experiments were conducted under oxic and anoxic conditions in 500 ml flasks containing 250 ml ms medium for studying parathion degradation kinetics for each batch experiment seven flasks containing 34 μm parathion spiked ms medium were inoculated with 1 ml of inoculum more information about inoculum preparation is provided in the supporting information section 3 3 sterile control flasks were prepared by the same procedures except adding inoculum all control and culture flasks were incubated at 150 rpm and 30 c in the dark at different time intervals 1 ml culture broth was taken for optical density and ph variation measurement residual parathion and potential metabolites in the medium were extracted by 10 ml of dcm containing naphthalene 6 5 mg l 1 as internal standard for further analysis 2 5 analytical methods and quantification 2 5 1 concentration measurement parathion was quantified using an agilent 6890 series gc agilent technologies usa equipped with a flame ionization detector fid as described elsewhere wu et al 2017 2018 a modified temperature program was used the column was initially held at 60 c for 2 min and increased at 8 c min 1 to 280 c and then held for 2 min 2 5 2 isotope analysis the carbon isotope compositions of parathion were analyzed by a gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometer gc c irms system which consists of a gc 7890a agilent technologies palo alto ca usa coupled via a conflo iv interface thermo fisher scientific germany to a mat 253 irms thermo fisher scientific germany via an open split high temperature pyrolysis was

spectrometer system gc htc irms a db 608 column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 5 μm agilent j w usa was used for sample separation the column was initially held at 60 c for 2 min and increased at 8 c min 1 to 280 c and then held for 2 min all samples were measured in triplicate the other analytical details are the same as described elsewhere wu et al 2017 2 5 3 quantification of parathion degradation in the field the carbon and hydrogen isotopic signatures are reported as δ values in parts per thousand relative to international reference materials which are vienna peedee belemnite vpdb for carbon and standard mean ocean water smow for hydrogen coplen 2011 coplen et al 2006 schimmelrnann et al 2016 a main objective of csia is to quantify the amount of chemical or biological degradation in the field supporting monitored natural attenuation mna as a site remedy the extent of degradation can be estimated for individual compounds using the isotope shifts between the source and the residual not yet degraded fraction of the reacting compound using eq 1 which is derived from the rearrangement of the logarithmic form of the rayleigh equation eq 2 meckenstock et al 2004 1 d 1 c t c 0 100 1 δ t 1 δ 0 1 1 ε 100 2 ln δ t 1 δ 0 1 ε ln c t c 0 where ct is the concentration at a given reaction time t or on a flow path downgradient a source c0 is the concentration at the beginning of a reaction or in source area δt and δ0 are the corresponding carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of the reacting compound ε is the isotope enrichment factor for a degradation process which can be obtained from reference experiment under laboratory condition using rayleigh equation eq 2 thus the extent of degradation d in the field can be retrieved from isotope values alone without additional information on concentrations or transformation products 3 results and discussion 3 1 parathion distribution and hydrogeochemical conditions the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater samples are listed in table 1 the groundwater level in the monitoring wells ranged from 1 40 to 5 15 m below surface the temperature was between 11 4 and 13 0 c concentrations of dissolved oxygen were always below 0 1 mg l 1 indicating almost anoxic conditions in the untreated area the ph ranged from 3 2 to 6 5 the acidic conditions were likely due to acid chemical waste deposition only one well in this area showed an alkaline ph of 9 4 well v03 2 parathion concentrations of samples from the untreated area were always lower than 5 mg l 1 in the treated area the ph ranged from 6 9 to 12 4 demonstrating the effectiveness of the remediation measure samples from well tc3 9 3 in the treated area were strongly acidic ph 2 2 indicating that this well is very close to the core of acid waste deposition and mixing of alkaline solutions with dnapl did not result in alkaline conditions the concentrations of parathion varied from 0 76 to 155 33 mg l 1 in the wells within the treated area table 1 the solubility of parathion is 10 4 mg l 1 in water at 8 c the average temperature of ground water in denmark which is calculated using the enthalpy of fusion for parathion as described elsewhere polatoğlu et al 2015 most of the parathion concentrations levels in the treated area are above its solubility this is due to that the treated area is located at the contamination hotspot fig 1 where free organic phases of a mixture of ops intermediate products reactants as well as solvents used in the manufacturing of ops are present free contaminant phases probably fill pore space of the sediment implying a limited contact to water phases thus reducing the mixing with alkaline water in the treated area the large variations of ph values and parathion concentrations in both areas illustrate rather heterogenic biogeochemical conditions at the investigated site potential transformation products of parathion were investigated in different treated and untreated areas of the site fig s2 and table s1 the relative abundance and frequency of detected aminoparathion 4 diethoxyphosphinothioyloxyaniline suggested reduction of the nitro group of parathion by chemical or microbial processes see also below compared to the treated area the higher abundance of aminoparathion in the untreated area table s1 showing neutral and acidic conditions indicates that the reduction of the nitro group is preferentially a biological process the presence of aminoparathion may point to reducing conditions prevailing at the dumpsite aminoparathion was detected in our biological degradation experiments under aerobic conditions using strain teri op1 and under anoxic conditions using strain teri ana 1 as described below in section 3 4 which is also in line with previous studies singh and walker 2006 p nitrophenol 4 nitrophenol is a typical alkaline hydrolysis product of parathion and was detected in both untreated and treated areas the relative abundance and detection frequency were higher in the treated area table s1 showing the hydrolytic cleavage of the o p bond the abundance of p nitrophenol in biodegradation studies suggests that biological hydrolysis may contribute to transformation of parathion 3 2 carbon and hydrogen isotope analysis of parathion from field samples the average value of all isotope analyses of source samples was taken as source signature of parathion resulting in 22 9 0 8 for δ13c n 10 and 212 15 for δ2h n 12 in the untreated area the obtained δ13c values differed from 22 1 to 18 0 and δ2h values differed from 226 to 208 table 1 in the treated area the δ13c values varied from 23 6 to 20 1 and δ2h values varied from 227 to 201 table 1 compared to the source signature of parathion the δ13c enrichment of 0 8 4 9 was obtained from the wells in the untreated area fig 2 a indicating in situ acidic and neutral hydrolysis was taking place in the treated area the δ13c values were almost identical with the source signature fig 2a showing that no carbon isotope fractionation of parathion occurs under strong alkaline conditions which is in agreement with the results of laboratory hydrolysis experiments wu et al 2018 δ13c enrichments of 2 8 and 2 1 were observed in samples from wells tc3 6 3 and tc3 7 2 respectively which are characterized by strongly alkaline ph values 11 7 12 4 this result might be explained by mixing of alkaline water and plumes during sampling mixing of water in porous media under laminar flow conditions in sandy aquifers is restricted which imply that alkaline solution will not mix easily with contaminant phases or highly contaminated water mass transfer processes are widely controlled by diffusive transport resulting in transversal dispersion along a flow path convective mixing in porous sediments practically can be neglected for example mixing of contaminants with electron donor or acceptor under laminar flow conditions can be limiting for biodegradation mixing during sampling need to be taken into account for interpreting isotope composition and lead to an underestimation of degradation reactions kopinke et al 2005 mixing of water bodies from different sections of an aquifer with specific reaction conditions should be considered for quantitative interpretation of isotope fractionation pattern thullner et al 2012 the isotope fractionation is an indication that the hydrolysis may have taken place under acidic neutral or slight alkaline conditions explaining the carbon isotope enrichment however in both treated and untreated areas the δ2h values were all overlapping with the source signature fig 2b because the hydrolysis of parathion is not associated to a detectable hydrogen isotope fractionation effect independent of the ph value 3 3 isotopic profiles of parathion during hydrolysis and chemical oxidation carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation patterns of hydrolysis and chemical oxidation of parathion have been investigated systematically in our previous study wu et al 2018 chemical oxidation of parathion occurs via oxidation of the p s bond to a p o bond by an oh radical in the first rate determining irreversible step fig 3 b the reaction is not linked to detectable hydrogen or carbon isotope fractionation in contrast the hydrolysis of parathion results in no detectable h isotope fractionation but significant c isotope fractionation corresponding to isotope enrichment factors of εc 6 9 0 8 at ph 2 6 7 0 4 at ph 5 6 0 0 2 at ph 7 3 5 0 4 at ph 9 and no detectable carbon isotope fractionation at ph 12 the different isotope fractionation patterns are due to two hydrolysis pathways of parathion fig 3a one is p o bond cleavage by nucleophilic attack at the phosphorus atom under strong alkaline condition resulting in no c and h isotope fractionation another one is c o bond cleavage by nucleophilic attack at the carbon atom under acidic neutral and slightly alkaline conditions resulting in a significant c but no h isotope fractionation the obtained εc at ph 2 ph 5 and ph 7 are identical when considering the confidence intervals this is due to the similar pathway taking place under neutral and acidic hydrolysis fig 3a1 which cannot be distinct by isotope fractionation analysis in the case of lower ph 7 the changes of ph have effects on the reaction rates for instance the hydrolysis half life of parathion at 25 c is reported to be 133 days at ph 5 and 247 days at ph 7 fao 1990 however no effects of ph changes on the reaction pathway and therefore the identical εc were obtained two hydrolysis pathways take place simultaneously in the range of 7 ph 10 with the increase of ph the contribution from c o bond cleavage pathway decreases resulting in smaller εc the reduction of the εc at ph 9 revealed that the contribution to parathion degradation via c o bond cleavage pathway is 51 58 wu et al 2018 using the extended rayleigh type equation derived by van breukelen van breukelen 2007 parathion is hydrolyzed completely by the p o bond cleavage pathway at ph 10 as shown experimentally wanamaker et al 2013 which is in agreement with the result that no detectable εc was obtained during hydrolysis at ph 12 therefore c isotope fractionation can be expected and applied to characterize parathion hydrolysis at ph 10 3 4 isotopic profiles of parathion during biodegradation isotopic profiles of parathion during biodegradation were investigated under laboratory cultivation using two isolated aerobic strains teri op1 teri op2 and one anaerobic strain teri ana 1 experimental details with regard to the microbiological investigations are described in the supporting information during aerobic degradation of more than 80 parathion no carbon and hydrogen isotope enrichment could be observed table s2 similarly under anoxic conditions no carbon and hydrogen isotope enrichment of parathion could be observed after 90 degradation table s3 thus the reactions were not associated with detectable carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation of parathion using the three tested strains the potential biodegradation metabolites of parathion were tentative analyzed via gc ms for analytical details see supporting information the tentative metabolites analyses suggested that p nitrophenol formed through the hydrolysis of the ester bond was one initial reaction product under aerobic conditions using strain teri op2 aminoparathion was detected in degradation experiments under aerobic conditions and anoxic conditions using strain teri op1 and strain teri ana 1 respectively this indicates that the biodegradation leads to the reduction of the nitro group to form the amino group in previous studies several microbial strains have been isolated capable of degrading parathion affiliated e g to the genera flavobacterium bacillus pseudomonas or arthrobacter singh and walker 2006 the previously proposed biodegradation mechanisms of parathion were summarized in fig 3c which are c1 hydrolysis of the phosphotriester bond to form p nitrophenol p o bond cleavage which is the major pathway c2 reduction of the nitro group acting as electron acceptor to form aminoparathion n o bond cleavage c3 oxidation of the sulfur group of parathion to form paraoxon diethyl 4 nitrophenyl phosphate p s bond cleavage no carbon or hydrogen bonds breaking is involved in the first rate determining irreversible step of all three proposed pathways thus no significant carbon and or hydrogen isotope fractionation is expected to be associated with the biodegradation of parathion therefore the microbial degradation is not likely to be characterized by carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation however only a limited number of studies exist on aerobic and anaerobic degradation of parathion it cannot be fully excluded that microorganisms could attack parathion by oxidizing a carbon entity leading to carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation 3 5 quantitative assessment of in situ hydrolysis at the investigated field site even though the formation of oh radicals is unlikely in an anoxic or oxygen limited aquifer the chemical oxidation of parathion leads to desulfurization in the rate limiting step and would not yield significant carbon or hydrogen isotope fractionation wu et al 2018 as discussed above it is unlikely that significant carbon or hydrogen isotope fractionation is associated with the biodegradation of parathion and moreover no carbon isotope fractionation can be expected during the hydrolysis of parathion at ph 10 hence the carbon isotope enrichment obtained in parathion at the groyne 42 site can be contributed exclusively to hydrolysis at ph 10 the extent of hydrolysis can be estimated by eq 1 using the εc determined in laboratory experiments based on the rayleigh equation however the accuracy of the degradation estimation in the field is highly dependent on the choice of an appropriate εc for the given field situation usepa 2008 the extent of in situ hydrolysis of parathion in the untreated area at the groyne 42 site was estimated using εc of 6 0 0 2 ph 7 6 7 0 4 ph 5 and 6 9 0 8 ph 2 respectively the estimation using carbon isotope enrichment revealed the evidence that up to 8 6 natural attenuation of parathion was contributed by hydrolysis under neutral and acidic conditions table 1 the εc of 3 5 0 4 ph 9 was used to estimate the extent of degradation in the untreated area considering the mixed hydrolysis pathways which resulted in up to 16 of natural attenuation of parathion was contributed by hydrolysis under slightly alkaline conditions table 1 the low extent of in situ hydrolysis is due to long half life of parathion under acidic and neutral conditions and low ground water temperature at the field site 11 13 c the initial concentration of parathion c0 in the untreated area was calculated by applying eq 1 using the measured concentrations ct and estimated extent of hydrolysis table 1 the initial concentrations of parathion in monitored wells in the untreated area were calculated to be below 5 17 mg l 1 which is below the solubility of 10 4 mg l 1 in water at 8 c the average temperature of ground water in denmark muff and colleagues investigated the influence of co solvents on the aqueous solubility and reactivity of the ops in the complex groyne 42 dnapl their results suggest that the hydrolysis reactions are limited by the rate of hydrolysis rather than napl dissolution muff et al 2016 chemical hydrolysis of parathion follows pseudo first order kinetics within the accuracy of measurement half life of the reactions conducted at ph 1 to 7 8 and temperatures from 0 to 90 c under different conditions from different studies are summarized in table s4 arrhenius plots are often used to analyze the effect of temperature on the rates of chemical reactions which displays the logarithm of kinetic constants ln κ plotted against inverse temperature 1 t the arrhenius plot of parathion hydrolysis using collected data in table s4 gave a straight line with r2 of 0 976 fig 4 from which the activation energy ea 92 04 kj mol 1 was determined the obtained ea is in the same order of the previous reported value of 22 35 kcal mol 1 93 52 kj mol 1 which was calculated from the hydrolysis of parathion at ph 7 8 at different temperatures weber 1976 the equation obtained in fig 3 shows the correlation of temperature and the rate constants of parathion hydrolysis at ph 7 8 from this a half life of 1521 days at the average ground water temperature in denmark 8 c can be roughly predicted the relative low temperature at the groyne 42 field site would lead to long retention time of parathion in the untreated area a previous study suggested that the enhancement of the average rate of hydrolysis could be achieved by a factor of 1 4 4 8 by increasing the reaction temperature from 10 to 30 c muff et al 2016 our results contradicts to some extent with the assumption that the rate of hydrolysis is the rate limiting step in the in situ degradation and believe that mixing is a major factor firstly we found indication for neutral and acidic hydrolysis even in the treated areas where someone would expect prevailing alkaline conditions secondly the high parathion concentrations clearly over the water solubility suggest that phases are present which are obviously not assessable to hydrolysis thirdly in spite of long half life the high concentrations suggest that phases not assessable to hydrolysis still provide a source of contamination leaching into the ground water thus the kinetic of hydrolytic transformation is expected to be controlled by mixing of alkaline water in the subsurface and mixing in porous media is slow similar assumption could be made for neutral and acidic hydrolysis mixing of alkaline solutions with dnapl seems to be a challenge for all in situ measures heterogenic reaction conditions could be expected as suggested by the carbon isotope enrichment of parathion even at places with high ph pointing to a predominance of neutral or acidic hydrolysis 4 conclusions carbon isotope fractionation can be used to characterize acidic and neutral hydrolysis of parathion at contaminated field sites anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation of parathion proceed via reduction of the nitro group to aminoparathion and or via enzymatic hydrolysis to p nitrophenol and chemical oxidation by radicals occurs via desulfurization of parathion to paraoxon both reaction mechanisms were shown to be not associated with carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation therefore the extent of hydrolysis under typical environmental ph values 3 10 can be quantified robustly using the rayleigh concept and the isotope enrichment factors obtained in laboratory hydrolysis experiments at ph smaller than 7 where the c o bond cleavage is the dominant hydrolysis pathway the ph changes will affect the reaction rate but has no effects on the carbon isotope enrichment factors of parathion in addition hydrolysis rates increase with increasing temperature for instance the half life of parathion at ph 7 is 247 days at 25 c fao 1990 and 75 h at 60 c wu et al 2018 however the mechanisms will not change and the isotope fractionation of sn2 reaction is considered to be not much effected by temperature a previous study reported that the hydrolysis rates of methyl halides increased with increasing temperature while carbon kinetic isotope effects for halide substitution were almost independent of temperature baesman and miller 2005 this suggest that when both temperature and ph adjustments are required for technical measures to improve parathion hydrolysis at contaminated sites the isotope enrichment factors obtained in laboratory hydrolysis experiments are still applicable to analyze the mode of hydrolysis conflicts of interest none acknowledgment langping wu is financially supported by the china scholarship council file no 201306460007

the global anthropogenic ghg emissions by 40 70 by 2050 compared to 2010 and emission levels near zero or below in 2100 pachauri et al 2014 hence it is imperative for sdwss to consider the potential minimization of ghg emissions in the planning and design of system upgrades collectively understandings of the environmental and financial aspects unique to the sdwss are essential in protecting human health and improving their sustainability the environmental sustainability of drinking water supply has increasingly been studied via life cycle assessment lca in the last two decades e g hancock et

of the technologies are often not discussed this could potentially hinder the groundtruthing and the generalizability of the methods and results only a few studies have modelled unit processes in detail to allow proper consideration of treatment plant sizes based upon engineering principles as well as potential system optimization by a mix and match of different unit processes ahmadi and

on the cost and environmental implications of small systems facing disinfection and dbp compliance challenges in us by combining life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost analysis lcca this study aims to provide an enhanced understanding on the environmental and socioeconomic tradeoffs of the sdwss technological selections in meeting the desired water quality requirements 2 methodology 2 1 study background the bethlehem water system bws is a typical small scale surface water supply system located in northern new hampshire with a treatment capacity of 0 033 m3 s 0 75 mgd and a service population of around 1700 water is treated via slow sand filtration and chlorine disinfection and then stored in a one million gallon cast in place concrete clearwell reservoir for an average residence time of two days before entering the distribution system fig 1 the total organic carbon toc of the raw water at the bws typically ranges around 1 5 12 mg l with an annual average of around 4 6 mg l this water has a high specific uv absorbance suva value indicating a large composition of high molecular weight unsaturated aromatic carbon in the toc weishaar et al 2003 which contributes to fast formation of dbps in the case of bws dbps could quickly exceed the regulated level within 3 h after contact with chlorine for both trihalomethanes tthm minimum contaminant level mcl 80 μg l and haloacetic acids haa5 mcl 60 μg l which is much shorter than the water residence time of most end users removal of toc by the slow sand filtration however is typically limited to 10 20 furthermore a relatively high dose of chlorine is needed to achieve the swtr lt1eswtr and lt2eswtr s requirements of the 4 log inactivation of viruses and 3 log inactivation of giardia lamblia collectively the limited toc removal high chlorine dosages long residence times and fast dbp formation characteristics have resulted in the bws frequent non compliances with the dbpr according to a 2014 survey of water system violations at least 590 systems around the nation are in violation of the stage 1 dbpr and a majority of these systems are sdwss relying on surface water as the primary source oxenford and barrett 2016 2 2 system upgrade scenarios the dbps at the sdwss can be controlled via three main strategies 1 enhanced removal of dbp precursors 2 modifying disinfection practices and 3 removal of dbps after formation wrf 2013 in the current study the first two dbp control strategies were investigated in designing alternative system upgrade scenarios considering the technical and socioeconomic constraints of the sdwss four system upgrade scenarios were developed which are intended to achieve the required dbp reduction either through increasing dbp precursor removal gac and ozone scenarios or minimizing dbp formation uv30 and uv186 scenarios gac scenario enhance the removal of natural organic matters noms in the raw water by adding granular activated carbon gac filtration to the current slow sand filtration furthermore a gravel roughing filter rf is installed as a pretreatment for water entering the gac filters e g removal of leaves and algae to improve their performances continue to use chlorination as a sole disinfection method but with reduced dosages ozone scenario change the characteristics of raw water noms by preozonation to enhance dbp precursor removals by the slow sand filter and to delay and minimize the formation of dbps within the residence time of the bws an ozone generator and contactor will be installed to break down the high molecular weight noms into low molecular weight simple organic carbons before entering the slow sand filters and the disinfection contactor additionally a rf is installed between ozonator and slow sand filters to prevent rapid head loss development in slow sand filters continue to use chlorination as a sole disinfection method uv30 scenario minimize dbp formation by modifying the current disinfection approach a combination of medium pressure uv disinfection 30 mj cm2 and chlorine disinfection is used to achieve the required 4 log inactivation of viruses and 3 log inactivation of giardia lamblia chloramine is used to for residual disinfection which is achieved by adding anhydrous ammonia to hypochlorite no changes will be made to the current operation of the slow sand filters uv186 scenario modify the current disinfection approach to achieve the least possible dbp formation a medium pressure uv reactor 186 mj cm2 will be added to achieve both 4 log virus inactivation and 3 log giardia lamblia inactivation similar to the uv30 scenario chloramine will provide residual disinfection and the current operation of slow sand filters will remain the same only medium pressure uv was considered in the upgrade scenarios because all pilot testing data that have been utilized in this study are based upon medium pressure systems medium pressure systems also require a smaller number of lamps and footprint compared with low pressure uv additionally chloramination was only included in the two uv scenarios based upon the design of the pilot tests and the interest of the bws nevertheless it has to be noted that a continuation of chlorination is also sufficient in achieving dbp requirements under the two uv scenarios fig 2 provides a sketch of the treatment processes of the aforementioned four system upgrade scenarios 2 3 life cycle assessment methodology overview an environmental life cycle assessment lca and a life cycle cost assessment lcca was performed in this study to evaluate the environmental and economic tradeoffs among the four system upgrade scenarios in the bws the lca captures the marginal environmental costs and benefits given any modifications of the existing system two types of environmental influences were investigated in this study 1 embodied energy which indicates the direct and indirect energy consumption associated with the system modifications and 2 global warming potential which describes the carbon footprint associated with the embodied energy these two indicators are specifically chosen to understand the implications of system design and technology selection on the water energy nexus and climate change mo et al 2010 2011 similarly the lcca was performed to capture the marginal economic costs and benefits expressed in the form of net present value npv of the four system upgrade scenarios cost calculations were performed for 20 years using 2017 as a base year a discount rate of 6 was assumed cradle to gate system boundary was adopted where any changes made to the processes of water intake treatment storage and delivery was included in the analysis the manufacturing construction operation and maintenance of each system upgrade scenario were investigated all four system upgrade scenarios were designed to achieve 4 log removal and inactivation of viruses and 3 log removal and inactivation of giardia lamblia in the finished water the current lca was performed to support the decision making and design selection of the bws hence the life cycle inventory was compiled primarily based on data obtained from process based design calculations pilot scale experiments the ecoinvent 3 and us economic input output 2002 databases embedded in simapro 8 1 and previous pertinent literature bayer et al 2005 cecchetti et al 2014 simapro 8 1 was also used to classify and characterize all environmental flows the cumulative energy demand v1 09 method was used to estimate the embodied energy of the four scenarios and the ipcc 2013 gwp 100a v1 01 method was used to estimate the 100 year global warming potential particularly the electricity grid mix of epa egrid s new england subregion newe was utilized in this study epa 2016 detailed process based design calculations for the four scenarios are described in section 2 4 2 4 process based design of system upgrade scenarios the following sections details the design principles and primary parameters of each scenario more information regarding the component dimensions material and energy types quantities and their associated simapro data entries are provided in the supporting information under a spreadsheet file titled calculations all infrastructures are designed for the peak flow rate of 0 033 m3 s all baseline operational material and energy consumptions are designed for the average flow rate of 0 022 m3 s and an average inflow organic carbon concentration of 4 6 mg l no additional redundancies are considered in the baseline estimations 2 4 1 design of the gac scenario in the gac scenario the rf is designed as three side by side parallel vertical up flow filters each with three equal depth stacked gravel layers of different gravel sizes fig 3 a each rf is designed to handle one third of the peak flow 0 011 m3 s with a typical loading rate of 1 2 m hour 0 5 gpm ft2 hence the footprint of each rf is calculated to be 32 m2 l w 5 7 m 5 7 m all gravel materials reside in three concrete contactors these contactors are taller 2 m than the stacked gravel layers 1 2 m to leave space for water and maintenance life span of rf is assumed to be 30 years each of the original slow sand filters has a cross section of 6 1 m 35 4 m and a depth of 0 9 m a 15 2 cm gac layer will be inserted into these slow sand filters as shown in fig 3 b which involves a process of excavating around half sand from each filter spreading gac layer and refilling the filter the reason for choosing embedded gac layers instead of a standalone gac contactor is to minimize pressure drop and the need of additional pumping and construction the tradeoff however is that during the operation of the new gac filter this same process has to be performed repeatedly every time a gac layer is exhausted nevertheless this modification is expected to double the removal efficiency of the total organic carbon toc from 20 to around 35 40 any potential natural bio regeneration within the gac filters is neglected due to the large uncertainties associated with the amount of bio regeneration aktaş çeçen 2007 this will result in conservative estimations of toc removal efficiency and the life span of gac before it needs to be regenerated gac exhaustion rates were estimated based upon the freundlich equilibrium two isotherms were developed by a series of lab experiments under a room temperature of 20 c after shaking at 1500 rpm for 2 h raw water used in these experiments has an initial organic carbon concentration of 4 6 mg l and ph range of 7 00 7 69 each of the two isotherms corresponds to a distinct type of gac calgon f 400 and norit hd 3000 eq 1 although norit hd 3000 is used in the baseline calculation used gac is reactivated at a facility around about 804 km away from the treatment plant via a process of high temperature reactivation and off gas treatment a 10 weight loss of gac during the regeneration process was assumed whereas a typical range of the regeneration weight loss is around 5 15 bayer et al 2005 the sensitivity of results to the changes of carbon type and regeneration weight loss was tested 1 e r c o c e k f c o 1 n where er gac exhaustion rate g l c 0 influent organic carbon concentration mg l c e effluent organic carbon concentration mg l k f freundlich adsorption capacity parameter mg g 7 7 and 19 mg g for calgon f 400 and norit hd 3000 respectively and 1 n freundlich adsorption intensity parameter dimensionless 0 32 and 0 79 for calgon f 400 and norit hd 3000 respectively employment of gac could potentially reduce the chlorine demand due to its contribution to additional 15 20 toc reduction current chlorine dosages in the bws vary between 1 5 and 2 mg cl2 l in summer and between 2 2 and 3 5 mg cl2 l in winter a chlorine concentration of around 1 5 mg cl2 l leaving the clearwell is required to ensure the 0 2 mg cl2 l residual disinfectant requirement is met for all bws end users hence the amount of chlorine consumed as a primary disinfectant is around 0 2 mg cl2 l depending on seasonal and non seasonal factors that influence raw water quality reaction kinetics and chemical solubility accordingly the new chlorine demand is estimated to be around 1 5 3 2 mg cl2 l using eq 2 2 cd rd ad 0 1 ar where cd chlorine demand with the application of the new gac filters mg cl2 l rd chlorine demand for residual disinfection which is assumed to be a constant of 1 5 mg cl2 l ad 0 original use of chlorine for chlorine demanding substances 0 2 mg cl2 l and ar additional percentage of toc reduction that is provided by the new gac filters 15 20 2 4 2 design of the ozone scenario in the ozone scenario pre ozonation is designed to break down longer carbon chains into shorter ones to delay dbp formations and increase the biodegradability of the organic compounds for sdwss a typical ozone contact time is around 5 10 min collins et al 2003 langlais et al 1991 in this study a 5 min 300 s contact time at the peak flow rate of 0 033 m3 s is assumed the minimal overall ozone contactor volume under this condition is 300 s 0 033 m3 s 10 m3 to prevent excessive pressure drop two parallel cylindrical concrete ozone contactors each with a volume of 5 m3 are designed each contactor has a height of 5 4 m a diameter of 1 1 m and a life span of 30 years ozone dosage is a function of dissolved organic carbon doc in the raw water and it is typically designed to be at a 1 1 ratio to doc concentrations price 1994 we also assume that doc concentrations in the bws is approximately equal to the toc concentrations based upon the facility s historical data accordingly a design ozone dosage of 4 6 mg l is selected based on the bws raw water doc which is equivalent to a 546 g hour ozone generation rate at the peak flow rate individual ozone generator designs are specific to each manufacturer in this study the appropriate ozone generator design to meet the required ozone generation rate is selected based upon technical specs obtained from primozone the selected ozone generator has an l w d dimension of 1 2 m 0 73 m 0 42 m a weight of 250 kg and a full generation capacity of 600 g hour or 3 0 nm3 hour the electricity power demand of the selected design is 7 2 kw the generator is primarily made of stainless steel and aluminum with an assumed life span of 15 years three parallel rfs are designed following the preozonation process each with a design flow rate of 3 4 10 4 m3 s m2 0 5 gpm ft2 this will give a total rf footprint of around 97 m2 and the depth of the rfs are designed to be 2 m to allow sufficient contact time each rf will have a similar three layer design as described in fig 3 a additionally a thin gac layer 1 cm will be placed on top of the rfs to prevent ozone leakage no change is made to the slow sand filters chlorine will continue to be used for primary and residual disinfection previous studies have reported inconsistent conclusions regarding the effect of ozone on chlorine demand some reported that the use of ozone reduces chlorine demand price 1994 whereas others have reported no effect at all or only negligible effect has taken place jadas hecart et al 1991 prevost et al 1989 hence the influence of ozone on the chlorine demand is neglected in the current study 2 4 3 design of uv30 and uv186 scenarios uv 30 and uv186 scenarios adopt a similar uv reactor design which comprises a set of uv lamps each with its own protective quartz sleeve a stainless steel uv chamber a sleeve wiping system for cleaning a uv sensor that monitors uv output within the chamber and a control system for the entire uv system the required uv dose to achieve a certain log inactivation target varies based upon pathogen species a 4 log inactivation of cryptosporidium and giardia requires a minimum of 22 mj cm2 of uv while the same inactivation rate of viruses requires a minimum of 186 mj cm2 of uv usepa 2003 achievement of the required uv dose is heavily dependent on two factors the uv intensity μw cm2 and the exposure time s the former could be influenced by the equipment parameters e g lamp type and arrangement etc and water quality parameters e g uv transmittance total suspended solids etc whereas the latter is usually determined by the reactor design and the water flow rate in most uv systems these parameters are read by the system s computer and a programed dose monitoring algorithm continuously changes the lamp s power level to maintain a consistant validated dose over a certain range of operating conditions in this study the design of the uv system is informed by data obtained from a pilot scale study of the bws water together with the technical specs of uv systems provided by trojanuv the selected uv system has a cylindrical design with a chamber length of around 533 mm and a cross section diameter of around 558 mm the uv chamber is made of stainless steel and weigh around 68 kg with a maximum flow rate of 0 033 m3 s the lowest expected uv exposure time will be around 4 s each chamber allows installation of four uv lamps by default with a design uvt of 74 at 254 nm and a design maximum flow rate of 0 75 mgd the uv30 scenario requires a total of one chamber with four lamps to provide a uv dosage of 30 mj cm2 where each lamp has a power of 4 9 kw this design uvt corresponds to an estimated toc concentration of 4 6 mg l on the other hand the uv186 scenario requires a total of seven chambers and 28 uv lamps to satisfy the intended dosage of 186 mj cm2 each lamp requires a power of 12 9 kw energy consumptions other than operating the uv lamps is neglected in this study each uv lamp is assumed to have a service life of 5000 h roughly 0 57 years the uv chamber and the sleeve wiping system is assumed to have a life time of 25 years the monitoring and control system are assumed to have a life time of 10 years we also assume the quartz sleeves of the uv lamps need to be replaced every 3 years uv disinfection also influences the amount of hypochlorite needed as a primary disinfectant in the uv30 scenario hypochlorite is used as a secondary primary disinfectant following the uv disinfection to achieve 4 log removal of viruses the amount of hypochlorite needed at this step was estimated based upon the contact time ct table provided by the epa under an average temperature of 0 5 c and a ph range of 6 9 a ct value of 12 min mg l is required to achieve 4 log inactivation of viruses assuming a minimal contact time of 60 min a free chlorine concentration of 0 2 mg cl2 l needs to be added anhydrous ammonia is then added to form chloramine for residual disinfection given a lower disinfection efficiency of chloramine a minimal residual chlorine concentration of 1 0 mg cl2 l is required based on the cl2 n ratio of 5 1 to form chloramine the amount of hypochlorite needed for residual disinfection is 4 45 mg cl2 l and the amount of anhydrous ammonia needed is 0 89 mg n l in the uv186 scenario no additional primary disinfection is needed chloramine is added as the residual disinfectant to entirely prevent the formation of dbps 2 5 sensitivity analysis we tested the sensitivity of the four scenarios to the changes of water quality an average annual toc concentration of 1 5 mg l was assumed to be the highest possible water quality and an average annual toc concentration of 12 mg l was assumed to be the lowest based upon historical observations the following descriptions provide a summary of the sensitivity analysis and more details of the calculations can be found in the supporting information in the gac scenario water quality influences the breakthrough rates of the gac filters which would result in a change in the gac consumption and regeneration frequencies in the ozone scenario changes of water quality primarily affect the selection of the ozone contactors and the amount of liquid oxygen and electricity needed to operate these contactors we use the design parameters obtained from the primozone to select the most appropriate contactor models for each toc concentration liquid oxygen and electricity consumptions were estimated based upon the selected model s ozone generation capacity and electricity power for the uv30 and uv186 scenarios water quality will primarily influence the electric power needed to operate the uv lamps and no changes in the system design are assumed the uv system provided by trojanuv is programmed to adjust its power levels based upon measurements taken from the embedded sensors to allow system automation the system will record the influent water s uvt and flow and adjust power accordingly to maintain a consistant dose within a specified range of conditions the influent water quality of the uv system was assumed to have 20 toc removal relative to the raw water due to treatment from the upstream slow sand filters the resulting toc post filtration was assumed to primarily be in the form of dissolved organic carbon doc the resulting doc concentrations were converted to uv transmittance uvt values using a correlation curve derived from measured data obtained from a pilot uv system in the bws the uvt values were then used to estimate the required electricity inputs of the uv lamps based upon their measured correlations 3 results and discussion 3 1 life cycle comparison of the four scenarios fig 4 provides the embodied energy and carbon footprint of the four scenarios and the percent distribution of each system the uv186 scenario has the highest embodied energy consumption 2529 gj year among the four scenarios which is around 6 times of the lowest uv30 scenario 417 gj year the uv186 scenario also has the highest carbon footprint 163 mg co2e year which is around 7 times of the lowest gac scenario 21 2 mg co2e year this is primarily because of the large amount of electricity needed to achieve the 4 log inactivation of viruses through uv disinfection alone the other three scenarios have a relatively comparable embodied energy and carbon footprint the ozone scenario has the second highest embodied energy consumption 665 gj year and carbon footprint 43 7 mg co2e year while most of the four scenarios have comparable ratios between its embodied energy and carbon footprint a notable difference is observed in the gac scenario s relative significance in terms of embodied energy and carbon footprint this discrepancy is resulted from the different contributions of gac materials to the embodied energy and carbon footprint of the gac scenario gac in this study is assumed to be produced from hard coal through a process of wet grinding of coal mixing with binding agent creation of briquettes oxidation drying carbonization activation crushing sieving and packaging bayer et al 2005 during the initial activation process coal is partially gasified at temperatures between 800 and 1000 c resulting in around 60 of weight loss when gac is regenerated it is heated to a lower temperature of around 700 c to degrade the contaminants with a much smaller gac weight loss when coal is used for generating gac it is no longer available for producing energy hence this initial amount of coal is entirely counted towards embodied energy calculations however only a portion of the initial coal is converted into the gaseous form and subsequently counted towards carbon footprint the sensitivity of the results to the changes of regeneration weight loss and carbon type show that reducing the regeneration weight loss to 5 would result in 5 decrease in the gac scenario s embodied energy consumption 403 gj year and 14 decrease in its carbon footprint 18 3 mg co2e year in this case the gac scenario outperforms the uv30 scenario and becomes the best option both in terms of embodied energy and carbon footprint meanwhile when the regeneration weight loss is increased to 15 a 5 increase in embodied energy 449 gj year and a 14 increase in carbon footprint 24 1 mg co2e year was observed despite these increases the major trends among the scenarios do not change in this case on the other hand replacing the norit hd 3000 with calgon f 400 could result in 21 times increase in the embodied energy 9182 gj year and 17 times increase in the carbon footrprint 388 mg co2e year primary due to calgon s inefficiency in treating the type of water present at the bws under this condition the gac scenario would have the highest embodied energy and carbon footpint among all four scenarios highlighting the importance of selecting the most appropriate gac types to achieve improved sustainability this aligns with findings from igos et al 2013 2014 that lca results are highly sensitive to the changes of gac consumptions in terms of the percent contribution of the different components electricity is the dominant energy and carbon contributor in all scenarios except for the gac scenario supplying the gac material has the largest contribution to the embodied energy and carbon footprint of the gac scenario other significant contributors to the embodied energy and carbon footprint of the gac scenario include gac transportation and extraction and refill 10 combined in the ozone scenario liquid oxygen supply is the second largest contributor following electricity representing around 20 of the total embodied energy and 25 of the carbon footprint in the uv30 scenario disinfectant supply chlorine and anhydrous ammonia is the second largest contributor representing around 15 of the embodied energy and carbon footprint for the uv186 scneario other contributors are almost negligible 3 2 life cycle cost comparison of the four scenarios fig 5 shows the life cycle cost comparison of the four scenarios the uv186 scenario has the highest npv followed by the ozone gac and uv30 scenarios sequentially over a 20 year lifespan the uv186 scenario has an estimated npv of 1 67 million us dollars usd which equals to more than half of the annual municipal budget of bethelehem nhes 2018 it is also 6 7 times of the lowest uv30 scenario 248 875 the ozone and gac scenarios have a npv of approximately 1 54 million and 0 46 milion which is around 6 2 and 1 8 times of the uv30 scenario respectively the ranking of the four scenarios follows a similar order as the rankings for embodied energy and carbon footprint the uv186 scenario is apparently the worst option in both environmental and economic terms both uv30 and gac are comparably good scenarios whereas the uv30 scenario is slightly better in terms of embodied energy and cost and the gac scenario is better in terms of carbon footprint while there is inherent uncertainty of the lca calculations our results highlight an important potential tradeoff between carbon footprint and economic cost in decision making in the case of bws the cost for reducing 1 kg of co2e by selecting the gac scenario instead of the uv30 scenario is 0 03 usd for the uv186 scenario initial infrastructure 38 replacement materials 38 and electricity 23 are the dominant contributors to the life cycle cost whereas additional chemical requirements have a negligible economic impact 1 the initial infrastructure of the uv system itself is expensive due to the number of units required 7 units to achieve 4 log viruses inactivation and 3 log giardia lamblia inactivation replacement of lamps have a high contribution to the cost of uv186 because of the high frequency of replacement required 1 per year for a 5000 h lamp assumed to run 24 h per day nevertheless both initial infrastructure and replacement materials have negligible contributions 0 2 to the embodied energy and carbon footprint of this scenario electricity cost comes from continuous operation of the medium pressure uv lamps over the 20 year lifespan while its contribution to economic cost is relatively moderate electricity is of high significance in terms of embodied energy and carbon footprint 97 the ozone scenario has the 2nd highest life cycle cost primarily due to its chemical 67 and initial infrastructure requirements 27 the percent contribution of liquid oxygen to cost is much higher than its contribution to embodied energy 22 and carbon footprint 23 this is resulted from the large quantity of liquid oxygen required during preozonation combined with a high unit cost of liquid oxygen similarly initial infrastructure has a much larger contribution to cost than to embodied energy and carbon footprint 0 6 the gac scenario has the 3rd highest life cycle cost primary contributors include the initial 34 and the replacement of filter materials 62 the initial filter material is expensive due to the high unit cost of virgin activated carbon 5 10 kg on average khera et al 2013 whereas the unit cost of reactivated carbon is approximately half of the cost of virgin activated carbon bayer et al 2005 the frequency of off site reactivation of carbon occurs every 2 years leading to a large quantity and hence a high cost for carbon reactivation over the 20 year lifespan for this scenario the additional infrastructure electricity and chemical requirements are low 5 in fact chlorine usage decreases slightly compared to baseline conditions due to enhanced nom removal during the filtration step lastly the uv30 scenario is the least costly scenario highlighting a smallest economic impact for small systems facing dbp problems similar to the uv186 scenario infrastructure 36 replacement materials 37 and electricity 22 are the primary contributors to life cycle costs but the cost of each is much lower this is because fewer uv reactors 1 unit and lamps 8 lamps as well as a much lower uv intensity is required when combining uv30 with chlorine to achieve the required 4 log inactivation of viruses and 3 log inactivation of giardia lamblia chemicals under the uv30 scenario have a relative contribution of 5 which is higher than the relative contribution of chemicals 1 for the uv186 scenario this increase in relative chemical contribution occurs because a higher dosage of chlorine is needed for both secondary and residual disinfections after the uv treatment the uv30 scenario highlights synergistic benefits by reducing environmental and economic impact over the life of a system simultaneously while relatively similar ranking of the four scenarios was observed when comparing the economic outcomes with the environmental outcomes our results have shown that major differences exist in terms of the dominant cost embodied energy and carbon footprint contributors of the four scenarios particularly the initial infrastructure represents a much more significant component in terms of cost than in embodied energy and carbon footprint this indicates an interesting tradeoff between the operation and constructions phases in decision making construction or infrastructure often causes a significant financial burden but it is relatively insignificant in terms of environmental impacts on the other hand operation of the systems often presents high environmental impacts but they could be neglected due to their relatively insignificant immediate or long term financial concerns this demonstrates the importance of considering both environmental and economic aspects in sustainability assessments to achieve an optimized solution to the existing problems 3 3 sensitivity of results to water quality changes raw water quality was found to have varied influence on the embodied energy carbon footprint and economic cost of the four scenarios under investigation fig 6 under a high water quality of 1 5 mg of toc l the ozone scenario presents the lowest embodied energy followed by the gac scenario and the uv30 scenario whereas the uv186 scenario still presents the highest embodied energy the ozone scenario also exhibits the largest percent reduction of embodied energy which is mainly from the reductions of electricity and liquid oxygen needed by shifting to a lower capacity ozone generator reductions of the embodied energy from the uv30 and uv186 scenarios are mainly due to a decrease of electricity consumption under a higher uvt however the percent reduction of these two scenarios are relatively low 20 23 compared with 35 60 of change the gac scenario on the other hand reduces embodied energy mainly because of a longer service life of gac and hence lower annual consumption and replacement rates carbon footprint of the gac scenario is still the lowest under a higher water quality which is closely followed by the ozone and uv30 scenarios and then to a lesser extent the uv186 scenario similar to the embodied energy the ozone scenario has the highest percent change in terms of carbon footprint while the uv30 and uv186 scenarios have the lowest in terms of the economic cost the uv30 sceanrio has the lowest npv followed by the gac ozone and uv186 scenarios subsequently the gac scenario has the highest percent of change of npv while the ozone scenarios have the lowest this is because of the decrease of gac consumptions under a higher water quality as well as the nonlinearity of unit liquid oxygen price based upon quantity purchased overall the relatively small percent reductions of the uv30 and uv186 scenarios under a higher water quality is resulted from two non linearities one that is between the toc and the uvt and one that is between the uvt and the operational electricity consumptions with all three metrics considered while the uv186 remains the worst under high water quality the gac scenario becomes the best option in terms of reducing environmental impacts and the uv30 scenario remains the most economic option under a low water quality of 12 mg of toc l the ozone and uv scenarios have comparable yet the lowest embodied energy while the uv186 scenario presents the highest the gac scenario exhibits the most significant percent increase of the embodied energy 1430 making it almost comparable to the uv186 scenario this is mainly resulted from a sharp decrease of gac s efficiency under an extremely high toc concentration the ozone scenario has the lowest percent increase of the embodied energy 56 which is mainly because of an increased electricity and liquid oxygen use efficiency resulting from shifting to a higher capacity ozone generator the carbon footprint of the four scenarios follow an order of uv30 ozone gac and uv186 from the lowest to the highest similar to the embodied energy the gac scenario has the largest percent increase of carbon footprint 1214 while the ozone scenario has the lowest 128 in terms of the economic cost the uv30 scenario remains the best followed by the gac ozone and uv186 scenarios nevertheless the gac scenario presents the highest percent increase in terms of npv 147 followed by ozone uv186 and uv30 scenarios overall uv30 becomes the best scenario under low water quality across all three metrics while the uv186 scenatio remains the worst 4 conclusions and implications four upgrade scenarios to solve the dbp issue of an existing small drinking water system utilizing simple slow sand filtration and disinfection were designed and compared from an economic and environmental life cycle perspective under an averaged raw water toc of 4 6 mg l we found that the uv30 scenario presents the lowest embodied energy and life cycle cost while the gac scenario presents the lowest carbon footprint the uv186 scenario always has the highest environmental and economic impacts a small environmental and economic tradeoff exist when selecting the uv30 or gac scenario as the final solution to the dbp issue essentially a cost of 0 03 usd has to be paid in order to reduce 1 kg of co2e of carbon footprint in case of a carbon market this additional cost of selecting the less carbon intensive gac scenario might be compensated through carbon emission trading the major contributors of the life cycle costs and environmental impacts in the individual scenarios also differ energy and or material consumptions during the operation phase dominate the environmental impacts of the four scenarios while the infrastructure investments have a noticeable contribution to the economic costs this discrepancy highlights the importance of assessing the multiple aspects of sustainability and considering the systems entire life cycle to achieve a global optimum changes of the carbon type in the gac scenario could greatly change its performance potentially making it the worst scenario as the gac breakthrough rate changes change of water quality could potentially alter the ranking of the four scenarios for instance under a higher water quality of 1 5 mg of toc l the ozone scenario could have least embodied energy required among the four scenarios while under a lower water quality of 12 mg of toc l the overall competitiveness of the gac scenario is greatly reduced many non linearities exist in the system design which contributes to the changes of scenario rankings this shows the importance of a comprehensive model that captures these non linearities to inform decision making beyond the three metrics that have been investigated in this study future studies should consider other operational and human factors present which may also influence the decision on adopting certain scenarios for instance application of the ozone scenario will require an upgrade of the water utility operator s license potentially resulting in higher cost furthermore use of liquid oxygen to produce ozone could also increase the complexity of the treatment process and operation which might lead to a higher demand of staff time the increased complexity might be perceived as inconvenient and hence becomes a hurdle to its adoption application of the gac scenario on the other hand may add to the complexity of operation by removing the gac for offsite regeneration and then adding virgin or regenerated gac back into the slow sand filter meanwhile the excavation and refillment of the filters could potentially interrupt the operation and disturb the biological activity of the slow sand filter these social and operational factors require further investigation to identify the barriers to certain solutions and help guide the design of future technological solutions future studies could also consider additional upgrade scenarios that have been excluded from this study due to data limitations 1 replacement of old ductile iron water mains and minimization of system dead ends 2 use of multiple chlorination locations throughout the distribution

19421,many of the small drinking water systems in the us that utilize simple filtration and chlorine disinfection or chlorine disinfection alone are facing disinfection byproduct dbp noncompliance issues which need immediate upgrades in this study four potential upgrade scenarios namely the gac ozone uv30 and uv186 scenarios were designed for a typical small drinking water systems and compared in terms of embodied energy carbon footprint and life cycle cost these scenarios are designed to either reduce the amount of dbp precursors using granular activated carbon filtration the gac scenario or ozonation the ozone scenario or replace the chlorine disinfection with the uv disinfection at different intensities followed by chloramination the uv30 and uv186 scenarios the uv30 scenario was found to have the lowest embodied energy 417 gj year and life cycle cost 0 25 million us dollars while the gac scenario has the lowest carbon footprint 21 mg co2e year the uv186 scenario consistently presents the highest environmental and economic impacts the major contributors of the economic and environmental impacts of individual scenarios also differ energy and or material consumptions during the operation phase dominate the environmental impacts of the four scenarios while the infrastructure investments have a noticeable contribution to the economic costs the results are sensitive to changes in water quality an increase of raw water quality i e an increase in organic precursor content could potentially result in the ozone scenario being the least energy intensive scenario while a decrease of water quality could greatly reduce the overall competitiveness of the gac scenario graphical abstract image 1 keywords small drinking water systems disinfection byproduct granular

greenhouse gas ghg emissions annually pabi et al 2013 usepa 2013 of all drinking water systems sdwss typically present the highest volumetric energy intensities and carbon footprints primarily due to their lack of the economies of scale sowby and burian 2017 additional demand of energy often comes from the supply of chemicals and services in the sdwss it is not uncommon that indirect energy consumption and its associated carbon footprints could exceed the direct ones mo et al 2011 2016 on the other hand achieving the 2 degrees celsius limit of warming in the 21st century entails reducing the global anthropogenic ghg emissions by 40 70 by 2050 compared to 2010 and emission levels near zero or below in 2100 pachauri et al 2014 hence it is imperative for sdwss to consider the potential minimization of ghg emissions in the planning and design of system upgrades collectively understandings of the environmental and financial aspects unique to the sdwss are essential in protecting human

aims to provide an enhanced understanding on the environmental and socioeconomic tradeoffs of the sdwss technological selections in meeting the desired water quality requirements 2 methodology 2 1 study background the bethlehem water system bws is a typical small scale surface water supply system located in northern new hampshire with a treatment capacity of 0 033 m3 s 0 75 mgd and a service population of around 1700 water is treated via slow sand filtration and chlorine disinfection and then stored in a one million gallon cast in place concrete clearwell reservoir for an average residence time of two days before entering the distribution system fig 1 the total organic carbon toc of the raw water at the bws typically ranges around 1 5 12 mg l with an annual average of around 4 6 mg l this water has a high specific uv absorbance suva value indicating a large composition of high molecular weight unsaturated aromatic carbon in the toc weishaar et al 2003 which contributes to fast formation of dbps in the case of bws dbps could quickly exceed the regulated level within 3 h after contact with chlorine for both trihalomethanes tthm minimum contaminant level mcl 80 μg l and haloacetic acids haa5 mcl 60 μg l which is much shorter than the water residence time of most end users removal of toc by the slow sand filtration however is typically limited to 10 20 furthermore a relatively high dose of chlorine is needed to achieve the swtr lt1eswtr and lt2eswtr s requirements of the 4 log inactivation of viruses and 3 log inactivation of giardia lamblia collectively the limited toc removal high chlorine dosages long residence times and fast dbp formation characteristics have resulted in the bws frequent non compliances with the dbpr according to a 2014 survey of water system violations at least 590 systems around the nation are in violation of the stage 1 dbpr and a majority of these systems are sdwss relying on surface water as the primary source oxenford and barrett 2016 2 2 system upgrade scenarios the dbps at the sdwss can be controlled via three main strategies 1 enhanced removal of dbp precursors 2 modifying disinfection practices and 3 removal of dbps after formation wrf 2013 in the current study the first two dbp control strategies were investigated in designing alternative system upgrade scenarios considering the technical and socioeconomic constraints of the sdwss four system upgrade scenarios were developed which are intended to achieve the required dbp reduction either through increasing dbp precursor removal gac and ozone scenarios or minimizing dbp formation uv30 and uv186 scenarios gac scenario enhance the removal of natural organic matters noms in the raw water by adding granular activated carbon gac filtration to the current slow sand filtration furthermore a gravel roughing filter rf is installed as a pretreatment for water entering the gac filters e g removal of leaves and algae to improve their performances continue to use chlorination as a sole disinfection method but with reduced dosages ozone scenario change the characteristics of raw water noms by preozonation to enhance dbp precursor removals by the slow sand filter and to delay and minimize the formation of dbps within the residence time of the bws an ozone generator and contactor will be installed to break down the high molecular weight noms into low molecular weight simple organic carbons before entering the slow sand filters and the disinfection contactor additionally a rf is installed between ozonator and slow sand filters to prevent rapid head loss development in slow sand filters continue to use chlorination as a sole disinfection method uv30 scenario minimize dbp formation by modifying the current disinfection approach a combination of medium pressure uv disinfection 30 mj cm2 and chlorine disinfection is used to achieve the required 4 log inactivation of viruses and 3 log inactivation of giardia lamblia chloramine is used to for residual disinfection which is achieved by adding anhydrous ammonia to hypochlorite no changes will be made to the current operation of the slow sand filters uv186 scenario modify the current disinfection approach to achieve the least possible dbp formation a medium pressure uv reactor 186 mj cm2 will be added to achieve both 4 log virus inactivation and 3 log giardia lamblia inactivation similar to the uv30 scenario chloramine will provide residual disinfection and the current operation of slow sand filters will remain the same only medium pressure uv was considered in the upgrade scenarios because all pilot testing data that have been utilized in this study are based upon medium pressure systems medium pressure systems also require a smaller number of lamps and footprint compared with low pressure uv additionally chloramination was only included in the two uv scenarios based upon the design of the pilot tests and the interest of the bws nevertheless it has to be noted that a continuation of chlorination is also sufficient in achieving dbp requirements under the two uv scenarios fig 2 provides a sketch of the treatment processes of the aforementioned four system upgrade scenarios 2 3 life cycle assessment methodology overview an environmental life cycle assessment lca and a life cycle cost assessment lcca was performed in this study to evaluate the environmental and economic tradeoffs among the four system upgrade scenarios in the bws the lca captures the marginal environmental costs and benefits given any modifications of the existing system two types of environmental influences were investigated in this study 1 embodied energy which indicates the direct and indirect energy consumption associated with the system modifications and 2 global warming potential which describes the carbon footprint associated with the embodied energy these two indicators are specifically chosen to understand the implications of system design and technology selection on the water energy nexus and climate change mo et al 2010 2011 similarly the lcca was performed to capture the marginal economic costs and benefits expressed in the form of net present value npv of the four system upgrade scenarios cost calculations were performed for 20 years using 2017 as a base year a discount rate of 6 was assumed cradle to gate system boundary was adopted where any changes made to the processes of water intake treatment storage and delivery was included in the analysis the manufacturing construction operation and maintenance of each system upgrade scenario were investigated all four system upgrade scenarios were designed to achieve 4 log removal and inactivation of viruses and 3 log removal and inactivation of giardia lamblia in the finished water the current lca was performed to support the decision making and design selection of the bws hence the life cycle inventory was compiled primarily based on data obtained from process based design calculations pilot scale experiments the ecoinvent 3 and us economic input output 2002 databases embedded in simapro 8 1 and previous pertinent literature bayer et al 2005 cecchetti et al 2014 simapro 8 1 was also used to classify and characterize all environmental flows the cumulative energy demand v1 09 method was used to estimate the embodied energy of the four scenarios and the ipcc 2013 gwp 100a v1 01 method was used to estimate the 100 year global warming potential particularly the electricity grid mix of epa egrid s new england subregion newe was utilized in this study epa 2016 detailed process based design calculations for the four scenarios are described in section 2 4 2 4 process based design of system upgrade scenarios the following sections details the design principles and primary parameters of each scenario more information regarding the component dimensions material and energy types quantities and their associated simapro data entries are provided in the supporting information under a spreadsheet file titled calculations all infrastructures are designed for the peak flow rate of 0 033 m3 s all baseline operational material and energy consumptions are designed for the average flow rate of 0 022 m3 s and an average inflow organic carbon concentration of 4 6 mg l no additional redundancies are considered in the baseline estimations 2 4 1 design of the gac scenario in the gac scenario the rf is designed as three side by side parallel vertical up flow filters each with three equal depth stacked gravel layers of different gravel sizes fig 3 a each rf is designed to handle one third of the peak flow 0 011 m3 s with a typical loading rate of 1 2 m hour 0 5 gpm ft2 hence the footprint of each rf is calculated to be 32 m2 l w 5 7 m 5 7 m all gravel materials reside in three concrete contactors these contactors are taller 2 m than the stacked gravel layers 1 2 m to leave space for water and maintenance life span of rf is assumed to be 30 years each of the original slow sand filters has a cross section of 6 1 m 35 4 m and a depth of 0 9 m a 15 2 cm gac layer will be inserted into these slow sand filters as shown in fig 3 b which involves a process of excavating around half sand from each filter spreading gac layer and refilling the filter the reason for choosing embedded gac layers instead of a standalone gac contactor is to minimize pressure drop and the need of additional pumping and construction the tradeoff however is that during the operation of the new gac filter this same process has to be performed repeatedly every time a gac layer is exhausted nevertheless this modification is expected to double the removal efficiency of the total organic carbon toc from 20 to around 35 40 any potential natural bio regeneration within the gac filters is neglected due to the large uncertainties associated with the amount of bio regeneration aktaş çeçen 2007 this will result in conservative estimations of toc removal efficiency and the life span of gac before it needs to be regenerated gac exhaustion rates were estimated based upon the freundlich equilibrium two isotherms were developed by a series of lab experiments under a room temperature of 20 c after shaking at 1500 rpm for 2 h raw water used in these experiments has an initial organic carbon concentration of 4 6 mg l and ph range of 7 00 7 69 each of the two isotherms corresponds to a distinct type of gac calgon f 400 and norit hd 3000 eq 1 although norit hd 3000 is used in the baseline calculation used gac is reactivated at a facility around about 804 km away from the treatment plant via a process of high temperature reactivation and off gas treatment a 10 weight loss of gac during the regeneration process was assumed whereas a typical range of the regeneration weight loss is around 5 15 bayer et al 2005 the sensitivity of results to the changes of carbon type and regeneration weight loss was tested 1 e r c o c e k f c o 1 n where er gac exhaustion rate g l c 0 influent organic carbon concentration mg l c e effluent organic carbon concentration mg l k f freundlich adsorption capacity parameter mg g 7 7 and 19 mg g for calgon f 400 and norit hd 3000 respectively and 1 n freundlich adsorption intensity parameter dimensionless 0 32 and 0 79 for calgon f 400 and norit hd 3000 respectively employment of gac could potentially reduce the chlorine demand due to its contribution to additional 15 20 toc reduction current chlorine dosages in the bws vary between 1 5 and 2 mg cl2 l in summer and between 2 2 and 3 5 mg cl2 l in winter a chlorine concentration of around 1 5 mg cl2 l leaving the clearwell is required to ensure the 0 2 mg cl2 l residual disinfectant requirement is met for all bws end users hence the amount of chlorine consumed as a primary disinfectant is around 0 2 mg cl2 l depending on seasonal and non seasonal factors that influence raw water quality reaction kinetics and chemical solubility accordingly the new chlorine demand is estimated to be around 1 5 3 2 mg cl2 l using eq 2 2 cd rd ad 0 1 ar where cd chlorine demand with the application of the new gac filters mg cl2 l rd chlorine demand for residual disinfection which is assumed to be a constant of 1 5 mg cl2 l ad 0 original use of chlorine for chlorine demanding substances 0 2 mg cl2 l and ar additional percentage of toc reduction that is provided by the new gac filters 15 20 2 4 2 design of the ozone scenario in the ozone scenario pre ozonation is designed to break down longer carbon chains into shorter ones to delay dbp formations and increase the biodegradability of the organic compounds for sdwss a typical ozone contact time is around 5 10 min collins et al 2003 langlais et al 1991 in this study a 5 min 300 s contact time at the peak flow rate of 0 033 m3 s is assumed the minimal overall ozone contactor volume under this condition is 300 s 0 033 m3 s 10 m3 to prevent excessive pressure drop two parallel cylindrical concrete ozone contactors each with a volume of 5 m3 are designed each contactor has a height of 5 4 m a diameter of 1 1 m and a life span of 30 years ozone dosage is a function of dissolved organic carbon doc in the raw water and it is typically designed to be at a 1 1 ratio to doc concentrations price 1994 we also assume that doc concentrations in the bws is approximately equal to the toc concentrations based upon the facility s historical data accordingly a design ozone dosage of 4 6 mg l is selected based on the bws raw water doc which is equivalent to a 546 g hour ozone generation rate at the peak flow rate individual ozone generator designs are specific to each manufacturer in this study the appropriate ozone generator design to meet the required ozone generation rate is selected based upon technical specs obtained from primozone the selected ozone generator has an l w d dimension of 1 2 m 0 73 m 0 42 m a weight of 250 kg and a full generation capacity of 600 g hour or 3 0 nm3 hour the electricity power demand of the selected design is 7 2 kw the generator is primarily made of stainless steel and aluminum with an assumed life span of 15 years three parallel rfs are designed following the preozonation process each with a design flow rate of 3 4 10 4 m3 s m2 0 5 gpm ft2 this will give a total rf footprint of around 97 m2 and the depth of the rfs are designed to be 2 m to allow sufficient contact time each rf will have a similar three layer design as described in fig 3 a additionally a thin gac layer 1 cm will be placed on top of the rfs to prevent ozone leakage no change is made to the slow sand filters chlorine will continue to be used for primary and residual disinfection previous studies have reported inconsistent conclusions regarding the effect of ozone on chlorine demand some reported that the use of ozone reduces chlorine demand price 1994 whereas others have reported no effect at all or only negligible effect has taken place jadas hecart et al 1991 prevost et al 1989 hence the influence of ozone on the chlorine demand is neglected in the current study 2 4 3 design of uv30 and uv186 scenarios uv 30 and uv186 scenarios adopt a similar uv reactor design which comprises a set of uv lamps each with its own protective quartz sleeve a stainless steel uv chamber a sleeve wiping system for cleaning a uv sensor that monitors uv output within the chamber and a control system for the entire uv system the required uv dose to achieve a certain log inactivation target varies based upon pathogen species a 4 log inactivation of cryptosporidium and giardia requires a minimum of 22 mj cm2 of uv while the same inactivation rate of viruses requires a minimum of 186 mj cm2 of uv usepa 2003 achievement of the required uv dose is heavily dependent on two factors the uv intensity μw cm2 and the exposure time s the former could be influenced by the equipment parameters e g lamp type and arrangement etc and water quality parameters e g uv transmittance total suspended solids etc whereas the latter is usually determined by the reactor design and the water flow rate in most uv systems these parameters are read by the system s computer and a programed dose monitoring algorithm continuously changes the lamp s power level to maintain a consistant validated dose over a certain range of operating conditions in this study the design of the uv system is informed by data obtained from a pilot scale study of the bws water together with the technical specs of uv systems provided by trojanuv the selected uv system has a cylindrical design with a chamber length of around 533 mm and a cross section diameter of around 558 mm the uv chamber is made of stainless steel and weigh around 68 kg with a maximum flow rate of 0 033 m3 s the lowest expected uv exposure time will be around 4 s each chamber allows installation of four uv lamps by default with a design uvt of 74 at 254 nm and a design maximum flow rate of 0 75 mgd the uv30 scenario requires a total of one chamber with four lamps to provide a uv dosage of 30 mj cm2 where each lamp has a power of 4 9 kw this design uvt corresponds to an estimated toc concentration of 4 6 mg l on the other hand the uv186 scenario requires a total of seven chambers and 28 uv lamps to satisfy the intended dosage of 186 mj cm2 each lamp requires a power of 12 9 kw energy consumptions other than operating the uv lamps is neglected in this study each uv lamp is assumed to have a service life of 5000 h roughly 0 57 years the uv chamber and the sleeve wiping system is assumed to have a life time of 25 years the monitoring and control system are assumed to have a life time of 10 years we also assume the quartz sleeves of the uv lamps need to be replaced every 3 years uv disinfection also influences the amount of hypochlorite needed as a primary disinfectant in the uv30 scenario hypochlorite is used as a secondary primary disinfectant following the uv disinfection to achieve 4 log removal of viruses the amount of hypochlorite needed at this step was estimated based upon the contact time ct table provided by the epa under an average temperature of 0 5 c and a ph range of 6 9 a ct value of 12 min mg l is required to achieve 4 log inactivation of viruses assuming a minimal contact time of 60 min a free chlorine concentration of 0 2 mg cl2 l needs to be added anhydrous ammonia is then added to form chloramine for residual disinfection given a lower disinfection efficiency of chloramine a minimal residual chlorine concentration of 1 0 mg cl2 l is required based on the cl2 n ratio of 5 1 to form chloramine the amount of hypochlorite needed for residual disinfection is 4 45 mg cl2 l and the amount of anhydrous ammonia needed is 0 89 mg n l in the uv186 scenario no additional primary disinfection is needed chloramine is added as the residual disinfectant to entirely prevent the formation of dbps 2 5 sensitivity analysis we tested the sensitivity of the four scenarios to the changes of water quality an average annual toc concentration of 1 5 mg l was assumed to be the highest possible water quality and an average annual toc concentration of 12 mg l was assumed to be the lowest based upon historical observations the following descriptions provide a summary of the sensitivity analysis and more details of the calculations can be found in the supporting information in the gac scenario water quality influences the breakthrough rates of the gac filters which would result in a change in the gac consumption and regeneration frequencies in the ozone scenario changes of water quality primarily affect the selection of the ozone contactors and the amount of liquid oxygen and electricity needed to operate these contactors we use the design parameters obtained from the primozone to select the most appropriate contactor models for each toc concentration liquid oxygen and electricity consumptions were estimated based upon the selected model s ozone generation capacity and electricity power for the uv30 and uv186 scenarios water quality will primarily influence the electric power needed to operate the uv lamps and no changes in the system design are assumed the uv system provided by trojanuv is programmed to adjust its power levels based upon measurements taken from the embedded sensors to allow system automation the system will record the influent water s uvt and flow and adjust power accordingly to maintain a consistant dose within a specified range of conditions the influent water quality of the uv system was assumed to have 20 toc removal relative to the raw water due to treatment from the upstream slow sand filters the resulting toc post filtration was assumed to primarily be in the form of dissolved organic carbon doc the resulting doc concentrations were converted to uv transmittance uvt values using a correlation curve derived from measured data obtained from a pilot uv system in the bws the uvt values were then used to estimate the required electricity inputs of the uv lamps based upon their measured correlations 3 results and discussion 3 1 life cycle comparison of the four scenarios fig 4 provides the embodied energy and carbon footprint of the four scenarios and the percent distribution of each system the uv186 scenario has the highest embodied energy consumption 2529 gj year among the four scenarios which is around 6 times of the lowest uv30 scenario 417 gj year the uv186 scenario also has the highest carbon footprint 163 mg co2e year which is around 7 times of the lowest gac scenario 21 2 mg co2e year this is primarily because of the large amount of electricity needed to achieve the 4 log inactivation of viruses through uv disinfection alone the other three scenarios have a relatively comparable embodied energy and carbon footprint the ozone scenario has the second highest embodied energy consumption 665 gj year and carbon footprint 43 7 mg co2e year while most of the four scenarios have comparable ratios between its embodied energy and carbon footprint a notable difference is observed in the gac scenario s relative significance in terms of embodied energy and carbon footprint this discrepancy is resulted from the different contributions of gac materials to the embodied energy and carbon footprint of the gac scenario gac in this study is assumed to be produced from hard coal through a process of wet grinding of coal mixing with binding agent creation of briquettes oxidation drying carbonization activation crushing sieving and packaging bayer et al 2005 during the initial activation process coal is partially gasified at temperatures between 800 and 1000 c resulting in around 60 of weight loss when gac is regenerated it is heated to a lower temperature of around 700 c to degrade the contaminants with a much smaller gac weight loss when coal is used for generating gac it is no longer available for producing energy hence this initial amount of coal is entirely counted towards embodied energy calculations however only a portion of the initial coal is converted into the gaseous form and subsequently counted towards carbon footprint the sensitivity of the results to the changes of regeneration weight loss and carbon type show that reducing the regeneration weight loss to 5 would result in 5 decrease in the gac scenario s embodied energy consumption 403 gj year and 14 decrease in its carbon footprint 18 3 mg co2e year in this case the gac scenario outperforms the uv30 scenario and becomes the best option both in terms of embodied energy and carbon footprint meanwhile when the regeneration weight loss is increased to 15 a 5 increase in embodied energy 449 gj year and a 14 increase in carbon footprint 24 1 mg co2e year was observed despite these increases the major trends among the scenarios do not change in this case on the other hand replacing the norit hd 3000 with calgon f 400 could result in 21 times increase in the embodied energy 9182 gj year and 17 times increase in the carbon footrprint 388 mg co2e year primary due to calgon s inefficiency in treating the type of water present at the bws under this condition the gac scenario would have the highest embodied energy and carbon footpint among all four scenarios highlighting the importance of selecting the most appropriate gac types to achieve improved sustainability this aligns with findings from igos et al 2013 2014 that lca results are highly sensitive to the changes of gac consumptions in terms of the percent contribution of the different components electricity is the dominant energy and carbon contributor in all scenarios except for the gac scenario supplying the gac material has the largest contribution to the embodied energy and carbon footprint of the gac scenario other significant contributors to the embodied energy and carbon footprint of the gac scenario include gac transportation and extraction and refill 10 combined in the ozone scenario liquid oxygen supply is the second largest contributor following electricity representing around 20 of the total embodied energy and 25 of the carbon footprint in the uv30 scenario disinfectant supply chlorine and anhydrous ammonia is the second largest contributor representing around 15 of the embodied energy and carbon footprint for the uv186 scneario other contributors are almost negligible 3 2 life cycle cost comparison of the four scenarios fig 5 shows the life cycle cost comparison of the four scenarios the uv186 scenario has the highest npv followed by the ozone gac and uv30 scenarios sequentially over a 20 year lifespan the uv186 scenario has an estimated npv of 1 67 million us dollars usd which equals to more than half of the annual municipal budget of bethelehem nhes 2018 it is also 6 7 times of the lowest uv30 scenario 248 875 the ozone and gac scenarios have a npv of approximately 1 54 million and 0 46 milion which is around 6 2 and 1 8 times of the uv30 scenario respectively the ranking of the four scenarios follows a similar order as the rankings for embodied energy and carbon footprint the uv186 scenario is apparently the worst option in both environmental and economic terms both uv30 and gac are comparably good scenarios whereas the uv30 scenario is slightly better in terms of embodied energy and cost and the gac scenario is better in terms of carbon footprint while there is inherent uncertainty of the lca calculations our results highlight an important potential tradeoff between carbon footprint and economic cost in decision making in the case of bws the cost for reducing 1 kg of co2e by selecting the gac scenario instead of the uv30 scenario is 0 03 usd for the uv186 scenario initial infrastructure 38 replacement materials 38 and electricity 23 are the dominant contributors to the life cycle cost whereas additional chemical requirements have a negligible economic impact 1 the initial infrastructure of the uv system itself is expensive due to the number of units required 7 units to achieve 4 log viruses inactivation and 3 log giardia lamblia inactivation replacement of lamps have a high contribution to the cost of uv186 because of the high frequency of replacement required 1 per year for a 5000 h lamp assumed to run 24 h per day nevertheless both initial infrastructure and replacement materials have negligible contributions 0 2 to the embodied energy and carbon footprint of this scenario electricity cost comes from continuous operation of the medium pressure uv lamps over the 20 year lifespan while its contribution to economic cost is relatively moderate electricity is of high significance in terms of embodied energy and carbon footprint 97 the ozone scenario has the 2nd highest life cycle cost primarily due to its chemical 67 and initial infrastructure requirements 27 the percent contribution of liquid oxygen to cost is much higher than its contribution to embodied energy 22 and carbon footprint 23 this is resulted from the large quantity of liquid oxygen required during preozonation combined with a high unit cost of liquid oxygen similarly initial infrastructure has a much larger contribution to cost than to embodied energy and carbon footprint 0 6 the gac scenario has the 3rd highest life cycle cost primary contributors include the initial 34 and the replacement of filter materials 62 the initial filter material is expensive due to the high unit cost of virgin activated carbon 5 10 kg on average khera et al 2013 whereas the unit cost of reactivated carbon is approximately half of the cost of virgin activated carbon bayer et al 2005 the frequency of off site reactivation of carbon occurs every 2 years leading to a large quantity and hence a high cost for carbon reactivation over the 20 year lifespan for this scenario the additional infrastructure electricity and chemical requirements are low 5 in fact chlorine usage decreases slightly compared to baseline conditions due to enhanced nom removal during the filtration step lastly the uv30 scenario is the least costly scenario highlighting a smallest economic impact for small systems facing dbp problems similar to the uv186 scenario infrastructure 36 replacement materials 37 and electricity 22 are the primary contributors to life cycle costs but the cost of each is much lower this is because fewer uv reactors 1 unit and lamps 8 lamps as well as a much lower uv intensity is required when combining uv30 with chlorine to achieve the required 4 log inactivation of viruses and 3 log inactivation of giardia lamblia chemicals under the uv30 scenario have a relative contribution of 5 which is higher than the relative contribution of chemicals 1 for the uv186 scenario this increase in relative chemical contribution occurs because a higher dosage of chlorine is needed for both secondary and residual disinfections after the uv treatment the uv30 scenario highlights synergistic benefits by reducing environmental and economic impact over the life of a system simultaneously while relatively similar ranking of the four scenarios was observed when comparing the economic outcomes with the environmental outcomes our results have shown that major differences exist in terms of the dominant cost embodied energy and carbon footprint contributors of the four scenarios particularly the initial infrastructure represents a much more significant component in terms of cost than in embodied energy and carbon footprint this indicates an interesting tradeoff between the operation and constructions phases in decision making construction or infrastructure often causes a significant financial burden but it is relatively insignificant in terms of environmental impacts on the other hand operation of the systems often presents high environmental impacts but they could be neglected due to their relatively insignificant immediate or long term financial concerns this demonstrates the importance of considering both environmental and economic aspects in sustainability assessments to achieve an optimized solution to the existing problems 3 3 sensitivity of results to water quality changes raw water quality was found to have varied influence on the embodied energy carbon footprint and economic cost of the four scenarios under investigation fig 6 under a high water quality of 1 5 mg of toc l the ozone scenario presents the lowest embodied energy followed by the gac scenario and the uv30 scenario whereas the uv186 scenario still presents the highest embodied energy the ozone scenario also exhibits the largest percent reduction of embodied energy which is mainly from the reductions of electricity and liquid oxygen needed by shifting to a lower capacity ozone generator reductions of the embodied energy from the uv30 and uv186 scenarios are mainly due to a decrease of electricity consumption under a higher uvt however the percent reduction of these two scenarios are relatively low 20 23 compared with 35 60 of change the gac scenario on the other hand reduces embodied energy mainly because of a longer service life of gac and hence lower annual consumption and replacement rates carbon footprint of the gac scenario is still the lowest under a higher water quality which is closely followed by the ozone and uv30 scenarios and then to a lesser extent the uv186 scenario similar to the embodied energy the ozone scenario has the highest percent change in terms of carbon footprint while the uv30 and uv186 scenarios have the lowest in terms of the economic cost the uv30 sceanrio has the lowest npv followed by the gac ozone and uv186 scenarios subsequently the gac scenario has the highest percent of change of npv while the ozone scenarios have the lowest this is because of the decrease of gac consumptions under a higher water quality as well as the nonlinearity of unit liquid oxygen price based upon quantity purchased overall the relatively small percent reductions of the uv30 and uv186 scenarios under a higher water quality is resulted from two non linearities one that is between the toc and the uvt and one that is between the uvt and the operational electricity consumptions with all three metrics considered while the uv186 remains the worst under high water quality the gac scenario becomes the best option in terms of reducing environmental impacts and the uv30 scenario remains the most economic option under a low water quality of 12 mg of toc l the ozone and uv scenarios have comparable yet the lowest embodied energy while the uv186 scenario presents the highest the gac scenario exhibits the most significant percent increase of the embodied energy 1430 making it almost comparable to the uv186 scenario this is mainly resulted from a sharp decrease of gac s efficiency under an extremely high toc concentration the ozone scenario has the lowest percent increase of the embodied energy 56 which is mainly because of an increased electricity and liquid oxygen use efficiency resulting from shifting to a higher capacity ozone generator the carbon footprint of the four scenarios follow an order of uv30 ozone gac and uv186 from the lowest to the highest similar to the embodied energy the gac scenario has the largest percent increase of carbon footprint 1214 while the ozone scenario has the lowest 128 in terms of the economic cost the uv30 scenario remains the best followed by the gac ozone and uv186 scenarios nevertheless the gac scenario presents the highest percent increase in terms of npv 147 followed by ozone uv186 and uv30 scenarios overall uv30 becomes the best scenario under low water quality across all three metrics while the uv186 scenatio remains the worst 4 conclusions and implications four upgrade scenarios to solve the dbp issue of an existing small drinking water system utilizing simple slow sand filtration and disinfection were designed and compared from an economic and environmental life cycle perspective under an averaged raw water toc of 4 6 mg l we found that the uv30 scenario presents the lowest embodied energy and life cycle cost while the gac scenario presents the lowest carbon footprint the uv186 scenario always has the highest environmental and economic impacts a small environmental and economic tradeoff exist when selecting the uv30 or gac scenario as the final solution to the dbp issue essentially a cost of 0 03 usd has to be paid in order to reduce 1 kg of co2e of carbon footprint in case of a carbon market this additional cost of selecting the less carbon intensive gac scenario might be compensated through carbon emission trading the major contributors of the life cycle costs and environmental impacts in the individual scenarios also differ energy and or material consumptions during the operation phase dominate the environmental impacts of the four scenarios while the infrastructure investments have a noticeable contribution to the economic costs this discrepancy highlights the importance of assessing the multiple aspects of sustainability and considering the systems entire life cycle to achieve a global optimum changes of the carbon type in the gac scenario could greatly change its performance potentially making it the worst scenario as the gac breakthrough rate changes change of water quality could potentially alter the ranking of the four scenarios for instance under a higher water quality of 1 5 mg of toc l the ozone scenario could have least embodied energy required among the four scenarios while under a lower water quality of 12 mg of toc l the overall competitiveness of the gac scenario is greatly reduced many non linearities exist in the system design which contributes to the changes of scenario rankings this shows the importance of a comprehensive model that captures these non linearities to inform decision making beyond the three metrics that have been investigated in this study future studies should consider other operational and human factors present which may also influence the decision on adopting certain scenarios for instance application of the ozone scenario will require an upgrade of the water utility operator s license potentially resulting in higher cost furthermore use of liquid oxygen to produce ozone could also increase the complexity of the treatment process and operation which might lead to a higher demand of staff time the increased complexity might be perceived as inconvenient and hence becomes a hurdle to its adoption application of the gac scenario on the other hand may add to the complexity of operation by removing the gac for offsite regeneration and then adding virgin or regenerated gac back into the slow sand filter meanwhile the excavation and refillment of the filters could potentially interrupt the operation and disturb the biological activity of the slow sand filter these social and operational factors require further investigation to identify the barriers to certain solutions and help guide the design of future technological solutions future studies could also consider additional upgrade scenarios that have been excluded from this study due to data limitations 1 replacement of old ductile iron water mains and minimization of system dead ends 2 use of multiple chlorination locations throughout the distribution

19422,water quality security within water distribution systems wdss has been an important issue due to their inherent vulnerability associated with contamination intrusion this motivates intensive studies to identify optimal water quality sensor placement wqsp strategies aimed to timely effectively detect un intentional intrusion events however these available wqsp optimization methods have consistently presumed that each wds node has an equal contamination probability while being simple in implementation this assumption may do not conform to the fact that the nodal contamination probability may be significantly regionally varied owing to variations in population density and user properties furthermore the low computational efficiency is another important factor that has seriously hampered the practical applications of the currently available wqsp optimization approaches to address these two issues this paper proposes an efficient multi objective wqsp optimization method to explicitly account for contamination probability variations four different contamination probability functions cpfs are proposed to represent the potential variations of nodal contamination probabilities within the wds two real world wdss are used to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method results show that wqsp strategies can be significantly affected by the choice of the cpf for example when the proposed method is applied to the large case study with the cpf accounting for user properties the event detection probabilities of the resultant solutions are approximately 65 while these values are around 25 for the traditional approach and such design solutions are achieved approximately 10 000 times faster than the traditional method this paper provides an alternative method to identify optimal wqsp solutions for the wds and also builds knowledge regarding the impacts of different cpfs on sensor deployments graphical abstract image keywords contamination probability function cpf contamination intrusion data archive method water distribution system wds water quality sensor placement wqsp 1 introduction a water distribution system wds is a network that delivers drinking water from treatment plant to end users therefore the wds s water quality safety is closely related to the health and well being of residents and hence it has always been an important issue to the society hu et al 2016 due to their large spatial coverage as well as complex configurations wdss are highly vulnerable to intentional attacks or accidental incidents perelman et al 2012 costa et al 2013 yang and boccelli 2016 recent incidents include a contamination event occurred in lanzhou china in april 2014 where the benzene from a chemical factory accidently intruded the wds people com cn 2014 and an event reported in hong kong at 31 may 2016 in which the lead level was significantly higher than the maximum level recommended by the world health organization chinanews 2016 unfortunately in both cases contamination was not detected until the residents have consumed the polluted water for a long period of time resulting in serious threats to public health this implies that it is vital to detect and warn contamination intrusion within the wds in a timely manner and accordingly reduce their associated impacts to achieve this goal a contamination warning system cws is typically developed within the wds the development of a cws typically involves the optimal placement of water quality sensors wu and walski 2006 chastain 2006 eliades and polycarpou 2008 hart and murray 2010 bazargan lari 2014 ohar et al 2015 hu et al 2017 soldevila et al 2018 naserizade et al 2018 this is because the availability of the sensors is often limited due to the constricted budgets and hence it is impossible to place a sensor at each node of the wds zhao et al 2016 this consequently motivates intensive studies to develop optimal water quality sensor placement wqsp strategies for wdss aimed to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency in detecting contamination events rathi et al 2015 the wqsp optimization typically consists of two main steps the determination of the objective functions to be optimized and the application development of optimization algorithms afshar and mariño 2012 oliker and ostfeld 2014 in terms of optimization objectives the minimization of the expected contamination time and the maximization of the detection probability have been widely considered as they represent the most straightforward manners to reduce the impacts of the contamination events preis and ostfeld 2008 rathi et al 2015 in subsequent studies a range of other objectives have also been developed either to explicitly account for the affected water volumes and population guidorzi et al 2009 aral et al 2010 or solely focus on reducing impacts of high consequence events krause and guestrin 2009 watson et al 2009 while the studies mentioned above have made significant contributions in formulating optimization objectives for the wqsp problem they have consistently made an assumption that the contamination probability of each node of the wds is identical while such an assumption greatly facilitates the implementation of the objective functions and optimization techniques it may do not conform to the fact that different regions of the wds may have significantly different contamination probabilities due to variations in their population density user properties and other system properties for instance pipes that deliver water for a larger proportion of the population are more likely to be intentionally attacked due to their potentially larger consequences relative to other pipes with low flow rates similarly the important or sensitive users e g hospital school and government departments are more likely to be maliciously attacked compared to common users bahadur et al 2003 the majority of the currently available objectives have not explicitly considered the underlying spatial variation of contamination probabilities within the wds only limited work has recognized the importance and necessity to improve the detection efficiency for important users these include the study by bahadur et al 2003 where critical customers e g hospitals were particularly considered within the wqsp design process and the teva spot software introduced by schal et al 2013 where user defined probability weights were considered to enable the wqsp optimization however neither explicit nodal contamination probability functions nor formal optimization frameworks are presented in these two studies more importantly there is a lack of understanding on how the nodal contamination probability variation affects the wqsp design solutions as this issue has not been comprehensively explored thus far to our best knowledge in parallel with the development of objective functions for wqsp optimization problems many studies have also been undertaken to develop optimization algorithms to identify the optimal wqsp strategies ostfeld et al 2008 diao and rauch 2013 rathi and gupta 2015 originally from the use of engineering experience and domain knowledge hart et al 2008 xu et al 2010 evolutionary algorithms eas have become more popular in recent years to optimize the design of the limited number of water quality sensors huang and mcbean 2006 xu et al 2010 comboul and ghanem 2013 this is because eas not only are often able to find better solutions relative to traditional engineering judgment approaches but also possess great flexibilities in dealing with wqsp problems for complex and looped wdss ostfeld et al 2008 however eas applications to wqsp optimization problems are not without difficulties a typical challenge that has seriously hampered eas wide applications is the low computational efficiency which is especially the case when dealing with real world wqsp optimization problems hart and murray 2010 this is because ea based optimization methods typically need to repeatedly call water quality simulation models of the wds which are often very computationally expensive ostfeld and salomons 2004 perelman and ostfeld 2011 while a number of studies have been carried out to improve the optimization efficiency with the aid of complexity science diao and rauch 2013 graph theory perelman and ostfeld 2011 the preconditioning methods dorini et al 2006 huang and mcbean 2006 the decomposition techniques guan et al 2006 aral et al 2008 and the surrogate models bi and dandy 2014 their efficiency performance either has been still unsatisfactory when dealing with large and real world wqsp optimization problems or has not been demonstrated using these large problems hart et al 2008 to address the issues of the ignorance of contamination probability variations and the low computational efficiency within the wqsp optimization process as mentioned above this paper proposes an efficient multi objective optimization method that explicitly accounts for spatial variability of contamination probabilities more specifically the primary contributions of the present work include i the offer of an alternative method for wqsp optimization with the aid of four proposed functions to account for nodal contamination probability variations and a data archive approach to enhance optimization efficiency and ii the demonstration of the significant difference between the design solutions identified using the proposed method that explicitly considers nodal contamination probability variations and the traditional approach that assumes equal contamination probability for each node thereby building fundamental knowledge regarding the impacts of contamination probability variations on sensor placement strategies within the wds 2 methodology the overall methodology of the proposed method is shown in fig 1 four different contamination probability functions cpfs are developed to represent nodal contamination probabilities of the wds a bi objective optimization formulation is defined with the objectives being the minimization of the expected detection time and the maximization of the detection probability to enhance the optimization efficiency a data archive approach is developed borg representing one of the most state of the art multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas used in water resources over the past few years zheng et al 2017 is selected to enable the optimization in the proposed framework two real world wdss are used as case studies to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method with the final pareto fronts and design solutions comprehensively analyzed the details of the proposed framework are described below 2 1 probability functions as illustrated in fig 1 four contamination probability functions cpfs are developed in the present study these cpfs account for spatial variation of nodal demands length of pipes connected to nodes flow rates of pipes and user properties it should be noted that there might be little information available to derive the underlying nodal contamination probabilities in practice and this may be the primary reason that an equal contamination probability is assumed for each node in previous studies in the present work the potential impact consequence of each contamination event is used to indicate its occurring probability the rationale behind this is that intentional contamination attacks are more likely to occur in the regions with high consequences for unintentional contamination events e g accidents assigning high occurring probabilities to important nodes are also meaningful this is because it is difficult if not impossible to detect all contamination events with typically limited budgets and hence it is more important to detect intrusion events occurring at important nodes represented by higher contamination probabilities than their counterparts in order to reduce the overall contamination impacts this is the hypothesis used to derive the four proposed contamination probability functions with details given below 2 1 1 the cpf based on the spatial variation of nodal demands cpf1 in defining nodal contamination probability the nodal demands are naturally considered as a straightforward indicator this is because a node with larger water demands is typically associated with a region with greater population density and hence this node is more likely to be maliciously attacked due to its potentially serious consequences therefore the contamination probabilities of the nodes with large water demands should be overall higher than those with low amount of demands in recognizing this we define a contamination probability function as the following 1 p s i t δ t a δ t d i t i 1 n t δ t a δ t d i t where p s i is the contamination probability of node i 1 2 n n is the total number of the nodes within the wds based on the spatial variation of nodal demands d i t is the water demands of node i at time t δ t 2 δ t a δ t a is the total number of the single simulation time period δ t if say δ t 1 h and a 24 for a daily simulation t δ t a δ t d i t is the total water demands of node i across the total time period i e the entire demand pattern time period as shown in equation 1 the nodal contamination probability is defined as the proportion of its corresponding demands relative to the total demands of the wds as so nodes with larger water demands are assigned greater contamination probabilities and vice versa for the sake of concise presentation the cpf defined in equation 1 is denoted as cpf1 it is noted that some nodes with large demands may not be necessarily associated with large population density such as industrial water users and hence contamination on these nodes would have little impact on public health an ad hoc way to handle this within the practical application can be the treat of these users as the common nodes within this proposed contamination probability function 2 1 2 the cpf based on length of pipes immediately connected to the nodes cpf2 in addition to nodal demands the total length of pipes that are immediately connected to the nodes can also be used to indicate nodal contamination probability this is because for example if a contamination event occurs at a node with relatively long pipe length e g a large number of downstream pipes the affected spatial region e g the spatial region that needs to be isolated can be larger than a node with shorter pipe length e g a lower number of downstream pipes resulting in greater social impacts this contamination probability function can be mathematically described as 2 p b i 1 2 k 1 ω i l k j 1 m l j where p b i is the contamination probability of node i based on length of pipes immediately connected to the nodes l j is the length of pipe j 1 2 m m is the total number of pipes in the wds ω i is the set of the node i consisting of all pipes that are immediately connected to this node since each pipe is associated with two nodes half of the length is considered for each pipe in ω i as shown in equation 2 the contamination probability function given in equation 2 is denoted as cpf2 for simplicity in later discussions 2 1 3 the cpf based on pipe flow rates cpf3 another meaningful indicator to represent nodal contamination probability is pipe flow rates for example for a contamination event occurring at a node if the flow rates of its downstream pipes are large the contamination can travel a long distance within a given time period and hence such contamination event can cause serious consequences due to its large spatial coverage therefore the nodes with downstream pipes having relatively larger flow rates can have higher contamination probabilities than the nodes associated with low pipe flow rates in recognizing this a probability function is developed as shown below 3 p f i j 1 m i c j i t l j i 1 n j 1 m i c j i t l j and 4 i c j i t 1 c j i t c min 0 otherwise where p f i is the contamination probability of node i based on pipe flow rates c j i t is the contamination concentration at pipe j caused by contamination intrusion at node i after a time period of t e g t 1 h is used in the present study c min is the minimum concentration that can be detected by water quality sensors i c j i t in equation 4 is an indicator function j 1 m i c j i t l j is the total length of contaminated pipes for the contamination event occurred at node i after a time period of t the cpf represented by equations 3 and 4 is denoted as cpf3 2 1 4 the cpf based on user properties cpf4 in a wds while some nodes might do not require large demands they are also important or sensitive users that have to ensure their water quality security with a high priority these include for example schools hospitals and government departments contamination intrusion on these users would have larger social impacts e g panics relative to individual common users and hence these users are more likely to have intentional contamination intrusion events to explicitly account for these important users defined as the set of ψ we propose to specify a particular high probability τ regardless of their actual demands and other properties as shown in equations 1 3 which is 5 p u t τ i ψ t δ t a δ t d i t i 1 n t δ t a δ t d i t 1 τ ψ otherwise where p u t is the probability function ψ is the degree of the set i e the number of elements in the set of ψ as shown in this equation each of the nodes in ψ is assigned a contamination probability of τ and the remaining nodes are given probabilities according to their demands for practical implementations the value of τ needs to be specified the cpf in equation 5 is denoted as cpf4 for later discussions it should be noted that p s i p b i p f i and p u i represent the contamination probability of node i defined by different cpfs as mentioned above this indicates that the contamination probability of the same node can be varied if different cpfs are used 2 2 formulation of the bi objective optimization typically the minimization of the population exposed to contamination intrusion events is the ultimate aim of the wqsp optimization however it is practically difficult to identify the exact population exposed to a contamination event which is especially the case for the assumed intrusion scenarios and hence the minimization of the detection time and the maximization of the detection probability are used to represent the reduction of the population exposure following previous studies e g hu et al 2016 this is because if a contamination event can be detected with shorter time or more contamination events can be detected using the sensor system the population exposed to contamination intrusion events can be considered overall lower ostfeld et al 2008 the detection time for node i contaminated at time t γ i t can be defined as the time elapsed from the start of the contamination intrusion at node i to the first identified presence of contaminant concentration by any of the sensors in wds ostfeld et al 2008 consequently the expected detection time f t can be mathematically expressed as 6 f t i 1 n t δ t a δ t p i γ i t i 1 n t δ t a δ t p i i γ i t and 7 i γ i t 1 γ i t 0 0 γ i t is not avaliable p i is the contamination probability at node i in the proposed optimization method p i are defined in equations 1 3 and 5 but for the traditional optimization methods p i 1 n representing that each node has an identical contamination probability for the indicator function in equation 7 i γ i t 1 if the contamination intrusion at node i at time t can be detected by at least one of the sensors in the wds otherwise γ i t is not available and hence i γ i t 0 the objective of the event detection probability f d is defined as the proportion of the total contamination scenarios that can be detected by any of the sensors in the wds as 8 f d i 1 n t δ t a δ t i γ i t 1 a p i where 1 a p i indicates the contamination probability of the node i at each time t δ t 2 δ t a δ t which is identical for all different time 2 3 the data archive method the computational overheads within the ea based wqsp optimization methods are mainly caused by the intensive calls on the water quality simulation models of the wdss which are often computationally very demanding especially for large and real world wdss bi and dandy 2014 for example a preliminary analysis on the real world zhn case study with 3439 nodes and 3512 pipes fig 1 demonstrates that 833 h approximately 34 7 days are required for 1 million evaluations this number is typically used for real world problems as stated in wang et al 2015 of this water quality model using a dell pc inter r at 2 9 ghz such massive demands significantly go beyond the computational resources that are typically available in practice to improve the wqsp optimization efficiency a data archive method is used in this study fig 2 shows the pseudo code of the proposed data archive method as shown in this figure the water quality model of the wds and the simulation parameters need to be pre specified before the optimization this is followed by the definition of all possible contamination scenarios at each node different contamination intrusion time for each node i contaminated at time b δ t as defined in fig 2 the water quality simulation model is performed with the given simulation parameters to enable the determination of its corresponding data archive for each contamination scenario s i b δ t denoted as a r i b δ t γ 1 i b δ t γ 2 i b δ t γ n i b δ t where γ j i b δ t is the minimum time required by node j to detect the contamination scenario s i b δ t for practical implementations the contamination scenario s i b δ t is determined as the contamination intruded at node i at time b δ t for a given wqsp solution with the total k sensors located at nodes s n 1 s n 2 s n k within the moea optimization process the proposed data archive method only needs to identify the detection time γ s n k i b δ t from the archive for each of the sensor nodes rather than performing the water quality simulation model this is followed by the determination of the minimum value γ min i b δ t of the detection time for all sensor nodes that is 9 γ min i b δ t min γ s n 1 i b δ t γ s n 2 i b δ t γ s n k i b δ t if γ min i b δ t na the contamination scenario s i b δ t can be detected with detection time being γ min i b δ t as so the two objective functions defined in equations 6 and 8 can be accordingly determined the proposed method is featured by that it performs water quality simulation only once for each node to enable the construction of data archive which is subsequently used to replace the simulation model within the optimization process since the proposed data archive method removes the need of repeat calls on the water quality models it significantly improves the optimization efficiency it is noted that the teva spot software introduced by schal et al 2013 also considered a database method to improve optimization efficiency but the detailed implementation was not given in their paper and hence it is difficult to enable the comparison between the proposed method and the approach stated in schal et al 2013 2 4 borg optimization algorithm borg is a state of the art hyper heuristic algorithm which has been widely in water resources in the recent years hadka and reed 2014 borg is a unified framework consisting of ε dominance ε progress randomized restart and auto adaptive multioperator recombination operators with details given in hadka and reed 2014 borg is featured by its dynamic population sizing strategy where the population size can change according to search progress to avoid premature convergence as well as its multi operator recombination strategy where multiple different crossover and mutation operators are jointly applied it should be noted that while borg is used in the proposed wqsp optimization method the choice of the moeas is not actually important to its successful application 2 5 result analysis methods as shown in fig 1 the result analysis is conducted in both the solution space and the decision space to enable a comprehensive understanding of the wqsp strategies identified by different contamination probability functions cpfs in the solution space the pareto fronts produced by different cpfs are compared in terms of the front quality measured by the two objectives defined in equations 6 and 8 in the decision space wqsp solutions yielded by different cpfs are analyzed and compared thereby offering improved knowledge regarding the impacts of contamination probability variations different cpfs on sensor deployments 3 computational experiment 3 1 case studies the proposed wqsp optimization method was applied to two real world wds case studies in china the jiayou network jyn and the zhuohao network zhn the jyn have two fixed head reservoirs 349 demand nodes and 509 pipes consisting of many loops as shown in fig 3 a the zhn has one reservoir 3439 demand nodes 3512 pipes and 16 valves with many branched structures fig 3 b both case studies have a 24 h demand pattern with each hour representing a demand scenario due to the budget limits only six and 30 water quality sensors were allowed for the jyn and zhn case studies respectively the proposed optimization method was used to identify the optimal wqsp strategies for the limited number of sensors under different cpfs it is noted that the choice of the sensor types does not affect the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method 3 2 implementation of the proposed method for each case study the contamination scenario s i b δ t was defined as the contamination intruded at node i at each demand pattern time ostfeld et al 2008 since 24 demand patterns are available for each case study the total number of contamination scenarios for the jyn and zhn case studies are 8376 i e 24 349 where 349 is the total number of nodes and 82 536 respectively following the method used in ostfeld et al 2008 the injection contamination concentration was 100 mg l for each scenario and the injection was assumed to be continuous before the contamination has been detected by any one of sensors in the wds the minimum detectable concentration of the water quality sensors was assumed to 0 01 mg l i e c min 0 01 mg l zheng et al 2018 above which the contamination can be detected by the sensor to ensure the stability of water quality parameters at every node throughout the entire simulation time the total simulation time t 96 h was used for each case study i e four times of the 24 demand pattern following the previous work ostfeld et al 2008 the time step ε for the water quality simulation was set to be 300 s the freely available epanet2 0 was used to enable hydraulic and water quality simulations in this paper for the proposed cpf4 equation 5 τ 0 05 is used for both case studies based on a preliminary analysis to ensure that the total contamination probability of the important users is reasonably large the initial population sizes of borg applied to the jyn and zhn case studies were 500 and 1000 respectively with other parameter values identical to those used in wang et al 2015 in addition to the four proposed cpfs the traditional probability function that assigns equal probability 1 n to each node was also considered in the present study this enables a comparison between different cpfs in terms of wqsp solutions thereby allowing a comprehensive investigation on the impacts of contamination probability variations on sensor placements to enable a statistically rigorous analysis ten and 100 borg runs with different random number seeds were applied to the jyn and zhn case studies respectively with different cpfs such a large number of optimization runs especially for the zhn case study can be efficiently performed by the proposed data achieve method which would otherwise not have been possible using commonly available computational resources more specifically the computation efficiency of the proposed method applied to the zhn case study is approximately 10 000 times faster than the traditional method on a dell pc inter r at 2 9 ghz as so enable many runs of the proposed method using the typically available computational budgets a few assumptions were made in the present study to enable the water quality simulation these included i the contamination intrusion events were instantly detected if contamination concentration of any one of the sensors were greater than c min 0 01 mg l i e the actual ability of the sensor to correctly alarm based on changes in the signal is considered to be ideal ii the contamination was conservative i e without decay during the whole transport within the network and iii once a node or pipe has been contaminated it remained contaminated throughout the entire simulation time these assumptions have been typically used in many previous studies ostfeld et al 2008 zheng et al 2018 4 results and discussions as mentioned in fig 1 both the pareto fronts and the design solutions are compared between the proposed method with various cpfs and traditional approach that assumes an equal nodal contamination probability it should be noted that the comparisons as well as the relative performance between the proposed method and the traditional approach are conditioned on the four nodal contamination probability functions considered 4 1 pareto front comparisons fig 4 shows the distributions of nodal contamination probabilities of the jyn case study based on the proposed four cpfs as shown in this figure significant spatial variations of nodal contamination probabilities are observed for this case study this is especially the case for the cpf3 equation 3 where nodes pipes near the water supply sources are overall assigned larger probabilities due to their large flow rates in delivering water fig 4 c the important users of the jyn case study include two schools one hospital and two government departments as indicated by large grey dots in fig 4 d i e a large contamination probability fig 5 presents the distribution of nodal contamination probabilities of the zhn case study derived from the cpf1 distributions of other cpfs are not given it can be seen from this figure that the majority of the nodes have a similar contamination probability expect that a few nodes possess significantly high likelihoods of contamination intrusion due to their large water demands this is because many nodes of this wds are the resident users it is a distribution network and hence their demands are overall similar figs 6 and 7 present the pareto fronts produced by typical runs of the proposed multi objective wqsp optimization method with four different cpfs with optimization objectives defined in equations 6 and 8 it is observed that the pareto fronts yielded by the four cpfs are overall substantially different to those provided by the traditional method assign equal contamination probability for each node with difference being more prominent for larger wdss as shown in figs 6 and 7 however this is not the case for the jyn case study when cpf1 nodal demands are used to indicate nodal contamination probabilities was used in the proposed method this is because the jyn is a transmission network where the nodal demand variation is overall appreciably lower than a distribution network such as the zhn case study the zhn consist of some nodes with very large demands as observed in figs 4 a and 5 we recalculated the objective function values for the pareto front solutions provided by the traditional method using the proposed cpfs which is denoted as the modified traditional method for later discussions in other words the nodal contamination variations were considered to determine the true detection probability of each design solution identified by the traditional method thereby enabling a fair comparison with the proposed method interestingly the differences between pareto fronts from the proposed approach and those identified by the modified traditional method become significantly smaller relative to that when the solutions from the traditional method were directly considered this implies that the contamination probability functions can appreciably affect the pareto fronts in terms of both the detection time and event detection probability even though the performance of the modified traditional method is considerably improved compared to the tradition method it is still overall significantly worse than the proposed wqsp optimization method with the four cpfs figs 6 and 7 for example if the contamination probability function accounts for the user properties cpf4 in equation 5 the design solution six sensors with 1 h expected detection time for the jyn case study produced by the proposed method can have an event detection probability of 50 while this number was only about 40 and 30 for the modified traditional method and the traditional method respectively fig 6 d in comparing the detection probabilities of wqsp solutions 30 available sensors for the zhn case study when the cpf1 was applied fig 7 a the proposed method can detect approximately 45 of the total contamination intrusion events if 3 h expected detection time was allowed which was appreciably higher than 34 of the modified traditional method such difference can also be observed for other cpfs as shown in fig 7 b and d for example when the proposed method was applied to the zhn case study with the cpf accounting for user properties cpf4 the event detection probabilities of the resultant solutions were approximately 65 while these values were around 25 for the traditional approach this clearly shows that design solutions produced by the proposed method are significantly different those provided by the traditional approach in terms of average detection time and contamination detection probability conditioned on that the nodal contamination variation exists in the wds it is noted that results of typical borg runs are given in figs 6 and 7 and similar observations are observed for other runs results are not given 4 2 design solution comparisons in addition to comparing pareto fronts in the solution space as stated above the design solutions in the decision space produced by the proposed and traditional methods were investigated and compared in this section in order to gain more insight into the impacts of contamination probability variations on sensor deployments since many design solutions were available in the pareto fronts we have selected the solutions with 1 h expected detection time to enable the analysis it is noted that similar observations were made for design solutions with other expected detection times such as two and 3 h fig 8 presents the locations of the six available sensors with 1 h expected detection time identified by 10 borg runs applied to the jyn case study while small variations were observed the optimal solutions from both the proposed method with the cpf1 equation 1 and the traditional method consistently deployed the six sensors in the five small regions as shown in fig 8 a this finding matches well with the observation made in fig 6 a in that the pareto fronts from the proposed and traditional methods were overall similar due to the low nodal demand variation of the jyn case study for the cpf2 and cpf3 significant variations can be found between the proposed method and the traditional approach in terms of sensor locations as presented in fig 8 b no sensors were deployed in the left bottom region of the jyn for the 10 solutions provided by the traditional method however the nodes in this region can be subject to un intentional contamination intrusion events with relatively high probabilities when consider the length of pipes immediately connected to the nodes due to that the length of pipes in this region are overall large than those in other regions in contrast the proposed method consistently placed sensors in the left bottom region of the jyn as the cpf2 assigned high probabilities for the nodes in this region similar observations can be made when the proposed method with the cpf3 based on pipe flow rates was applied to the jyn as shown in fig 8 c when the cpf4 equation 5 was used the sensor locations identified by the proposed approach exhibited the noticeable differences compared to those provide by the traditional method it can be seen from fig 8 d that the proposed method consistently placed sensors exactly at or in the vicinity of the locations of the important users over the 10 runs so that the contamination events could be detected immediately when these events occurred in the area of important users however the traditional method was unable to explicitly consider the potentially high contamination probabilities associated with these important users and hence the resultant wqsp strategies were more likely to have a lower event detection probability relative to the proposed method see fig 6 d it is difficult to present the locations of the 30 sensors for the zhn case study for all wqsp solutions identified by 100 borg runs to illustrate the design differences between the proposed and traditional methods the following method is used design solutions with 1 h expected detection time were firstly selected from the 100 borg runs for the proposed method with different cpfs and the traditional method then for each of these design solutions the water quality simulation was performed with contamination injected at each node of the zhn to identify the distribution of the detection time over all node contamination events finally the probability density plots of the detection time for different design solutions were used to indicate the differences of the sensor locations identified by the proposed and traditional approaches fig 9 shows the probability density plots of the 100 solutions with 1 h expected detection time selected from 100 borg runs with the means representing by the thick lines to enable a clear comparison we only present the results with detection time smaller than 1 h as the distribution of the relatively longer detection time is overall similar between the proposed and traditional methods as shown in fig 9 while there is a moderate uncertainty in probability density distribution across different design solutions from different runs the trend of the plot is overall similar in comparing the probability density distribution between the proposed and traditional methods significant differences can be observed for the contamination probability functions considering spatial demand variations and user properties fig 9 a and d which agrees well with the observation made based on the pareto front results in fig 7 a and d for the other two contamination probability functions the differences between the design solutions identified by the proposed and traditional methods can be statistically small it should be noted that the probability density plots fig 9 are only used to demonstrate the differences of the design solutions in terms of sensor deployments and they cannot indicate their performance in event detection probability as the nodal contamination probability variations are not considered in these plots the wqsp strategies with 1 h expected detection time provided by a typical run of the proposed method with the cpf1 and a typical run of the traditional method are given in fig 10 as can be seen significant differences can be observed for these two design solutions with sensor locations identified by the proposed method much closer to the nodes with large demands relative to the traditional method for example there were five nodes with large demands large grey dots in the left bottom area of the zhn case study as shown in fig 10 when consider the spatial variation of nodal demands but the wqsp solutions produced by the traditional method did not deploy any sensors in this region in contrast the wqsp strategies identified by the proposed method consistently assigned sensors for this region over different runs 5 summary and conclusions water distribution systems wdss are vulnerable to un intentional contaminant intrusion events due to their large spatial coverage as well as complex structures this consequently leads to many studies to develop optimization techniques for the identification of optimal water quality sensor placement wqsp strategies in order to detect contaminant intrusion events with great efficiency and effectiveness however these available wqsp optimization techniques have consistently assumed that the nodal contamination probability is equal across the entire wds while such an assumption is benefit in its great simplicity for the implementation of optimization techniques it may not be able to represent the realistic contamination probability distribution of the wds this is because the regions of the wds with high population density or important users are more likely to be subject to un intentional contamination intrusion due to their potentially serious consequences in addition the majority of the currently available wqsp optimization methods are computationally very demanding due to their intensive calls on the water quality simulation models of the wds this has seriously hampered the wider up takes of these optimization methods for practical applications especially for dealing with real world wqsp optimization problems this paper has proposed an efficient multi objective wqsp optimization method that explicitly accounts for contamination probability variations in the proposed method four contamination probability functions cpfs have been developed in which spatial variation of nodal demands length of pipes connected to nodes flow rates of pipes and user properties were considered to indicate the nodal contamination probabilities a data archive method has been used to greatly enhance the optimization efficiency through the development of detection time archive thereby avoiding the repeat calling on water quality simulation models which were typically computational expensive in the proposed method a bi objective optimization formulation has been defined where the expected detection time was to be minimized and the detection probability was to be maximized this optimization formulation has been solved using borg which was a widely used multi objective evolutionary algorithm in water resources two real world case studies have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed wqsp methods with different cpfs the observations and implications are outlined below i the wqsp solutions could be significantly affected by the use of contamination probability functions cpfs in terms of pareto fronts in the solution space and sensor placements in the decision space which was especially the case for the large wdss e g the zhn case study this implies that the contamination probability distribution of the wds is an important factor that needs to be considered when identifying the optimal wqsp solutions ii conditioned on the use of four contamination probability functions cpfs the proposed method consistently outperformed the traditional method in terms of event detection probability for the two case studies this suggests that it is vital to incorporate the realistic cpf of the wds within the wqsp optimization process thereby maximizing the performance water quality security within the wdss of the limited number of sensors e g reduce the detection time and increase the event detection probability iii the proposed four contamination probability functions cpfs provide important alternatives to quantitively determine nodal contamination probabilities for the wds we also observed that in addition to the choice of the cpfs the properties of the wds including nodal demand variations distributions of pipe diameters and structure characteristics loops or trees can also affect the optimal wqsp strategies iv the data archive method has been demonstrated to be efficient in identifying optimal wqsp solutions with advantage being more prominent for larger wqsp optimization problems this is demonstrated by the fact in that the computation efficiency of the proposed method applied to the zhn case study was approximately 10 000 times faster than the traditional method on a dell pc inter r at 2 9 ghz this approach with implementation details as presented in this study can be also used for other water quality modelling and analysis such as reliability analysis and monte carlo simulation of wds water quality in closing the outcome of this paper not only have provided an alternative method that can be used to explicitly account for nodal contamination probability variations within the wqsp optimization process but also have built fundamental knowledge regarding the

19422,water quality security within water distribution systems wdss has been an important issue due to their inherent vulnerability associated with contamination intrusion this motivates intensive studies to identify optimal water quality sensor placement wqsp strategies aimed to timely effectively detect un intentional intrusion events however these available wqsp optimization methods have consistently presumed that each wds node has an equal contamination probability while being simple in implementation this assumption may do not conform to the fact that the nodal contamination probability may be significantly regionally varied owing to variations in population density and user properties furthermore the low computational efficiency is another important factor that has seriously hampered the practical applications of the currently available wqsp optimization approaches to address these two issues this paper proposes an efficient multi objective wqsp optimization method to explicitly account for contamination probability variations four different contamination probability functions cpfs are proposed to represent the potential variations of nodal contamination probabilities within the wds two real world wdss are used to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method results show that wqsp strategies can be significantly affected by the choice of the cpf for example when the proposed method is applied to the large case study with the cpf accounting for user properties the event detection probabilities of the resultant solutions are approximately 65 while these values are around 25 for the traditional approach and such design solutions are achieved approximately 10 000 times faster than the traditional method this paper provides an alternative method to identify optimal wqsp solutions for the wds and also builds knowledge regarding the impacts of different cpfs on sensor deployments graphical abstract image keywords contamination probability function cpf contamination intrusion data archive method water distribution system wds water quality sensor placement wqsp 1 introduction a water distribution system wds is a network that delivers drinking water from treatment plant to end users therefore the wds s water quality safety is closely related to the health and well being of residents and hence it has always been an important issue to the society hu et al 2016 due to their large spatial coverage as well as complex configurations wdss are highly vulnerable to intentional attacks or accidental incidents perelman et al 2012 costa et al 2013 yang and boccelli 2016 recent incidents include a contamination event occurred in lanzhou china in april 2014 where the benzene from a chemical factory accidently intruded the wds people com cn 2014 and an event reported in hong kong at 31 may 2016 in which the lead level was significantly higher than the maximum level recommended by the world health organization chinanews 2016 unfortunately in both cases contamination was not detected until the residents have consumed the polluted water for a long period of time resulting in serious threats to public health this implies that it is vital to detect and warn contamination intrusion within the wds in a timely manner and accordingly reduce their associated impacts to achieve this goal a contamination warning system cws is typically developed within the wds the development of a cws typically involves the optimal placement of water quality sensors wu and walski 2006 chastain 2006 eliades and polycarpou 2008 hart and murray 2010 bazargan lari 2014 ohar et al 2015 hu et al 2017 soldevila et al 2018 naserizade et al 2018 this is because the availability of the sensors is often limited due to the constricted budgets and hence it is impossible to place a sensor at each node of the wds zhao et al 2016 this consequently motivates intensive studies to develop optimal water quality sensor placement wqsp strategies for wdss aimed to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency in detecting contamination events rathi et al 2015 the wqsp optimization typically consists of two main steps the determination of the objective functions to be optimized and the application development of optimization algorithms afshar and mariño 2012 oliker and ostfeld 2014 in terms of optimization objectives the minimization of the expected contamination time and the maximization of the detection probability have been widely considered as they represent the most straightforward manners to reduce the impacts of the contamination events preis and ostfeld 2008 rathi et al 2015 in subsequent studies a range of other objectives have also been developed either to explicitly account for the affected water volumes and population guidorzi et al 2009 aral et al 2010 or solely focus on reducing impacts of high consequence events krause and guestrin 2009 watson et al 2009 while the studies mentioned above have made significant contributions in formulating optimization objectives for the wqsp problem they have consistently made an assumption that the contamination probability of each node of the wds is identical while such an assumption greatly facilitates the implementation of the objective functions and optimization techniques it may do not conform to the fact that different regions of the wds may have significantly different contamination probabilities due to variations in their population density user properties and other system properties for instance pipes that deliver water for a larger proportion of the population are more likely to be intentionally attacked due to their potentially larger consequences relative to other pipes with low flow rates similarly the important or sensitive users e g hospital school and government departments are more likely to be maliciously attacked compared to common users bahadur et al 2003 the majority of the currently available objectives have not explicitly considered the underlying spatial variation of contamination probabilities within the wds only limited work has recognized the importance and necessity to improve the detection efficiency for important users these include the study by bahadur et al 2003 where critical customers e g hospitals were particularly considered within the wqsp design process and the teva spot software introduced by schal et al 2013 where user defined probability weights were considered to enable the wqsp optimization however neither explicit nodal contamination probability functions nor formal optimization frameworks are presented in these two studies more importantly there is a lack of understanding on how the nodal contamination probability variation affects the wqsp design solutions as this issue has not been comprehensively explored thus far to our best knowledge in parallel with the development of objective functions for wqsp optimization problems many studies have also been undertaken to develop optimization algorithms to identify the optimal wqsp strategies ostfeld et al 2008 diao and rauch 2013 rathi and gupta 2015 originally from the use of engineering experience and domain knowledge hart et al 2008 xu et al 2010 evolutionary algorithms eas have become more popular in recent years to optimize the design of the limited number of water quality sensors huang and mcbean 2006 xu et al 2010 comboul and ghanem 2013 this is because eas not only are often able to find better solutions relative to traditional engineering judgment approaches but also possess great flexibilities in dealing with wqsp problems for complex and looped wdss ostfeld et al 2008 however eas applications to wqsp optimization problems are not without difficulties a typical challenge that has seriously hampered eas wide applications is the low computational efficiency which is especially the case when dealing with real world wqsp optimization problems hart and murray 2010 this is because ea based optimization methods typically need to repeatedly call water quality simulation models of the wds which are often very computationally expensive ostfeld and salomons 2004 perelman and ostfeld 2011 while a number of studies have been carried out to improve the optimization efficiency with the aid of complexity science diao and rauch 2013 graph theory perelman and ostfeld 2011 the preconditioning methods dorini et al 2006 huang and mcbean 2006 the decomposition techniques guan et al 2006 aral et al 2008 and the surrogate models bi and dandy 2014 their efficiency performance either has been still unsatisfactory when dealing with large and real world wqsp optimization problems or has not been demonstrated using these large problems hart et al 2008 to address the issues of the ignorance of contamination probability variations and the low computational efficiency within the wqsp optimization process as mentioned above this paper proposes an efficient multi objective optimization method that explicitly accounts for spatial variability of contamination probabilities more specifically the primary contributions of the present work include i the offer of an alternative method for wqsp optimization with the aid of four proposed functions to account for nodal contamination probability variations and a data archive approach to enhance optimization efficiency and ii the demonstration of the significant difference between the design solutions identified using the proposed method that explicitly considers nodal contamination probability variations and the traditional approach that assumes equal contamination probability for each node thereby building fundamental knowledge regarding the impacts of contamination probability variations on sensor placement strategies within the wds 2 methodology the overall methodology of the proposed method is shown in fig 1 four different contamination probability functions cpfs are developed to represent nodal contamination probabilities of the wds a bi objective optimization formulation is defined with the objectives being the minimization of the expected detection time and the maximization of the detection probability to enhance the optimization efficiency a data archive approach is developed borg representing one of the most state of the art multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas used in water resources over the past few years zheng et al 2017 is selected to enable the optimization in the proposed framework two real world wdss are used as case studies to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method with the final pareto fronts and design solutions comprehensively analyzed the details of the proposed framework are described below 2 1 probability functions as illustrated in fig 1 four contamination probability functions cpfs are developed in the present study these cpfs account for spatial variation of nodal demands length of pipes connected to nodes flow rates of pipes and user properties it should be noted that there might be little information available to derive the underlying nodal contamination probabilities in practice and this may be the primary reason that an equal contamination probability is assumed for each node in previous studies in the present work the potential impact consequence of each contamination event is used to indicate its occurring probability the rationale behind this is that intentional contamination attacks are more likely to occur in the regions with high consequences for unintentional contamination events e g accidents assigning high occurring probabilities to important nodes are also meaningful this is because it is difficult if not impossible to detect all contamination events with typically limited budgets and hence it is more important to detect intrusion events occurring at important nodes represented by higher contamination probabilities than their counterparts in order to reduce the overall contamination impacts this is the hypothesis used to derive the four proposed contamination probability functions with details given below 2 1 1 the cpf based on the spatial variation of nodal demands cpf1 in defining nodal contamination probability the nodal demands are naturally considered as a straightforward indicator this is because a node with larger water demands is typically associated with a region with greater population density and hence this node is more likely to be maliciously attacked due to its potentially serious consequences therefore the contamination probabilities of the nodes with large water demands should be overall higher than those with low amount of demands in recognizing this we define a contamination probability function as the following 1 p s i t δ t a δ t d i t i 1 n t δ t a δ t d i t where p s i is the contamination probability of node i 1 2 n n is the total number of the nodes within the wds based on the spatial variation of nodal demands d i t is the water demands of node i at time t δ t 2 δ t a δ t a is the total number of the single simulation time period δ t if say δ t 1 h and a 24 for a daily simulation t δ t a δ t d i t is the total water demands of node i across the total time period i e the entire demand pattern time period as shown in equation 1 the nodal contamination probability is defined as the proportion of its corresponding demands relative to the total demands of the wds as so nodes with larger water demands are assigned greater contamination probabilities and vice versa for the sake of concise presentation the cpf defined in equation 1 is denoted as cpf1 it is noted that some nodes with large demands may not be necessarily associated with large population density such as industrial water users and hence contamination on these nodes would have little impact on public health an ad hoc way to handle this within the practical application can be the treat of these users as the common nodes within this proposed contamination probability function 2 1 2 the cpf based on length of pipes immediately connected to the nodes cpf2 in addition to nodal demands the total length of pipes that are immediately connected to the nodes can also be used to indicate nodal contamination probability this is because for example if a contamination event occurs at a node with relatively long pipe length e g a large number of downstream pipes the affected spatial region e g the spatial region that needs to be isolated can be larger than a node with shorter pipe length e g a lower number of downstream pipes resulting in greater social impacts this contamination probability function can be mathematically described as 2 p b i 1 2 k 1 ω i l k j 1 m l j where p b i is the contamination probability of node i based on length of pipes immediately connected to the nodes l j is the length of pipe j 1 2 m m is the total number of pipes in the wds ω i is the set of the node i consisting of all pipes that are immediately connected to this node since each pipe is associated with two nodes half of the length is considered for each pipe in ω i as shown in equation 2 the contamination probability function given in equation 2 is denoted as cpf2 for simplicity in later discussions 2 1 3 the cpf based on pipe flow rates cpf3 another meaningful indicator to represent nodal contamination probability is pipe flow rates for example for a contamination event occurring at a node if the flow rates of its downstream pipes are large the contamination can travel a long distance within a given time period and hence such contamination event can cause serious consequences due to its large spatial coverage therefore the nodes with downstream pipes having relatively larger flow rates can have higher contamination probabilities than the nodes associated with low pipe flow rates in recognizing this a probability function is developed as shown below 3 p f i j 1 m i c j i t l j i 1 n j 1 m i c j i t l j and 4 i c j i t 1 c j i t c min 0 otherwise where p f i is the contamination probability of node i based on pipe flow rates c j i t is the contamination concentration at pipe j caused by contamination intrusion at node i after a time period of t e g t 1 h is used in the present study c min is the minimum concentration that can be detected by water quality sensors i c j i t in equation 4 is an indicator function j 1 m i c j i t l j is the total length of contaminated pipes for the contamination event occurred at node i after a time period of t the cpf represented by equations 3 and 4 is denoted as cpf3 2 1 4 the cpf based on user properties cpf4 in a wds while some nodes might do not require large demands they are also important or sensitive users that have to ensure their water quality security with a high priority these include for example schools hospitals and government departments contamination intrusion on these users would have larger social impacts e g panics relative to individual common users and hence these users are more likely to have intentional contamination intrusion events to explicitly account for these important users defined as the set of ψ we propose to specify a particular high probability τ regardless of their actual demands and other properties as shown in equations 1 3 which is 5 p u t τ i ψ t δ t a δ t d i t i 1 n t δ t a δ t d i t 1 τ ψ otherwise where p u t is the probability function ψ is the degree of the set i e the number of elements in the set of ψ as shown in this equation each of the nodes in ψ is assigned a contamination probability of τ and the remaining nodes are given probabilities according to their demands for practical implementations the value of τ needs to be specified the cpf in equation 5 is denoted as cpf4 for later discussions it should be noted that p s i p b i p f i and p u i represent the contamination probability of node i defined by different cpfs as mentioned above this indicates that the contamination probability of the same node can be varied if different cpfs are used 2 2 formulation of the bi objective optimization typically the minimization of the population exposed to contamination intrusion events is the ultimate aim of the wqsp optimization however it is practically difficult to identify the exact population exposed to a contamination event which is especially the case for the assumed intrusion scenarios and hence the minimization of the detection time and the maximization of the detection probability are used to represent the reduction of the population exposure following previous studies e g hu et al 2016 this is because if a contamination event can be detected with shorter time or more contamination events can be detected using the sensor system the population exposed to contamination intrusion events can be considered overall lower ostfeld et al 2008 the detection time for node i contaminated at time t γ i t can be defined as the time elapsed from the start of the contamination intrusion at node i to the first identified presence of contaminant concentration by any of the sensors in wds ostfeld et al 2008 consequently the expected detection time f t can be mathematically expressed as 6 f t i 1 n t δ t a δ t p i γ i t i 1 n t δ t a δ t p i i γ i t and 7 i γ i t 1 γ i t 0 0 γ i t is not avaliable p i is the contamination probability at node i in the proposed optimization method p i are defined in equations 1 3 and 5 but for the traditional optimization methods p i 1 n representing that each node has an identical contamination probability for the indicator function in equation 7 i γ i t 1 if the contamination intrusion at node i at time t can be detected by at least one of the sensors in the wds otherwise γ i t is not available and hence i γ i t 0 the objective of the event detection probability f d is defined as the proportion of the total contamination scenarios that can be detected by any of the sensors in the wds as 8 f d i 1 n t δ t a δ t i γ i t 1 a p i where 1 a p i indicates the contamination probability of the node i at each time t δ t 2 δ t a δ t which is identical for all different time 2 3 the data archive method the computational overheads within the ea based wqsp optimization methods are mainly caused by the intensive calls on the water quality simulation models of the wdss which are often computationally very demanding especially for large and real world wdss bi and dandy 2014 for example a preliminary analysis on the real world zhn case study with 3439 nodes and 3512 pipes fig 1 demonstrates that 833 h approximately 34 7 days are required for 1 million evaluations this number is typically used for real world problems as stated in wang et al 2015 of this water quality model using a dell pc inter r at 2 9 ghz such massive demands significantly go beyond the computational resources that are typically available in practice to improve the wqsp optimization efficiency a data archive method is used in this study fig 2 shows the pseudo code of the proposed data archive method as shown in this figure the water quality model of the wds and the simulation parameters need to be pre specified before the optimization this is followed by the definition of all possible contamination scenarios at each node different contamination intrusion time for each node i contaminated at time b δ t as defined in fig 2 the water quality simulation model is performed with the given simulation parameters to enable the determination of its corresponding data archive for each contamination scenario s i b δ t denoted as a r i b δ t γ 1 i b δ t γ 2 i b δ t γ n i b δ t where γ j i b δ t is the minimum time required by node j to detect the contamination scenario s i b δ t for practical implementations the contamination scenario s i b δ t is determined as the contamination intruded at node i at time b δ t for a given wqsp solution with the total k sensors located at nodes s n 1 s n 2 s n k within the moea optimization process the proposed data archive method only needs to identify the detection time γ s n k i b δ t from the archive for each of the sensor nodes rather than performing the water quality simulation model this is followed by the determination of the minimum value γ min i b δ t of the detection time for all sensor nodes that is 9 γ min i b δ t min γ s n 1 i b δ t γ s n 2 i b δ t γ s n k i b δ t if γ min i b δ t na the contamination scenario s i b δ t can be detected with detection time being γ min i b δ t as so the two objective functions defined in equations 6 and 8 can be accordingly determined the proposed method is featured by that it performs water quality simulation only once for each node to enable the construction of data archive which is subsequently used to replace the simulation model within the optimization process since the proposed data archive method removes the need of repeat calls on the water quality models it significantly improves the optimization efficiency it is noted that the teva spot software introduced by schal et al 2013 also considered a database method to improve optimization efficiency but the detailed implementation was not given in their paper and hence it is difficult to enable the comparison between the proposed method and the approach stated in schal et al 2013 2 4 borg optimization algorithm borg is a state of the art hyper heuristic algorithm which has been widely in water resources in the recent years hadka and reed 2014 borg is a unified framework consisting of ε dominance ε progress randomized restart and auto adaptive multioperator recombination operators with details given in hadka and reed 2014 borg is featured by its dynamic population sizing strategy where the population size can change according to search progress to avoid premature convergence as well as its multi operator recombination strategy where multiple different crossover and mutation operators are jointly applied it should be noted that while borg is used in the proposed wqsp optimization method the choice of the moeas is not actually important to its successful application 2 5 result analysis methods as shown in fig 1 the result analysis is conducted in both the solution space and the decision space to enable a comprehensive understanding of the wqsp strategies identified by different contamination probability functions cpfs in the solution space the pareto fronts produced by different cpfs are compared in terms of the front quality measured by the two objectives defined in equations 6 and 8 in the decision space wqsp solutions yielded by different cpfs are analyzed and compared thereby offering improved knowledge regarding the impacts of contamination probability variations different cpfs on sensor deployments 3 computational experiment 3 1 case studies the proposed wqsp optimization method was applied to two real world wds case studies in china the jiayou network jyn and the zhuohao network zhn the jyn have two fixed head reservoirs 349 demand nodes and 509 pipes consisting of many loops as shown in fig 3 a the zhn has one reservoir 3439 demand nodes 3512 pipes and 16 valves with many branched structures fig 3 b both case studies have a 24 h demand pattern with each hour representing a demand scenario due to the budget limits only six and 30 water quality sensors were allowed for the jyn and zhn case studies respectively the proposed optimization method was used to identify the optimal wqsp strategies for the limited number of sensors under different cpfs it is noted that the choice of the sensor types does not affect the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method 3 2 implementation of the proposed method for each case study the contamination scenario s i b δ t was defined as the contamination intruded at node i at each demand pattern time ostfeld et al 2008 since 24 demand patterns are available for each case study the total number of contamination scenarios for the jyn and zhn case studies are 8376 i e 24 349 where 349 is the total number of nodes and 82 536 respectively following the method used in ostfeld et al 2008 the injection contamination concentration was 100 mg l for each scenario and the injection was assumed to be continuous before the contamination has been detected by any one of sensors in the wds the minimum detectable concentration of the water quality sensors was assumed to 0 01 mg l i e c min 0 01 mg l zheng et al 2018 above which the contamination can be detected by the sensor to ensure the stability of water quality parameters at every node throughout the entire simulation time the total simulation time t 96 h was used for each case study i e four times of the 24 demand pattern following the previous work ostfeld et al 2008 the time step ε for the water quality simulation was set to be 300 s the freely available epanet2 0 was used to enable hydraulic and water quality simulations in this paper for the proposed cpf4 equation 5 τ 0 05 is used for both case studies based on a preliminary analysis to ensure that the total contamination probability of the important users is reasonably large the initial population sizes of borg applied to the jyn and zhn case studies were 500 and 1000 respectively with other parameter values identical to those used in wang et al 2015 in addition to the four proposed cpfs the traditional probability function that assigns equal probability 1 n to each node was also considered in the present study this enables a comparison between different cpfs in terms of wqsp solutions thereby allowing a comprehensive investigation on the impacts of contamination probability variations on sensor placements to enable a statistically rigorous analysis ten and 100 borg runs with different random number seeds were applied to the jyn and zhn case studies respectively with different cpfs such a large number of optimization runs especially for the zhn case study can be efficiently performed by the proposed data achieve method which would otherwise not have been possible using commonly available computational resources more specifically the computation efficiency of the proposed method applied to the zhn case study is approximately 10 000 times faster than the traditional method on a dell pc inter r at 2 9 ghz as so enable many runs of the proposed method using the typically available computational budgets a few assumptions were made in the present study to enable the water quality simulation these included i the contamination intrusion events were instantly detected if contamination concentration of any one of the sensors were greater than c min 0 01 mg l i e the actual ability of the sensor to correctly alarm based on changes in the signal is considered to be ideal ii the contamination was conservative i e without decay during the whole transport within the network and iii once a node or pipe has been contaminated it remained contaminated throughout the entire simulation time these assumptions have been typically used in many previous studies ostfeld et al 2008 zheng et al 2018 4 results and discussions as mentioned in fig 1 both the pareto fronts and the design solutions are compared between the proposed method with various cpfs and traditional approach that assumes an equal nodal contamination probability it should be noted that the comparisons as well as the relative performance between the proposed method and the traditional approach are conditioned on the four nodal contamination probability functions considered 4 1 pareto front comparisons fig 4 shows the distributions of nodal contamination probabilities of the jyn case study based on the proposed four cpfs as shown in this figure significant spatial variations of nodal contamination probabilities are observed for this case study this is especially the case for the cpf3 equation 3 where nodes pipes near the water supply sources are overall assigned larger probabilities due to their large flow rates in delivering water fig 4 c the important users of the jyn case study include two schools one hospital and two government departments as indicated by large grey dots in fig 4 d i e a large contamination probability fig 5 presents the distribution of nodal contamination probabilities of the zhn case study derived from the cpf1 distributions of other cpfs are not given it can be seen from this figure that the majority of the nodes have a similar contamination probability expect that a few nodes possess significantly high likelihoods of contamination intrusion due to their large water demands this is because many nodes of this wds are the resident users it is a distribution network and hence their demands are overall similar figs 6 and 7 present the pareto fronts produced by typical runs of the proposed multi objective wqsp optimization method with four different cpfs with optimization objectives defined in equations 6 and 8 it is observed that the pareto fronts yielded by the four cpfs are overall substantially different to those provided by the traditional method assign equal contamination probability for each node with difference being more prominent for larger wdss as shown in figs 6 and 7 however this is not the case for the jyn case study when cpf1 nodal demands are used to indicate nodal contamination probabilities was used in the proposed method this is because the jyn is a transmission network where the nodal demand variation is overall appreciably lower than a distribution network such as the zhn case study the zhn consist of some nodes with very large demands as observed in figs 4 a and 5 we recalculated the objective function values for the pareto front solutions provided by the traditional method using the proposed cpfs which is denoted as the modified traditional method for later discussions in other words the nodal contamination variations were considered to determine the true detection probability of each design solution identified by the traditional method thereby enabling a fair comparison with the proposed method interestingly the differences between pareto fronts from the proposed approach and those identified by the modified traditional method become significantly smaller relative to that when the solutions from the traditional method were directly considered this implies that the contamination probability functions can appreciably affect the pareto fronts in terms of both the detection time and event detection probability even though the performance of the modified traditional method is considerably improved compared to the tradition method it is still overall significantly worse than the proposed wqsp optimization method with the four cpfs figs 6 and 7 for example if the contamination probability function accounts for the user properties cpf4 in equation 5 the design solution six sensors with 1 h expected detection time for the jyn case study produced by the proposed method can have an event detection probability of 50 while this number was only about 40 and 30 for the modified traditional method and the traditional method respectively fig 6 d in comparing the detection probabilities of wqsp solutions 30 available sensors for the zhn case study when the cpf1 was applied fig 7 a the proposed method can detect approximately 45 of the total contamination intrusion events if 3 h expected detection time was allowed which was appreciably higher than 34 of the modified traditional method such difference can also be observed for other cpfs as shown in fig 7 b and d for example when the proposed method was applied to the zhn case study with the cpf accounting for user properties cpf4 the event detection probabilities of the resultant solutions were approximately 65 while these values were around 25 for the traditional approach this clearly shows that design solutions produced by the proposed method are significantly different those provided by the traditional approach in terms of average detection time and contamination detection probability conditioned on that the nodal contamination variation exists in the wds it is noted that results of typical borg runs are given in figs 6 and 7 and similar observations are observed for other runs results are not given 4 2 design solution comparisons in addition to comparing pareto fronts in the solution space as stated above the design solutions in the decision space produced by the proposed and traditional methods were investigated and compared in this section in order to gain more insight into the impacts of contamination probability variations on sensor deployments since many design solutions were available in the pareto fronts we have selected the solutions with 1 h expected detection time to enable the analysis it is noted that similar observations were made for design solutions with other expected detection times such as two and 3 h fig 8 presents the locations of the six available sensors with 1 h expected detection time identified by 10 borg runs applied to the jyn case study while small variations were observed the optimal solutions from both the proposed method with the cpf1 equation 1 and the traditional method consistently deployed the six sensors in the five small regions as shown in fig 8 a this finding matches well with the observation made in fig 6 a in that the pareto fronts from the proposed and traditional methods were overall similar due to the low nodal demand variation of the jyn case study for the cpf2 and cpf3 significant variations can be found between the proposed method and the traditional approach in terms of sensor locations as presented in fig 8 b no sensors were deployed in the left bottom region of the jyn for the 10 solutions provided by the traditional method however the nodes in this region can be subject to un intentional contamination intrusion events with relatively high probabilities when consider the length of pipes immediately connected to the nodes due to that the length of pipes in this region are overall large than those in other regions in contrast the proposed method consistently placed sensors in the left bottom region of the jyn as the cpf2 assigned high probabilities for the nodes in this region similar observations can be made when the proposed method with the cpf3 based on pipe flow rates was applied to the jyn as shown in fig 8 c when the cpf4 equation 5 was used the sensor locations identified by the proposed approach exhibited the noticeable differences compared to those provide by the traditional method it can be seen from fig 8 d that the proposed method consistently placed sensors exactly at or in the vicinity of the locations of the important users over the 10 runs so that the contamination events could be detected immediately when these events occurred in the area of important users however the traditional method was unable to explicitly consider the potentially high contamination probabilities associated with these important users and hence the resultant wqsp strategies were more likely to have a lower event detection probability relative to the proposed method see fig 6 d it is difficult to present the locations of the 30 sensors for the zhn case study for all wqsp solutions identified by 100 borg runs to illustrate the design differences between the proposed and traditional methods the following method is used design solutions with 1 h expected detection time were firstly selected from the 100 borg runs for the proposed method with different cpfs and the traditional method then for each of these design solutions the water quality simulation was performed with contamination injected at each node of the zhn to identify the distribution of the detection time over all node contamination events finally the probability density plots of the detection time for different design solutions were used to indicate the differences of the sensor locations identified by the proposed and traditional approaches fig 9 shows the probability density plots of the 100 solutions with 1 h expected detection time selected from 100 borg runs with the means representing by the thick lines to enable a clear comparison we only present the results with detection time smaller than 1 h as the distribution of the relatively longer detection time is overall similar between the proposed and traditional methods as shown in fig 9 while there is a moderate uncertainty in probability density distribution across different design solutions from different runs the trend of the plot is overall similar in comparing the probability density distribution between the proposed and traditional methods significant differences can be observed for the contamination probability functions considering spatial demand variations and user properties fig 9 a and d which agrees well with the observation made based on the pareto front results in fig 7 a and d for the other two contamination probability functions the differences between the design solutions identified by the proposed and traditional methods can be statistically small it should be noted that the probability density plots fig 9 are only used to demonstrate the differences of the design solutions in terms of sensor deployments and they cannot indicate their performance in event detection probability as the nodal contamination probability variations are not considered in these plots the wqsp strategies with 1 h expected detection time provided by a typical run of the proposed method with the cpf1 and a typical run of the traditional method are given in fig 10 as can be seen significant differences can be observed for these two design solutions with sensor locations identified by the proposed method much closer to the nodes with large demands relative to the traditional method for example there were five nodes with large demands large grey dots in the left bottom area of the zhn case study as shown in fig 10 when consider the spatial variation of nodal demands but the wqsp solutions produced by the traditional method did not deploy any sensors in this region in contrast the wqsp strategies identified by the proposed method consistently assigned sensors for this region over different runs 5 summary and conclusions water distribution systems wdss are vulnerable to un intentional contaminant intrusion events due to their large spatial coverage as well as complex structures this consequently leads to many studies to develop optimization techniques for the identification of optimal water quality sensor placement wqsp strategies in order to detect contaminant intrusion events with great efficiency and effectiveness however these available wqsp optimization techniques have consistently assumed that the nodal contamination probability is equal across the entire wds while such an assumption is benefit in its great simplicity for the implementation of optimization techniques it may not be able to represent the realistic contamination probability distribution of the wds this is because the regions of the wds with high population density or important users are more likely to be subject to un intentional contamination intrusion due to their potentially serious consequences in addition the majority of the currently available wqsp optimization methods are computationally very demanding due to their intensive calls on the water quality simulation models of the wds this has seriously hampered the wider up takes of these optimization methods for practical applications especially for dealing with real world wqsp optimization problems this paper has proposed an efficient multi objective wqsp optimization method that explicitly accounts for contamination probability variations in the proposed method four contamination probability functions cpfs have been developed in which spatial variation of nodal demands length of pipes connected to nodes flow rates of pipes and user properties were considered to indicate the nodal contamination probabilities a data archive method has been used to greatly enhance the optimization efficiency through the development of detection time archive thereby avoiding the repeat calling on water quality simulation models which were typically computational expensive in the proposed method a bi objective optimization formulation has been defined where the expected detection time was to be minimized and the detection probability was to be maximized this optimization formulation has been solved using borg which was a widely used multi objective evolutionary algorithm in water resources two real world case studies have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed wqsp methods with different cpfs the observations and implications are outlined below i the wqsp solutions could be significantly affected by the use of contamination probability functions cpfs in terms of pareto fronts in the solution space and sensor placements in the decision space which was especially the case for the large wdss e g the zhn case study this implies that the contamination probability distribution of the wds is an important factor that needs to be considered when identifying the optimal wqsp solutions ii conditioned on the use of four contamination probability functions cpfs the proposed method consistently outperformed the traditional method in terms of event detection probability for the two case studies this suggests that it is vital to incorporate the realistic cpf of the wds within the wqsp optimization process thereby maximizing the performance water quality security within the wdss of the limited number of sensors e g reduce the detection time and increase the event detection probability iii the proposed four contamination probability functions cpfs provide important alternatives to quantitively determine nodal contamination probabilities for the wds we also observed that in addition to the choice of the cpfs the properties of the wds including nodal demand variations distributions of pipe diameters and structure characteristics loops or trees can also affect the optimal wqsp strategies iv the data archive method has been demonstrated to be efficient in identifying optimal wqsp solutions with advantage being more prominent for larger wqsp optimization problems this is demonstrated by the fact in that the computation efficiency of the proposed method applied to the zhn case study was approximately 10 000 times faster than the traditional method on a dell pc inter r at 2 9 ghz this approach with implementation details as presented in this study can be also used for other water quality modelling and analysis such as reliability analysis and monte carlo simulation of wds water quality in closing the outcome of this paper not only have provided an alternative method that can be used to explicitly account for nodal contamination probability variations within the wqsp optimization process but also have built fundamental knowledge regarding the

from gaussian output files to predict the possible reaction sites the homo and lumo denotes the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of as prepared catalysts a series of characterizations were performed to elucidate the specific properties of nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 which showed the best catalytic performance discussed below n doping did not change the external and internal structure of cnt oh and tubular structures were still observed from both sem and tem images of nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 figs 1 and 2 the ft ir spectra are shown in fig 3 and the absorption peak at 1630 cm 1 was ascribed to the valence oscillations of the c c bond in the benzene ring liu et al 2016b due to the relative low contents no obvious peaks of oh and n groups were observed in the ft ir spectra the three diffraction peaks at 26 5 42 4 and 54 7 in the xrd patterns fig 4 were indexed into the hexagonal graphite structures 002 100 and 004 planes respectively li et al 2003 the crystal structure of cnt oh showed no distinct changes after n doping in agreement with the sem and tem results according to the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms in fig 5 the bet surface area of cnt oh was calculated as 195 2 m2 g 1 and an increasing surface area of 237 3 m2 g 1 was obtained after n modification as seen from their raman spectra fig 6 two obvious peaks at 1341 and 1575 cm 1 corresponding to d and g band respectively were observed in the spectra of cnt oh and nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 d band represents the disorder and defects in the carbon lattice or the existence of amorphous carbon gupta et al 2014 tavares et al 2015 while g band reveals in plane tangential stretching of the carbon carbon bonds in the graphene structure gangupomu et al 2016 the intensities of both d and g band increased after n doping which was consistent with the findings of tavares et al 2015 the ratio i d i g as an indicator of the degree of disorder in carbon liu et al 2015 was 1 19 and 1 12 for cnt oh and nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 respectively suggesting that n doping did not change sp2 network of carbon the intensity of the second order g band namely g band is highly sensitive to charge transfer effects rao et al 1997 yan et al 2014 tavares et al 2015 compared with cnt oh the g band intensity also increased in nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 indicating that n doping can improve the concentration of charge carriers of cnt oh to achieve a better removal efficiency of contaminants the xps survey spectrum was used to investigate the chemical composition and the dopants of the catalyst fig 7 a showed the presence of c o and n in the nh4no3 cnt oh samples confirming the successful doping of n into cnt oh all recorded photoelectron lines were calibrated to the c 1s line at 284 ev and the binding energies of c 1s o 1s and n 1s were located at 285 0 ev 402 0 ev and 494 0 ev respectively the surface n doping content in nh4no3 cnt oh samples was generally very low ranging from 0 88 to 1 60 table 1 previously sharifi et al 2012 used the catalytic chemical vapor deposition method to synthesize n doped multi walled carbon nanotubes in which the n content reached a maximum of 9 2 ghosh et al 2010 used imidazole as a dual source of c and n to prepare n cnts and a higher n doping of 12 1 25 7 was achieved the different preparation methods and n sources may contribute to the different n doping level another possible explanation for the low n doping content in this work is that the cnts contain small amount of surface oxygen containing functional groups which would provide few active sites to react with n liu et al 2016b found that oxygen containing functional groups evidently promote the doping of nitrogen into cnts moreover a proportional relationship was not observed between the surface n doping content and the initial nh4no3 dosage the nh4no3 cnt oh 1 1 showed a high n doping content which subsequently increased slightly with further increase of the initial nh4no3 dosage previously lai et al 2012 and sun et al 2013 reported that three types of n existed in carbon nanomaterials in this work the peaks at 399 7 ev and 400 4 ev were assigned to the pyridinic six membered ring and pyrrolic five membered ring n respectively fig 7b the disappearance of graphitic quaternary n was attributed to the relatively low annealing temperature t 350 c with the increasing annealing temperature nitrogen bonding configurations could gradually transform from amino nitrogen to pyrrolic and pyridinic t 300 c and graphitic t 600 c nitrogen in sequence chen et al 2014 wu et al 2015 additionally it was observed that greater initial nh4no3 dosage resulted in higher pyridinic n content as 43 84 68 82 and 70 47 for nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 1 1 and 2 1 catalyst respectively however the total percentages of pyrrolic n were almost constant as 0 49 0 44 and 0 47 for nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 1 1 and 2 1 catalyst respectively 3 2 removal of 2 4 4 hbp by ps activation with different carbonaceous materials 3 2 1 the efficiency of different carbonaceous materials the removal of 2 4 4 hbp by pristine and urea doped cnt oh cnt cooh and go was in fig 8 a when ps was not present the adsorption after 4 h increased slightly for urea doped cnt oh and cnt cooh from 27 to 33 and 22 26 respectively opposite to the effect observed for go 9 for go and 2 for urea go fig s1a this fact may be due to the changed characteristics of these materials after n doping as seen from fig 8a the addition of carbonaceous materials especially the n doped materials increased the removal efficiency of 2 4 4 hbp compared to the effect of ps alone the removal of 2 4 4 hbp is ordered as urea cnt oh urea cnt cooh cnt oh cnt cooh urea go go and the specific value after 4 h is 100 93 89 57 47 and 18 respectively the relative hydrophilic property of cnt oh may result in high efficiency compared to cnt cooh in contrast n and s co doped cnt cooh n s cnt cooh showed a higher catalytic activity towards pms for benzophenone 4 removal than n and s co doped cnt oh n s cnt oh liu et al 2016b possibly due to the difference in target pollutant and cnt coohs in their study the cnt coohs used were carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes furthermore it is likely that the unique tubular property of carbon nanotubes regardless of the identity of cnt oh or cnt cooh makes their activation effects higher than that of go 3 2 2 nitrogen from different reagents based on the above result we chose cnt oh to compare the catalytic activity of n doping from urea nh4no3 indole and polyaniline the mass ratio of nitrogenous reagents to cnt oh is 1 1 as observed in fig s1b nh4no3 indole and polyaniline doped cnt oh decreased the adsorption of 2 4 4 hbp which was in contrast to the effect of urea furthermore different n sources showed different abilities for ps activation and the highest removal was observed in the ps nh4no3 cnt oh system fig 8b specifically the order of ps activation potential is nh4no3 cnt oh urea cnt oh indole cnt oh cnt oh polyaniline cnt oh with the 4 h removal efficiency of 100 100 93 89 and 76 respectively in fact the remaining 2 4 4 hbp concentration dropped rapidly to 20 in the first 0 5 h of ps oxidation by nh4no3 cnt oh this is possibly because the two different valence states of n in nh4no3 are more beneficial for electron transfer further improving the oxidation of 2 4 4 hbp the ps activation ability of polyaniline cnt oh was the lowest among the four different reagents and was even lower than that of the pristine cnt oh possibly due to the decreased number of reactive sites resulting from the macromolecular characteristics of polyaniline 3 2 3 different n doping content of nh4no3 cnt oh the effects of different n doping content on 2 4 4 hbp removal were studied at the nh4no3 cnt oh mass ratio of 0 5 1 1 1 and 2 1 as seen in fig s1c there was no significant adsorption except for the nh4no3 cnt oh 2 1 material no proportional relationship was observed between the initial nh4no3 dosage and the removal efficiency fig 8c from the xps analysis the actual n doping contents of these three carbonaceous materials were all very low compared to c and o regardless of the theoretical mass ratio of nh4no3 and cnt oh similar results were found by other researchers sun et al 2014 used nh4no3 as a source of n to prepare n doped cnt and only 0 88 n was doped into cnt liu et al 2016b synthesized n s cnt oh from thiourea and cnt oh and the n doping content was less than 5 in the two works the theoretical mass ratio of nitrogenous reagents to carbonaceous materials were both set at 1 1 the three nh4no3 cnt oh catalysts showed no obvious change in the 2 4 4 hbp removal which was related with the nearly identical percentage of pyrrolic n in the catalysts along with the bet surface areas in table 1 this result indicated that the surface area was not a key factor in ps activation similar to the findings of wang et al 2016 whereas pyrrolic n played a key role during the ps activation process considering the adsorption effect the nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 showed the best catalytic performance thus the investigations of reaction kinetics intermediates identification and degradation pathways were performed using this material in subsequent studies 3 3 reaction kinetics of 2 4 4 hbp in ps nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 system fig 9 shows the effects of solution ph reaction temperature and initial substrate concentration on 2 4 4 hbp degradation in ps nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 system as seen from fig 9a complete removal was all achieved in 2 h and there was no obvious difference in the removal rate at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 suggesting that ph has little effect on 2 4 4 hbp removal in the ps nh4no3 cnt oh system fig 9b shows the degradation of 2 4 4 hbp at three different reaction temperatures 25 35 and 45 c obviously high temperature enhanced the removal of 2 4 4 hbp to be specific the time required for complete removal of the substrate decreased from 2 h to 30 min with temperature rising from 25 c to 45 c unlike single ps or metal oxides catalyzed ps system pan et al 2017 2018 the overall effects of reaction temperature and solution ph are not obvious possibly because the catalyst has already possessed an excellent ability of ps activation under mild reaction conditions we have studied the effect of initial concentration 8 696 43 48 and 86 96 μm on 2 4 4 hbp removal as shown in fig 9c the removal rate decreased with increasing initial 2 4 4 hbp concentration for a given ps dosage the amount of radicals generated in solution is considered to be constant thus leading to a large removal efficiency at a low initial 2 4 4 hbp concentration further high substrate concentration would produce more reaction intermediates and their competition with 2 4 4 hbp for oxidants inevitably inhibited the removal of the parent compound in addition the nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 catalyst shows good recyclability and excellent stability refer to text s1 for details 3 4 the residual ps concentration in order to evaluate ps decomposition rate the residual ps concentrations were measured with or without the catalyst the results fig s2 showed that ps decomposed very slowly with no obvious concentration change in single ps system while the residual ps decreased to 68 after 2 h in presence of 100 mg l 1 catalyst thus the addition of catalyst could activate ps to produce much more reactive radicals for contaminant removal 3 5 activation mechanism it is well known that so4 and ho are the dominant radical species in the ps system while radical and non radical mechanisms are both reported in the reaction solutions containing ps and carbonaceous materials sun et al 2014 lee et al 2015 chen et al 2016 chen and carroll 2016 cheng et al 2017 hence to identify the activation mechanism of nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 for ps oxidation on 2 4 4 hbp meth and tba were used as radical scavengers to quench the related radicals due to their distinct reactivity with so4 and ho xu et al 2017 table s3 as seen from fig 10 a in single ps system the removal of 2 4 4 hbp was remarkably inhibited by the addition of meth and tba compared with the control the residual 2 4 4 hbp after 10 h increased from 79 to 93 and 92 respectively indicating that meth and tba can quench so4 and ho in solution as shown in fig 10b and fig s3 no inhibition in removal and even a slight promotion effect were observed in the five as prepared catalysts according to the experiment results in single ps system we may say that there were no aqueous so4 and ho in the catalytic degradation system similar findings were also obtained by chen et al 2016 and cheng et al 2017 nevertheless different activation mechanisms were observed the former study regarded so4 and ho as the major reactive species while the latter considered that 1o2 mainly contributed to the removal of target pollutant then furfuryl alcohol ffa and phenol two well known scavengers were adopted to elucidate the reaction mechanism and their specific second order rate constants for reactions are listed in table s3 since 1o2 did not exist after the adding of 100 mg l 1 cnt discussed below ffa was used to quench oh while phenol was used to quench both oh and so4 in this work as shown in fig 10c d and fig s4 5 a significant inhibitory effect on the removal of 2 4 4 hbp was found in the presence of ffa and especially phenol with the increasing ffa concentration this inhibitory effect became stronger more specifically in the presence of 43 48 mm ffa only 38 66 65 44 and 41 of the substrate were oxidized in 4 h for cnt oh urea cnt oh nh4no3 cnt oh indole cnt oh and polyaniline cnt oh respectively when phenol was present in the system little loss of 2 4 4 hbp was observed by contrast a near complete degradation was observed in the control condition except for polyaniline cnt oh this information combined with the radical quenching experimental results by meth and tba leads to the conclusion that so4 and ho on the catalyst surface worked together for the oxidation of 2 4 4 hbp it is known that the polarity and water solubility of the scavengers decrease in the order of meth tba ffa and phenol wohlfarth 2002 therefore the quenching inability of meth and tba can be explained by their hydrophilic nature which makes them difficult to closely approach the surface of catalyst however the relatively hydrophobic ffa and phenol can easily approach the catalyst surface further quenching surface radicals to inhibit the reaction lindsey and tarr 2000 ziajka and pasiuk bronikowska 2005 liang et al 2013 meanwhile epr experiments were conducted in order to verify the above speculation from the epr spectra we can obtain the following information 1 no peaks were observed for dmpo or temp solution or single nh4no3 cnt oh system 2 obvious peaks with hyperfine splitting constants of αn αh 14 9 g and αn 13 2 g αh 9 6 1 48 0 78 g fig 11 a and a typical three line with equal intensities fig 11b were observed in the single ps system corresponding to dmpo oh dmpo so4 adducts and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol n oxyl radical tmpn respectively demonstrating the existence of ho so4 radicals and 1o2 in this system 3 after the addition of 100 mg l 1 nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 into the ps solution the signals of ho and so4 radicals disappeared with the detection of the 5 5 dimethyl 2 oxo pyrroline 1 oxyl dmpox radical 4 the tmpn peak also disappeared when temp was used as the spin trapping reagent but no new signals were detected for point 3 very strong signal of dmpox may overlap the signal of the so4 radicals such that the peak of dmpo so4 adducts was not detected floyd and soong 1977 reported the existence of dmpox suggesting that it was derived from direct oxidation by single electron sources many studies have shown that dmpo may be oxidized into dmpox in strongly oxidative environments black and watson 1973 finkelstein et al 1980 rosen and rauckman 1980 thornalley et al 1983 bernofsky et al 1990 nishi et al 1992 mao et al 1994 bilski et al 1996 proved that dmpo could be oxidized by 1o2 into dmpox in an aqueous solution and the rate constant k was approximately 1 8 107 m 1 s 1 harbour et al 1980 in the single ps system 1o2 may be produced according to eqs 1 6 reshetnyak et al 2003 yan et al 2017 in this study the addition of nh4no3 cnt oh may immensely accelerate the reactions 1 5 and inhibit reaction 6 resulting in the accumulation of extraordinarily high amounts of ho this hypothesis was supported by the findings of some other researchers huang and huang 2009 x wang et al 2015 yao et al 2017 who showed that the occurrence of dmpox may be ascribed to the proliferation of ho in conclusion surface hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were responsible for the substrate oxidation during the reaction carbon nanotubes play a role of electron mediator and can provide many reaction sites for the oxidation reaction 1 s2o8 2 activators 2so4 2 so4 h2o ho so4 2 h 3 s2o8 2 h2o hso5 hso4 4 hso5 h2o h2o2 hso4 5 h2o2 2ho 6 2 ho 1 2 1o2 h2o 3 6 identification of intermediates and reaction pathways to facilitate products identification the reactions for lc ms analysis were carried out at a high 2 4 4 hbp concentration of 86 96 μm the total ion current tic chromatograms for samples at different reaction time are presented in fig s9a as seen the peaks of 2 4 4 hbp and its transformation products mainly appeared at 10 18 min according to the detailed ms ms analysis fig s10 the possible structures of its 10 intermediates were obtained as shown in fig s10 the difference between the measured mass and the theoretical mass was also calculated and the small error demonstrated the reliability of the detection method table s4 in the ms ms spectra the parent compound 2 4 4 hbp had two main fragment ions with the m z values of 135 00 and 93 03 which were ascribed to the cleavage of the c c bridge bond for compound p1 the ion peaks at m z 213 02 201 05 and 151 00 resulted from the losses of 2o co o and phenol group from the parent ion of m z 245 04 respectively thus p1 was recognized as a hydroxylated derivative of 2 4 4 hbp and its structure was shown in fig s10 the compound p2 has a parent ion of m z 243 02 and the successive losses of co and co o group generated a fragment ion peak at m z 171 04 the fragment ions with m z 135 00 and 91 02 were also observed which corresponded to the loss of 108 and 44 da from m z 243 02 in sequence suggesting the existence of phenol carbonyl and two hydroxyl groups in p2 because of the relatively low m z values p3 p5 and p7 should belong to the single benzene ring compounds the m z values of p8 p11 were about twice as high as that of 2 4 4 hbp accordingly we speculated that the polymerization reaction of the substrate may have occurred in the solution from fig s11a we can see that the intensities of the extracted ion current eic chromatograms of p8 p11 changed with the progress of reaction in each eic figure two obvious peaks are always present at different retention time indicating the existence of two isomers however their very similar properties lead to the difficult separation of the peaks on the basis of above discussion two feasible pathways were summarized in fig 12 pathway i was initiated by the attack of hydroxyl radicals on the c c bridge bond of 2 4 4 hbp resulting in the generation of monophenyl compounds p3 p6 however p6 was not detected in the ms spectra possibly because it was rapidly transformed into p7 in pathway ii the benzene ring of 2 4 4 hbp was attacked by hydroxyl radicals with the formation of hydroxylation intermediate p1 which was further transformed to p2 similar to the results of our previous study pan et al 2017 then two kinds of polymerization reactions occur on one hand the cross coupling reaction between 2 4 4 hbp and p2 generated p8 which underwent c c bridge bond cleavage and hydroxylation to give p9 and p10 respectively on the other hand because ps is a strong electron acceptor 2 4 4 hbp may lose an electron to form radicals and the self coupling of the 2 4 4 hbp radical yielded the dimer product p11 the eic chromatograms in ps cnt oh and ps system fig s11 b and c also revealed the existence of p8 p11 indicating that the presence of a strong electron acceptor such as ps instead of cnt oh or n doping induces the polymerization of 2 4 4 hbp furthermore we cannot detect trimers tetramers and other complexes of 2 4 4 hbp suggesting that aqueous 2 4 4 hbp prefers to polymerize into dimers when treated by ps coupling reactions are favorable to environmental pollution control in that these reactions tend to transform contaminants into less toxic derivatives and can prevent leaching of notoriously toxic and recalcitrant pollutants by immobilizing them tukayi et al 2011 however some previous studies have shown that bromophenols brps may be transformed into more toxic brominated polymeric products like hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers oh pbdes and biphenyls oh pbbs during oxidation process jiang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 guan et al 2017 due to the large difficulty in obtaining pure samples it is hard to evaluate the toxicity of these dimer products overall the physicochemical properties the environmental behavior and the ecotoxicity of the transformation intermediates of 2 4 4 hbp deserve further researches overall cleavage of c c bridge bond hydroxylation and polymerization were mainly involved in the degradation of 2 4 4 hbp in ps nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 system 3 7 mineralization the mineralization degree in reaction solution was evaluated by total organic carbon toc content it was clearly seen from fig s12 that toc level decreased over time but the mineralization degree only reached 49 after 4 h possibly due to the generation of refractory imtermediates such as p8 p11 3 8 fed calculations many previous studies have shown that theoretical calculations can provide insights into the reaction mechanism or possible reactive sites of organic pollutants wang et al 2004 qu et al 2012 xiao et al 2015 the values of 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo of each atom of 2 4 4 hbp are displayed in fig 13 it can be seen that the highest 2fed2 homo values are obtained for c 3 followed by c 5 and o 15 indicating that the highly substituted benzene ring was easily oxidized the isosurface of the homo orbital also showed that the electron density is mainly distributed on these sites making them more vulnerable for electron extraction however due to the steric hindrance effect it seems unlikely that the oxidants will attack the c 5 site therefore c 3 and o 15 are the sites where the local electrons may be easily shifted to ps coupling of the resulting radicals would lead to the formation of p11 in addition c 3 and c 7 showed the highest fed2 homo fed2 lumo values suggesting that the hydroxyl radical tends to attack these two sites this was confirmed by the observation of the hydroxylation product p1 and the bond cleavage products p3 p5 4 conclusions for three carbonaceous materials hydroxyl multi walled carbon nanotubes present good potential for activating ps and this potential is further enhanced by the doping of inorganic salt nh4no3 as the n source sample characterization revealed that tubular and crystal structures were still maintained after n doping into cnt oh pyridinic and pyrrolic n were found in nh4no3 cnt oh catalysts and pyrrolic n plays a significant role to activate ps under the conditions of 2 4 4 hbp 0 ps 0 1 500 ph0 7 t 25 c concentration of nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 catalyst 100 mg l 1 43 48 μm 2 4 4 hbp was completely removed from aqueous solution in 2 h the removal efficiency of 2 4 4 hbp decreased with increasing initial substrate concentration while solution ph and temperature generally had little effects on the oxidation reaction according to radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra hydroxyl and sulfate radicals on the surface of the catalyst contributed to the substrate oxidation in the reaction process three primary reactions i e c c bridge bond cleavage hydroxylation and polymerization lead to the generation of 10 intermediates this work may provide

19423,in this work we systematically investigated the persulfate ps activation potential of a series of nitrogen doped carbonaceous materials for the degradation of 2 4 4 trihydroxybenzophenone 2 4 4

first to describe the transformation mechanism of 2 4 4 hbp in nitrogen doped carbonaceous materials catalyzed ps system graphical abstract image 1 keywords persulfate activation nitrogen doping carbonaceous materials 2 4 4 hbp reaction mechanisms 1 introduction the worldwide occurrence and detection of uv type stabilizers such as hydroxybenzophenones and their derivatives in environment have already been reported some of these compounds show distinct endocrine disrupting activity including estrogenic androgenic and anti androgenic activities in animals and humans schlumpf et al 2001 zhang et al 2011 among benzophenone and its 16 derivatives the highest hormonal activities were observed for 2 4 4 trihydroxybenzophenone 2 4 4 hbp suzuki et al 2005 unfortunately to date there have been no reports on the transformation mechanisms of this compound recently sulfate radicals based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have attracted increasing attention due to their unique advantages such as high redox potential wide ph operation range and high mineralization degree of organic pollutants thiele bruhn 2003 barnes et al 2004 yuan et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 persulfate ps which is

michael kordatou et al 2015 pan et al 2017 2018 these activation methods require large energy inputs or may cause secondary pollution tsitonaki et al 2010 and thus are not favorable in environmental pollution control materials such as carbon nanotubes cnt and graphene oxide go are emerging promising green and heterogeneous catalysts for elimination of persistent organic compounds in aquatic environment goncalves et al 2012 2013 lee et al 2015 qu et al 2015 the chemical doping of heteroatoms e g n p and s can remarkably enhance the catalytic activity of nanostructured carbonaceous materials for example liu et al 2016a synthesized n doped reduced go filters as a supported catalyst to activate ps to oxidize phenol wang et al 2015 prepared n modified reduced go by a hydrothermal method as a bifunctional material to remove bisphenol wu et al 2015 and yang et al 2012 used phosphorus doped carbon hollow spheres and sulfur doped graphene to reduce oxygen respectively especially surface nitrogen doped multi walled carbon nanotubes show a significant effect on the acceleration of ps oxidation of the pollutants sun et al 2014 although n doped carbonaceous materials have been studied the effects of n originating from different reagents and the n content on catalysis have rarely been reported furthermore large debates exist over the proposed activation mechanisms radical versus non radical of different carbonaceous materials for ps or peroxymonosulfate pms sun et al 2014 lee et al 2015 chen et al 2016 chen and carroll 2016 cheng et al 2017 in addition guan et al 2017 have observed the formation of brominated polymeric products during the degradation of bromophenols by ps cnt however it is not known whether dimers trimers and other complexes of 2 4 4 hbp can be formed in ps cnt system in this context we systematically investigated the potential of using nitrogen doped carbonaceous materials to activate ps for 2 4 4 hbp removal the purposes of the present study are to 1 determine the optimal catalyst by considering the effects of n doped multiple carbonaceous materials different n sources and n doping contents on ps activation 2 examine the effects of reaction temperature solution ph and initial substrate concentration on 2 4 4 hbp removal efficiency in the catalyzed ps oxidation system 3 elucidate the activation mechanism of carbonaceous materials

the spectrophotometric method liang et al 2008 2 5 theoretical calculations the frontier electron density fed calculations were performed at the b3lyp 6 311 g level using the gaussian 09 program frequency analysis after structural geometry optimization was used to confirm a true energy minimum on the potential energy surface the values of 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo were calculated from gaussian output files to predict the possible reaction sites the homo and lumo denotes the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of as prepared catalysts a series of characterizations were performed to elucidate the specific properties of nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 which showed the best catalytic performance discussed below n doping did not change the external and internal structure of cnt oh and tubular structures were still observed from both sem and tem images of nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 figs 1 and 2 the ft ir spectra are shown in fig 3 and the absorption peak at 1630 cm 1 was ascribed to the valence oscillations of the c c bond in the benzene ring liu et al 2016b due to the relative low contents no obvious peaks of oh and n groups were observed in the ft ir spectra the three diffraction peaks at 26 5 42 4 and 54 7 in the xrd patterns fig 4 were indexed into the hexagonal graphite structures 002 100 and 004 planes respectively li et al 2003 the crystal structure of cnt oh showed no distinct changes after n doping in agreement with the sem and tem results according to the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms in fig 5 the bet surface area of cnt oh was calculated as 195 2 m2 g 1 and an increasing surface area of 237 3 m2 g 1 was obtained after n modification as seen from their raman spectra fig 6 two obvious peaks at 1341 and 1575 cm 1 corresponding to d and g band respectively were observed in the spectra of cnt oh and nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 d band represents the disorder and defects in the carbon lattice or the existence of amorphous carbon gupta et al 2014 tavares et al 2015 while g band reveals in plane tangential stretching of the carbon carbon bonds in the graphene structure gangupomu et al 2016 the intensities of both d and g band increased after n doping which was consistent with the findings of tavares et al 2015 the ratio i d i g as an indicator of the degree of disorder in carbon liu et al 2015 was 1 19 and 1 12 for cnt oh and nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 respectively suggesting that n doping did not change sp2 network of carbon the intensity of the second order g band namely g band is highly sensitive to charge transfer effects rao et al 1997 yan et al 2014 tavares et al 2015 compared with cnt oh the g band intensity also increased in nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 indicating that n doping can improve the concentration of charge carriers of cnt oh to achieve a better removal efficiency of contaminants the xps survey spectrum was used to investigate the chemical composition and the dopants of the catalyst fig 7 a showed the presence of c o and n in the nh4no3 cnt oh samples confirming the successful doping of n into cnt oh all recorded photoelectron lines were calibrated to the c 1s line at 284 ev and the binding energies of c 1s o 1s and n 1s were located at 285 0 ev 402 0 ev and 494 0 ev respectively the surface n doping content in nh4no3 cnt oh samples was generally very low ranging from 0 88 to 1 60 table 1 previously sharifi et al 2012 used the catalytic chemical vapor deposition method to synthesize n doped multi walled carbon nanotubes in which the n content reached a maximum of 9 2 ghosh et al 2010 used imidazole as a dual source of c and n to prepare n cnts and a higher n doping of 12 1 25 7 was achieved the different preparation methods and n sources may contribute to the different n doping level another possible explanation for the low n doping content in this work is that the cnts contain small amount of surface oxygen containing functional groups which would provide few active sites to react with n liu et al 2016b found that oxygen containing functional groups evidently promote the doping of nitrogen into cnts moreover a proportional relationship was not observed between the surface n doping content and the initial nh4no3 dosage the nh4no3 cnt oh 1 1 showed a high n doping content which subsequently increased slightly with further increase of the initial nh4no3 dosage previously lai et al 2012 and sun et al 2013 reported that three types of n existed in carbon nanomaterials in this work the peaks at 399 7 ev and 400 4 ev were assigned to the pyridinic six membered ring and pyrrolic five membered ring n respectively fig 7b the disappearance of graphitic quaternary n was attributed to the relatively low annealing temperature t 350 c with the increasing annealing temperature nitrogen bonding configurations could gradually transform from amino nitrogen to pyrrolic and pyridinic t 300 c and graphitic t 600 c nitrogen in sequence chen et al 2014 wu et al 2015 additionally it was observed that greater initial nh4no3 dosage resulted in higher pyridinic n content as 43 84 68 82 and 70 47 for nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 1 1 and 2 1 catalyst respectively however the total percentages of pyrrolic n were almost constant as 0 49 0 44 and 0 47 for nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 1 1 and 2 1 catalyst respectively 3 2 removal of 2 4 4 hbp by ps activation with different carbonaceous materials 3 2 1 the efficiency of different carbonaceous materials the removal of 2 4 4 hbp by pristine and urea doped cnt oh cnt cooh and go was in fig 8 a when ps was not present the adsorption after 4 h increased slightly for urea doped cnt oh and cnt cooh from 27 to 33 and 22 26 respectively opposite to the effect observed for go 9 for go and 2 for urea go fig s1a this fact may be due to the changed characteristics of these materials after n doping as seen from fig 8a the addition of carbonaceous materials especially the n doped materials increased the removal efficiency of 2 4 4 hbp compared to the effect of ps alone the removal of 2 4 4 hbp is ordered as urea cnt oh urea cnt cooh cnt oh cnt cooh urea go go and the specific value after 4 h is 100 93 89 57 47 and 18 respectively the relative hydrophilic property of cnt oh may result in high efficiency compared to cnt cooh in contrast n and s co doped cnt cooh n s cnt cooh showed a higher catalytic activity towards pms for benzophenone 4 removal than n and s co doped cnt oh n s cnt oh liu et al 2016b possibly due to the difference in target pollutant and cnt coohs in their study the cnt coohs used were carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes furthermore it is likely that the unique tubular property of carbon nanotubes regardless of the identity of cnt oh or cnt cooh makes their activation effects higher than that of go 3 2 2 nitrogen from different reagents based on the above result we chose cnt oh to compare the catalytic activity of n doping from urea nh4no3 indole and polyaniline the mass ratio of nitrogenous reagents to cnt oh is 1 1 as observed in fig s1b nh4no3 indole and polyaniline doped cnt oh decreased the adsorption of 2 4 4 hbp which was in contrast to the effect of urea furthermore different n sources showed different abilities for ps activation and the highest removal was observed in the ps nh4no3 cnt oh system fig 8b specifically the order of ps activation potential is nh4no3 cnt oh urea cnt oh indole cnt oh cnt oh polyaniline cnt oh with the 4 h removal efficiency of 100 100 93 89 and 76 respectively in fact the remaining 2 4 4 hbp concentration dropped rapidly to 20 in the first 0 5 h of ps oxidation by nh4no3 cnt oh this is possibly because the two different valence states of n in nh4no3 are more beneficial for electron transfer further improving the oxidation of 2 4 4 hbp the ps activation ability of polyaniline cnt oh was the lowest among the four different reagents and was even lower than that of the pristine cnt oh possibly due to the decreased number of reactive sites resulting from the macromolecular characteristics of polyaniline 3 2 3 different n doping content of nh4no3 cnt oh the effects of different n doping content on 2 4 4 hbp removal were studied at the nh4no3 cnt oh mass ratio of 0 5 1 1 1 and 2 1 as seen in fig s1c there was no significant adsorption except for the nh4no3 cnt oh 2 1 material no proportional relationship was observed between the initial nh4no3 dosage and the removal efficiency fig 8c from the xps analysis the actual n doping contents of these three carbonaceous materials were all very low compared to c and o regardless of the theoretical mass ratio of nh4no3 and cnt oh similar results were found by other researchers sun et al 2014 used nh4no3 as a source of n to prepare n doped cnt and only 0 88 n was doped into cnt liu et al 2016b synthesized n s cnt oh from thiourea and cnt oh and the n doping content was less than 5 in the two works the theoretical mass ratio of nitrogenous reagents to carbonaceous materials were both set at 1 1 the three nh4no3 cnt oh catalysts showed no obvious change in the 2 4 4 hbp removal which was related with the nearly identical percentage of pyrrolic n in the catalysts along with the bet surface areas in table 1 this result indicated that the surface area was not a key factor in ps activation similar to the findings of wang et al 2016 whereas pyrrolic n played a key role during the ps activation process considering the adsorption effect the nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 showed the best catalytic performance thus the investigations of reaction kinetics intermediates identification and degradation pathways were performed using this material in subsequent studies 3 3 reaction kinetics of 2 4 4 hbp in ps nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 system fig 9 shows the effects of solution ph reaction temperature and initial substrate concentration on 2 4 4 hbp degradation in ps nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 system as seen from fig 9a complete removal was all achieved in 2 h and there was no obvious difference in the removal rate at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 suggesting that ph has little effect on 2 4 4 hbp removal in the ps nh4no3 cnt oh system fig 9b shows the degradation of 2 4 4 hbp at three different reaction temperatures 25 35 and 45 c obviously high temperature enhanced the removal of 2 4 4 hbp to be specific the time required for complete removal of the substrate decreased from 2 h to 30 min with temperature rising from 25 c to 45 c unlike single ps or metal oxides catalyzed ps system pan et al 2017 2018 the overall effects of reaction temperature and solution ph are not obvious possibly because the catalyst has already possessed an excellent ability of ps activation under mild reaction conditions we have studied the effect of initial concentration 8 696 43 48 and 86 96 μm on 2 4 4 hbp removal as shown in fig 9c the removal rate decreased with increasing initial 2 4 4 hbp concentration for a given ps dosage the amount of radicals generated in solution is considered to be constant thus leading to a large removal efficiency at a low initial 2 4 4 hbp concentration further high substrate concentration would produce more reaction intermediates and their competition with 2 4 4 hbp for oxidants inevitably inhibited the removal of the parent compound in addition the nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 catalyst shows good recyclability and excellent stability refer to text s1 for details 3 4 the residual ps concentration in order to evaluate ps decomposition rate the residual ps concentrations were measured with or without the catalyst the results fig s2 showed that ps decomposed very slowly with no obvious concentration change in single ps system while the residual ps decreased to 68 after 2 h in presence of 100 mg l 1 catalyst thus the addition of catalyst could activate ps to produce much more reactive radicals for contaminant removal 3 5 activation mechanism it is well known that so4 and ho are the dominant radical species in the ps system while radical and non radical mechanisms are both reported in the reaction solutions containing ps and carbonaceous materials sun et al 2014 lee et al 2015 chen et al 2016 chen and carroll 2016 cheng et al 2017 hence to identify the activation mechanism of nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 for ps oxidation on 2 4 4 hbp meth and tba were used as radical scavengers to quench the related radicals due to their distinct reactivity with so4 and ho xu et al 2017 table s3 as seen from fig 10 a in single ps system the removal of 2 4 4 hbp was remarkably inhibited by the addition of meth and tba compared with the control the residual 2 4 4 hbp after 10 h increased from 79 to 93 and 92 respectively indicating that meth and tba can quench so4 and ho in solution as shown in fig 10b and fig s3 no inhibition in removal and even a slight promotion effect were observed in the five as prepared catalysts according to the experiment results in single ps system we may say that there were no aqueous so4 and ho in the catalytic degradation system similar findings were also obtained by chen et al 2016 and cheng et al 2017 nevertheless different activation mechanisms were observed the former study regarded so4 and ho as the major reactive species while the latter considered that 1o2 mainly contributed to the removal of target pollutant then furfuryl alcohol ffa and phenol two well known scavengers were adopted to elucidate the reaction mechanism and their specific second order rate constants for reactions are listed in table s3 since 1o2 did not exist after the adding of 100 mg l 1 cnt discussed below ffa was used to quench oh while phenol was used to quench both oh and so4 in this work as shown in fig 10c d and fig s4 5 a significant inhibitory effect on the removal of 2 4 4 hbp was found in the presence of ffa and especially phenol with the increasing ffa concentration this inhibitory effect became stronger more specifically in the presence of 43 48 mm ffa only 38 66 65 44 and 41 of the substrate were oxidized in 4 h for cnt oh urea cnt oh nh4no3 cnt oh indole cnt oh and polyaniline cnt oh respectively when phenol was present in the system little loss of 2 4 4 hbp was observed by contrast a near complete degradation was observed in the control condition except for polyaniline cnt oh this information combined with the radical quenching experimental results by meth and tba leads to the conclusion that so4 and ho on the catalyst surface worked together for the oxidation of 2 4 4 hbp it is known that the polarity and water solubility of the scavengers decrease in the order of meth tba ffa and phenol wohlfarth 2002 therefore the quenching inability of meth and tba can be explained by their hydrophilic nature which makes them difficult to closely approach the surface of catalyst however the relatively hydrophobic ffa and phenol can easily approach the catalyst surface further quenching surface radicals to inhibit the reaction lindsey and tarr 2000 ziajka and pasiuk bronikowska 2005 liang et al 2013 meanwhile epr experiments were conducted in order to verify the above speculation from the epr spectra we can obtain the following information 1 no peaks were observed for dmpo or temp solution or single nh4no3 cnt oh system 2 obvious peaks with hyperfine splitting constants of αn αh 14 9 g and αn 13 2 g αh 9 6 1 48 0 78 g fig 11 a and a typical three line with equal intensities fig 11b were observed in the single ps system corresponding to dmpo oh dmpo so4 adducts and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol n oxyl radical tmpn respectively demonstrating the existence of ho so4 radicals and 1o2 in this system 3 after the addition of 100 mg l 1 nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 into the ps solution the signals of ho and so4 radicals disappeared with the detection of the 5 5 dimethyl 2 oxo pyrroline 1 oxyl dmpox radical 4 the tmpn peak also disappeared when temp was used as the spin trapping reagent but no new signals were detected for point 3 very strong signal of dmpox may overlap the signal of the so4 radicals such that the peak of dmpo so4 adducts was not detected floyd and soong 1977 reported the existence of dmpox suggesting that it was derived from direct oxidation by single electron sources many studies have shown that dmpo may be oxidized into dmpox in strongly oxidative environments black and watson 1973 finkelstein et al 1980 rosen and rauckman 1980 thornalley et al 1983 bernofsky et al 1990 nishi et al 1992 mao et al 1994 bilski et al 1996 proved that dmpo could be oxidized by 1o2 into dmpox in an aqueous solution and the rate constant k was approximately 1 8 107 m 1 s 1 harbour et al 1980 in the single ps system 1o2 may be produced according to eqs 1 6 reshetnyak et al 2003 yan et al 2017 in this study the addition of nh4no3 cnt oh may immensely accelerate the reactions 1 5 and inhibit reaction 6 resulting in the accumulation of extraordinarily high amounts of ho this hypothesis was supported by the findings of some other researchers huang and huang 2009 x wang et al 2015 yao et al 2017 who showed that the occurrence of dmpox may be ascribed to the proliferation of ho in conclusion surface hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were responsible for the substrate oxidation during the reaction carbon nanotubes play a role of electron mediator and can provide many reaction sites for the oxidation reaction 1 s2o8 2 activators 2so4 2 so4 h2o ho so4 2 h 3 s2o8 2 h2o hso5 hso4 4 hso5 h2o h2o2 hso4 5 h2o2 2ho 6 2 ho 1 2 1o2 h2o 3 6 identification of intermediates and reaction pathways to facilitate products identification the reactions for lc ms analysis were carried out at a high 2 4 4 hbp concentration of 86 96 μm the total ion current tic chromatograms for samples at different reaction time are presented in fig s9a as seen the peaks of 2 4 4 hbp and its transformation products mainly appeared at 10 18 min according to the detailed ms ms analysis fig s10 the possible structures of its 10 intermediates were obtained as shown in fig s10 the difference between the measured mass and the theoretical mass was also calculated and the small error demonstrated the reliability of the detection method table s4 in the ms ms spectra the parent compound 2 4 4 hbp had two main fragment ions with the m z values of 135 00 and 93 03 which were ascribed to the cleavage of the c c bridge bond for compound p1 the ion peaks at m z 213 02 201 05 and 151 00 resulted from the losses of 2o co o and phenol group from the parent ion of m z 245 04 respectively thus p1 was recognized as a hydroxylated derivative of 2 4 4 hbp and its structure was shown in fig s10 the compound p2 has a parent ion of m z 243 02 and the successive losses of co and co o group generated a fragment ion peak at m z 171 04 the fragment ions with m z 135 00 and 91 02 were also observed which corresponded to the loss of 108 and 44 da from m z 243 02 in sequence suggesting the existence of phenol carbonyl and two hydroxyl groups in p2 because of the relatively low m z values p3 p5 and p7 should belong to the single benzene ring compounds the m z values of p8 p11 were about twice as high as that of 2 4 4 hbp accordingly we speculated that the polymerization reaction of the substrate may have occurred in the solution from fig s11a we can see that the intensities of the extracted ion current eic chromatograms of p8 p11 changed with the progress of reaction in each eic figure two obvious peaks are always present at different retention time indicating the existence of two isomers however their very similar properties lead to the difficult separation of the peaks on the basis of above discussion two feasible pathways were summarized in fig 12 pathway i was initiated by the attack of hydroxyl radicals on the c c bridge bond of 2 4 4 hbp resulting in the generation of monophenyl compounds p3 p6 however p6 was not detected in the ms spectra possibly because it was rapidly transformed into p7 in pathway ii the benzene ring of 2 4 4 hbp was attacked by hydroxyl radicals with the formation of hydroxylation intermediate p1 which was further transformed to p2 similar to the results of our previous study pan et al 2017 then two kinds of polymerization reactions occur on one hand the cross coupling reaction between 2 4 4 hbp and p2 generated p8 which underwent c c bridge bond cleavage and hydroxylation to give p9 and p10 respectively on the other hand because ps is a strong electron acceptor 2 4 4 hbp may lose an electron to form radicals and the self coupling of the 2 4 4 hbp radical yielded the dimer product p11 the eic chromatograms in ps cnt oh and ps system fig s11 b and c also revealed the existence of p8 p11 indicating that the presence of a strong electron acceptor such as ps instead of cnt oh or n doping induces the polymerization of 2 4 4 hbp furthermore we cannot detect trimers tetramers and other complexes of 2 4 4 hbp suggesting that aqueous 2 4 4 hbp prefers to polymerize into dimers when treated by ps coupling reactions are favorable to environmental pollution control in that these reactions tend to transform contaminants into less toxic derivatives and can prevent leaching of notoriously toxic and recalcitrant pollutants by immobilizing them tukayi et al 2011 however some previous studies have shown that bromophenols brps may be transformed into more toxic brominated polymeric products like hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers oh pbdes and biphenyls oh pbbs during oxidation process jiang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 guan et al 2017 due to the large difficulty in obtaining pure samples it is hard to evaluate the toxicity of these dimer products overall the physicochemical properties the environmental behavior and the ecotoxicity of the transformation intermediates of 2 4 4 hbp deserve further researches overall cleavage of c c bridge bond hydroxylation and polymerization were mainly involved in the degradation of 2 4 4 hbp in ps nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 system 3 7 mineralization the mineralization degree in reaction solution was evaluated by total organic carbon toc content it was clearly seen from fig s12 that toc level decreased over time but the mineralization degree only reached 49 after 4 h possibly due to the generation of refractory imtermediates such as p8 p11 3 8 fed calculations many previous studies have shown that theoretical calculations can provide insights into the reaction mechanism or possible reactive sites of organic pollutants wang et al 2004 qu et al 2012 xiao et al 2015 the values of 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo of each atom of 2 4 4 hbp are displayed in fig 13 it can be seen that the highest 2fed2 homo values are obtained for c 3 followed by c 5 and o 15 indicating that the highly substituted benzene ring was easily oxidized the isosurface of the homo orbital also showed that the electron density is mainly distributed on these sites making them more vulnerable for electron extraction however due to the steric hindrance effect it seems unlikely that the oxidants will attack the c 5 site therefore c 3 and o 15 are the sites where the local electrons may be easily shifted to ps coupling of the resulting radicals would lead to the formation of p11 in addition c 3 and c 7 showed the highest fed2 homo fed2 lumo values suggesting that the hydroxyl radical tends to attack these two sites this was confirmed by the observation of the hydroxylation product p1 and the bond cleavage products p3 p5 4 conclusions for three carbonaceous materials hydroxyl multi walled carbon nanotubes present good potential for activating ps and this potential is further enhanced by the doping of inorganic salt nh4no3 as the n source sample characterization revealed that tubular and crystal structures were still maintained after n doping into cnt oh pyridinic and pyrrolic n were found in nh4no3 cnt oh catalysts and pyrrolic n plays a significant role to activate ps under the conditions of 2 4 4 hbp 0 ps 0 1 500 ph0 7 t 25 c concentration of nh4no3 cnt oh 0 5 1 catalyst 100 mg l 1 43 48 μm 2 4 4 hbp was completely removed from aqueous solution in 2 h the removal efficiency of 2 4 4 hbp decreased with increasing initial substrate concentration while solution ph and temperature generally had little effects on the oxidation reaction according to radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra hydroxyl and sulfate radicals on the surface of the catalyst contributed to the substrate oxidation in the reaction process three primary reactions i e c c bridge bond cleavage hydroxylation and polymerization lead to the generation of 10 intermediates this work may provide

19424,raw water transportation pipelines are vital in an urban water supply system for transporting raw water to drinking water treatment plants this study investigated the effects of pipe material on nitrogen transformation microbial communities and characteristics of related function genes in paint lined steel pipe plsp and cement lined steel pipe clsp raw water model systems we established quantitative relationships between specific functional genes and change rates of nitrogen pollutants which were verified by field investigation on nitrogen pollutant transformations in real raw water transportation systems the results showed that the clsp produced higher ammonia nitrogen nh4 n transformation rates and higher effluent concentrations of nitrate nitrogen no3 n and dissolved organic nitrogen don than the plsp both pipes achieved high and stable nitrite nitrogen no2 n and low total nitrogen tn removal efficiency nitrification was found to be the dominant process in both model systems especially in the clsp characteristics of microbial communities and nitrogen functional genes which were analysed by high throughput pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr respectively varied between the two pipe systems nitrogen transformation pathways identified by path analysis were also different between the plsp and clsp due to different microbial community characteristics and synergistic effects of nitrogen functional genes in the clsp nh4 n no2 n with part denitrification was the primary transformation pathway of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n while only ammonia oxidization contributed to nh4 n transformation in the plsp no2 n no3 n was the main pathway involved in no2 n transformation and no3 n accumulation the tn removal showed complex relationships with nitrification denitrification and nitrogen fixation processes these findings provided molecular level insights into nitrogen pollutant transformations during the transportation of raw water through different types of pipes and technical support for the selection of raw water pipe materials in our study area the taihu basin china plsp was better than clsp for distributing raw water in a

transformation mechanism of nitrogen pollutants and the relationship between microbe and water quality in raw water pipeline are in an urgent need to be understood unfortunately limited knowledge is available regarding the microbial ecology of dwdss as previous studies have generally focused on temporal variations in microbial communities and ignored to establish relationships between nitrogen contaminants and microbes in raw water transportation systems many functional genes are involved in nitrogen transformation processes including ammonia monooxygenase amoa nitrite oxidoreductase nxra anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox periplasmic nitrate reductase napa membrane bound nitrate reductase narg nitrite reductase nirk nirs nitrous oxide reductase nosz and nitrogen fixation reductase nifh wang et al 2017 researchers have investigated the nitrogen cycling genes in wetlands wang et al 2015a stream sediments kim et al 2016 and water well medihala et al 2013 and demonstrated their contribution to transformation of nitrogen pollutants although the effects of functional genes on nitrogen removal processes have been widely recognized limited efforts have been made to investigate the detailed underlying molecular mechanism that governs nitrogen transformation and the relative contribution ranking of microbial genes associated with nitrogen cycling in raw water transportation systems as a result the lack of a quantitative link between nitrogen removal processes and nitrogen functional genes limits the ability to optimize processes of distributing raw water and to maintain high effluent quality there are many factors influencing water quality during transportation li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 such as pipe materials liu et al 2014 hu et al 2018 disinfectant residual gillespie et al 2014 hydraulic regime manuel et al 2007 douterelo et al 2013 temperature lin et al 2017 el chakhtoura et al 2015 water residence time machell et al 2010 and dissolved oxygen do niu et al 2016 several studies showed that water quality changed in pipes with different pipe materials due to different biofilms forming on pipe walls for transporting treated tap water lehtola et al 2004 biofilm microbial community growth rate and structure vary with the type of pipe used in dwdss lehtola et al 2005 alphaproteobacteria clostridiaand actinobacteria were detected in plastic pipes while alphaproteobacteria bacilli and gammaproteobacteria were predominant in cast iron pipes douterelo et al 2014a b however few studies have explored raw water transportation systems due to the inherent difficulty in accessing these ecosystems to the best of our knowledge there is no research focusing on raw water pipes that account for the effects of pipe material on the conversion of nitrogen pollutants and function genes the molecular level mechanisms remains unknown regarding the conversion of nitrogen pollutants in raw water pipes with different pipe materials this study aimed to fill the knowledge gap discussed above by investigating the microbial community specific nitrogen cycling genes and nitrogen pollutant conversion in model pipe systems made of different materials plsp and clsp were chosen because they are commonly used in raw water transportation systems in the taihu lake basin china according to our field surveys the quantitative relationships between nitrogen cycling genes and nitrogen pollutant conversion were established to identify the key pathway of nitrogen pollutant transformation in the plsp and clsp results may provide insights into molecule level mechanisms regulating nitrogenous pollutant transformations in raw water pipes and provide improved theoretical and technical support for the selection of raw water pipeline materials to achieve better quality of raw water transportation 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory reactors and operation two laboratory scale reactors were constructed for raw water transportation fig 1 consisting of three concentric nesting pipes with different pipe materials one reactor was plsp and the other clsp the outer pipe functioning as a protective shell was made of acrylic perspex for its high strength and durability the inner and middle pipes were comprised of the same material the sizes of the inner middle and outer pipes were 1 25 m of ø200 mm 1 4 m of ø400 mm and 1 4 m of ø420 mm respectively both reactors were fed with the same raw water withdrawn from the taihu basin china for one year of operation the physico chemical characteristics of the raw water are shown in table s1 supporting information time control switches and solenoid valves were installed at the inlet and outlet of the middle pipe to automatically maintain a hydraulic retention time of 6 h a propeller 5b15x72 shenzhen china and a single phase electric motor u60 40 220 shanghai china were installed at the inlet to continuously supply water at a constant velocity of 0 16 m s measured by an l type pitot tube l s 2 100 shanghai china and a differential pressure gauge jcyb 2000a shanghai china all operational parameters were chosen to simulate hydraulic conditions and shear stresses in real raw water pipes φ1800 mm velocity 1 4 m s in the taihu basin china 2 2 sampling and analysis water samples were taken from source water and reactor effluent every three days and were analysed immediately after filtration through a 0 45 μm membrane the do content was measured using a do meter sg6 mettler toledo international japan chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were determined following standard methods spea of china 2002 total dissolved nitrogen was measured by a toc tn analyser multi n c 2100 berlin germany the don content was calculated as the difference between total dissolved nitrogen tdn and the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n each reactor experiment was conducted over three months from december 2015 to february 2016 a sufficient long period that was found previously for biofilms to reach equilibrium hallam et al 2001 manuel et al 2007 pinto et al 2012 at this stage samples were representative of mature biofilms approximately 20 0 cm2 of biofilm sample was drawn from the two reactors at each sampling point during the four seasons replicates were collected from three separate locations on each pipe section at different sections a total of 32 samples were summarized in table 1 biofilms were drawn using sterile spatulas and placed in sterile containers followed by storage at 4 c until dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing three sample replicates were taken for dna analysis using the e z n a soil dna kit omega inc usa 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and dna detection kits qubit2 0 bioresearch china were used to check the quantity and purity of the extracted dna respectively the high throughput sequencing method was used to explore the microbial composition of the bacterial communities the amplification of the v1 v3 region in the bacterial 16s rrna gene was performed using the 341f 5 adaptor b barcode cct acg ggn ggc wgc ag 3 and 805r primers 5 adaptor b barcode gac tac hvg ggtatctaa tcc 3 detailed description of the methods are available in section s1 of the appendices 2 4 sequence analysis initial data were processed by prinseq http prinseq sourceforge net and mothur software http www mothur org to obtain the available sequences where the former was employed for any unknown nucleotides and trimming the optimized sequences to 150 bp in length and the latter contributed to the removal of chimeral interference the effective sequences were clustered in operational taxonomic units otus using uclust software http www drive5 com uclust at 97 similarity the taxonomic classification of sequences was accomplished using the ribosomal database project classifier that passed a threshold of 80 a heatmap was created using the r g plots package to show the similarities and differences between the eight samples and highlight the most abundant groups 2 5 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the qpcr method was used to investigate nitrogen transformation functional genes in order to understand their distribution characteristics in both reactors made of different materials the absolute abundances of nitrogen functional genes including anammox 16s rrna gene amoa nxra nifh napa narg nirs nirk nosz genes and bacterial 16s rrna gene were quantified using sybr green and a lightcycler 480 real time pcr detection system roche diagnostics meylan france the 20 μl reaction mixtures contained the following components 10 μl of sybrgreen qpcr master mix roche china 2 μl of template dna 0 4 μl each of the forward and reverse primers table s2 and 7 2 μl ddh2o millipore usa all of the samples were run in triplicate the protocol and parameters for each target gene were summarized in table s3 the plasmid dna of all target genes was manufactured by sangon biotech company shanghai china the plasmids were diluted along a 10 fold gradient to obtain the standard curve via pre experimentation the coefficient of determination values r2 exceeded 0 99 for all of the standard curves and replicates and the amplification efficiencies were 90 2 109 7 2 6 statistics analysis all data were evaluated using one way univariate analysis of variance anova to select reasonable measurements transformation or accumulation rates of nh4 n no2 n no3 n don and tn were calculated using the formulas reported by zhi and ji 2014 principal component analysis pca and redundancy analysis rda performed by canoco5 software http www canoco5 com were used to determine the main factors affecting community structure as well as the abundance of genes and to explain qualitative relationships between microbial communities and nitrogen pollutant conversion gao et al 2014 respectively functional genes normalized to the 16s rrna gene were exhibited as percentages of target gene copy numbers in the total bacterial community pearson correlation coefficients were obtained using spss statistics 20 ibm usa to investigate the ecological associations between functional genes and 16s rrna gene where p 0 05 indicates a significant relationship to establish quantitative relationships between nitrogen transformation rates and functional genes stepwise regression models were built using spss statistics 20 path analysis was used to quantify the relative contribution of each functional gene group to variations in nitrogen transformation rates wang et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of nitrogen pollutants fig 2 shows the influent and effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n don and tn and their conversion rates in the different material reactors overall the conversion of nitrogen pollutants demonstrated similar patterns in the two reactors during the operation phase 0 365 days the removal rate of no2 n following with the nh4 n removal rate dropped at the beginning and then sharply rose to a steady state possibly due to instability of biofilm formation during the initial days and the increasing amount of bacteria henceforth lehtola et al 2004 the no3 n which was present in greater concentration in the effluent than in the influent throughout the experimental period 0 365 day was consistent with the result found in real raw water transportation systems luo et al 2013 it might be due to the occurrence of nitrification and insufficient nutrition such as carbon sources for denitrification in raw water distribution pipes li et al 2015 ji et al 2012 indicated that high concentration of nh4 n can be one of the principal causes of a high nitrification rate in our simulators the influent nh4 n concentration was 0 362 1 170 favourable conditions for nitrification the conversion rates of no3 n increased during the first 100 days and decreased gradually until stably which was probably associated with the changing rate of nh4 n and no2 n an increase was noted in don concentration accumulation rate owing to the release of soluble microbial metabolism from biomass ni et al 2011 chen et al 2017 in addition tn fluctuated greatly during the yearlong period and did not have dependent relationship with the don accumulation rate he et al 2018 fig 2 showed a higher nh4 n conversion rate and no3 n don accumulation rate in clsp 43 35 51 20 23 03 42 98 and 47 93 73 58 respectively than those in plsp 35 42 41 70 18 17 33 64 and 29 32 42 00 respectively during stabilization 180 365 days the no2 n conversion rate was high in both systems the average tn removal rates in the two reactors were approximately 0 28 and 3 93 respectively for the clsp and plsp these results were consistent with real raw water pipes with different materials fed with the same water source in taihu basin china the water quality data is shown in table s4 the consistence with the real raw water pipes confirmed the feasibility and reliability of our model reactors in addition different conversion rates of nitrogen pollutants between two pipes could be related to particular microbial community characteristics of accumulated biofilm and synergistic effects of nitrogen genes which will be further investigated and discussed in 3 2 and 3 3 3 2 microbial community characteristics of biofilm the biofilm samples were analysed using the high throughput sequencing technology to investigate the characteristics of bacterial community in clsp and plsp all of the otus were grouped at a 97 sequence identity threshold the values of chao1 ace shannon and simpon estimators table s5 indicated higher richness and diversity microbial communities in clsp because of its rougher surface for biofilm adhesion busscher et al 2010 the occurrence of nitrification in the distribution network is positively correlated with the numbers of heterotrophic bacteria which explains the more nitrification in clsp lipponen et al 2002 as shown in fig 3 bioflim samples could be clustered into two groups according to clustering analysis and rda analysis indicating a clear separation between clsp and plsp at phylum and genus level respectively this separation showed that pipe material played an important role in microbial community structures the dominant bacterial phylas within the biofilms from clsp and plsp were calculated as the average of four biological replicates fig 3a proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were prevalent in both model systems because of their strong environmental adaptability which was consistent with the results found in real raw water transportation system zlatanović et al 2017 besides nitrospirae were slightly higher in clsp compared with plsp firmicutes and planctomycetes which play key roles in no2 n and nh4 n consumption via anaerobic ammonium oxidation processes were similar in the two biofilm samples du et al 2017 acidobacteria chloroflexi and cyanobacteria common in fresh water and biofilm environments xie et al 2012 were also identified in the two model systems at the genus level fig 3b sphingomonas was the dominant genera accounting for 22 01 27 79 in plsp and 7 45 18 06 in clsp its abundance might be due to the capability of some of these bacteria to produce large amounts of extracellular polymeric compounds which favoured biofilm formation bereschenko et al 2008 2010 obvious differences were observed in terms of the amount of pseudomonas 1 32 3 75 nitrospira 7 37 15 41 and bacillus 0 56 1 93 in the clsp compared with those in the plsp 5 32 14 32 1 18 8 50 and 0 05 0 16 respectively both systems underwent aerobic heterotrophic ammonium oxidation navarro noya et al 2013 in addition we detected that the relative abundance of hyphomicrobium in the samples obtained from the clsp was slightly higher than those in plsp bacterial communities in the two pipe materials were quite different at the genus level rda analyses were used to further evaluate the relationships between nitrogen transformation rate and community structure at genus level under various environmental conditions fig 3c the results of rda analysis p 0 05 indicated that the nh4 n and no2 n removal rates and no3 n accumulation rate were positively correlated with nitrospira and bacillus numbers which confirmed the hypothesis that nitrospira contributed the most to no2 n and nh4 n removal rates during distribution systems berry et al 2006 gulay et al 2016 consequently higher abundance of nitrospira and bacillus in the clsp led to better nh4 n and no2 n removal and higher accumulation of no3 n moreover nitrospirae were positively associated with temperature but negatively correlated with the influent nh4 n concentration and do level shu et al 2015 therefore nitrospirae flourished in summer during which the do level was lower because the temperature and influent no3 n concentration were higher than those in other seasons there was a strong relationship between the don accumulation rate of pseudomonas and hyphomicrobium the former had a negative relationship with the don accumulation rate while the latter was the opposite the concentration of don in the plsp effluent was lower than that in the clsp due to large amount of pseudomonas and less hyphomicrobium in the plsp wilhelm et al 2013 concluded that species sorting by environmental conditions was the major mechanism for shaping biofilm community structure in our reactors different environmental conditions in plsp and clsp led to distinct biofilm features particular microbial community characteristics of biofilm resulted in the different conversion of nitrogen pollutants in raw water transportation systems with different pipe material 3 3 influence of pipe material on nitrogen functional genes to evaluate the effects of pipe material on biofilm at gene levels qpcr was used to quantify the abundances of nitrogen transformation functional genes anammox amoa nxra nifh narg napa nirk nirs and nosz and 16s rrna gene fig 5 the number of genes were also expressed as the percentage of copy numbers of 16s rdna in each season which partly reflected the relative intensity of nitrogen transformation processes winkler et al 2011 the relationship between the 16s rrna and nine functional genes was calculated by pearson correlation analysis table s6 using spss statistics 20 ibm usa the amoa nxra and anammox bacterial 16s rrna were three main functional genes associated with nitrification bernhard et al 2010 the anammox 16s rrna gene as the marker of transformation of nh4 n and no2 n to n2 tsushima et al 2007 accounted for the largest proportion 2 375 1 205 among the nine functional genes in the two reactors and was nearly 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than the number of amoa copies which was often considered to be a marker of oxidation nh4 n to no2 n dionisi et al 2002 one possible explanation for this observation is that do was consumed primarily during the 6 h hydraulic retention time which created an anaerobic environment favourable for anammox bacteria enrichment fu et al 2016 the nitrite oxidase coding gene nxra was treated as the primary marker gene for nitrite oxidizing bacteria depending on the no2 n produced from ammonia oxidation performed by the amoa gene kandeler et al 2006 thus showing a trend similar to the amoa over time it was in accordance with other literature that found the same pattern in sewage sludge zeng et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 nirs was more abundant than any other denitrifying genes i e napa narg nosz nirs and nirk in both reactor systems followed by anammox henry et al 2006 which was similar to studies of biotrickling filters wang et al 2016 the abundances of narg were 10 20 fold higher than napa in two reactors and they were used as markers for the first denitrification step no3 n no2 n with different conditions lopez gutierrez et al 2004 indicating that narg might play a leading role in producing no2 n in our system bru et al 2007 the average copy number of napa was the lowest among nine nitrogen functional genes and the ranking order of others was anammox nirs nifh nirk nosz narg amoa nxra it was interesting to notice that the denitrification genes accounted for a large proportion than nitrification genes in both reactors especially in winter these phenomena were attributed to lower temperatures and significant increase in the concentration of nh4 n zhang et al 2013 according to previous studies on the structure of the denitrifying communities that were largely influenced by nh4 n concentration in natural water columns avrahami et al 2002 the abundances of these functional genes varied dramatically between the two pipe materials according to pca which showed a clear separation between two pipe materials and an aggregation within each system these results proved that pipe material was a key mechanism for the abundance of genes fig s1 which was further confirmed by anosim p 0 05 r 0 72 biofilm from clsp had more numerous copies of the 16s rrna gene than biofilm from plsp with considerable seasonal fluctuations within each system gómez silván et al 2014 fig 4 because both amoa and nxra required aerobic conditions poly et al 2008 the relative abundances of amoa were higher in the plsp 3 10 104 1 34 105 copies g with more sufficient do table s1 on the contrary anammox was inhibited at a high do concentration 3 0 mg l zhang et al 2015 and was less abundant in the plsp it should be noted that copy numbers of nitrifying functional genes amoa anammox and nxra were slightly higher in clsp which may explain the higher accumulation of no3 n and the increased removal rates of no2 n and nh4 n in clsp zhao et al 2014 in addition the copy numbers of five denitrifying functional genes i e napa narg nosz nirs and nirk were higher in the clsp possibly due to lower do level gómez et al 2002 3 4 qualitative and quantitative response relationships to evaluate quantitative contributions of functional genes to nitrogen removal in raw water transportation systems with different pipe materials stepwise regression models were applied to quantify linear relationships between functional genes and nitrogen transformation rates 16s rrna and nine functional genes were used as candidate variables in stepwise regression analyses to account for the nitrogen transformation mechanisms in different pipes linear relationships for nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn were successfully established in the two systems with r2 values ranging from 0 705 to 0 950 table 2 the roles played by given functional genes varied between the two reactors in the plsp the nh4 n transformation rate was determined jointly by amoa anammox and nxra in the clsp bacteria together with amoa anammox were positively correlated with the nh4 n transformation rate as mentioned above more denitrifying functional genes were found in bacterial than nitrifying functional genes especially in clsp thus the more denitrifying functional genes such as nirs to enhance no2 n consumption garcia lledo et al 2011 the more nh4 n transformed because lower no2 n concentrations reduced the toxic effects on ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob tan et al 2008 hence both ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying microorganisms contributed to nh4 n transformation in the clsp nxra as the only factor in no3 n transformation was negatively correlated to no3 n transformation in both plsp and clsp similar to the results reported by other studies pan et al 2017 as shown in table 2 the no2 n transformation rate in the plsp was mutually determined by three variables nxra amoa and amoa narg napa the first variable nxra was positively correlated with the no2 n removal rate while the second amoa was far from that the narg napa and amoa genes produced no2 n however the amoa gene was involved in nh4 n conversion which produced the substrate for further no2 n conversion dionisi et al 2002 therefore the third variable in the no2 n equation amoa narg napa promoted no2 n transformation in the clsp nxra coupled with amoa anammox exhibited a positive relationship with no2 n conversion similar to the observation in a trickling filter wang et al 2015b we speculated that aerobic ammonia oxidation was the primary mechanism to consume no2 n in the two pipe material systems but denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation did the opposite in both plsp and clsp the tn transformation rate was collectively determined by narg and nifh bacteria in the plsp the denitrification process directly provided substrates for the nitrogen fixation process hence the relative abundance of nifh genes promoted the removal of tn kim et al 2016 in the clsp nifh bacteria and amoa anammox bacteria were involved in the tn removal the first variable nifh bacteria was positively related with the tn removal rate because nitrogen in the air was reduced by nifh genes to nh4 n with the help of specific microbes in a process called nitrogen fixation raymond et al 2004 the second variable in the tn equation amoa anammox bacteria showed a negative relationship which is consistent with a previously identified relationship implying that nh4 n transformation conducted by amoa and anammox was the limiting factor in the tn removal rittman and langeland 1985 stated that denitrification could be inhibited when the do concentration was higher than 2 5 mg l thus the high influent do concentrations 3 61 9 03 mg l in the clsp and 4 88 10 05 mg l in the plsp in the two pipeline systems limited the activities of the denitrifying bacteria and the denitrification process in addition the limited abundance of narg napa as well as the high abundance of nitrification genes and concentration of nh4 n were also attributed to poor tn removal efficiency zhang et al 2015 3 5 nitrogen transformation pathways path analysis was used to further assess the relative contributions of the functional genes to nitrogen removal in raw water transportation systems with different pipe materials and to identify the key pathways to the transformation of nitrogen pollutants the positive or negative values in fig 5 indicated that the functional gene groups promoted or limited nitrogen removal respectively fig 5 clearly showed that the pathways of nitrogen transformation were different between the two pipe materials in the plsp amoa anammox and nxra had positive effects 0 929 on nh4 n transformation fig 5a indicating that ammonia oxidation liu et al 2012 a rate limiting step of the nitrification process was the key pathway in the plsp to transport nh4 n this result was consistent with the finding reported by mena et al 2017 in which the enrichment of amoa and anammox gene as well as ammonia oxidation were conducive to increase the nitrification capacity of bioreactors contrarily bacteria in the clsp demonstrated positive 1 087 impact on the nh4 n transformation rate fig 5b which was higher than amoa anammox 0 432 this result suggested that aerobic ammonia oxidation nh4 n no2 n with part denitrification was the primary nh4 n removal pathway in the clsp despite the dominant abundance of anammox in both systems its low sensitivity coefficient indicated a low reactivity in aerobic conditions hendrickx et al 2012 marc strous et al 2006 the main pathway for no3 n accumulation in both pipe systems was nxra with direct effects of 0 897 and 0 871 in the clsp and plsp respectively nxra contributed more 1 168 to no2 n transformation rates than amoa anammox 0 732 did in the clsp fig 5b the direct effects on no2 n transformation of nxra 4 730 amoa 3 331 and amoa narg napa 0 886 were obtained for the plsp fig 5a these results suggested that the high activity of nxra in spite of its less abundance controlled the no2 n removal and no3 n accumulation because nxra consumed limited o2 and no2 n before aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria facilitating no3 n accumulation pang et al 2015 therefore the transformation rates of no2 n were high in both plsp and clsp higher effluent no3 n concentrations in the clsp can be ascribed to higher transformation rates of nh4 n martens habbena et al 2009 additionally anammox genes did not appear in the pathway of no2 n transformation and no3 n accumulation implying that anaerobic ammonia oxidation was inferior to aerobic ammonia oxidation in nitrification in our systems especially in the promotion of no2 n transformation and no3 n accumulation in a word we speculated that no2 n no3 n was the main pathway for no2 n transformation and no3 n accumulation in both the plsp and clsp the anammox genes had slightly higher influence 0 562 on the tn removal rate than nifh bacteria 0 355 and amoa anammox bacteria 0 392 did in the clsp fig 5b in spite of the high anammox abundance the anammox was inactive possibly due to the competition with the nxra gene for no2 n and aerobic conditions according to pang et al 2015 the tn removal rate limited by anammox inhibition nh4 n no2 n no3 n had complex relationships with the nitrification denitrification and nitrogen fixation process no3 n no2 n was the main pathway influencing the tn removal rate in the plsp fig 5a which was remarked by narg however it was shared by the nitrogen fixation process 0 492 which inhibited the tn removal therefore the tn removal rate was low during the experiments in the clsp and plsp to sum up we suggested that plsp is better for distributing raw water especially in the taihu basin china with a transportation distance shorter than 15 28 km due to the lower effluent concentrations of don and no3 n as well as less abundance of microorganisms however for a longer distance of raw water transportation clsp may have more potential of denitrification which is helpful to remove nitrogen pollutants in raw water 4 conclusion in our study two raw water transportation reactors with different pipe materials i e plsp and clsp were constructed to investigate the effect of pipe material on nitrogen transformation microbial communities and related function genes major conclusions are drawn as follows the clsp showed higher nh4 n transformation rates and effluent no3 n concentrations than the plsp both pipe types achieved high and stable no2 n concentrations and low tn removal efficiencies nitrification was the most prominent in raw water transportation systems especially in the clsp higher richness and diversity of microbial communities were found in the clsp sphingomonas and pseudomonas were dominant in the plsp and sphingomonas and nitrospira in the clsp pipe material influenced microbial communities in the biofilm pipe material influenced the abundance of nitrogen functional genes the absolute abundance of nitrogen functional genes was slightly higher in the clsp except napa nitrogen transformation pathways were different between the plsp and clsp systems due to different microbial community characteristics and synergistic effects of nitrogen function genes plsp is better than clsp for distributing raw water especially in the taihu basin china due to its lower effluent concentrations of don and no3 n and lower richness

19424,raw water transportation pipelines are vital in an urban water supply system for transporting raw water to drinking water treatment plants this study investigated the effects of pipe material on nitrogen transformation microbial communities and characteristics of related function genes in paint lined steel pipe plsp and cement lined steel pipe clsp raw water model systems we established quantitative relationships between specific functional genes and change rates of nitrogen pollutants which were verified by field investigation on nitrogen pollutant transformations in real raw water transportation systems the results showed that the clsp produced higher ammonia nitrogen nh4 n transformation rates and higher effluent concentrations of nitrate nitrogen no3 n and dissolved organic nitrogen don than the plsp both pipes achieved high and stable nitrite nitrogen no2 n and low total nitrogen tn removal efficiency nitrification was found to be the dominant process in both model systems especially in the clsp characteristics of microbial communities and nitrogen functional genes which were analysed by high throughput pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr respectively varied between the two pipe systems nitrogen transformation pathways identified by path analysis were also different between the plsp and clsp due to different microbial community characteristics and synergistic effects of nitrogen functional genes in the clsp nh4 n no2 n with part denitrification was the primary transformation pathway of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n while only ammonia oxidization contributed to nh4 n transformation in the plsp no2 n no3 n was the main pathway involved in no2 n transformation and no3 n accumulation the tn removal showed complex relationships with nitrification denitrification and nitrogen fixation processes these findings provided molecular level insights into nitrogen pollutant transformations during the transportation of raw water through different types of pipes and technical support for the selection of raw water pipe materials in our study area the taihu basin china plsp was better than clsp for distributing raw water in a short transportation distance due to the lower effluent concentrations of don and no3 n and less abundance of microorganisms graphical abstract image 1 keywords raw water transportation model system

have been successfully applied in water pre treatment to remove nitrogen and organic pollutants han et al 2013 however limited research has been focused on changes of nitrogen pollutants in raw water

the detailed underlying molecular mechanism that governs nitrogen transformation and the relative contribution ranking of microbial genes associated with nitrogen cycling in raw water transportation

al 2016 several studies showed that water quality changed in pipes with different pipe materials due to different biofilms forming on pipe walls for transporting treated tap water lehtola et al 2004 biofilm microbial community growth rate and structure vary with the type of pipe used in dwdss lehtola et al 2005 alphaproteobacteria clostridiaand actinobacteria were detected in plastic pipes while alphaproteobacteria bacilli and gammaproteobacteria were predominant in cast iron pipes douterelo et al 2014a b however few studies have explored raw water transportation systems due to the inherent difficulty in accessing these ecosystems to the best of our knowledge there is no research focusing on raw water pipes that account for the effects of pipe material on the conversion of nitrogen pollutants and function genes the molecular level mechanisms remains unknown regarding the conversion of nitrogen pollutants in raw water pipes with different pipe materials this study aimed to fill the knowledge gap discussed above by investigating the microbial community specific nitrogen cycling genes and nitrogen pollutant conversion in model pipe systems made of different materials plsp and clsp were chosen because they are commonly used in raw water transportation systems in the taihu lake basin china according to our field surveys the quantitative relationships between nitrogen cycling genes and nitrogen pollutant conversion were established to identify the key pathway of nitrogen pollutant transformation in the plsp and clsp results may provide insights into molecule level mechanisms regulating nitrogenous pollutant transformations in raw water pipes and provide improved theoretical and technical support for the selection of raw water pipeline materials to achieve better quality of raw water transportation 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory reactors and operation two laboratory scale reactors were constructed for raw water transportation fig 1 consisting of three concentric nesting pipes with different pipe materials one reactor was plsp and the other clsp the outer pipe functioning as a protective shell was made of acrylic perspex for its high strength and durability the inner and middle pipes were comprised of the same material the sizes of the inner middle and outer pipes were 1 25 m of ø200 mm 1 4 m of ø400 mm and 1 4 m of ø420 mm respectively both reactors were fed with the same raw water withdrawn from the taihu basin china for one year of operation the physico chemical characteristics of the raw water are shown in table s1 supporting information time control switches and solenoid valves were installed at the inlet and outlet of the middle pipe to automatically maintain a hydraulic retention time of 6 h a propeller 5b15x72 shenzhen china and a single phase electric motor u60 40 220 shanghai china were installed at the inlet to continuously supply water at a constant velocity of 0 16 m s measured by an l type pitot tube l s 2 100 shanghai china and a differential pressure gauge jcyb 2000a shanghai china all operational parameters were chosen to simulate hydraulic conditions and shear stresses in real raw water pipes φ1800 mm velocity 1 4 m s in the taihu basin china 2 2 sampling and analysis water samples were taken from source water and reactor effluent every three days and were analysed immediately after filtration through a 0 45 μm membrane the do content was measured using a do meter sg6 mettler toledo international japan chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were determined following standard methods spea of china 2002 total dissolved nitrogen was measured by a toc tn analyser multi n c 2100 berlin germany the don content was calculated as the difference between total dissolved nitrogen tdn and the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n each reactor experiment was conducted over three months from december 2015 to february 2016 a sufficient long period that was found previously for biofilms to reach equilibrium hallam et al 2001 manuel et al 2007 pinto et al 2012 at this stage samples were representative of mature biofilms approximately 20 0 cm2 of biofilm sample was drawn from the two reactors at each sampling point during the four seasons replicates were collected from three separate locations on each pipe section at different sections a total of 32 samples were summarized in table 1 biofilms were drawn using sterile spatulas and placed in sterile containers followed by storage at 4 c until dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing three sample replicates were taken for dna analysis using the e z n a soil dna kit omega inc usa 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and dna detection kits qubit2 0 bioresearch china were used to check the quantity and purity of the extracted dna respectively the high throughput sequencing method was used to explore the microbial composition of the bacterial communities the amplification of the v1 v3 region in the bacterial 16s rrna gene was performed using the 341f 5 adaptor b barcode cct acg ggn ggc wgc ag 3 and 805r primers 5 adaptor b barcode gac tac hvg ggtatctaa tcc 3 detailed description of the methods are available in section s1 of the appendices 2 4 sequence analysis initial data were processed by prinseq http prinseq sourceforge net and mothur software http www mothur org to obtain the available sequences where the former was employed for any unknown nucleotides and trimming the optimized sequences to 150 bp in length and the latter contributed to the removal of chimeral interference the effective sequences were clustered in operational taxonomic units otus using uclust software http www drive5 com uclust at 97 similarity the taxonomic classification of sequences was accomplished using the ribosomal database project classifier that passed a threshold of 80 a heatmap was created using the r g plots package to show the similarities and differences between the eight samples and highlight the most abundant groups 2 5 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the qpcr method was used to investigate nitrogen transformation functional genes in order to understand their distribution characteristics in both reactors made of different materials the absolute abundances of nitrogen functional genes including anammox 16s rrna gene amoa nxra nifh napa narg nirs nirk nosz genes and bacterial 16s rrna gene were quantified using sybr green and a lightcycler 480 real time pcr detection system roche diagnostics meylan france the 20 μl reaction mixtures contained the following components 10 μl of sybrgreen qpcr master mix roche china 2 μl of template dna 0 4 μl each of the forward and reverse primers table s2 and 7 2 μl ddh2o millipore usa all of the samples were run in triplicate the protocol and parameters for each target gene were summarized in table s3 the plasmid dna of all target genes was manufactured by sangon biotech company shanghai china the plasmids were diluted along a 10 fold gradient to obtain the standard curve via pre experimentation the coefficient of determination values r2 exceeded 0 99 for all of the standard curves and replicates and the amplification efficiencies were 90 2 109 7 2 6 statistics analysis all data were evaluated using one way univariate analysis of variance anova to select reasonable measurements transformation or accumulation rates of nh4 n no2 n no3 n don and tn were calculated using the formulas reported by zhi and ji 2014 principal component analysis pca and redundancy analysis rda performed by canoco5 software http www canoco5 com were used to determine the main factors affecting community structure as well as the abundance of genes and to explain qualitative relationships between microbial communities and nitrogen pollutant conversion gao et al 2014 respectively functional genes normalized to the 16s rrna gene were exhibited as percentages of target gene copy numbers in the total bacterial community pearson correlation coefficients were obtained using spss statistics 20 ibm usa to investigate the ecological associations between functional genes and 16s rrna gene where p 0 05 indicates a significant relationship to establish quantitative relationships between nitrogen transformation rates and functional genes stepwise regression models were built using spss statistics 20 path analysis was used to quantify the relative contribution of each functional gene group to variations in nitrogen transformation rates wang et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of nitrogen pollutants fig 2 shows the influent and effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n don and tn and their conversion rates in the different material reactors overall the conversion of nitrogen pollutants demonstrated similar patterns in the two reactors during the operation phase 0 365 days the removal rate of no2 n following with the nh4 n removal rate dropped at the beginning and then sharply rose to a steady state possibly due to instability of biofilm formation during the initial days and the increasing amount of bacteria henceforth lehtola et al 2004 the no3 n which was present in greater concentration in the effluent than in the influent throughout the experimental period 0 365 day was consistent with the result found in real raw water transportation systems luo et al 2013 it might be due to the occurrence of nitrification and insufficient nutrition such as carbon sources for denitrification in raw water distribution pipes li et al 2015 ji et al 2012 indicated that high concentration of nh4 n can be one of the principal causes of a high nitrification rate in our simulators the influent nh4 n concentration was 0 362 1 170 favourable conditions for nitrification the conversion rates of no3 n increased during the first 100 days and decreased gradually until stably which was probably associated with the changing rate of nh4 n and no2 n an increase was noted in don concentration accumulation rate owing to the release of soluble microbial metabolism from biomass ni et al 2011 chen et al 2017 in addition tn fluctuated greatly during the yearlong period and did not have dependent relationship with the don accumulation rate he et al 2018 fig 2 showed a higher nh4 n conversion rate and no3 n don accumulation rate in clsp 43 35 51 20 23 03 42 98 and 47 93 73 58 respectively than those in plsp 35 42 41 70 18 17 33 64 and 29 32 42 00 respectively during stabilization 180 365 days the no2 n conversion rate was high in both systems the average tn removal rates in the two reactors were approximately 0 28 and 3 93 respectively for the clsp and plsp these results were consistent with real raw water pipes with different materials fed with the same water source in taihu basin china the water quality data is shown in table s4 the consistence with the real raw water pipes confirmed the feasibility and reliability of our model reactors in addition different conversion rates of nitrogen pollutants between two pipes could be related to particular microbial community characteristics of accumulated biofilm and synergistic effects of nitrogen genes which will be further investigated and discussed in 3 2 and 3 3 3 2 microbial community characteristics of biofilm the biofilm samples were analysed using the high throughput sequencing technology to investigate the characteristics of bacterial community in clsp and plsp all of the otus were grouped at a 97 sequence identity threshold the values of chao1 ace shannon and simpon estimators table s5 indicated higher richness and diversity microbial communities in clsp because of its rougher surface for biofilm adhesion busscher et al 2010 the occurrence of nitrification in the distribution network is positively correlated with the numbers of heterotrophic bacteria which explains the more nitrification in clsp lipponen et al 2002 as shown in fig 3 bioflim samples could be clustered into two groups according to clustering analysis and rda analysis indicating a clear separation between clsp and plsp at phylum and genus level respectively this separation showed that pipe material played an important role in microbial community structures the dominant bacterial phylas within the biofilms from clsp and plsp were calculated as the average of four biological replicates fig 3a proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were prevalent in both model systems because of their strong environmental adaptability which was consistent with the results found in real raw water transportation system zlatanović et al 2017 besides nitrospirae were slightly higher in clsp compared with plsp firmicutes and planctomycetes which play key roles in no2 n and nh4 n consumption via anaerobic ammonium oxidation processes were similar in the two biofilm samples du et al 2017 acidobacteria chloroflexi and cyanobacteria common in fresh water and biofilm environments xie et al 2012 were also identified in the two model systems at the genus level fig 3b sphingomonas was the dominant genera accounting for 22 01 27 79 in plsp and 7 45 18 06 in clsp its abundance might be due to the capability of some of these bacteria to produce large amounts of extracellular polymeric compounds which favoured biofilm formation bereschenko et al 2008 2010 obvious differences were observed in terms of the amount of pseudomonas 1 32 3 75 nitrospira 7 37 15 41 and bacillus 0 56 1 93 in the clsp compared with those in the plsp 5 32 14 32 1 18 8 50 and 0 05 0 16 respectively both systems underwent aerobic heterotrophic ammonium oxidation navarro noya et al 2013 in addition we detected that the relative abundance of hyphomicrobium in the samples obtained from the clsp was slightly higher than those in plsp bacterial communities in the two pipe materials were quite different at the genus level rda analyses were used to further evaluate the relationships between nitrogen transformation rate and community structure at genus level under various environmental conditions fig 3c the results of rda analysis p 0 05 indicated that the nh4 n and no2 n removal rates and no3 n accumulation rate were positively correlated with nitrospira and bacillus numbers which confirmed the hypothesis that nitrospira contributed the most to no2 n and nh4 n removal rates during distribution systems berry et al 2006 gulay et al 2016 consequently higher abundance of nitrospira and bacillus in the clsp led to better nh4 n and no2 n removal and higher accumulation of no3 n moreover nitrospirae were positively associated with temperature but negatively correlated with the influent nh4 n concentration and do level shu et al 2015 therefore nitrospirae flourished in summer during which the do level was lower because the temperature and influent no3 n concentration were higher than those in other seasons there was a strong relationship between the don accumulation rate of pseudomonas and hyphomicrobium the former had a negative relationship with the don accumulation rate while the latter was the opposite the concentration of don in the plsp effluent was lower than that in the clsp due to large amount of pseudomonas and less hyphomicrobium in the plsp wilhelm et al 2013 concluded that species sorting by environmental conditions was the major mechanism for shaping biofilm community structure in our reactors different environmental conditions in plsp and clsp led to distinct biofilm features particular microbial community characteristics of biofilm resulted in the different conversion of nitrogen pollutants in raw water transportation systems with different pipe material 3 3 influence of pipe material on nitrogen functional genes to evaluate the effects of pipe material on biofilm at gene levels qpcr was used to quantify the abundances of nitrogen transformation functional genes anammox amoa nxra nifh narg napa nirk nirs and nosz and 16s rrna gene fig 5 the number of genes were also expressed as the percentage of copy numbers of 16s rdna in each season which partly reflected the relative intensity of nitrogen transformation processes winkler et al 2011 the relationship between the 16s rrna and nine functional genes was calculated by pearson correlation analysis table s6 using spss statistics 20 ibm usa the amoa nxra and anammox bacterial 16s rrna were three main functional genes associated with nitrification bernhard et al 2010 the anammox 16s rrna gene as the marker of transformation of nh4 n and no2 n to n2 tsushima et al 2007 accounted for the largest proportion 2 375 1 205 among the nine functional genes in the two reactors and was nearly 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than the number of amoa copies which was often considered to be a marker of oxidation nh4 n to no2 n dionisi et al 2002 one possible explanation for this observation is that do was consumed primarily during the 6 h hydraulic retention time which created an anaerobic environment favourable for anammox bacteria enrichment fu et al 2016 the nitrite oxidase coding gene nxra was treated as the primary marker gene for nitrite oxidizing bacteria depending on the no2 n produced from ammonia oxidation performed by the amoa gene kandeler et al 2006 thus showing a trend similar to the amoa over time it was in accordance with other literature that found the same pattern in sewage sludge zeng et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 nirs was more abundant than any other denitrifying genes i e napa narg nosz nirs and nirk in both reactor systems followed by anammox henry et al 2006 which was similar to studies of biotrickling filters wang et al 2016 the abundances of narg were 10 20 fold higher than napa in two reactors and they were used as markers for the first denitrification step no3 n no2 n with different conditions lopez gutierrez et al 2004 indicating that narg might play a leading role in producing no2 n in our system bru et al 2007 the average copy number of napa was the lowest among nine nitrogen functional genes and the ranking order of others was anammox nirs nifh nirk nosz narg amoa nxra it was interesting to notice that the denitrification genes accounted for a large proportion than nitrification genes in both reactors especially in winter these phenomena were attributed to lower temperatures and significant increase in the concentration of nh4 n zhang et al 2013 according to previous studies on the structure of the denitrifying communities that were largely influenced by nh4 n concentration in natural water columns avrahami et al 2002 the abundances of these functional genes varied dramatically between the two pipe materials according to pca which showed a clear separation between two pipe materials and an aggregation within each system these results proved that pipe material was a key mechanism for the abundance of genes fig s1 which was further confirmed by anosim p 0 05 r 0 72 biofilm from clsp had more numerous copies of the 16s rrna gene than biofilm from plsp with considerable seasonal fluctuations within each system gómez silván et al 2014 fig 4 because both amoa and nxra required aerobic conditions poly et al 2008 the relative abundances of amoa were higher in the plsp 3 10 104 1 34 105 copies g with more sufficient do table s1 on the contrary anammox was inhibited at a high do concentration 3 0 mg l zhang et al 2015 and was less abundant in the plsp it should be noted that copy numbers of nitrifying functional genes amoa anammox and nxra were slightly higher in clsp which may explain the higher accumulation of no3 n and the increased removal rates of no2 n and nh4 n in clsp zhao et al 2014 in addition the copy numbers of five denitrifying functional genes i e napa narg nosz nirs and nirk were higher in the clsp possibly due to lower do level gómez et al 2002 3 4 qualitative and quantitative response relationships to evaluate quantitative contributions of functional genes to nitrogen removal in raw water transportation systems with different pipe materials stepwise regression models were applied to quantify linear relationships between functional genes and nitrogen transformation rates 16s rrna and nine functional genes were used as candidate variables in stepwise regression analyses to account for the nitrogen transformation mechanisms in different pipes linear relationships for nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn were successfully established in the two systems with r2 values ranging from 0 705 to 0 950 table 2 the roles played by given functional genes varied between the two reactors in the plsp the nh4 n transformation rate was determined jointly by amoa anammox and nxra in the clsp bacteria together with amoa anammox were positively correlated with the nh4 n transformation rate as mentioned above more denitrifying functional genes were found in bacterial than nitrifying functional genes especially in clsp thus the more denitrifying functional genes such as nirs to enhance no2 n consumption garcia lledo et al 2011 the more nh4 n transformed because lower no2 n concentrations reduced the toxic effects on ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob tan et al 2008 hence both ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying microorganisms contributed to nh4 n transformation in the clsp nxra as the only factor in no3 n transformation was negatively correlated to no3 n transformation in both plsp and clsp similar to the results reported by other studies pan et al 2017 as shown in table 2 the no2 n transformation rate in the plsp was mutually determined by three variables nxra amoa and amoa narg napa the first variable nxra was positively correlated with the no2 n removal rate while the second amoa was far from that the narg napa and amoa genes produced no2 n however the amoa gene was involved in nh4 n conversion which produced the substrate for further no2 n conversion dionisi et al 2002 therefore the third variable in the no2 n equation amoa narg napa promoted no2 n transformation in the clsp nxra coupled with amoa anammox exhibited a positive relationship with no2 n conversion similar to the observation in a trickling filter wang et al 2015b we speculated that aerobic ammonia oxidation was the primary mechanism to consume no2 n in the two pipe material systems but denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation did the opposite in both plsp and clsp the tn transformation rate was collectively determined by narg and nifh bacteria in the plsp the denitrification process directly provided substrates for the nitrogen fixation process hence the relative abundance of nifh genes promoted the removal of tn kim et al 2016 in the clsp nifh bacteria and amoa anammox bacteria were involved in the tn removal the first variable nifh bacteria was positively related with the tn removal rate because nitrogen in the air was reduced by nifh genes to nh4 n with the help of specific microbes in a process called nitrogen fixation raymond et al 2004 the second variable in the tn equation amoa anammox bacteria showed a negative relationship which is consistent with a previously identified relationship implying that nh4 n transformation conducted by amoa and anammox was the limiting factor in the tn removal rittman and langeland 1985 stated that denitrification could be inhibited when the do concentration was higher than 2 5 mg l thus the high influent do concentrations 3 61 9 03 mg l in the clsp and 4 88 10 05 mg l in the plsp in the two pipeline systems limited the activities of the denitrifying bacteria and the denitrification process in addition the limited abundance of narg napa as well as the high abundance of nitrification genes and concentration of nh4 n were also attributed to poor tn removal efficiency zhang et al 2015 3 5 nitrogen transformation pathways path analysis was used to further assess the relative contributions of the functional genes to nitrogen removal in raw water transportation systems with different pipe materials and to identify the key pathways to the transformation of nitrogen pollutants the positive or negative values in fig 5 indicated that the functional gene groups promoted or limited nitrogen removal respectively fig 5 clearly showed that the pathways of nitrogen transformation were different between the two pipe materials in the plsp amoa anammox and nxra had positive effects 0 929 on nh4 n transformation fig 5a indicating that ammonia oxidation liu et al 2012 a rate limiting step of the nitrification process was the key pathway in the plsp to transport nh4 n this result was consistent with the finding reported by mena et al 2017 in which the enrichment of amoa and anammox gene as well as ammonia oxidation were conducive to increase the nitrification capacity of bioreactors contrarily bacteria in the clsp demonstrated positive 1 087 impact on the nh4 n transformation rate fig 5b which was higher than amoa anammox 0 432 this result suggested that aerobic ammonia oxidation nh4 n no2 n with part denitrification was the primary nh4 n removal pathway in the clsp despite the dominant abundance of anammox in both systems its low sensitivity coefficient indicated a low reactivity in aerobic conditions hendrickx et al 2012 marc strous et al 2006 the main pathway for no3 n accumulation in both pipe systems was nxra with direct effects of 0 897 and 0 871 in the clsp and plsp respectively nxra contributed more 1 168 to no2 n transformation rates than amoa anammox 0 732 did in the clsp fig 5b the direct effects on no2 n transformation of nxra 4 730 amoa 3 331 and amoa narg napa 0 886 were obtained for the plsp fig 5a these results suggested that the high activity of nxra in spite of its less abundance controlled the no2 n removal and no3 n accumulation because nxra consumed limited o2 and no2 n before aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria facilitating no3 n accumulation pang et al 2015 therefore the transformation rates of no2 n were high in both plsp and clsp higher effluent no3 n concentrations in the clsp can be ascribed to higher transformation rates of nh4 n martens habbena et al 2009 additionally anammox genes did not appear in the pathway of no2 n transformation and no3 n accumulation implying that anaerobic ammonia oxidation was inferior to aerobic ammonia oxidation in nitrification in our systems especially in the promotion of no2 n transformation and no3 n accumulation in a word we speculated that no2 n no3 n was the main pathway for no2 n transformation and no3 n accumulation in both the plsp and clsp the anammox genes had slightly higher influence 0 562 on the tn removal rate than nifh bacteria 0 355 and amoa anammox bacteria 0 392 did in the clsp fig 5b in spite of the high anammox abundance the anammox was inactive possibly due to the competition with the nxra gene for no2 n and aerobic conditions according to pang et al 2015 the tn removal rate limited by anammox inhibition nh4 n no2 n no3 n had complex relationships with the nitrification denitrification and nitrogen fixation process no3 n no2 n was the main pathway influencing the tn removal rate in the plsp fig 5a which was remarked by narg however it was shared by the nitrogen fixation process 0 492 which inhibited the tn removal therefore the tn removal rate was low during the experiments in the clsp and plsp to sum up we suggested that plsp is better for distributing raw water especially in the taihu basin china with a transportation distance shorter than 15 28 km due to the lower effluent concentrations of don and no3 n as well as less abundance of microorganisms however for a longer distance of raw water transportation clsp may have more potential of denitrification which is helpful to remove nitrogen pollutants in raw water 4 conclusion in our study two raw water transportation reactors with different pipe materials i e plsp and clsp were constructed to investigate the effect of pipe material on nitrogen transformation microbial communities and related function genes major conclusions are drawn as follows the clsp showed higher nh4 n transformation rates and effluent no3 n concentrations than the plsp both pipe types achieved high and stable no2 n concentrations and low tn removal efficiencies nitrification was the most prominent in raw water transportation systems especially in the clsp higher richness and diversity of microbial communities were found in the clsp sphingomonas and pseudomonas were dominant in the plsp and sphingomonas and nitrospira in the clsp pipe material influenced microbial communities in the biofilm pipe material influenced the abundance of nitrogen functional genes the absolute abundance of nitrogen functional genes was slightly higher in the clsp except napa nitrogen transformation pathways were different between the plsp and clsp systems due to different microbial community characteristics and synergistic effects of nitrogen function genes plsp is better than clsp for distributing raw water especially in the taihu basin china due to its lower effluent concentrations of don and no3 n and lower richness
