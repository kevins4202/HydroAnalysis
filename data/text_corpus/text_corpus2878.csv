acrylamide crosslinker the polymerization reaction was performed using 1 mol of ammonium persulfate as initiator and varying both the monomer concentration 10 25 mmol l and the percentage of crosslinker 4 and 8 mol the degree of modification dm and water absorption capacity wac at different phs were calculated gravimetrically these modified membranes were characterized by ftir sem tga electrokinetic potential and permeability the cr vi retention capacity of the modified membranes was evaluated at different phs the dm values were between 23 46 and 41 82 the highest wac was for the membrane prepared with 25 mmol l of monomer and 4 mol of crosslinker independent of the ph value the ftir characterization showed absorption bands confirming this membrane modification the sem analysis showed the morphological changes of the membranes by the presence of interpolymeric networks tga showed a typical thermogravimetric curve of the polymers that contain quaternary ammonium groups modified ultrafiltration membranes exhibited good thermal stability electrokinetic potential revealed that the modified membrane is cationic in a wide range of ph and permeability test showed that all the modified membranes decrease the volumetric flux the results of cr vi retention indicate that it is possible to remove this metal at different phs 3 6 and 9 highlighting the highest retention at ph 6 reaching a value of 94 when 20 mg l of chromium vi was used in the feed keywords hexavalent chromium membrane modification metal retention polymer 1 introduction although chemical industries can enhance the economic growth and development of a country they can cause major environmental disasters for this reason the governments of different countries and international institutions have developed a series of reforms that seek harmony between the industrial and environmental sector in spite of this industrial sectors such as paintings textiles steel and mining among others cause contamination of the waters through discharge currents that contain heavy metals such as chromium ions for example 1 chromium is a transition metal which depending on its oxidation state exhibits a high solubility and mobility in different aqueous systems chromium is mainly found with trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi oxidation states though the cr iii species in low concentration is an essential nutrient in biological functions it can be toxic at high concentrations in addition the cr vi species is highly toxic due to its high oxidative capacity 1 depending on the concentration and ph cr vi can be found as different species in water such as h2cro4 hcro4 cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 2 hexavalent chromium can cause health problems such as vomiting severe diarrhea gastrointestinal pain it may even modify the process of dna transcription causing cancer 3 for this reason the world health organization established a concentration of 0 05 mg l as the maximum permissible limit for chromium in drinking water 4 5 to achieve this objective there are several removal and recovery techniques for cr vi among the most common techniques and methods applied for cr vi removal are adsorption 6 reduction and precipitation 7 bioremediation 8 and also concentration processes using membranes such as diffusion dialysis neutralization dialysis and donnan dialysis 9 12 among others a promising alternative for the retention of heavy metal ions involves the use of microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes modified by interpolymeric networks these consist of the combination of two different multifunctional polymers which have the ability to crosslink and form in situ interpolymeric networks at a molecular scale 9 16 often interpolymeric networks are prepared with the aim of transferring properties from one of the polymers to the other or to obtain combined and even new synergic properties 16 in this work the modification of regenerated cellulose rc ultrafiltration membranes with interpolymeric networks was carried out in order to obtain an efficient interpolymeric material to remove the cr vi ions present in an aqueous solution to modify the membranes a free radical polymerization was performed to grow the functional polymer in the membrane ammonium persulfate aps was used as a initiator agent which started the in situ radical polymerization of 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium chloride claeta monomer in presence of the n n methylenebis acrylamide mba crosslinker agent the polymerization was performed using a fixed amount of aps 1 mol and varying the claeta concentration 10 25 mmol l and the percentage of mba 4 and 8 mol their degree of modification dm and water absorption capacity wac was determined in addition the membranes were characterized by ftir sem tga electrokinetic potential and permeability after that the retention capacity of cr vi at different phs was evaluated by filtration experiments 2 experimental 2 1 reagents the interpolymeric networks were prepared via in situ radical polymerization in 10 kda regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membranes ultracel plgc millipore usa the monomer used in the polymerization was 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium chloride claeta 80 sigma aldrich the initiator was ammonium persulfate aps 98 sigma aldrich and the crosslinker was n ń methylenebis acrylamide mba 99 sigma aldrich for the chromium vi retention study potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 merck was used to prepare the stock solutions the ph was adjusted using naoh merck or hno3 merck 2 2 preparation of modified membranes the rc ultrafiltration membranes used in this work are asymmetrical membranes composed by two layers cellulose layer in the active face and polypropylene layer as support the membranes were first conditioned with an ethanol solution 50 v v merck for residue removal and wetting of the pores then the reactive solution containing claeta monomer mba crosslinker and aps initiator was prepared in 20 ml of milli q water with constant stirring this solution was bubbled with n2 in order to displace the oxygen subsequently this reactive solution was injected by pressing with n2 the rc membrane using an ultrafiltration cell amicon 8050 millipore after that the membrane was placed in an aluminum plate system and the polymerization was performed in an oven at 60 c for 12 h at the end of the process the plates were cooled at room temperature and then the modified membranes were hydrated with milli q water rinsed and freeze dried for 12 h see fig 1 the conditions for the preparation of interpolymeric networks inside the membrane are shown in table 1 the acronym cl was used as an abbreviated form of p claeta and the different numerations for describing the synthesis conditions 2 3 degree of modification the degree of modification dm of the rc membrane was calculated gravimetrically for this purpose the unmodified membranes were weighted then the freeze dried modified membranes were also weighted the degree of modification was calculated according to the eq 1 1 d m p m p u p u 100 where pm is the weight of the modified rc membrane and pu is the weight of the unmodified rc membrane 2 4 water absorption capacity the modified rc membranes were first weighed in dry then they were submerged in deionized water at different ph values 3 6 and 9 the water absorption capacity wac was studied in a time range of 10 60 min and measured each 10 min using a fixed water volume of 30 ml the wac was calculated according to eq 2 2 w a c p w p m p m 100 where pw is the weight of the membrane with absorbed water and pm corresponds to the initial weight of the modified membrane 2 5 morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy the surfaces cellulose layer and polypropylene layer of the modified and unmodified rc membranes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem using a jeol microscope jsh 6380lv model at acceleration voltage of 20 kv 2 6 fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy the identification of functional groups of the modified rc membranes was carried out using an analysis of infrared spectroscopy ftir which was performed with a nicolet protege spectrophotometer 460 model in a range of 4000 400 cm 1 2 7 thermogravimetric analysis the thermogravimetric analysis was carried out with a thermo microbalance netzsch model tg 209f1 iris between 30 at 550 c in nitrogen atmosphere and the heating rate was 10 c min in all cases 2 8 electrokinetic properties and permeability in order to study the electrokinetic properties of the modified membrane it was cut into thin pieces and submerged into 5 10 2 mol l kcl solutions at ph values of 3 5 7 and 9 11 the equipment brookhaven zetaplus was used and the ph was controlled using hcl and naoh the electrokinetic potential ϛ can be determined from the ionic mobility μe by using the smoluchowski equation eq 3 3 μ e ε ς η where μe is the ionic electrophoretic mobility cm2 v s ε is the liquid permittivity j v2 m and ϛ is the electrokinetic potential or the zeta potential mv this method determines the electrokinetic potential of the functional groups incorporated in the modified membranes 11 on the other hand the permeability was estimated considering the time required to pass deionized water through the modified membrane until to collect 50 ml of permeate the stirred cell filtration unit amicon was used with nitrogen gas as pressure source 2 bar this analysis probes indirectly the modification of the membrane 2 9 determination of cr vi retention by ultrafiltration in order to determine the chromium vi retention capacity of the modified rc membranes an ultrafiltration system amicon 8050 was used in concentration mode using 20 mg l of cr vi in the feed and 2 bar of pressure n2 filtration studies were performed for different modified rc membranes at ph 3 6 and 9 the retention percentage r was determined according to eq 4 4 r 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the concentrations of chromium vi in the feed and permeate respectively chromium concentration was measured in the filtrate by atomic absorption spectrometry aas using a perkin elmer 3100 spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of dm the determination of dm was performed qualitatively by gravimetric measures of the modified and unmodified membranes 9 11 table 2 shows the dm of the modified rc membranes as a function of monomer concentration claeta and percentage of crosslinker mba from the results it is possible to appreciate that the highest dms are obtained when a smaller amount of monomer was used in the synthesis independent of the amount of crosslinker this may occur due to the use of excess of monomer in the feed which can cause a certain amount of polymer to be formed outside the membrane and then eliminated in the washing and purification process in the case of membranes cl1 and cl2 their dms were the lowest reaching values of around 23 on the other hand the cl4 membrane reached the highest value of dm 41 52 this membrane was prepared with a lower concentration of claeta and crosslinker in comparison with the other samples analyzed it is also probable that when less monomer is used in the injection this is incorporated more properly into the membrane pores resulting in the formation of a denser network 9 the literature also reports similar results revealing that the interpenetrating polymer network formed is not always depending of the amount of monomer in the feed 13 also an high interpolymeric network density of p claeta inside of the host membrane occurs due to the hydrophilic character of the claeta monomer and cellulose substrate this affinity help to obtain homogeneous distribution of the trapped p claeta hydrogel 3 2 determination of wac the wac test is also used to confirm the internal modification of the membranes wac of the modified membranes reveals the hydrophilicity character in the structure of the formed interpenetrating network in fig 2 the wac of the modified rc membranes with p claeta network is reported at three different phs in regards to time the results indicate that the cl2 membrane reaches a high value of wac above 300 at three different ph values 3 6 and 9 despite having a low percentage of dm having a smaller dm is possible to obtain a less dense membrane which produces more flexibility and therefore a greater capacity of water absorption probably membranes with a high dm can form a denser and rigid network with less flexibility so that less water can be absorbed for cl1 cl3 and cl4 the wac was near to 200 independent of the ph value on the other hand it is known that the quaternary ammonium group in the p claeta is charged in all ph range however the hydronium ions could produce that the interpolymeric network expand when the ph values are basic or to contract when the ph values are acid 11 the unmodified membrane showed lowest values of wac in comparison with modified membranes and this behavior did not change with the ph values 3 3 morphological analysis by sem two layers cellulose layer deposited on polypropylene layer form the unmodified rc ultrafiltration membrane used in this work when the interpolymeric network is formed inside the membrane the density is increased while the pore diameter and penetration depth is decreased 15 the analysis of the images obtained through sem were performed for an unmodified rc membrane cellulose layer see fig 3 a and polypropylene layer see fig 3f both were compared with the morphology of modified rc membranes with interpolymeric networks see fig 3b e for cellulose layer and fig 3g j for polypropylene layer the results of the cl1 membrane see fig 3b and g show a significant change in the surface compared to the unmodified rc membrane on the other hand the surface images of the membranes cl2 cl3 and cl4 show that they are more dense and homogeneous compared with membrane cl1 the decrease of surface heterogeneity can be explained as a result of the pore size decrease since the interpolymeric network was mainly formed inside the pores 13 15 these morphological results are congruent with dm shown in table 2 a higher dm for membranes cl3 and cl4 give a significant change in the morphology of both surfaces moreover it is possible to see that the modification of polypropylene layer increases for higher dm forming a dense p claeta layer on the polypropylene fibers this demonstrates that the injection method is a simple way to modify the surfaces and the interior of the membrane 3 4 ftir spectroscopy the ftir spectrum of the unmodified rc membrane see fig 4 a is compared with cl4 membrane which has a higher dm see fig 4b in the ftir spectrum of the cl4 membrane a decrease in band intensity can be observed over 3000 cm 1 this signal corresponds to the tension of the oh groups of the cellulose which decreases when the membrane is modified with the polymer moreover the spectrum of the modified rc membrane showed a new signal at 1727 cm 1 corresponding to the carbonyl group of p claeta besides absorption bands observed at 1482 cm 1 correspond to the stretching of the quaternary ammonium group of the polymer and other signal vibration to 1581 cm 1 corresponding to cn and nh 9 this analysis also confirms the modification of the membrane by the formation of interpolymeric networks 3 5 thermal analysis fig 5 shows the tga curves for the modified rc membranes with p claeta interpolymeric networks the thermograms of the modified rc membranes showed a typical sigmoidal shape of p claeta indicating weight loss in two steps at different decomposition temperatures 17 however in the case of modified rc membranes is observed that all the samples have a high thermal stability around 300 c the literature reports that the weight loss was around 75 and it occurred at two temperatures 264 and 324 c for the homopolymer p claeta 17 the tga results of modified rc membranes showed the same sigmoidal shape of p claeta however the first decomposition temperature is near 300 c in the case of cl3 it presented higher dm 36 98 and the highest first decomposition temperature 331 c this can be explained by the formation of dense interpolymeric network that could increase the thermal resistance probably due to the presence of crosslinked polymers inside to the membrane on the other hand literature also reports the thermal decomposition of cellulose and polypropylene which occur at 315 c and above 400 c respectively 18 according to this the second decomposition temperature in all the thermograms of this study could corresponds to the polypropylene layer of the membrane 3 6 determination of zeta potential and permeability the modified membranes containing ionic functional groups can produce superficial charges related to wetting adsorption and ion transport the electrokinetic potential is the fixed charge potential difference between the mobile ionic charges cationic anionic in the absorption layer 11 the fig 6 a shows the behavior of cl4 membrane which exhibited higher electrokinetic potentials at ph value of 3 the quaternary ammonium groups present in the modified membrane exhibit a positive charge in a wide range of ph in acidic media the excess of h repels the quaternary ammonium groups with positive charges on the other hand at ph value of 9 the electrokinetic potential decreases because of the presence of oh ions the network is then contracted and these oh ions compete with the cl ions in the diffusion layer the movement of the cl counterion in the diffusion layer becomes favored when the ph is acid 11 this behavior in function of ph is in accordance with the chromate removal capacity of cl4 membrane which is maximum at ph 3 and decrease slightly when the ph increase this result confirm the modification of membrane incorporating cationic functional groups the electrokinetic potentials for cellulose membranes are reported in the literature 19 the following observations are reported the zeta potential is negative at all ph values investigated ph between 2 and 10 the zeta potential becomes more negative as the ph increases and for ph values greater than about 5 the zeta potential becomes more negative as the ionic strength increases 19 fig 6b shows the volumetric flux of the modified membranes in comparison with the unmodified membrane the values of flux are 95 40 38 27 and 15 l hm2 for unmodified cl1 cl2 cl3 and cl4 respectively the volumetric flux of water decreased for all modified membrane samples because the pore size decreased by the presence of p claeta networks which produced resistance to water and also these networks can swell these results are in agree with the dm for all the membranes therefore membranes with higher dm presented lower volumetric flux 3 7 retention of cr vi by filtration fig 7 shows the retention profiles of cr vi 20 mg l when the modified rc membranes cl1 cl2 cl3 and cl4 were used as filters in filtration experiments using concentration mode to understand the effect of ph in cr vi removal first is necessary to consider the speciation of cr vi in water at ph values below 1 the predominant species is h2cro4 at ph values of 2 4 and depending of the concentration is possible to find hcro4 and some cr2o7 2 anions at ph between 4 and 6 cr2o7 2 and hcro4 ions exist in equilibrium and under alkaline conditions ph 8 cr vi exists predominantly as cro4 2 anion 20 the retention capacity of cr vi by the unmodified rc membrane is null at all the studied phs 12 and it was compared with the retention capacity of the modified rc membranes in general cr vi can be removed from aqueous solution in a wide ph range using the modified membranes the highest retention percentages were obtained for the less modified membranes cl1 and cl2 at all the studied phs the cl2 membrane sample reached the highest percentages of cr vi retention at ph 6 giving a maximum value of 94 1 this result is directly related to the low dm and high wac previously obtained for this membrane on the other hand the membranes with the highest dm were those with lower percentages of cr vi retention this may be due to the presence of interpolymeric networks that can produce resistance to water absorption and ion exchange capacity 9 10 considering the effect of ph in the cr vi removal at ph 3 the excess of the h ions can produce an repulsion effect with cationic functional group of the network and decrease slightly the removal capacity at ph 6 the interpolymeric networks can be in equilibrium of swelling and retracting facilitating the maximum retention of both hcro4 and cro4 2 anions at ph 9 the hydroxyl ions competes with the cro4 2 ions for the ammonium quaternary fixed groups and the interpolymeric network decrease the functional fixed groups available for cr vi retention the literature reports some studies about cr vi removal by water soluble polymers containing quaternary ammonium functional groups these studies reveal that the interaction between the functional groups of the polymer and chromium vi ions was not purely electrostatic the formation of a coordination bond between a partially movable functional group on the polymeric network and one on the oppositely charged chromium anion is also considered 12 20 industrial waste in addition to cr vi also contains other species which vary depending on the type of industry therefore it is important to investigate the influence of interfering ions on the removal of cr vi some studies indicate that waste water from chromium industry mainly contains cations such as na ca2 mg2 cu2 ni 2 and also some anions such as no3 and cl 21 in the present study the influence of interfering ions on cr vi removal was analyzed considering cl and na from acid and base respectively on the other hand recent literature reports some similar cr vi removal studies using soluble polymers containing quaternary ammonium groups p claeta used as sorbent in combination with ultrafiltration membranes 17 in these previous studies the influence of interfering ions such as cl so4 2 and po4 3 on the removal of cr vi was analyzed in general the results indicated that when these interfering ions were added to the solution cr vi retention decreased this is probably due to the competition between the anions interfering with the chromate anion by the site of interaction of the polymer the concentration loading and nature of the interfering ions affected the removal of cr vi from the aqueous solution 17 future studies will consider the use of modified membranes in the removal of cr vi from an ionic mixture and industrial effluents 4 conclusions in the present work the modification of regenerated cellulose membranes was performed by in situ radical polymerization of a functional monomer in presence of a crosslinker and an initiator the polymerization was performed using a fixed amount of initiator and by varying the concentration of the monomer and the percentage of crosslinker subsequently the characterization of the modified membranes by dm wac ftir sem tga electrokinetic potential and permeability was carried out finally cr vi retention capacity was evaluated by filtration at different phs the results indicated that using a higher monomer concentration in the synthesis the dm was lower independent of the crosslinker the membranes with lower dm presented a higher wac the characterization by ftir and sem confirms the modification of the membrane by the presence of interpolymeric networks in the case of tga although the modified membranes showed the same typical sigmoidal shape of p claeta however the thermal decomposition started at a higher temperature compared to the pure homopolymer above 300 c the electrokinetic potential reveal that the modified membrane is cationic in a wide range of ph and permeability decrease when the dm increase modified rc membranes were used as a filter to study cr vi retention the results indicate that it is possible to remove the cr vi ions at different phs 3 6 and 9 reaching higher percentages of retention for modified membranes with lower dm the high retention of cr vi by the cl2 membrane at ph 6 reaches the value of 94 1 these preliminary results are

a denser network 9 the literature also reports similar results revealing that the interpenetrating polymer network formed is not always depending of the amount of monomer in the feed 13 also an high

obtain a less dense membrane which produces more flexibility and therefore a greater capacity of water absorption probably membranes with a high dm can form a denser and rigid network with less flexibility so that less water can be absorbed for cl1 cl3 and cl4 the wac was near to 200 independent of the ph value on the other hand it is known that the quaternary ammonium group in the p claeta

compared with the morphology of modified rc membranes with interpolymeric networks see fig 3b e for cellulose layer and fig 3g j for polypropylene layer the results of the cl1 membrane see fig 3b and g show a significant change in the surface compared to the unmodified rc membrane on the other hand the surface images of the membranes cl2 cl3 and cl4 show that they are more dense and homogeneous compared with membrane cl1 the decrease of surface heterogeneity can be explained as a result of the pore size decrease since the interpolymeric network was mainly formed inside the pores 13 15 these morphological results are congruent with dm shown in table 2 a higher dm for membranes cl3 and cl4 give a significant change in the morphology of both surfaces moreover it is possible to see that the modification of polypropylene layer increases for higher dm forming a dense p claeta layer on the polypropylene fibers this demonstrates that the injection method is a simple way to modify the surfaces and the interior of the membrane 3 4 ftir spectroscopy the ftir spectrum of the unmodified rc membrane see fig 4 a is compared with cl4 membrane which has a higher dm see fig 4b in the ftir spectrum of the cl4 membrane a decrease in band intensity can be observed over 3000 cm 1 this signal corresponds to the tension of the oh groups of the cellulose which decreases when the membrane is modified with the polymer moreover the spectrum of the modified rc membrane showed a new signal at 1727 cm 1 corresponding to the carbonyl group of p claeta besides absorption bands observed at 1482 cm 1 correspond to the stretching of the quaternary ammonium group of the polymer and other signal vibration to 1581 cm 1 corresponding to cn and nh 9 this analysis also confirms the modification of the membrane by the formation of interpolymeric networks 3 5 thermal analysis fig 5 shows the tga curves for the modified rc membranes with p claeta interpolymeric networks the thermograms of the modified rc membranes showed a typical sigmoidal shape of p claeta indicating weight loss in two steps at different decomposition temperatures 17 however in the case of modified rc membranes is observed that all the samples have a high thermal stability around 300 c the literature reports that the weight loss was around 75 and it occurred at two temperatures 264 and 324 c for the homopolymer p claeta 17 the tga results of modified rc membranes showed the same sigmoidal shape of p claeta however the first decomposition temperature is near 300 c in the case of cl3 it presented higher dm 36 98 and the highest first decomposition temperature 331 c this can be explained by the formation of dense interpolymeric network that could increase the thermal resistance probably due to the presence of crosslinked polymers inside to the membrane on the other hand literature also reports the thermal decomposition of cellulose and polypropylene which occur at 315 c and above 400 c respectively 18 according to this the second decomposition temperature in all the thermograms of this study could corresponds to the polypropylene layer of the membrane 3 6 determination of zeta potential and permeability the modified membranes containing ionic functional groups can produce superficial charges related to wetting adsorption and ion transport the electrokinetic potential is the fixed charge potential difference between the mobile ionic charges cationic anionic in the absorption layer 11 the fig 6 a shows the behavior of cl4 membrane which exhibited higher electrokinetic potentials at ph value of 3 the quaternary ammonium groups present in the modified membrane exhibit a positive charge in a wide range of ph in acidic media the excess of h repels the quaternary ammonium groups with positive charges on the other hand at ph value of 9 the electrokinetic potential decreases because of the presence of oh ions the network is then contracted and these oh ions compete with the cl ions in the diffusion layer the movement of the cl counterion in the diffusion layer becomes favored when the ph is acid 11 this behavior in function of ph is in accordance with the chromate removal capacity of cl4 membrane which is maximum at ph 3 and decrease slightly when the ph increase this result confirm the modification of membrane incorporating cationic functional groups the electrokinetic potentials for cellulose membranes are reported in the literature 19 the following observations are reported the zeta potential is negative at all ph values investigated ph between 2 and 10 the zeta potential becomes more negative as the ph increases and for ph values greater than about 5 the zeta potential becomes more negative as the ionic strength increases 19 fig 6b shows the volumetric flux of the modified membranes in comparison with the unmodified membrane the values of flux are 95 40 38 27 and 15 l hm2 for unmodified cl1 cl2 cl3 and cl4 respectively the volumetric flux of water decreased for all modified membrane samples because the pore size decreased by the presence of p claeta networks which produced resistance to water and also these networks can swell these results are in agree with the dm for all the membranes therefore membranes with higher dm presented lower volumetric flux 3 7 retention of cr vi by filtration fig 7 shows the retention profiles of cr vi 20 mg l when the modified rc membranes cl1 cl2 cl3 and cl4 were used as filters in filtration experiments using concentration mode to understand the effect of ph in cr vi removal first is necessary to consider the speciation of cr vi in water at ph values below 1 the predominant species is h2cro4 at ph values of 2 4 and depending of the concentration is possible to find hcro4 and some cr2o7 2 anions at ph between 4 and 6 cr2o7 2 and hcro4 ions exist in equilibrium and under alkaline conditions ph 8 cr vi exists predominantly as cro4 2 anion 20 the retention capacity of cr vi by the unmodified rc membrane is null at all the studied phs 12 and it was compared with the retention capacity of the modified rc membranes in general cr vi can be removed from aqueous solution in a wide ph range using the modified membranes the highest retention percentages were obtained for the less modified membranes cl1 and cl2 at all the studied phs the cl2 membrane sample reached the highest percentages of cr vi retention at ph 6 giving a maximum value of 94 1 this result is directly related to the low dm and high wac previously obtained for this membrane on the other hand the membranes with the highest dm were those with lower percentages of cr vi retention this may be due to the presence of interpolymeric networks that can produce resistance to water absorption and ion exchange capacity 9 10 considering the effect of ph in the cr vi removal at ph 3 the excess of the h ions can produce an repulsion effect with cationic functional group of the network and decrease slightly the removal capacity at ph 6 the interpolymeric networks can be in equilibrium of swelling and retracting facilitating the maximum retention of both hcro4 and cro4 2 anions at ph 9 the hydroxyl ions competes with the cro4 2 ions for the ammonium quaternary fixed groups and the interpolymeric network decrease the functional fixed groups available for cr vi retention the literature reports some studies about cr vi removal by water soluble polymers containing quaternary ammonium functional groups these studies reveal that the interaction between the functional groups of the polymer and chromium vi ions was not purely electrostatic the formation of a coordination bond between a partially movable functional group on the polymeric network and one on the oppositely charged chromium anion is also considered 12 20 industrial waste in addition to cr vi also contains other species which vary depending on the type of industry therefore it is important to investigate the influence of interfering ions on the removal of cr vi some studies indicate that waste water from chromium industry mainly contains cations such as na ca2 mg2 cu2 ni 2 and also some anions such as no3 and cl 21 in the present study the influence of interfering ions on cr vi removal was analyzed considering cl and na from acid and base respectively on the other hand recent literature reports some similar cr vi removal studies using soluble polymers containing quaternary ammonium groups p claeta used as sorbent in combination with ultrafiltration membranes 17 in these previous studies the influence of interfering ions such as cl so4 2 and po4 3 on the removal of cr vi was analyzed in general the results indicated that when these interfering ions were added to the solution cr vi retention decreased this is probably due to the competition between the anions interfering with the chromate anion by the site of interaction of the polymer the concentration loading and nature of the interfering ions affected the removal of cr vi from the aqueous solution 17 future studies will consider the use of modified membranes in the removal of cr vi from an ionic mixture and industrial effluents 4 conclusions in the present work the modification of regenerated cellulose membranes was performed by in situ radical polymerization of a functional monomer in presence of a crosslinker and an initiator the polymerization was performed using a fixed amount of initiator and by varying the concentration of the monomer and the percentage of crosslinker subsequently the characterization of the modified membranes by dm wac ftir sem tga electrokinetic potential and permeability was carried out finally cr vi retention capacity was evaluated by filtration at different phs the results indicated that using a higher monomer concentration in the synthesis the dm was lower independent of the crosslinker the membranes with lower dm presented a higher wac the characterization by ftir and sem confirms the modification of the membrane by the presence of interpolymeric networks in the case of tga although the modified membranes showed the same typical sigmoidal shape of p claeta however the thermal decomposition started at a higher temperature compared to the pure homopolymer above 300 c the electrokinetic potential reveal that the modified membrane is cationic in a wide range of ph and permeability decrease when the dm increase modified rc membranes were used as a filter to study cr vi retention the results indicate that it is possible to remove the cr vi ions at different phs 3 6 and 9 reaching higher percentages of retention for modified membranes with lower dm the high retention of cr vi by the cl2 membrane at ph 6 reaches the value of 94 1 these preliminary results are promising for the development of metal separation systems based on modified membranes acknowledgements the authors thank the fondecyt project no 11140324 and the dicyt project n 021741sp vridei

14391,polysulfone psf nanocomposite ultrafiltration uf membrane was prepared using polystyrene silicomolybdate simo ps nanoparticles nps the spherical simo ps particles can be simply doped into a psf membrane via the phase inversion process which allows the hydrophilic simo ps spheres to migrate to the hydrophobic psf surface and facilitates the antifouling capability of the membrane especially its anti bacterial activity consequently the nanocomposite hybrid membrane simo ps psf displays excellent overall completion in separation performance compared with pure psf and polystyrene psf ps psf membranes where nanosized simo particles 70 nm can completely and uniformly diffuse through the flat surface of the ps spheres however for bovine serum albumin bsa solution the outcomes show that the modified membranes have a 99 rejection compared to 90 for the basic membrane also contact angle measurements expose that adding the nps increases the hydrophilicity of the psf surface this membrane could be an exceptional material for water treatment purposes keywords polystyrene silicomolybdate polysulfone nanoparticles ultrafiltraion antibacterial activity 1 introduction borg el arab city is a fraction of the northwestern coastal district of egypt it is positioned at 60 km from alexandria and extended 14 km from the mediterranean sea it is surrounded by latitudes 30 45 31 00 n and longitudes 29 28 29 45 e it includes three villages are abu sir festive and gharbaney 1 the city includes nine housing areas and 4 manufacturing zones the 4 industrial zones are by 510 factories of dissimilar industrial sectors 2 during the last century an enormous quantity of industrial wastewater was discharged into rivers lakes and coastal areas this has resulted in severe pollution problems in the aquatic atmosphere and caused negative possessions to the eco system and human being live 3 due to the rapid increases in population and urbanization in the past few decades the challenges of obtaining clean and abundant water and of managing wastewater are quickly growing because of their rewards such as low energy expenses and high separation effectiveness membrane based separation techniques have been extensively used in numerous industries 4 ultrafiltration uf one of the most common membrane separation techniques used in water treatment can remove prevalent and harmful water components e g viruses proteins pathogens and colloids 5 6 various membranes comprising for example polysulfone psf polyethersulfone polyamide chitosan cellulose acetate and polyacrylonitrile have been improved for development performance however because of the hydrophobicity of most polymers utilized for uf membrane fabrication these filtration membranes are fairly viler able to organic fouling arising from the adsorption or deposition of retained organic components 7 8 consequently polysulfone psf has emerged as a fitting material for this application because of its eminent chemical and thermal stability excellent oxidation resistance and great mechanical properties 9 however membrane fouling remains a chief barrier to the widespread utilization of membrane technology as it can cause decreased flux increased transmembrane pressure and ultimately reduced membrane service life 10 11 various strategies have been developed for improving antifouling performance and preventing membrane damage including pretreatment of the feed solution optimization of the component collection development of operating conditions the establishment of cleaning procedures and modification of membranes among these membrane modification especially by increasing membrane hydrophilicity has been established as an efficient technique to diminish membrane fouling because of the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction among contaminant molecules in the feed solution and the membrane through filtration the recent progress in nanotechnology has considerably broadened the extent of membrane modification by introducing the integration of inorganic nanomaterials to functionalize membranes 12 it is well known that membrane properties including hydrophilicity and antifouling capability can be enhanced by incorporating various types of inorganic nanoparticles nps such as titania tio2 13 14 zirconium zro2 15 silica sio2 16 zinc oxide zno 17 alumina al2o3 18 silver ag 19 and carbon nanotubes 20 furthermore nps with inhibitory and bactericidal activities can directly contribute to the antimicrobial capability of membranes in particular silica has garnered much interest owing to its high toxicity to numerous strains of bacteria and minimal toxicity to animals and humans the morphological and infiltration properties of adapted membranes are very sensitive to the fill ratio of the included particles thus a large amount of insulation should be used to decrease particle aggregation moreover membrane permeation is not always improved due to the risk of pore blocking therefore sotto et al established a treatment with a relatively small amount of particles less than 1 to avoid this adverse effect 21 this comes within attain of has been implicated in this work among the likely filler materials sio2 has been widely considered for membrane modification because of its excellent chemical stability and elevated hydrophilicity 22 however nearly all earlier studies have included non ordered mesoporous silica particles at incorporation values greater than 0 75 wt conversely the addition of mesostructured functionalized silica at low concentrations to the psf medium is proposed to facilitate two properties porous arrangement and silica functionalization mesostructured silica has been widely utilized in catalysis separation and adsorption 23 to the best of our knowledge ps could be a feasible and suitable additive to improve membrane structure and performance however no experimental study about using ps and simo ps to modify psf uf membrane or other uf membranes has been carried out simo ps nanohybrid was worn to functionalize membrane for the first time in this study with a new advance the spherical formed simo ps can be simply doped into psf medium to perform an ultrafiltration membrane via phase inversion technique the assimilation of hydrophilic simo ps nanohybrid could not only advance the hydrophilicity of membrane plane but also produce a superior pore structure of the membrane both benefiting the water permeability furthermore the whole preparation procedure is simplistic and convenient ps spheres can be suitably fabricated via self polymerization in aqueous solutions at 25 c and own a lot of merits such as easily modified size identical spherical profile elevated hydrophilicity excellent biocompatibility non toxicity and fine thermal stability 24 25 the objectives of this article were first developing a novel doping method for membrane modification using polystyrene ps spheres conjugated with silicomolybdate simo nps in this context ps serves as a free radical scavenger protecting the polymer matrix and prevent organic fouling over control of metal nps on the surface of a ps bead is one of the most widely accepted routes for their synthesis however in nearly all cases the extent of the surface of the ps bead covered with the metal particles is small and non uniform because of interparticle coulomb repulsion leaving highly exposed polystyrene beads thus complete coverage of ps beads by an ultra thin and uniform layer of simo nps is urgently needed by researchers in the field to the best of our knowledge this study represents the first use of a simo ps nanohybrid to functionalize a membrane matrix with our new development the spherical simo ps particles can be easily doped into a psf medium to prepare a uf membrane via the phase inversion technique the absorption of hydrophilic simo ps nanohybrid might not only enhance the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface but also result in a better pore arrangement both of which improve the water permeability furthermore the complete preparation procedure is simplistic and controllable functional chemical groups are established on the surface of the simo nps to improve their interaction with psf and their dispersion in the ps medium furthermore the extent of the coverage of the ps surface with simo particles face be able to be suitably tailored in this work the structures and morphologies of the simo ps spheres and simo ps doped psf membranes were characterized revealing that the hybrid membranes have good separation properties and performance the influence of the simo ps nanohybrids on the membrane properties was also systematically evaluated secondly application of the new ultrafiltration membrane in the treatment of real contaminated industrial effluents collected from borg el arab area 2 experimental 2 1 materials polysulfone psf mw 78 000 g mol density 1 24 g ml at 25 c was applied from solvay

peptone water peptic digest of animal tissue 10 g l 5 g l in h2o at 25 c ph value 7 2 agar 96 and meat extract were purchased from himedia all reagents and chemicals utilized in this work were of analytical grade purity 2 2 fabrication of the hybrid nanomaterials simo ps although most nanocomposite materials are fabricated via positively charged assembly it might be impossible to assume the existence of an ion exchange consequence among the metal cations and surface groups in these cases owing to repulsion therefore a precursor diffusion deposition technique might be the favored choice the synthesis of nanosized silicomolybdate simo loaded onto an anion exchanger polystyrene is summarized below and details about the steps performed in a typical laboratory synthesis of an anion exchanger saturated with molybdate nanoparticles nps are as follows first 25 g of ps anion exchange resin was added to a 500 ml container containing 50 ml of ammonium molybdate in 10 sulfuric acid and the suspension was shaken for 24 h the molybdate solution was prepared by adding 10 g of ammonium molybdate to 100 ml of a 50 50 mixed solution of methanol 25 h2so4 next the material was separated from the prepared solution air dried for 4 h and then immersed in 100 ml of 10 naoh solution for 1 h the bulk produced resin a hybrid anion exchanger was then soaked numerous times in deionized water followed by acetone and air dried at 24 c for 24 h subsequently the resulting particles conjugated with mo ii were exposed to 350 ml ofh4sio4 na2sio3 h2so4 solution 20 by mass and stirred at 60 rpm for 12 h the precipitation reaction of mo ii and h4sio4 occurred in the nanopores of the matrix and simo ps nanomaterials were obtained in this procedure the mo ii salts infiltrate the interior surface of the ps matrix by diffusion rather than by ion exchange as presented in fig 1 2 3 preparation of simo ps psf nps blended membranes psf ultrafiltration membranes were fabricated through an immersion precipitation method a casting solution was prepared by dissolving psf 18 wt ps psf 18 wt and simo ps psf 0 3 wt simo ps in 18 wt psf in dmac with stirring at 70 c for 12 h then the solution was cast on a dust free glass plate placed in air 25 c relative humidity of 45 50 for 15 s and deep in deionized water at 25 1 c the resulting membranes were warily washed with deionized water to reduce the residual solvent and stored in pure water before testing 2 4 characterization particles were characterized by fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy the functional groups in the simo psnps were evaluated using a nicolet avatar 230 spectrometer at room temperature the np morphology was determined by scanning electron microscopy sem using an sem model quanta field emission gun feg

with jeol jem 1400 uhr operated at 80 kv to characterize the mechanical properties of the different membranes their elongation and tensile strength were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis dma using a universal mechanical testing instrument dmataq800 film tension clamp measurements were performed at room temperature with a strain rate of 50 mm min for each membrane at least three specimens were examined to determine hydrophilicity the static contact angle of water on the surface of a polymer membrane was measured by using a vca video contact angle system kr üssdsa25b germany the average rate of the contact angle on every polymer membrane was obtained using at least five different sites on each membrane the thermal stability of the prepared membranes was characterized using a shimadzu dt 60h thermal analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan samples were measured from ambient temperature to 700 c at a heating rate of 15 deg min 2 5 separation performance of membranes the values of pure water flux and rejection were determined using a cross flow membrane component the operating pressure was 0 2 mpa before the measurements each of the prepared membranes was operated for approximately 60 min and then the pure water flux and rejection were measured flat sheet membranes with an effective area of 2 4 cm2 were located in the test instrument with the top surface facing the feed water all membrane models were prepared and tested at least twice with three membrane tests for ultrafiltration uf performance the water flux f was calculated using eq 1 1 f v at where v is the total volume of permeated pure water l a is the valuable membrane area m2 and t is the operation time h the rejection r was measured with 0 5 g l humic acid ha methyl orange mo and bovine serum albumin protein bsa and was calculated using eq 2 2 rejection 1 c permeate c feed where cpermeate and cfeed represent ha mo and bsa concentrations in permeate and feed solutions respectively a uv vis spectrometer 8453e hp was used to determine the concentrations of ha mo and bsa at 254 464 and 205 nm respectively reusability of the psf and simo ps psf membranes after cleaning with detergent and water rising was studied by repeating consecutive adsorption desorption cycles for this purpose 250 ml of hcl 0 02 m acetone 0 1 m solution was utilized as desorption solutions first membranes were equilibrated ha solution then they were put into the desorption solutions and shaken for 24 h thereafter the desorbed ha concentration in the supernatants was quantified by the spectrophotometer after desorption step the membrane was utilized over again in an adsorption procedure as described above 2 6 water sampling and laboratory analyses one field trip in borg el arab region was conducted in june 2017 for water sampling and different field measurements two water samples were collected from two oxidation bonds at different locations the low brackish oxidation bond was collected at 30 49 14 2 n and longitudes 29 31 19 4 e and the high brackish oxidation bond was located at 30 49 14 1 n and longitudes 29 31 18 7 e different chemical analysis of collected water samples were completed at the central laboratory of the desert research center drc in cairo egypt the collection protection and analyses of the water samples followed the typical methods of the american society of testing and materials 26 the hydrogen ion concentration ph and electrical conductivity ec were considered in the field trip via portable ph and ec meters hanna instruments ann arbor michigan usa where ec was expected in micro siemens per centimeter at 25 c ec and ph were precise in the field at once after sampling the water samples were put in 1000 ml capacity polyethylene bottles the water samples were potted and analyzed in the laboratory for major ions ca2 mg2 na k hco3 co3 so4 2 cl using standard methods 27 28 alkali metal ions sodium na and potassium k were set using a flame photometer jenway pfp 7 total hardness

molybdenum nickel phosphorous silica strontium and zinc were determined by inductively coupled argon plasma icap 6500 duo thermo scientific england 1000 mg l multi element certified standard solution merck germany was utilized as a stock solution for instrument standardization 2 7 bacteria tests membrane anti adhesion and anti bacteria tests were conducted with gram negative e coli and gram positive listeria which are isolated from borg el arab area both e coli and listeria strains were first grown on tryptone soya broth tsb media at 37 c in the shaker incubator oxoid cm129 for 24 h to obtain the overnight phase of the bacteria following that 1 ml from each bacterial culture was pipetted from the overnight phase into another flask with freshly prepared tsb incubated for another 6 h at 37 c to obtain the log phase of the bacteria this was done because the log phase of both e coli and listeria was believed to have higher activity and be more viable than in other growth phases after incubation period bacterial cells in the log phase were separated by centrifugation and washed with phosphate buffer saline pbs solution and centrifugated again this procedure was repeated three times to ensure that all nutrients remaining from the tsb were removed the objective of this process was to create an environment without any nutrients so that the growth of existing bacteria in their numbers would be restricted during the anti adhesion test the prepared bacteria were then diluted up to 100 times with pbs to obtain a suspension of about 20 102 cells ml for e coli and 90 102 for listeria in the initial adhesion tests psf and simo ps psf membranes d 20 mm were immersed together into both the e coli and listeria suspension 10 ml in a sealed bottle and the mixture was shaken in an incubator shaker at 200 rpm and 37 c for 5 h after that the membranes were taken out and rinsed three times gently with pbs the bacteria remained on each type of the membranes were observed with sem as an indication of bacterial adhesion before the sem scan the samples were prepared as follows 32 each membrane sample was immersed into 3 v v glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c for the fixation of the adhered bacteria after 3 h the membrane was taken out of the glutaraldehyde solution followed by step dehydration with 100 ethanol the membrane was then dried at room temperature to be ready for sem scan moreover the antibacterial activity of these membranes was also investigated by examining the bacteriostasis rate by the viable cell counting technique e coli and listeria were inoculated in 5 ml of lb liquid nutrient medium respectively and shaken for 12 h at 37 c the actual number of cells utilized for a given test was firmed by the standard serial dilution method 20 mm of various membranes including the psf membrane and the simo ps psf membrane were cut and sterilized by autoclaving for 20 min respectively to examine the antibacterial activity the membranes were added into the 10 ml solution inoculated by about 106 cfu ml e coli and listeria respectively and then which were incubated at room temperature after 24 h membranes were retrieved from cultures and washed with normal saline the wash solutions were collected and diluted it with de ionized water till its concentration becomes to 10 2 of the original value 1 ml of dilution solution was to widen onto lb culture medium and all plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h the numbers of colonies on the plates were determined by the plate count method 2 8 statistical analysis all experiments were perfected at least three times and statistics were existed using anova and spss 13 0 univariate tests were performed following the general linear model glm to assess variations of the rejection organic pollutants sulfates and nitrates in the two oxidation pond in borg el arab area among different three membranes posthoc analysis one way anova coupled with a test of least significant difference lsd was done only in the cases where the differences were significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ps and simo ps nanoparticles the ft ir spectra of polystyrene silicomolybdate simo ps nps immobilized on resin beads and free ps beads are compared in fig 2 the peak at 3421 cm 1 for the free resin beads can be assigned to the nh stretching mode of the cnh 3 moieties 33 this peak position was blue shifted by 31 cm 1 in the spectrum of the simo ps np immobilized on resin beads indicating the existence of an interaction of the cationic and anionic moieties of the resin beads with the silicon and molybdate ions the bands appear at 3470 and 1636 cm 1 belongs to the surface adsorbed h2o molecules 34 moreover the peaks in the region from 500 to 900 cm 1 are attributed to metal oxygen vibration moo vibrations 35 the band located at 973 7 cm 1 indicates the sio stretching vibration of the silanol group 36 fig 3 a shows scanning electron microscopy sem images of the ps beads note that the spherical geometry is retained after processing and converting the beads into simo ps particles as observed in fig 3 b 37 the simo species develop into tiny particles present on the top surface of the ps spheres indicating that the dispersion of simonps within an anion exchanger is scientifically difficult because both silicon ions si4 and the quaternary ammonium groups r4n in an anion exchange resin are positively charged once appropriately dispersed within an anion exchanger i e ps simo nps were conclusively demonstrated to be irreversibly retained for many cycles of operation fig 4 reveals the typical tem images of the simo ps nanostructures indicating quasi sphere like morphology with size in the range of 8 33 8 nm thermogravimetric analysis tga of ps and its derivative simo ps was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere as shown in fig 5 in the case of the ps beads three weight loss stages can be observed in the tga curve the first stage at 91 6 c corresponds to the heat of vaporization of water in the sample the second weight loss stage begins at 285 5 c and ends at 421 c which indicates the superior thermal stability of pure ps the differential thermogravimetric analysis dtg curve shows three exothermic peaks matching to the weight loss stages seen in the tga curve thermal and dynamic mechanical analysis dma of ps composites reinforced with short sisal fibers was conducted 38 by contrast the tga curve of simo ps fig 5 shows continuous weight loss 5 5 up to 55 c which may be due to the exclusion of external water molecules and a slow weight loss of 20 up to 309 3 c was seen for the removal of interstitial and coordinated water further weight loss of 25 between 309 and 428 c may be due to the total decomposition of the organic component of simo ps 39 40 when the temperature was increased above 500 c a smooth horizontal curve attributable to the formation of the corresponding metal oxides was observed the above findings were also supported by dtg 41 the dtg curve fig 5 of simo ps shows a sharp and broad endothermic peak at temperatures between 55 2 and 120 c due to dehydration the two exothermic peaks in the temperature region of 309 428 4 c may be caused by the alteration of the compound from amorphous to crystalline and the creation of the corresponding metal oxides dynamic light scattering dls analysis of the synthesized nps is shown in fig 6 the graph in the figure indicates the relatively uniform size distribution of the simo ps particles clearly most of the simo ps particle sizes are between 50 nm and 100 nm with an average of 70 4 nm these consequences are reasonable and consistent with those obtained from sem 3 2 characterization of hybrid membranes containing simo ps nps ft ir spectroscopic analysis of the different synthesized psf uf membranes was conducted to confirm the formation of membranes doped with ps and membranes doped with simo ps nps and to obtain some knowledge of their structures as shown in fig 7 the ft ir spectrum of the psf membrane showed bands at 715 4 853 2 1013 7 1149 9 1487 3 and 1584 7 cm 1 corresponding to aromatic hydrogen groups isolated aromatic hydrogen groups ether groups sulfonic acid groups alkane groups and ch aromatic bonds respectively 42 43 by contrast the ft ir spectra of the ps psf and simo ps psf membranes shown in fig 7 exhibit the appearance of new peaks in addition to peaks present in the spectrum of the psf membrane indicating the reaction of ps with psf fig 7 also shows the ft ir spectrum of the simo ps psf membranes which displays a band at 3405 4 cm 1 corresponding to the nh stretching mode of the cnh 3 moieties and a band at 1739 3 cm 1 corresponding to the amide groups 44 while the peak at 3433 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of oh group of physisorbed h2o 45 other bands characteristic of simo nps is also observed at 873 3 and 950 cm 1 moo and sio bonds respectively 35 36 this result indicates that the reaction between ps and simo occurs by diffusion instead of ion exchange fig 8 shows sem images of both surface and cross section of psf ps psf and simo ps psf membranes compared to the simo ps psf membranes the surface of the ps psf membrane is not smooth and has some agglomeration fig 8 this result was attributed to the good incorporation of the simo ps nps in the psf matrix leading to an improvement in their properties based on these findings the membrane structure was determined to have a typical asymmetric morphology with a smooth surface compared to the pure psf membranes which is owing to speeding up the exchange rate of the solvent and nonsolvent of the hydrophilic casting solution via the phase inversion procedure moreover some inorganic particles were found to be incorporated on the membrane surface because hydrophilic inorganic particles such as simo tend to move toward the membrane surface during the phase inversion method 46 from tem fig 9 we can see nano sized simo ps nps are dispersed in the psf membrane as nano sized grade 26 86 nm due to some agglomeration which occurred during membrane preparation which enhanced modified membranes hydrophilicity significantly above all the composite uf membrane is not only maintaining organic membranes character but also increasing its hydrophilicity intensity and antifouling properties to understand the mechanical properties of the polymer membrane and attached simo ps nps the stress and strain characteristics of the psf ps psf and simo ps psf membranes were found as shown in fig 10 compared with the pristine ps psf membrane the simo ps psf membranes exhibit not only enhanced tensile strength under extreme physical operating conditions but also increased elongation at break percentages and remarkably increased young s modulus values this can be explained by the fact that the bonding between the ps and the simo nps as observed by ft ir is energetically favorable and thus favors the transfer of the mechanical load from the polymer matrix to the simo nps therefore it can be concluded that the homogeneous and well dispersed simo nps of relatively smaller size as can be observed in sem analysis as well as the added bonding sites throughout the simo ps guarantee the efficient absorption of mechanical energy and distribute the external load there by increasing the mechanical properties of the obtained nanocomposite uf membrane 47 generally the contact angle indicates the level of surface hydrophilicity of a membrane the pure water flux and contact angles of the psf and modified psf membranes ps psf and simo ps psf were measured at room temperature the contact angle of the modified psf membranes was reduced compared to that of the pure psf membrane as shown in fig 11 the contact angle was reduced from 90 0 for psf to 42 2 2 55 for simo ps psf which can be attributed to the reduced interfacial energy of the mixed matrix membranes because of the functional groups of the simo ps nps on the surface of the psf membrane 48 however the water flux of the prepared membranes was directly influenced by the improved hydrophilicity the modified simo ps psf membrane was found to have a higher water flux than the pure psf membrane owing to its extremely high hydrophilicity the simo ps psf membrane exhibits the smallest contact angle i e the greatest surface hydrophilicity which contributes to membrane water infiltration and antifouling properties to further verify the successful synthesis of the psf and simo ps psf membranes tga and dtg measurements were conducted and the results are shown in fig 12 the tga curves in fig 12 show that in the case of the psf membrane two weight loss stages can be observed the first stage at 451 4 561 97 c was interpreted as the cleavage of the so3h groups this weight loss of 46 8 was also ascribed to the evaporation of additives the boiling point of n n dimethylacetamide dmac is 165 c 49 the second stage above 729 9 c a mass loss of 41 92 is associated with the cleavage of the polymer main chain 50 notably the so groups in the main chain of psf appear to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water in the case of the ps psf membrane one weight loss stage at 515 c can be observed in the tga curve this finding can be attributed the introduction of ps the large volume of benzene side group in ps not only increased the steric hindrance of segmentation but also increased the interaction between the molecular chains meanwhile the increased tg also improved the thermal properties of psf in addition the dtg curves revealed that the different copolymers had different numbers of exothermic peaks namely different weight loss stages for psf there were only two endothermic peaks at approximately 531 and 631 c corresponding to the degradation of the aromatic backbone of psf which is amorphous 51 by contrast the tga curve of simo ps psf shows one weight loss stage and one exothermic peak at 516 c on the one hand this exothermic peak which fluctuates between 500 c and 600 c and was mainly assigned to the decomposition of the aromatic ring segment contained in ps became larger on the other hand the endothermic peak above 500 c which was mainly present in psf and may be attributed to the decomposition of the aromatic ring segment became smaller this variation was associated with the changes in the amount of psf and ps used 52 when the temperature was increased above 500 c a smooth horizontal curve corresponding to the formation of the corresponding metal oxides was observed the above findings were also supported by the dtg curves fig 13 exhibits the separation performance of the psf ps psf and simo ps psf membranes compared with the psf membrane the water flux of the hybrid membranes is superior as shown in fig 13 the addition of hydrophilic inorganic particles may contribute to the increased membrane hydrophilicity improved membrane pore structure and most importantly enhanced membrane water permeation properties the simo ps psf membrane has the highest water permeability because of the synergistic effect of the hydrophilic ps and simo which contributes to the extremely high hydrophilicity of simo ps meanwhile the rejection of mo ha and bsa by the simo ps psf membrane increases slightly reaching a value of 99 for bsa thus the simo ps psf membrane is considered to possess improved separation performance 3 3 reusability of psf and simo ps psf membranes as it was mentioned in the previous section psf and simo ps psf membranes exhibited better efficiency in ha separation three numbers of cycles desorption resorption are wanted to construct the process more economical the reuse of the uf membrane and desorbent is an important feature for its possible utilization in continuous systems in industrial processes 53 hence desorption of ha from these membranes was conceded by hcl 0 02 m and 0 1 m acetone solutions it has already been reported by nabi et al 40 that the simo layer is still stable after being treated with 0 02 m hcl and 0 1 acetone solutions indicating high quality endurance of the layer to the acidic and organic solvents however the membranes were tested by treating the simo ps psf layer with harsh acidic and acetone for 24 h the stability of the simo ps psf layer was examined by measuring the uv absorbance of the treating solution at 254 nm as shown in fig 14 as a result acetone 0 1 m with the maximum stripping capacity was accepted for the reusability inquiry of the membranes the recyclable property of the obtained membranes i e psf and simo ps psf was studied by repeating the ha adsorption desorption processes three times using the same membrane after the regeneration by the striping solution acetone 0 1 m as can be seen in fig 14 psf and simo ps psf membranes after three cycles maintain their adsorption capability with a slight loss in the adsorption capacity adsorbed desorbed amounts are decreased rapidly for the third cycle hence the number of the repeating cycles might be enough to stimulate the reusability of the membranes however complete desorption 100 was not achievable probably because of the permanent entrapment of ha moieties in the polystyrene backbone 54 as mentioned in the above section psf membranes have elevated rigidity and high quality chemical resistance owing to their structures consisting of phenylene rings associated with sulfonyl so2 groups the working temperature for these membranes can attain as high as 75 8 c operating ph can vary from 1 to 13 55 these membranes have high alkali resistance however psf membranes are disposed to oxidizing agents such as chlorine or hydrogen peroxide the maximum acceptable chlorine concentration is up and doing to 200 ppm for short time applications and 50 ppm for long time applications shi et al 55 present a complete review of membrane fouling and cleaning in uf applications first of all membrane fouling the reason for cleaning in the first set is addressed in conditions of its cause forms and the major kinds of foulants and successful parameters secondly the goals methods mechanisms and processes of membrane cleaning are debated in large detail there are as numerous types of cleaning patterns as there are fouling kinds and mechanisms commonly the commercially popular resources referred to as conventional cleaning include groups of the physical and chemical process cleaning methods can contain several procedures depending on the fouling condition universal cleaning protocols depend on various industries which consist of a hydraulic clean preceding to and after chemical biological cleaning though in order to permit for optimisation the full cleaning run has to be specially considered for a particular work cleaning procedure parameters comprise choosing appropriate cleaning agents and their concentration classify and period of cleaning steps hydrodynamics ph and temperature the means of estimation of cleaning competence are listed in this review 55 in addition to containing a numeral of current characterization modes which assist gain more insights into the outcome impacts and mechanisms of the cleaning procedure 55 herein the main properties of the simo ps psf membrane prepared in this work are compared with some earlier published hybrid ultrafiltration membranes functionalized with tio2 ag fe2o3 ag sio2 isocyanate treated graphene oxide nanoparticles polyaniline nanofibers and phenolphthalein 46 52 56 65 and the outcome is summarized in table 1 as we can see the hybrid membranes functionalized via surface coating illustrate a lower water flux than the corresponding pure polymer membranes because the coating on the surface may block the surface pores simo ps psf membrane in this study is prepared by phase inversion method and has significantly improved water permeability moreover it also holds an advantage in long term stability over the simo polymer hybrid membrane due to the protection of ps for the polymer matrix which has been proved in the above sections thus our simo ps psf membrane has a remarkable overall performance providing a promising material for further application 3 4 application of psf ps psf and simo ps psf blended membranes in the treatment of real polluted industrial wastewater samples from borg el arab region recently polymeric materials such as polyethylenimine polyvinyl alcohol pva polyacrylic acid and polysulfone have been successfully used to eliminate traces of different metal ions and organic pollutants from industrial waste by uf in this investigation the removal of organic pollutants which was measured as total organic carbon toc and of sulfate and nitrate from aqueous solution by ion exchange and diffusion through uf using the psf ps psf and simo ps psf blended membranes with a simo ps concentration of 0 3 wt was attempted in the borg elarab area egypt because the quaternary amino groups present in ps cannot easily bind to the hydrolyzed sulfate and nitrate ions due to the competitive reactions between oh ions and amino groups with such metal ions 66 the two applied water obtained from the borg el arab area with high concentrations of organic pollutants sulfates and nitrates were used as the feed solution the feed consists of solutions of metal ions at different concentrations as shown in table 2 accordingly an aqueous feed of real water was passed through the psf ps psf and simo ps psf blended membranes in an experiment conducted to study the effect of a polymeric ion exchanger i e polyethyleneimine pei on rejection some of the metal ions of sulfate and nitrate were observed to pass through the membranes under neutral conditions ph 7 because at this ph strong protonation of the metal being exchanged along with a relatively larger increase in diffusion occurs 67 tables 3 and 4 show the results of the lsd of the different uf membranes in terms of their ability to reject sulfate nitrate and organic pollutants furthermore the rejection of organic pollutants toc was higher than that of the metal ions sulfate and nitrate due to stronger uf structure of the membranes 68 69 the simo ps psf membrane was found to be significant only among different uf psf and ps psf membranes glm anova p 05 and as per the lsd test tables 3 and 4 simo ps psf emerged to be the single most dominating fraction contributing to the reported variability and the only fraction that is significantly distinct from the rest 3 5 anti adhesion results bacteria anti adhesion test was first done for the psf and simo ps psf membranes simo ps psf had greatly enhanced hydrophilicity than psf see fig 11 in terms of water contact angle initially e coli and listeria was used in the test for the two types of membranes the sem images in fig 15 show the adhesion results of e coli and listeria on each type of the membranes after 5 h of contact with the e coli suspension it is clear that the psf membrane had a significant amount of e coli on the surface probably due to its relatively high surface hydrophobicity in contrast the simo ps psf membrane had much less adhesion of e coli and listeria on the surfaces this may be attributed to the significantly enhanced hydrophilicity of simo ps psf membrane as compared to that of the psf base membrane therefore the results in this part of study have clearly demonstrated that increasing the hydrophilicity of a membrane indeed improved the anti adhesion performance of bacteria hence membrane hydrophilicity should not be used as it has already been so commonly used in practice as a sole criterion to indicate the tendency of membrane to bacteria adhesion in various membrane anti biofouling efforts it is interesting to note that the e coli and lesteria bacteria on the simo ps psf membrane had very different morphology from that on psf the bacteria on the simo ps psf membrane surface were shorter but fatter in shape than those on the psf membrane the strong attraction force between the simo ps psf membrane and the attached e coli and listeria bacteria may have hindered the normal elongation of the bacteria for their growth of e coli and listeria adhered on the surface 3 6 anti bacteria results the major interest here was to examine the anti bacteria performance of the psf and simo ps psf membranes for comparison the psf and simo ps ps membranes were also tested also it is interesting to find out how the introduction of the bio cide such as silica and molybdenum ions on the membrane further affected membrane biofouling behavior through the anti bacteria approach the anti bacteria test was again first conducted with e coli and listeria as described in the experimental section e coli and listeria was spread on the agar plate and a disc of membrane sample was then used to cover a part of the agar plate in the middle after cultured for 24 h the agar plate was seen for bacteria colonies the viable cell numbers of e coli and listeria aureus after coming into contact with various membranes were evaluated respectively the antibacterial effect was shown table 5 as can be observed the bacteriostasis rates of the new nanocomposite membranes against e coli and listeria are 75 and 95 respectively the content of silicomolybdate is about 3 by weight of psf the hybrid membranes had a high antibacterial efficiency for e coli and listeria in other words the bacteriostasis rate of the hybrid membranes against e coli is lower than that of listeria thus the simo ps psf membranes will have a potential application to reduce bacterial fouling in membrane treatment of water 4 conclusion in this work a simo ps nanohybrid was successively synthesized in which the ps spheres act as an adhesive substrate to hold the densely covered simo nps together the simo ps psf membrane exhibits excellent separation performance and shows high rejection to bsa indicating that ps helps reduce the absorption of radicals and protect the polymer medium from being attacked the results show that the hybrid simo ps psf membrane possesses a high flux and high performance in the separation of organic pollutants present in polluted water the antibacterial test clarified that the nanocomposite membranes were effective against e coli and listeria which would have a potential application to decrease bacterial fouling in membrane treatment of waste water this simple approach is promising for a future large scale synthesis of this nanostructured material which can be used in many important applications such as uf and chromatography and as an adsorbent or filler material finally this research proved that incorporating a support with ion exchange behavior is very useful to expand the applications of membranes acknowledgements the author would like to thank dr rabaa yasin for the assistance and great help in antibacterial activity experiments in microbiology department

14391,polysulfone psf nanocomposite ultrafiltration uf membrane was prepared using polystyrene silicomolybdate simo ps nanoparticles nps the spherical simo ps particles can be simply doped into a psf membrane via the phase inversion process which allows the hydrophilic simo ps spheres to migrate to the hydrophobic psf surface and facilitates the antifouling capability of the membrane especially its anti bacterial activity consequently the nanocomposite hybrid membrane simo ps psf displays excellent overall completion in separation performance compared with pure psf and polystyrene psf ps psf membranes where nanosized simo particles 70 nm can completely and uniformly diffuse through the flat surface of the ps spheres however for bovine serum albumin bsa solution the outcomes show that the modified membranes have a 99 rejection compared to 90 for the basic membrane also contact angle measurements expose that adding the nps increases the hydrophilicity of the psf surface this membrane could be an exceptional material for water treatment purposes keywords polystyrene silicomolybdate polysulfone nanoparticles ultrafiltraion antibacterial activity 1 introduction borg el arab city is a fraction of the northwestern coastal district of egypt it is positioned at 60 km from alexandria and extended 14 km from the mediterranean sea it is surrounded by latitudes 30 45 31 00 n and longitudes 29 28 29 45 e it includes three villages are abu sir festive and gharbaney 1 the city includes nine housing areas and 4 manufacturing zones the 4 industrial zones are by 510 factories of dissimilar industrial sectors 2 during the last century an enormous quantity of industrial wastewater was discharged into rivers lakes and coastal areas this has resulted in severe pollution problems in the aquatic atmosphere and caused negative possessions to the eco system and human being live 3 due to the rapid increases in population and urbanization in the past few decades the challenges of obtaining clean and abundant water and of managing wastewater are quickly growing because of their rewards such as low energy expenses and high separation effectiveness membrane based separation techniques have been extensively used in numerous industries 4 ultrafiltration uf one of the most common membrane separation techniques used in water treatment can remove prevalent and harmful water components e g viruses proteins pathogens and colloids 5 6 various membranes comprising for example polysulfone psf polyethersulfone polyamide chitosan cellulose acetate and polyacrylonitrile have been improved for development performance however because of the hydrophobicity of most polymers utilized for uf membrane fabrication these filtration membranes are fairly viler able to organic fouling arising from the adsorption or deposition of retained organic components 7 8 consequently polysulfone psf has emerged as a fitting material for this application because of its eminent chemical and thermal stability excellent oxidation resistance and great mechanical properties 9 however membrane fouling remains a chief barrier to the widespread utilization of membrane technology as it can cause decreased flux increased transmembrane pressure and ultimately reduced membrane service life 10 11 various strategies have been developed for improving antifouling performance and preventing membrane damage including pretreatment of the feed solution optimization of the component collection development of operating conditions the establishment of cleaning procedures and modification of membranes among these membrane modification especially by increasing membrane hydrophilicity has been established as an efficient technique to diminish membrane fouling because of the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction among contaminant molecules in the feed solution and the membrane through filtration the recent progress in nanotechnology has considerably broadened the extent of membrane modification by introducing the integration of inorganic nanomaterials to functionalize membranes 12 it is well known that membrane properties including hydrophilicity and antifouling capability can be enhanced by incorporating various types of inorganic nanoparticles nps such as titania tio2 13 14 zirconium zro2 15 silica sio2 16 zinc oxide zno 17 alumina al2o3 18 silver ag 19 and carbon nanotubes 20 furthermore nps with inhibitory and bactericidal activities can directly contribute to the antimicrobial capability of membranes in particular silica has garnered much interest owing to its high toxicity to numerous strains of bacteria and minimal toxicity to animals and humans the morphological and infiltration properties of adapted membranes are very sensitive to the fill ratio of the included particles thus a large amount of insulation should be used to decrease particle aggregation moreover membrane permeation is not always improved due to the risk of pore blocking therefore sotto et al established a treatment with a relatively small amount of particles less than 1 to avoid this adverse effect 21 this comes within attain of has been implicated in this work among the likely filler materials sio2 has been widely considered for membrane modification because of its excellent chemical stability and elevated hydrophilicity 22 however nearly all earlier studies have included non ordered mesoporous silica particles at incorporation values greater than 0 75 wt conversely the addition of mesostructured functionalized silica at low concentrations to the psf medium is proposed to facilitate two properties porous arrangement and silica functionalization mesostructured silica has been widely utilized in catalysis separation and adsorption 23 to the best of our knowledge ps could be a feasible and suitable additive to improve membrane structure and performance however no experimental study about using ps and simo ps to modify psf uf membrane or other uf membranes has been carried out simo ps nanohybrid was worn to functionalize membrane for the first time in this study with a new advance the spherical formed simo ps can be simply doped into psf medium to perform an ultrafiltration membrane via phase inversion technique the assimilation of hydrophilic simo ps nanohybrid could not only advance the hydrophilicity of membrane plane but also produce a superior pore structure of the membrane both benefiting the water permeability furthermore the whole preparation procedure is simplistic and convenient ps spheres can be suitably fabricated via self polymerization in aqueous solutions at 25 c and own a lot of merits such as easily modified size identical spherical profile elevated hydrophilicity excellent biocompatibility non toxicity and fine thermal stability 24 25 the objectives of this article were first developing a novel doping method for membrane modification using polystyrene ps spheres conjugated with silicomolybdate simo nps in this context ps serves as a free radical scavenger protecting the polymer matrix and prevent organic fouling over control of metal nps on the surface of a ps bead is one of the most widely accepted routes for their synthesis however in nearly all cases the extent of the surface of the ps bead covered with the metal particles is small and non uniform because of interparticle coulomb repulsion leaving highly exposed polystyrene beads thus complete coverage of ps beads by an ultra thin and uniform layer of simo nps is urgently needed by researchers in the field to the best of our knowledge this study represents the first use of a simo ps nanohybrid to functionalize a membrane matrix with our new development the spherical simo ps particles can be easily doped into a psf medium to prepare a uf membrane via the phase inversion technique the absorption of hydrophilic simo ps nanohybrid might not only enhance the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface but also result in a better pore arrangement both of which improve the water permeability furthermore the complete preparation procedure is simplistic and controllable functional chemical groups are established on the surface of the simo nps to improve their interaction with psf and their dispersion in the ps medium furthermore the extent of the coverage of the ps surface with simo particles face be able to be suitably tailored in this work the structures and morphologies of the simo ps spheres and simo ps doped psf membranes were characterized revealing that the hybrid membranes have good separation properties and performance the influence of the simo ps nanohybrids on the membrane properties was also systematically evaluated secondly application of the new ultrafiltration membrane in the treatment of real contaminated industrial effluents collected from borg el arab area 2 experimental 2 1 materials polysulfone psf mw 78 000 g mol density 1 24 g ml at 25 c was applied from solvay

peptone water peptic digest of animal tissue 10 g l 5 g l in h2o at 25 c ph value 7 2 agar 96 and meat extract were purchased from himedia all reagents and chemicals utilized in this work were of analytical grade purity 2 2 fabrication of the hybrid nanomaterials simo ps although most nanocomposite materials are fabricated via positively charged assembly it might be impossible to assume the existence of an ion exchange consequence among the metal cations and surface groups in these cases owing to repulsion therefore a precursor diffusion deposition technique might be the favored choice the synthesis of nanosized silicomolybdate simo loaded onto an anion exchanger polystyrene is summarized below and details about the steps performed in a typical laboratory synthesis of an anion exchanger saturated with molybdate nanoparticles nps are as follows first 25 g of ps anion exchange resin was added to a 500 ml container containing 50 ml of ammonium molybdate in 10 sulfuric acid and the suspension was shaken for 24 h the molybdate solution was prepared by adding 10 g of ammonium molybdate to 100 ml of a 50 50 mixed solution of methanol 25 h2so4 next the material was separated from the prepared solution air dried for 4 h and then immersed in 100 ml of 10 naoh solution for 1 h the bulk produced resin a hybrid anion exchanger was then soaked numerous times in deionized water followed by acetone and air dried at 24 c for 24 h subsequently the resulting particles conjugated with mo ii were exposed to 350 ml ofh4sio4 na2sio3 h2so4 solution 20 by mass and stirred at 60 rpm for 12 h the precipitation reaction of mo ii and h4sio4 occurred in the nanopores of the matrix and simo ps nanomaterials were obtained in this procedure the mo ii salts infiltrate the interior surface of the ps matrix by diffusion rather than by ion exchange as presented in fig 1 2 3 preparation of simo ps psf nps blended membranes psf ultrafiltration membranes were fabricated through an immersion precipitation method a casting solution was prepared by dissolving psf 18 wt ps psf 18 wt and simo ps psf 0 3 wt simo ps in 18 wt psf in dmac with stirring at 70 c for 12 h then the solution was cast on a dust free glass plate placed in air 25 c relative humidity of 45 50 for 15 s and deep in deionized water at 25 1 c the resulting membranes were warily washed with deionized water to reduce the residual solvent and stored in pure water before testing 2 4 characterization particles were characterized by fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy the functional groups in the simo

using a universal mechanical testing instrument dmataq800 film tension clamp measurements were performed at room temperature with a strain rate of 50 mm min for each membrane at least three specimens

rate of the contact angle on every polymer membrane was obtained using at least five different sites on each membrane the thermal stability of the prepared membranes was characterized using a shimadzu dt 60h thermal analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan samples were measured from ambient temperature to 700 c at a heating rate of 15 deg min 2 5 separation performance of membranes the values of pure water flux and rejection were determined using a cross flow membrane component the operating pressure was 0 2 mpa before the measurements each of the prepared membranes was operated for approximately 60 min and then the pure water flux and rejection were measured flat sheet membranes with an effective area of 2 4 cm2 were located in the test instrument with the top surface facing the feed water all membrane models were prepared and tested at least twice with three membrane tests for ultrafiltration uf performance the water flux f was calculated using eq 1 1 f v at where v is the total volume of permeated pure water l a is the valuable membrane area m2 and t is the operation time h the rejection r was measured with 0 5 g l humic acid ha methyl orange mo and bovine serum albumin protein bsa and was calculated using eq 2 2 rejection 1 c permeate c feed where cpermeate and cfeed represent ha mo and bsa concentrations in permeate and feed solutions respectively a uv vis spectrometer 8453e hp was used to determine the concentrations of ha mo and bsa at 254 464 and 205 nm respectively reusability of the psf and simo ps psf membranes after cleaning with detergent and water rising was studied by repeating consecutive adsorption desorption cycles for this purpose 250 ml of hcl 0 02 m acetone 0 1 m solution was utilized as desorption solutions first membranes were equilibrated ha solution then they were put into the desorption solutions and shaken for 24 h thereafter the desorbed ha concentration in the supernatants was quantified by the spectrophotometer after desorption step the membrane was utilized over again in an adsorption procedure as described above 2 6 water sampling and laboratory analyses one field trip in borg el arab region was conducted in june 2017 for water sampling and different field measurements two water samples were collected from two oxidation bonds at different locations the low brackish oxidation bond was collected at 30 49 14 2 n and longitudes 29 31 19 4 e and the high brackish oxidation bond was located at 30 49 14 1 n and longitudes 29 31 18 7 e different chemical analysis of collected water samples were completed at the central laboratory of the desert research center drc in cairo egypt the collection protection and analyses of the water samples followed the typical methods of the american society of testing and materials 26 the hydrogen ion concentration ph and electrical conductivity ec were considered in the field trip via portable ph and ec meters hanna instruments ann arbor michigan usa where ec was expected in micro siemens per centimeter at 25 c ec and ph were precise in the field at once after sampling the water samples were put in 1000 ml capacity polyethylene bottles the water samples were potted and analyzed

molybdenum nickel phosphorous silica strontium and zinc were determined by inductively coupled argon plasma icap 6500 duo thermo scientific england 1000 mg l multi element certified standard solution merck germany was utilized as a stock solution for instrument standardization 2 7 bacteria tests membrane anti adhesion and anti bacteria tests were conducted with gram negative e coli and gram positive listeria which are isolated from borg el arab area both e coli and listeria strains were first grown on tryptone soya broth tsb media at 37 c in the shaker incubator oxoid cm129 for 24 h to obtain the overnight phase of the bacteria following that 1 ml from each bacterial culture was pipetted from the overnight phase into another flask with freshly prepared tsb incubated for another 6 h at 37 c to obtain the log phase of the bacteria this was done because the log phase of both e coli and listeria was believed to have higher activity and be more viable than in other growth phases after incubation period bacterial cells in the log phase were separated by centrifugation and washed with phosphate buffer saline pbs solution and centrifugated again this procedure was repeated three times to ensure that all nutrients remaining from the tsb were removed the objective of this process was to create an environment without any nutrients so that the growth of existing bacteria in their numbers would be restricted during the anti adhesion test the prepared bacteria were then diluted up to 100 times with pbs to obtain a suspension of about 20 102 cells ml for e coli and 90 102 for listeria in the initial adhesion tests psf and simo ps psf membranes d 20 mm were immersed together into both the e coli and listeria suspension 10 ml in a sealed bottle and the mixture was shaken in an incubator shaker at 200 rpm and 37 c for 5 h after that the membranes were taken out and rinsed three times gently with pbs the bacteria remained on each type of the membranes were observed with sem as an indication of bacterial adhesion before the sem scan the samples were prepared as follows 32 each membrane sample was immersed into 3 v v glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c for the fixation of the adhered bacteria after 3 h the membrane was taken out of the glutaraldehyde solution followed by step dehydration with 100 ethanol the membrane was then dried at room temperature to be ready for sem scan moreover the antibacterial activity of these membranes was also investigated by examining the bacteriostasis rate by the viable cell counting technique e coli and listeria were inoculated in 5 ml of lb liquid nutrient medium respectively and shaken for 12 h at 37 c the actual number of cells utilized for a given test was firmed by the standard serial dilution method 20 mm of various membranes including the psf membrane and the simo ps psf membrane were cut and sterilized by autoclaving for 20 min respectively to examine the antibacterial activity the membranes were added into the 10 ml solution inoculated by about 106 cfu ml e coli and listeria respectively and then which were incubated at room temperature after 24 h membranes were retrieved from cultures and washed with normal saline the wash solutions were collected and diluted it with de ionized water till its concentration becomes to 10 2 of the original value 1 ml of dilution solution was to widen onto lb culture medium and all plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h the numbers of colonies on the plates were determined by the plate count method 2 8 statistical analysis all experiments were perfected at least three times and statistics were existed using anova and spss 13 0 univariate tests were performed following the general linear model glm to assess variations of the rejection organic pollutants sulfates and nitrates in the two oxidation pond in borg el arab area among different three membranes posthoc analysis one way anova coupled with a test of least significant difference lsd was done only in the cases where the differences were significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ps and simo ps nanoparticles the ft ir spectra of polystyrene silicomolybdate simo ps nps immobilized on resin beads and free ps beads are compared in fig 2 the peak at 3421 cm 1 for the free resin beads can be assigned to the nh stretching mode of the cnh 3 moieties 33 this peak position was blue shifted by 31 cm 1 in the spectrum of the simo ps np immobilized on resin beads indicating the existence of an interaction of the cationic and anionic moieties of the resin beads with the silicon and molybdate ions the bands appear at 3470 and 1636 cm 1 belongs to the surface adsorbed h2o molecules 34 moreover the peaks in the region from 500 to 900 cm 1 are attributed to metal oxygen vibration moo vibrations 35 the band located at 973 7 cm 1 indicates the sio stretching vibration of the silanol group 36 fig 3 a shows scanning electron microscopy sem images of the ps beads note that the spherical geometry is retained after processing and converting the beads into simo ps particles as observed in fig 3 b 37 the simo species develop into tiny particles present on the top surface of the ps spheres indicating that the dispersion of simonps within an anion exchanger is scientifically difficult because both silicon ions si4 and the quaternary ammonium groups r4n in an anion exchange resin are positively charged once appropriately dispersed within an anion exchanger i e ps simo nps were conclusively demonstrated to be irreversibly retained for many cycles of operation fig 4 reveals the typical tem images of the simo ps nanostructures indicating quasi sphere like morphology with size in the range of 8 33 8 nm thermogravimetric analysis tga of ps and its derivative simo ps was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere as shown in fig 5 in the case of the ps beads three weight loss stages can be observed in the tga curve the first stage at 91 6 c corresponds to the heat of vaporization of water in the sample the second weight loss stage begins at 285 5 c and ends at 421 c which indicates the superior thermal stability of pure ps the differential thermogravimetric analysis dtg curve shows three exothermic peaks matching to the weight loss stages seen in the tga curve thermal and dynamic mechanical analysis dma of ps composites reinforced with short sisal fibers was conducted 38 by contrast the tga curve of simo ps fig 5 shows continuous weight loss 5 5 up to 55 c which may be due to the exclusion of external water molecules and a slow weight loss of 20 up to 309 3 c was seen for the removal of interstitial and coordinated water further weight loss of 25 between 309 and 428 c may be due to the total decomposition of the organic component of simo ps 39 40 when the temperature was increased above 500 c a smooth horizontal curve attributable to the formation of the corresponding metal oxides was observed the above findings were also supported by dtg 41 the dtg curve fig 5 of simo ps shows a sharp and broad endothermic peak at temperatures between 55 2 and 120 c due to dehydration the two exothermic peaks in the temperature region of 309 428 4 c may be caused by the alteration of the compound from amorphous to crystalline and the creation of the corresponding metal oxides dynamic light scattering dls analysis of the synthesized nps is shown in fig 6 the graph in the figure indicates the relatively uniform size distribution of the simo ps particles clearly most of the simo ps particle sizes are between 50 nm and 100 nm with an average of 70 4 nm these consequences are reasonable and consistent with those obtained from sem 3 2 characterization of hybrid membranes containing simo ps nps ft ir spectroscopic analysis of the different synthesized psf uf membranes was conducted to confirm the formation of membranes doped with ps and membranes doped with simo ps nps and to obtain some knowledge of their structures as shown in fig 7 the ft ir spectrum of the psf membrane showed bands at 715 4 853 2 1013 7 1149 9 1487 3 and 1584 7 cm 1 corresponding to aromatic hydrogen groups isolated aromatic hydrogen groups ether groups sulfonic acid groups alkane groups and ch aromatic bonds respectively 42 43 by contrast the ft ir spectra of the ps psf and simo ps psf membranes shown in fig 7 exhibit the appearance of new peaks in addition to peaks present in the spectrum of the psf membrane indicating the reaction of ps with psf fig 7 also shows the ft ir spectrum of the simo ps psf membranes which displays a band at 3405 4 cm 1 corresponding to the nh stretching mode of the cnh 3 moieties and a band at 1739 3 cm 1 corresponding to the amide groups 44 while the peak at 3433 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of oh group of physisorbed h2o 45 other bands characteristic of simo nps is also observed at 873 3 and 950 cm 1 moo and sio bonds respectively 35 36 this result indicates that the reaction between ps and simo occurs by diffusion instead of ion exchange fig 8 shows sem images of both surface and cross section of psf ps psf and simo ps psf membranes compared to the simo ps psf membranes the surface of the ps psf membrane is not smooth and has some agglomeration fig 8 this result was attributed to the good incorporation of the simo ps nps in the psf matrix leading to an improvement in their properties based on these findings the membrane structure was determined to have a typical asymmetric morphology with a smooth surface compared to the pure psf membranes which is owing to speeding up the exchange rate of the solvent and nonsolvent of the hydrophilic casting solution via the phase inversion procedure moreover some inorganic particles were found to be incorporated on the membrane surface because hydrophilic inorganic particles such as simo tend to move toward the membrane surface during the phase inversion method 46 from tem fig 9 we can see nano sized simo ps nps are dispersed in the psf membrane as nano sized grade 26 86 nm due to some agglomeration which occurred during membrane preparation which enhanced modified membranes hydrophilicity significantly above all the composite uf membrane is not only maintaining organic membranes character but also increasing its hydrophilicity intensity and antifouling properties to understand the mechanical properties of the polymer membrane and attached simo ps nps the stress and strain characteristics of the psf ps psf and simo ps psf membranes were found as shown in fig 10 compared with the pristine ps psf membrane the simo ps psf membranes exhibit not only enhanced tensile strength under extreme physical operating conditions but also increased elongation at break percentages and remarkably increased young s modulus values this can be explained by the fact that the bonding between the ps and the simo nps as observed by ft ir is energetically favorable and thus favors the transfer of the mechanical load from the polymer matrix to the simo nps therefore it can be concluded that the homogeneous and well dispersed simo nps of relatively smaller size as can be observed in sem analysis as well as the added bonding sites throughout the simo ps guarantee the efficient absorption of mechanical energy and distribute the external load there by increasing the mechanical properties of the obtained nanocomposite uf membrane 47 generally the contact angle indicates the level of surface hydrophilicity of a membrane the pure water flux and contact angles of the psf and modified psf membranes ps psf and simo ps psf were measured at room temperature the contact angle of the modified psf membranes was reduced compared to that of the pure psf membrane as shown in fig 11 the contact angle was reduced from 90 0 for psf to 42 2 2 55 for simo ps psf which can be attributed to the reduced interfacial energy of the mixed matrix membranes because of the functional groups of the simo ps nps on the surface of the psf membrane 48 however the water flux of the prepared membranes was directly influenced by the improved hydrophilicity the modified simo ps psf membrane was found to have a higher water flux than the pure psf membrane owing to its extremely high hydrophilicity the simo ps psf membrane exhibits the smallest contact angle i e the greatest surface hydrophilicity which contributes to membrane water infiltration and antifouling properties to further verify the successful synthesis of the psf and simo ps psf membranes tga and dtg measurements were conducted and the results are shown in fig 12 the tga curves in fig 12 show that in the case of the psf membrane two weight loss stages can be observed the first stage at 451 4 561 97 c was interpreted as the cleavage of the so3h groups this weight loss of 46 8 was also ascribed to the evaporation of additives the boiling point of n n dimethylacetamide dmac is 165 c 49 the second stage above 729 9 c a mass loss of 41 92 is associated with the cleavage of the polymer main chain 50 notably the so groups in the main chain of psf appear to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water in the case of the ps psf membrane one weight loss stage at 515 c can be observed in the tga curve this finding can be attributed the introduction of ps the large volume of benzene side group in ps not only increased the steric hindrance of segmentation but also increased the interaction between the molecular chains meanwhile the increased tg also improved the thermal properties of psf in addition the dtg curves revealed that the different copolymers had different numbers of exothermic peaks namely different weight loss stages for psf there were only two endothermic peaks at approximately 531 and 631 c corresponding to the degradation of the aromatic backbone of psf which is amorphous 51 by contrast the tga curve of simo ps psf shows one weight loss stage and one exothermic peak at 516 c on the one hand this exothermic peak which fluctuates between 500 c and 600 c and was mainly assigned to the decomposition of the aromatic ring segment contained in ps became larger on the other hand the endothermic peak above 500 c which was mainly present in psf and may be attributed to the decomposition of the aromatic ring segment became smaller this variation was associated with the changes in the amount of psf and ps used 52 when the temperature was increased above 500 c a smooth horizontal curve corresponding to the formation of the corresponding metal oxides was observed the above findings were also supported by the dtg curves fig 13 exhibits the separation performance of the psf ps psf and simo ps psf membranes compared with the psf membrane the water flux of the hybrid membranes is superior as shown in fig 13 the addition of hydrophilic inorganic particles may contribute to the increased membrane hydrophilicity improved membrane pore structure and most importantly enhanced membrane water permeation properties the simo ps psf membrane has the highest water permeability because of the synergistic effect of the hydrophilic ps and simo which contributes to the extremely high hydrophilicity of simo ps meanwhile the rejection of mo ha and bsa by the simo ps psf membrane increases slightly reaching a value of 99 for bsa thus the simo ps psf membrane is considered to possess improved separation performance 3 3 reusability of psf and simo ps psf membranes as it was mentioned in the previous section psf and simo ps psf membranes exhibited better efficiency in ha separation three numbers of cycles desorption resorption are wanted to construct the process more economical the reuse of the uf membrane and desorbent is an important feature for its possible utilization in continuous systems in industrial processes 53 hence desorption of ha from these membranes was conceded by hcl 0 02 m and 0 1 m acetone solutions it has already been reported by nabi et al 40 that the simo layer is still stable after being treated with 0 02 m hcl and 0 1 acetone solutions indicating high quality endurance of the layer to the acidic and organic solvents however the membranes were tested by treating the simo ps psf layer with harsh acidic and acetone for 24 h the stability of the simo ps psf layer was examined by measuring the uv absorbance of the treating solution at 254 nm as shown in fig 14 as a result acetone 0 1 m with the maximum stripping capacity was accepted for the reusability inquiry of the membranes the recyclable property of the obtained membranes i e psf and simo ps psf was studied by repeating the ha adsorption desorption processes three times using the same membrane after the regeneration by the striping solution acetone 0 1 m as can be seen in fig 14 psf and simo ps psf membranes after three cycles maintain their adsorption capability with a slight loss in the adsorption capacity adsorbed desorbed amounts are decreased rapidly for the third cycle hence the number of the repeating cycles might be enough to stimulate the reusability of the membranes however complete desorption 100 was not achievable probably because of the permanent entrapment of ha moieties in the polystyrene backbone 54 as mentioned in the above section psf membranes have elevated rigidity and high quality chemical resistance owing to their structures consisting of phenylene rings associated with sulfonyl so2 groups the working temperature for these membranes can attain as high as 75 8 c operating ph can vary from 1 to 13 55 these membranes have high alkali resistance however psf membranes are disposed to oxidizing agents such as chlorine or hydrogen peroxide the maximum acceptable chlorine concentration is up and doing to 200 ppm for short time applications and 50 ppm for long time applications shi et al 55 present a complete review of membrane fouling and cleaning in uf applications first of all membrane fouling the reason for cleaning in the first set is addressed in conditions of its cause forms and the major kinds of foulants and successful parameters secondly the goals methods mechanisms and processes of membrane cleaning are debated in large detail there are as numerous types of cleaning patterns as there are fouling kinds and mechanisms commonly the commercially popular resources referred to as conventional cleaning include groups of the physical and chemical process cleaning methods can contain several procedures depending on the fouling condition universal cleaning protocols depend on various industries which consist of a hydraulic clean preceding to and after chemical biological cleaning though in order to permit for optimisation the full cleaning run has to be specially considered for a particular work cleaning procedure parameters comprise choosing appropriate cleaning agents and their concentration classify and period of cleaning steps hydrodynamics ph and temperature the means of estimation of cleaning competence are listed in this review 55 in addition to containing a numeral of current characterization modes which assist gain more insights into the outcome impacts and mechanisms of the cleaning procedure 55 herein the main properties of the simo ps psf membrane prepared in this work are compared with some earlier published hybrid ultrafiltration membranes functionalized with tio2 ag fe2o3 ag sio2 isocyanate treated graphene oxide nanoparticles polyaniline nanofibers and phenolphthalein 46 52 56 65 and the outcome is summarized in table 1 as we can see the hybrid membranes functionalized via surface coating illustrate a lower water flux than the corresponding pure polymer membranes because the coating on the surface may block the surface pores simo ps psf membrane in this study is prepared by phase inversion method and has significantly improved water permeability moreover it also holds an advantage in long term stability over the simo polymer hybrid membrane due to the protection of ps for the polymer matrix which has been proved in the above sections thus our simo ps psf membrane has a remarkable overall performance providing a promising material for further application 3 4 application of psf ps psf and simo ps psf blended membranes in the treatment of real polluted industrial wastewater samples from borg el arab region recently polymeric materials such as polyethylenimine polyvinyl alcohol pva polyacrylic acid and polysulfone have been successfully used to eliminate traces of different metal ions and organic pollutants from industrial waste by uf in this investigation the removal of organic pollutants which was measured as total organic carbon toc and of sulfate and nitrate from aqueous solution by ion exchange and diffusion through uf using the psf ps psf and simo ps psf blended membranes with a simo ps concentration of 0 3 wt was attempted in the borg elarab area egypt because the quaternary amino groups present in ps cannot easily bind to the hydrolyzed sulfate and nitrate ions due to the competitive reactions between oh ions and amino groups with such metal ions 66 the two applied water obtained from the borg el arab area with high concentrations of organic pollutants sulfates and nitrates were used as the feed solution the feed consists of solutions of metal ions at different concentrations as shown in table 2 accordingly an aqueous feed of real water was passed through the psf ps psf and simo ps psf blended membranes in an experiment conducted to study the effect of a polymeric ion exchanger i e polyethyleneimine pei on rejection some of the metal ions of sulfate and nitrate were observed to pass through the membranes under neutral conditions ph 7 because at this ph strong protonation of the metal being exchanged along with a relatively larger increase in diffusion occurs 67 tables 3 and 4 show the results of the lsd of the different uf membranes in terms of their ability to reject sulfate nitrate and organic pollutants furthermore the rejection of organic pollutants toc was higher than that of the metal ions sulfate and nitrate due to stronger uf structure of the membranes 68 69 the simo ps psf membrane was found to be significant only among different uf psf and ps psf membranes glm anova p 05 and as per the lsd test tables 3 and 4 simo ps psf emerged to be the single most dominating fraction contributing to the reported variability and the only fraction that is significantly distinct from the rest 3 5 anti adhesion results bacteria anti adhesion test was first done for the psf and simo ps psf membranes simo ps psf had greatly enhanced hydrophilicity than psf see fig 11 in terms of water contact angle initially e coli and listeria was used in the test for the two types of membranes the sem images in fig 15 show the adhesion results of e coli and listeria on each type of the membranes after 5 h of contact with the e coli suspension it is clear that the psf membrane had a significant amount of e coli on the surface probably due to its relatively high surface hydrophobicity in contrast the simo ps psf membrane had much less adhesion of e coli and listeria on the surfaces this may be attributed to the significantly enhanced hydrophilicity of simo ps psf membrane as compared to that of the psf base membrane therefore the results in this part of study have clearly demonstrated that increasing the hydrophilicity of a membrane indeed improved the anti adhesion performance of bacteria hence membrane hydrophilicity should not be used as it has already been so commonly used in practice as a sole criterion to indicate the tendency of membrane to bacteria adhesion in various membrane anti biofouling efforts it is interesting to note that the e coli and lesteria bacteria on the simo ps psf membrane had very different morphology from that on psf the bacteria on the simo ps psf membrane surface were shorter but fatter in shape than those on the psf membrane the strong attraction force between the simo ps psf membrane and the attached e coli and listeria bacteria may have hindered the normal elongation of the bacteria for their growth of e coli and listeria adhered on the surface 3 6 anti bacteria results the major interest here was to examine the anti bacteria performance of the psf and simo ps psf membranes for comparison the psf and simo ps ps membranes were also tested also it is interesting to find out how the introduction of the bio cide such as silica and molybdenum ions on the membrane further affected membrane biofouling behavior through the anti bacteria approach the anti bacteria test was again first conducted with e coli and listeria as described in the experimental section e coli and listeria was spread on the agar plate and a disc of membrane sample was then used to cover a part of the agar plate in the middle after cultured for 24 h the agar plate was seen for bacteria colonies the viable cell numbers of e coli and listeria aureus after coming into contact with various membranes were evaluated respectively the antibacterial effect was shown table 5 as can be observed the bacteriostasis rates of the new nanocomposite membranes against e coli and listeria are 75 and 95 respectively the content of silicomolybdate is about 3 by weight of psf the hybrid membranes had a high antibacterial efficiency for e coli and listeria in other words the bacteriostasis rate of the hybrid membranes against e coli is lower than that of listeria thus the simo ps psf membranes will have a potential application to reduce bacterial fouling in membrane treatment of water 4 conclusion in this work a simo ps nanohybrid was successively synthesized in which the ps spheres act as an adhesive substrate to hold the densely covered simo nps together the simo ps psf membrane exhibits excellent separation performance and shows high rejection to bsa indicating that ps helps reduce the absorption of radicals and protect the polymer medium from being attacked the results show that the hybrid simo ps psf membrane possesses a high flux and high performance in the separation of organic pollutants present in polluted water the antibacterial test clarified that the nanocomposite membranes were effective against e coli and listeria which would have a potential application to decrease bacterial fouling in membrane treatment of waste water this simple approach is promising for a future large scale synthesis of this nanostructured material which can be used in many important applications such as uf and chromatography and as an adsorbent or filler material finally this research proved that incorporating a support with ion exchange behavior is very useful to expand the applications of membranes acknowledgements the author would like to thank dr rabaa yasin for the assistance and great help in antibacterial activity experiments in microbiology department

14392,the present work aims at developing and testing two new ultrafiltration ceramic membranes synthesized from a locally available barbotine kaolin zirconia um01 membrane and 3 mercaptopropyl trimethyoxysilane aum01 the electrokinetic characterization of membranes highlighted a negative charge density over a wide range of ph the addition of 3 mercaptopropyl trimethyoxysilane leads to a decrease in water permeability from around 95 35 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 for both membranes it was recognized that salt and dye rejections were strongly influenced by electrostatic interactions with the membrane surface where a considerable loss of performance with the increasing of ionic solution strength was induced the maximum dye rejections were obtained with the aum01 membrane and were close to 100 and 80 for cationic methyl green and neutral red and anionic reactive black5 dyes respectively keywords membrane dyes zeta potential electrostatic interactions filtration ceramic 1 introduction altought the two thirds of the earth s surface are covered by water only 3 of the world s water is fresh water and two thirds of that is tucked is unavailable for our use that is mainly caused by the presence of a variety of contaminants in raw water where their average size ranges from the micrometric scale e g bacteria to a few tenths of nanometers solvated ions membrane processes like microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have proved their efficiency in the field of water treatment in various industrial sectors such as drinking water production and industrial effluents treatment ceramic membranes offer better properties as compared to organic ones in term of thermal chemical and mechanical stability as well as resistance to microbial degradation 1 moreover they are suitable for applications in many fields such as wastewater recycling textile food and pharmaceutical industries 2 3 the electrokinetic properties of membranes play a significant role in their separation performance and fouling tendency since they exert a high influence on the magnitude of the interactions between the membrane and the feed liquid thus the permeation fluxes of both solvent and solutes is affected through the membrane pores 4 27 ceramic membranes electrokinetic properties are commonly studied by electrophoretic mobility 5 6 electroosmosis flow rate 7 and streaming potential measurements 6 12 membrane potential measurements can also be used to get relevant information about the membrane density charge 13 14 clays are interesting materials for ceramic supports and membranes in our previous work a thin layer of alkoxide 98 tetraethylorthosilicate was coated onto a kaolin zirconia membrane and the resulting membrane showed interesting results for dyes and heavy metals removal 15 25 in the present work we synthesized new ultrafiltration ceramic membranes from clays zirconia and alkoxide these membranes were further characterized by x ray fluorescence x ray diffraction spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy infrared spectroscopy and tangential streaming potential measurements finally their performance in terms of salts and dyes rejection was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals kaolin used in this work was an algerian natural product a barbotine from the ghazaouet area western part of algeria zirconium oxide mw 123 22 g mol and 3 mercaptopropyl trimethyoxysilane mw 196 34 g mol assay percent range 85 were purchased from sigma aldrich and acros organics respectively the feed solutions were prepared from analytical grade chemical products from fluka methyl green neutral red and rb5 and merck na2so4 mgcl2 mgso4 kcl and nacl further all solutions were prepared from milli q quality water 2 2 membrane synthesis we synthesized two different kinds of membranes a support layer made up of a barbotine get from the western part of algeria was first prepared according to the protocol described in 16 a layer consisting of kaolin and zro2 3 was further coated onto the support after sintering at 1050 c for 2 h a composite membrane labeled um01 composed of the support layer and a 10 μm thick skin layer with pore diameters around 0 1 μm was obtained the second membrane labeled aum01 was obtained by adding a thin layer of alkoxide 3 mercaptopropyl trimethyoxysilane 85 mptms onto the um01 membrane surface this top layer was prepared via a sol gel technique by mixing h2o hcl 3 mptms ethanol in the volume ration of 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 from a colloidal suspension of mptms in alcohol followed by peptization under acidic conditions the presence of the intermediate kaolin zro2 layer is here essential since it connects as a bridge between the macroporous support and the top layer thus it is of a great importance to avoid infiltration of this latter into the support when the transmembrane pressure tmp is applied the slip casting procedure was followed by drying and calcination at 780 c 2 3 membrane characterization the membrane chemical analysis was performed by x ray fluorescence arl optim x wdxrf spectrometer x ray diffraction xrd was carried out with an xpert mpd automated powder diffractometer using cuka1 radiation source a 1 54056 å the structure and morphology of the two membrane were characterized by scanning electron microscopy jeol jmc 6000 the infrared spectra of the mptms layer were obtained with a ft ir 4100 fourier transform infrared spectrometer jasco spectra were collected from 400 to 4000 cm 1 at 2 cm 1 resolution and each spectrum was averaged from 128 scans after background recording performed at ambient air a zeta cad cad inst france electrokinetic analyzer was used for tangential streaming potential tsp measurements the device measures the electrical potential difference generated by the pressure induced circulation of an electrolyte solution a milli molar kcl solution was used in this work through a thin slit channel formed by a couple of identical membranes it is worth mentioning that tsp measurements were performed with flat sheet membrane samples tsp δe was further used to assess the membrane apparent zeta potential ζ from the helmholtz smoluchowski equation 17 1 δ e δ p ε 0 ε r ζ η λ 0 where δp is the pressure difference applied through the channel formed by the two membrane samples ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and εr η and λ0 are the dielectric constant viscosity and electric conductivity of the measuring solution respectively 2 4 ultrafiltration tests tubular membranes length 30 cm inner diameter 13 mm outer diameter 16 mm were used for cross flow filtration experiments a schematic of filtration unit is shown in fig 1 performed at a tmp of 4 bar ultrafiltration performance was mainly described through permeability lp water flux j and rejection rate r salt rejection of na2so4 mgcl2 mgso4 and nacl solutions at ph 6 0 0 2 and different concentrations 500 1000 and 1500pm was determined according to 2 r 100 1 c p c f where cp and cf are the permeate and feed concentrations respectively salt concentrations in the permeate solutions were determined from conductivity measurements eq 2 was used to determine dye rejections too synthetic dye solutions 5 l at three concentration 10 5 10 4 10 3 m were filtered tangentially for 2 h under a tmp of 4 bar both permeate and feed concentrations were determined from visible spectrophotometry optizen120 uv the main characteristics of the dye solutions are collected in table 1 all rejection results reported hereafter represent the average values of three successive experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 chemical analysis the chemical analysis of the um01 membrane was performed from x ray fluorescence table 2 it indicated that sio2 and al2o3 were the major components of the powder 3 1 2 xrd analysis the xrd spectra of the um01 membrane skin layer obtained before and after sintering at 1050 c are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively before sintering the main phases observed were kaolinite k muscovite m and quartz q however for samples sintered at 1050 c the kaolinite phase was no longer detected xrd shows that mullite phase mu was the main crystalline mineral in the sintered powder and zirconia zr monoclinic system was detected as a minor phase moreover the peaks observed for the aum01 skin layer fig 2 c at 2θ 21 and 28 corresponding to si and s peaks respectively clearly confirmed the coating of mptms over the membrane surface during heating from 950 c metakaolinis transformed into aluminum silicon spinel si3al4o12 which is also referred to as a gamma alumina type structure upon calcination to around 1050 c the spinel phase nucleates and is transformed into mullite 3al2o3 2sio2 and highly crystalline cristobalite shrinkage of the sample volume is significant and porosity decreases 20 21 these identified phases are of great importance because of their interesting mechanical properties such as high young s modulus 3 1 3 morphology fig 3 shows the images of sem of two ceramic membranes before and after coating with mptms there are any difference found between ceramic membranes before and after coating with thin layer um01 membrane before coating has large pore size compared with the aum01 membrane ceramic membrane after coating with top layer has a smaller pore size because it has been covered by the mptms particles 3 1 4 ftir spectroscopy analysis fig 4 presents the ftir spectra of the aum01 membrane mptms skin layer before a and after b sintering at 780 c see section 2 2 ftir spectra of mptms before sintering fig 4 a reveal the large broad band appeared over the range of 3000 3400 cm 1 probably is emerge from presence of oh the peaks around 1100 and 1600 cm 1 may be due to vibrational and bending modes of hoh respectively and co stretching vibrations was appeared in 1000 cm 1 26 the band at 997 cm 1 and 1115 cm 1corresponds to the asymmetric stretching of the sioc and siosi bonds respectively 22 23 the band at 1240 cm 1 is associated with sirs stretching 22 23 the ftir spectrum recorded after sintering fig 4 b shows the most prominent a new peaks was found around 1053 cm 1 that may be belong to the stretching and bending vibration of osio and sio of silanol groups band from mptms while the characteristic band due to oh disappears after sintering ftir results suggest that mptms creates a sio2 network by producing siosi inter bonds 3 1 5 electrokinetic characterization fig 5 shows the ph dependence of zeta potential determined from tsp measurements for both um01 and aum01 membranes the membranes surface charge density as well as their surface potential change with ph because the protonation degree of functional groups on the membrane surface is greatly dependent on ph 24 the isoelectric points i e p of the um01 and aum01 membranes were found to be around 3 and 2 8 respectively the membrane surfaces being overall negatively charged for ph higher than these values and positively charged for lower ph such an amphoteric behavior comes from protonation deprotonation of hydroxyl groups onto the membranes surfaces the ph dependence of the um01 and aum01 zeta potentials depends upon the reactivity of surface hydroxyl groups with the potential determining ions h which modifies the net charge of the membrane surface although both membranes have relatively close i e p the aum01 membrane exhibits much larger negative zeta potentials than the um01 membrane which is expected to impact the membrane separation performance regarding charged solutes due to stronger donnan exclusion in the case of the aum01 membrane 3 2 water flux and permeability pure water fluxes of both um01 and aum01 membranes are shown in fig 6 in both cases the water flux was found to vary linearly with the tmp as expected from darcy s law the hydraulic permeability deduced from the slope flux f tmp indicated an almost three fold higher permeability for the um01 membrane 88 4 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 than for the aum01 membrane 31 7 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 a decrease in the flux was observed for both membranes during the first 30 min of operation before a steady state was reached fig 7 the same time was required to reach steady state with salt and dye solutions lower flux obtained with salt solutions resulted from concentration polarization 3 3 retention rate of salts and dyes 3 3 1 effect of concentration and ionic strength on salt rejection salt rejection performance of both um01 and aum01 membranes obtained for single salt solutions nacl mgcl2 na2so4 and mgso4 in the ph range 5 8 6 2 and for a tmp of 4 bar is shown in fig 8 for both membranes and whatever the electrolyte rejection rates were found to decrease with increasing feed concentrations see fig 8 a and c this is the signature of a rejection mechanism ruled by the so called donnan exclusion salts with magnesium cations mgcl2 and mgso4 were less rejected than salts with sodium cations nacl and na2so4 which is in line with negative zeta potentials measured for both membranes in the ph range 5 8 6 2 see fig 5 since bivalent cations are more attracted by the negative membrane charge than monovalent cations fig 8b and d confirm the dominant donnan exclusion mechanism since a clear correlation between the salt rejection and the medium ionic strength was found indeed an increase in the ionic strength leads to compression of the electrochemical double layer and then to weaker electrostatic repulsions 3 3 2 dye rejection fig 9 shows the variation of dye rejection as a function of concentration the aum01 membrane exhibits higher rejections than the um01 membrane whatever the dye is for the aum01 membrane rejection was found to be almost independent of the dye concentration for the concentration range under investigation while the um01 membrane performance was more sensitive to dye concentration this can be explained by the larger pores of the um01 membrane as compared to the aum01 membrane ones in addition to the weaker electrostatic interactions between charged dyes and the um01 membrane interestingly the rejection of the anionic dye rb5 was lower than the one of cationic dyes mg and nr although the pristine membranes were negatively charged fig 5 a possible explanation is the adsorption of cationic dyes onto the negatively charged pores in the first times of filtration which causes a decrease in the pore size along the charge reversal surface this leads to strong repulsive interactions between adsorbed and free mg and nr molecules on the other hand no or at least limited adsorption of rb5 is expected onto the like charged membranes which pore size is not reduced during rb5 filtration 4 conclusion the aim of this work was to develop characterize and test new ultrafiltration ceramic membranes synthesized from a locally available barbotine kaolin zirconia and 3 mercaptopropyltrimethyoxysilane it was recognized from the tangential streaming potential measurements that membranes were negatively charged over a wide range of ph further both salt and dye rejections were strongly influenced by electrostatic interactions with the membrane surface an anionic and two cationics were considered in ultrafiltration experiments very promising performance was obtained for the different dyes with experimental rejections ranging from 80 to 100 for the most efficient membrane higher rejections were obtained with cationic dyes which were attributed to strong electrostatic repulsions between dyes and membranes after dye adsorption onto the membrane pores leading to i pore size reduction and ii surface charge reversal acknowledgment we wish to thank gratefully professor anthony szymczyk from the institute of chemical sciences of rennes

14392,the present work aims at developing and testing two new ultrafiltration ceramic membranes synthesized from a locally available barbotine kaolin zirconia um01 membrane and 3 mercaptopropyl trimethyoxysilane aum01 the electrokinetic characterization of membranes highlighted a negative charge density over a wide range of ph the addition of 3 mercaptopropyl trimethyoxysilane leads to a decrease in water permeability from around 95 35 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 for both membranes it was recognized that salt and dye rejections were strongly influenced by electrostatic interactions with the membrane surface where a considerable loss of performance with the increasing of ionic solution strength was induced the maximum dye rejections were obtained with the aum01 membrane and were close to 100 and 80 for cationic methyl green and neutral red and anionic reactive black5 dyes respectively keywords membrane dyes zeta potential electrostatic interactions filtration ceramic 1 introduction altought the two thirds of the earth s surface are covered by water only 3 of the world s water is fresh water and two thirds of that is tucked is unavailable for our use that is mainly caused by the presence of a variety of contaminants in raw water where their average size ranges from the micrometric scale e g bacteria to a few tenths of nanometers solvated ions membrane processes like microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have proved their efficiency in the field of water treatment in various industrial sectors such as drinking water production and industrial effluents treatment ceramic membranes offer better properties as compared to organic ones in term of thermal chemical and mechanical stability as well as resistance to microbial degradation 1 moreover they are suitable for applications in many fields such as wastewater recycling textile food and pharmaceutical industries 2 3 the electrokinetic properties of membranes play a significant role in their separation performance and fouling tendency since they exert a high influence on the magnitude of the interactions between the membrane and the feed liquid thus the permeation fluxes of both solvent and solutes is affected through the membrane pores 4 27 ceramic membranes electrokinetic properties are commonly studied by electrophoretic mobility 5 6 electroosmosis flow rate 7 and streaming potential measurements 6 12 membrane potential measurements can also be used to get relevant information about the membrane density charge 13 14 clays are interesting materials for ceramic supports and membranes in our previous work a thin layer of alkoxide 98 tetraethylorthosilicate was coated onto a kaolin zirconia membrane and the resulting membrane showed interesting results for dyes and heavy metals removal 15 25 in the present work we synthesized new ultrafiltration ceramic membranes from clays zirconia and alkoxide these membranes were further characterized by x ray fluorescence x ray diffraction spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy infrared spectroscopy and tangential streaming potential measurements finally their performance in terms of salts and dyes rejection was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals kaolin used in this work was an algerian natural product a barbotine from the ghazaouet area western part of algeria zirconium oxide mw 123 22 g mol and 3 mercaptopropyl trimethyoxysilane mw 196 34 g mol assay percent range 85 were purchased from sigma aldrich and acros organics respectively the feed solutions were prepared from analytical grade chemical products from fluka methyl green neutral red and rb5 and merck na2so4 mgcl2 mgso4 kcl and nacl further all solutions were prepared from milli q quality water 2 2 membrane synthesis we synthesized two different kinds of membranes a support layer made up of a barbotine get from the western part of algeria was first prepared according to the protocol described in 16 a layer consisting of kaolin and zro2 3 was further coated onto the support after sintering at 1050 c for 2 h a composite membrane labeled um01 composed of the support layer and a 10 μm thick skin layer with pore diameters around 0 1 μm was obtained the second membrane labeled aum01 was obtained by adding a thin layer of alkoxide 3 mercaptopropyl trimethyoxysilane 85 mptms onto the um01 membrane surface this top layer was prepared via a sol gel technique by mixing h2o hcl 3 mptms ethanol in the volume ration of 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 from a colloidal suspension of mptms in alcohol followed by peptization under acidic conditions the presence of the intermediate kaolin zro2 layer is here essential since it connects as a bridge between the macroporous support and the top layer thus it is of a great importance to avoid infiltration of this latter into the support when the transmembrane pressure tmp is applied the slip casting procedure was followed by drying and calcination at 780 c 2 3 membrane characterization the membrane chemical analysis was performed by x ray fluorescence arl optim x wdxrf spectrometer x ray diffraction xrd was carried out with an xpert mpd automated powder diffractometer using cuka1 radiation source a 1 54056 å the structure and morphology of the two membrane were characterized by scanning electron microscopy jeol jmc 6000 the infrared spectra of the mptms layer were obtained with a ft ir 4100 fourier transform infrared spectrometer jasco spectra were collected from 400 to 4000 cm 1 at 2 cm 1 resolution and each spectrum was averaged from 128 scans after background recording performed at ambient air a zeta cad cad inst france electrokinetic analyzer was used for tangential streaming potential tsp measurements the device measures the electrical potential difference generated by the pressure induced circulation of an electrolyte solution a milli molar kcl solution was used in this work through a thin slit channel formed by a couple of identical membranes it is worth mentioning that tsp measurements were performed with flat sheet membrane samples tsp δe was further used to assess the membrane apparent zeta potential ζ from the helmholtz smoluchowski equation 17 1 δ e δ p ε 0 ε r ζ η λ 0 where δp is the pressure difference applied through the channel formed by the two membrane samples ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and εr η and λ0 are the dielectric constant viscosity and electric conductivity of the measuring solution respectively 2 4 ultrafiltration tests tubular membranes length 30 cm inner diameter 13 mm outer diameter 16 mm were used for cross flow filtration experiments a schematic of filtration unit is shown in fig 1 performed at a tmp of 4 bar ultrafiltration performance was mainly described through permeability lp water flux j and rejection rate r salt rejection of na2so4 mgcl2 mgso4 and nacl solutions at ph 6 0 0 2 and different concentrations 500 1000 and 1500pm was determined according to 2 r 100 1 c p c f where cp and cf are the permeate and feed concentrations respectively salt concentrations in the permeate solutions were determined from conductivity measurements eq 2 was used to determine dye rejections too synthetic dye solutions 5 l at three concentration 10 5 10 4 10 3 m were filtered tangentially for 2 h under a tmp of 4 bar both permeate and feed concentrations were determined from visible spectrophotometry optizen120 uv the main characteristics of the dye solutions are collected in table 1 all rejection results reported hereafter represent the average values of three successive experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 chemical analysis the chemical analysis of the um01 membrane was performed from x ray fluorescence table 2 it indicated that sio2 and al2o3 were the major components of the powder 3 1 2 xrd analysis the xrd spectra of the um01 membrane skin layer obtained before and after sintering at 1050 c are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively before sintering the main phases observed were kaolinite k muscovite m and quartz q however for samples sintered at 1050 c the kaolinite phase was no longer detected xrd shows that mullite phase mu was the main crystalline mineral in the sintered powder and zirconia zr monoclinic system was detected as a minor phase moreover the peaks observed for the aum01 skin layer fig 2 c at 2θ 21 and 28 corresponding to si and s peaks respectively clearly confirmed the coating of mptms over the membrane surface during heating from 950 c metakaolinis transformed into aluminum silicon spinel si3al4o12 which is also referred to as a gamma alumina type structure upon calcination to around 1050 c the spinel phase nucleates and is transformed into mullite 3al2o3 2sio2 and highly crystalline cristobalite shrinkage of the sample volume is significant and porosity decreases 20 21 these identified phases are of great importance because of their interesting mechanical properties such as high young s modulus 3 1 3 morphology fig 3 shows the images of sem of two ceramic membranes before and after coating with mptms there are any difference found between ceramic membranes before and after coating with thin layer um01 membrane before coating has large pore size compared with the aum01 membrane ceramic membrane after coating with top layer has a smaller pore size because it has been covered by the mptms particles 3 1 4 ftir spectroscopy analysis fig 4 presents the ftir spectra of the aum01 membrane mptms skin layer before a and after b sintering at 780 c see section 2 2 ftir spectra of mptms before sintering fig 4 a reveal the large broad band appeared over the range of 3000 3400 cm 1 probably is emerge from presence of oh the peaks around 1100 and 1600 cm 1 may be due to vibrational and bending modes of hoh respectively and co stretching vibrations was appeared in 1000 cm 1 26 the band at 997 cm 1 and 1115 cm 1corresponds to the asymmetric stretching of the sioc and siosi bonds respectively 22 23 the band at 1240 cm 1 is associated with sirs stretching 22 23 the ftir spectrum recorded after sintering fig 4 b shows the most prominent a new peaks was found around 1053 cm 1 that may be belong to the stretching and bending vibration of osio and sio of silanol groups band from mptms while the characteristic band due to oh disappears after sintering ftir results suggest that mptms creates a sio2 network by producing siosi inter bonds 3 1 5 electrokinetic characterization fig 5 shows the ph dependence of zeta potential determined from tsp measurements for both um01 and aum01 membranes the membranes surface charge density as well as their surface potential change with ph because the protonation degree of functional groups on the membrane surface is greatly dependent on ph 24 the isoelectric points i e p of the um01 and aum01 membranes were found to be around 3 and 2 8 respectively the membrane surfaces being overall negatively charged for ph higher than these values and positively charged for lower ph such an amphoteric behavior comes from protonation deprotonation of hydroxyl groups onto the membranes surfaces the ph dependence of the um01 and aum01 zeta potentials depends upon the reactivity of surface hydroxyl groups with the potential determining ions h which modifies the net charge of the membrane surface although both membranes have relatively close i e p the aum01 membrane exhibits much larger negative zeta potentials than the um01 membrane which is expected to impact the membrane separation performance regarding charged solutes due to stronger donnan exclusion in the case of the aum01 membrane 3 2 water flux and permeability pure water fluxes of both um01 and aum01 membranes are shown in fig 6 in both cases the water flux was found to vary linearly with the tmp as expected from darcy s law the hydraulic permeability deduced from the slope flux f tmp indicated an almost three fold higher permeability for the um01 membrane 88 4 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 than for the aum01 membrane 31 7 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 a decrease in the flux was observed for both membranes during the first 30 min of operation before a steady state was reached fig 7 the same time was required to reach steady state with salt and dye solutions lower flux obtained with salt solutions resulted from concentration polarization 3 3 retention rate of salts and dyes 3 3 1 effect of concentration and ionic strength on salt rejection salt rejection performance of both um01 and aum01 membranes obtained for single salt solutions nacl mgcl2 na2so4 and mgso4

the concentration range under investigation while the um01 membrane performance was more sensitive to dye concentration this can be explained by the larger pores of the um01 membrane as compared to the aum01 membrane ones in addition to the weaker electrostatic interactions between charged dyes and the um01 membrane interestingly the rejection of the anionic dye rb5 was lower than the one of

14393,in thiswork cellulose acetate zinc oxide zeolite composite membranes were successfully synthesized via a simple dips method for the removal of benzophenone 3 from water the influence of the different concentrations of cellulose acetate and zeolites zinc oxide nano composite particles were prepared and inserted in the membrane matrix the resulting membrane was characterized by atr ir xrd sem icp oes and afm analysis the water uptake study was also carried out to know hydrophobicity of the membrane the membrane performances were significantly improved after the addition of zno zeolite in the cellulose acetate solution in ascending order the concentration of zeolite zno enhances the hydrophilicity of the membranes the membrane showed 98 rejection of benzophenone 3 in neutral ph however rejection and permeate flux increases with the concentration of zeolite zno the effect of applied pressure and feed concentration was studied and discussed with scientific reasons keywords nanotechnology benzophenone 3 cellulose acetate zeolites membrane and emerging contaminants 1 introduction in the fast growing population diminishing water resources and climate changes are extending the duration of droughts and floods by making drinking water a contentious resource in many parts of the world over the past decade the presence of pharmaceuticals personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs in water source are inevitably a growing global concern due to their noticeable effects on aquatic life notable skewing of sex ratios and their unknown effects on humans 1 these contaminants invade surface waters primarily via wastewater effluents and could also be the result of agricultural activities in this regard an exceptional and efficient water purification technology is considered as an urgent need to address the problems related to benzophenone 3 such as water shortages health energy and climate change benzophenone 3 bp 3 is well known sunscreen agent and its metabolite 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone have been detected in human urine it directly enters in to the gastrointestinal tract benzophenone 3 has complex receptor interactions in vitro and are estrogenic in fish hence removal of bp 3 is a major issue and it is very serious threat for aquatic ecosystem usually for removal of ec s photocatalytic degradation is feasible process but bp 3 lacks functional groups that difficult to degrade in the environmental water there are very well known treatments for benzophenone 3removal i e biological treatment systems activated sludge and biological trickling filter 2 physicochemical treatment like coagulation flocculation and lime softening 3 membrane processes like microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nano filtration nf and reverse osmosis ro are considered as promising alternatives in removing the huge amounts of organic micro pollutants 4 nf and ro are proven to be very effective filtration technologies in withdrawing micro pollutants 5 6 the preparation of a soft membrane with an excellent selective properties and molecular sieving properties is very desirable from both practical and fundamental stand points one of the common methods is to combine a crystalline such as porous solid metal oxide with a flexible cheap and abundant organic matrix cellulose acetate there are several reports found on metal oxides induced membranes for water purification tio2 7 zno 8 al2o3 9 zeolite 10 graphene oxide 11 and carbon nano tubes 12 are showed impact in membrane separation among these metal oxides zeolite has unique property which is very obliging to the membrane separation zeolites are crystalline micro porous and tetrahedral units of aluminosilicates these are made up of silicon oxygen and aluminum oxygen bonded tetrahedron units which are negatively charged hydrophilic pillers overall around 46 natural and 150 synthetic zeolite minerals are known in the literature among all these zeolite x showed better properties for membrane separation because of its wide micro porous nature however zno is also one of the impressed metal oxides in membrane technology zno repress the formation of macro void on the membrane surface which increases mechanical strength and dense surface a porous zeolite and zno nanoparticles combined together provide a better characteristic for membrane application the incorporation of these combined nanoparticles in cellulose acetate membrane matrix deserves significant attention for many potential applications they have excellent molecular sieving function large surface areas and controlled host sorbet interactions especially at low vapor pressure the current study reports on the structural and physiochemical features of inorganic polymer hybrid nanocomposite membranes the membranes prepared by infusing the synthesized zeolite supported zno nano particles into the cellulose acetate polymer matrix membrane to our knowledge limited studies were reported on mixed matrix membrane for bp 3 edc removal the present work was focused on removal of bp 3 using ca zno zeolite mixed matrix membrane the synthesized zeolite supported zno nanoparticle was characterized by atr ir spectroscopy to prove the influence of zno zeolite with variation in the ways of incorporation on the shifting of bonds and molecular level interactions occurring within the nanocomposite membrane changes in the surface morphologies of the skin layer of mixed matrix membranes were investigated via scanning electron microscopy sem quantitative surface roughness analysis is analyzed by using atomic force microscopy afm to probe the role of nanomaterials in influencing membrane topographies dead end filtration technique was employed to understand the performance of the

stirred for 40 min at ambient condition after the evaporation of solvent in a hot air oven at 90 c for two hours after complete evaporation of the solvent the dried solid powder was crushed by grinding in mortar and pestle for the formation of homogeneous solid state mixture the powdered mixture was then calcinted at 300 c for 5 h to get the zeolite supported zno catalyst 14 the zeolite

membranes table 1 displays the concentration of nanoparticles and cellulose acetate in the membranes 10 zno zeolite supported nanoparticle was initially sonicated for 1 h in dmf and acetone mixture 25 ml and 60 ml respectively followed by 4 h stirring to avoid agglomeration of nps cellulose acetate was added further into the casting solution and stirred for 24 h to get viscous casting solution finally solution was sonicated for 30 min and was left to stand for 10 min prior to casting to remove air bubbles then the solution was poured on 6 mm thick glass plate and casted using the smooth glass rod casted membrane was exposed in fume hood for 20 s to remove volatiles and to form dense layer on the membrane surface subsequently the glass plate was immersed in coagulation bath containing the cold water for 40 50 min membrane sheet precipitates out in the coagulation bath finally the membrane was thoroughly washed with distilled water several times and stored in distilled water at ambient temperature for 24 h to improve the membrane mechanical strength the composite membrane with different concentration of zeolite supported zno nanoparticle was labeled as cam caze 1 caze 2 and caze 3 2 4 characterization the crystal structure of the synthesized zno zeolite supported zno nanoparticles and zeolite powder was characterized by philips x pert pro x ray diffractometer xrd shimadzu xd d1 with graphite monochromatized cu k alpha 15418 å radiation source with a scanning speed of 20 min scanning electron microscopy sem micrographs were studied using carl zeiss field

then used for membrane shimadzu make uv 1800 uv vis spectrophotometer with uv probe software was used to measure the absorption spectrum of the sample 2 5 water uptake study hydrophilicity of the membrane was determined by water uptake capacity this study includes immersion of membrane samples in deionized water at room temperature for 24 h followed by blotting the wet membranes to remove surface adhering water droplets which are then quickly weighed finally these membranes were dried in and weighed again the water uptake of the membranes can be calculated by gravimetric analysis by comparing the weight gain of the wet membrane with reference to the dry membrane and reported as weight percent water absorption the water uptake can be calculated as follows 1 water uptake w w w d w d 100 where ww is the weight of wet membrane and wd is the weight of dry membrane 16 2 5 1 performance study of the membrane to evaluate the permeation and rejection properties of the membranes self constructed dead end filtration unit was used in the ambient temperature during the entire experiment 17 a circular membrane with 60 mm diameter was placed in the test cell with the active surface facing towards the incoming feed and membrane effective area is about 5 mm in order to minimize experimental errors the average of three reported values was taken 2 5 1 1 pure water flux water flux was measured by direct permeation measurement of distilled water and reported in liter per meter square per hour l m2h at different pressure from 200 to 1000 kpa 2 5 1 2 rejection study in order to determine the rejection properties of the prepared membranes the rejection of bp 3 experiment was carried in the same filtration unit the feed sample bp 3 solution of different concentrations 1 3 and 6 ppm was prepared and the rejection studies were conducted under different pressures from 200 kpa to 1000 kpa at the difference pressure interval of 200 kpa the concentration of bp 3 in feed and permeate was measured by uv spectrophotometer by photometric method at a wavelength of 298 nm the spectrum of feed and permeate was also recorded to evaluate the bp 3 peak absorbance in the feed and permeate the percent rejection was calculated using the following equation 18 2 rejection 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the concentrations of permeate and feed respectively experiments were conducted in triplicate and the average results were reported 3 results and discussions zeolites are porous alumino silicates with uniform pore sizes between 0 3 and 1 nm 19 and pore volumes from about 0 10 0 35 cm3 g the pore size distribution is very uniform and sharp due to the fact that the pores form the part of the crystal structure itself unlike clay which tends to swell during operation zeolites offer preferential flow paths for water molecules while maintaining the rigidity of its framework another special aspect of this structure is that the pore and channel sizes are nearly uniform allowing the crystal to act as a molecular sieve at the angstrom scale the porous zeolites act as a host to water and other small molecules allowing only appropriate molecular size to pass through its pores imparting the molecular sieving property 20 adsorption property of zeolites is closely related to the location of non framework cations and to their accessibility to adsorbed molecules in the studies we have used zeolite x faujasite it is known to be a very stable zeolite and hydration has very little impact on its overall structure unlike some other open framework solids clinoptilolite aluminophosphates 21 22 molecular simulations were performed in the classical limit no bond breaking take place for instance this justified by the fact that no hydrolysis is observed upon water adsorption 23 due to the weak bonding of water with the faujasite framework additionally the ion exchange capacity is inversely proportional to the si al ratio based on the previous studies the specific ion exchange capacity depends on the structure of the zeolite the si al ratio and the ions to be exchanged 24 however implementation of zno in zeolite matrix increases the hydrophilicity as well as charge to the metal oxide composites 3 1 x ray diffraction analysis the xrd studies of zno nanoparticle and zeolite supported 10 zno nanoparticles and zeolite powders were conducted xrd pattern of the same are shown in fig 1 xrd pattern of zno nanoparticles exhibited the peaks at 2θ equal to 31 67 34 31 36 14 47 40 56 52 62 73 66 28 67 91 and 69 03 which corresponded to a typical diffraction of zincite with hexagonal symmetry these peaks perfectly matched with the reference to jcpds card no 36 1451 and the lattice parameters are a 3 24982 å c 5 20661 å 25 synthesized zno nanoparticles are pure as no impurity peaks were detected crystalline size of zno was found to be 33 nm and it was determined using scherer s formula 26 from the xrd analysis of zeolite peaks are found at 12 16 19 20 24 27 31 and 32 are equal to 2θ and those are characteristic peaks of zeolite x type 27 xrd intensity of characteristic peaks of zeolite material indicates the crystallinity extent and the concentration of the crystalline content of zeolite 28 from the xrd pattern of zeolite supported 10 zno it is found that there is alittle increase in the intensity of peaks at 2θ equal to 12 16 19 20 24 27 31 67 34 31 36 14 47 40 56 52 62 73 66 28 67 91 and 69 03 confirms the impregnation of zno on the zeolite powder 10 zno zeolite powder low concentration of zno metal ion is used in this study and further crystalline phases of metal ions were not detected in any pattern still that metal ions are dispersed at the cation phases of zeolites rendering them undetectable by xrd the observed peaks in the range of 30 to 50 could be indexed as the wurtzite structure of zno which is well matched with standard diffraction data jcpds 36 145 3 2 scanning electron microscopic sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx analysis fig 2 presents the sem micrographs of zno zeolite and zeolite supported 10 znosamples sem analysis examines the distribution of zno species over the zeolite it is seen that the clean surface of zeolite crystals is covered by the zno particles and there is no noticeable change in the typical morphology of the support after the loading of zno as can be seen from the sem images zno nanoparticles are like clusters attaching to the zeolite surface the edx spectra of zno fig 2 nanoparticles confirm the presence of pure oxygen and zinc without impurities it is evidenced from the edx spectra and elemental compositions in table 2 the presence of si and al constituent of zeolite and also the presence of zn conforms the impregnation of zno on zeolite composite powder the molar si al ratio for used zeolite x is about 1 1 34 3 3 icp studies of zeolite supported zno nanoparticles inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes elemental analysis of zeolite supported zno powder was carried out after sample digestion in order to determine the concentration of aluminum silica and zinc it is found that the silica and aluminum content in zeolite powder is 25 28 and 18 6 respectively and the zinc content was found to be 10 3 w v basis this summarizes the zno loading by solid state dispersion technique based on the icp studies it is possible to calculate si al ratio of the zeolite the si al proportion is 1 1 34 and as per the literature in zeolite x si al ratio expected value ranges from 1 to 1 5 29 3 4 morphology studies of ca and ca zno zeolite composite membrane the surface morphology of the membrane as illustrated in fig 3 a c the cross section images are depicted in fig 3 d f clearly it is noted that the dispersion of zno zeolite nano particles nps on the membrane surfaces was varied according to the concentration of nps the membranes prepared with less amount of nps exhibited more dispersion of nps in fig 3 a as compared to membranes of higher amount of nps i e fig 3 b and c the dispersion of nps is higher and clear in fig 3 a than in fig 3 b and c in fig 3 a the amount of nps is high so that it agglomerates and forms clusters in fig 3b and c the cross sectional images gives fine information on the incorporation of nps embedded in the polymer matrix layers as well as productivity of the membranes fig 3 c not showed any zno zeolite in the polymer but we could notice nps in all other images fig 3 d and f also the structure of membrane layers has been changed accordingly with zno zeolite content increases the viscosity of the casting solution will also increase which will disturb or troubles the penetration of nps deeper into the polymer matrix during phase inversion process the finger like projections in the sub layer of the membranes fainted and changed to spongy like projections with the increase in dosage of the nano filers as reported earlier it is found that increasing the nps could intensifies the formation of crosslinking structure between nps and polymeric chains inhibiting the growth of finger like projections as can be seen in fig 3 a d and e the main factor contributing to the formation of macro voids is the liquid liquid demixing behavior during phase inversion process since zno zeolite has more affinity towards water than the polymer chains the penetration velocity of nps into polymer matrix and the increase of solvent diffusion velocity of membrane to water are higher during phase inversion 30 when a membrane casting solution with nanofillers is quenched in water bath the nanofillers can act as a crystal nuclei and hence leading to crystallized polymer chains around them as shown in the cross sectional views 31 thus it can be concluded that the concentration of nps plays an influential role controlling the membrane structure as well as the overall performance of the membranes however membrane cracks were observed because of bombardment of high beam electrons during sem scan this phenomenon is common for non conducting material 3 5 atr ir atr ir spectra of ca and their composites are presented in fig 4 the main characteristic peaks of ca were assigned as follows characteristic absorption peak at 3500 cm 1 can be attributed to the presence of oh group and the peaks at 1743 cm 1 1270 cm 1and 1050 cm 1 were correlated to the stretching of co group ether group and co bond of the ch2 oh group respectively the ir values of the ca were compared with the spectra of composite membrane it is observed that the characteristics peak of oh group was shifted from 3450 cm 1to 3461 cm 1 as shown in fig 4 similar peak shifting is also seen for the peaks located at 1743 1270 and 1050 cm 1 the observed shifts in the peaks may be may be ascribed to the formation of h bonding between zno and ca 3 6 water uptake behavior water uptake study was performed at different ph range fig 5 shows the percentage of water uptake of prepared membranes at different ph values ca membrane shows higher water uptake at ph 7 as it is being hydrophilic in nature 32 with the increase of zeolite zno composite concentration in the blend membranes water absorption capacity decreased caze 3 membrane showed less water uptake when compared with ca membrane as depicted in fig 5 the overall uptake ratio of membranes are due to several factors one factor is due to the absorption of water into the polymer matrix and second factor is due to the retention of water by capillary in the membrane pores there is a possibility of opening the pores of membranes under different ph conditions 33 the membrane ca only showed more water absorption and membrane caze 3 showed lesser at neutral ph compared to other membranes it is a well known fact that ca membrane is hydrophilic in nature while insertion of nanopillers closes the pores which hinder water retained in capillary of the membrane 34 the same observation was found in neutral and basic medium water uptake is mainly driven by solvent diffusion but in acidic ph the due to protonation the chain relaxation effect occurs caze 1 caze 2 and caze 3 membranes showed more water uptake in basic ph due to the exchange of hydrogen ion however under strong acidic ph condition membrane was unstable due to the formation of larger pores which resulted in more water uptake of the membrane 3 7 performance study of the membrane the membrane material composition influences the water flux fig 6 shows the water permeation results it is evident from fig 6 that there is an increase in water permeation with an increase in the pressure and the composition of membrane material fabricated dead end filtration unit was used for all permeation studies and experiments carried out at room temperature the procedure was followed as described in previous publication 35 a 60 mm circular membrane was placed in the test cell with the top surface towards feed sample and membrane effective area around 5 cm2 water flux value is reported in l m2h water flux increased with an increase in the composition of zeolite supported zno nanoparticles caze 3 membrane showed highest water flux it implies that the hydrophilicity increases with the nanopillers however increasing of flux with respect to pressure is approximately linear it may say that the poresizes are probably symmetric in nature 3 7 1 rejection with different concentration the rejection studies of bp 3 were conducted as same as water flux study the experiments were performed in triplicates and mean results were reported the effect of pressure and feed concentration on performance of membranes were studied fig 7 shows permeate flux and fig 8 shows rejection of feed sample caze 3 membrane showed highest rejection when compared with all other membranes it showed 98 of rejection of bp 3 at 200 kpa pressure the rejection of the membrane is maximum as compare to literature one p krzeminski et al reported that uf membranes showed 73 rejection with 50 ppm of feed concentration 36 however y yoon et al also reported low rejection as compare to ca zeolite zno mixed matrix membranes 37 moreover in this study the rejection was more than 98 with the increase of feed concentration and decreased with the increase of pressure permeate of the feed sample clearly reflects high productivity in zeolite zno composite membrane as compared to ca membrane the permeate flux is more with respect to increase of concentration of zeolite zno composite nano particles in the membranes while increasing pressure the permeate flux increases it means the pores are ruptured at higher pressure however the feed concentration has not affected the productivity greatly the rejection experiment was extended to the laboratory prepared feed water 1 3 and 6 ppm of bp 3 was used in the feed tank the concentration of feed sample does not effect on membrane performance the caz 3 membrane showed slight more rejection than the other membranes the reuse of the membranes was tested in 200 kpa pressure initially the rejection was continued up to 120 min and afterwards the membrane was washed with distilled water and again used for rejection experiment rejection rate of membranes were checked before wash and after the wash of the membranes as depicted in fig 9 in the case of caze 3 there was a declining trend in rejection with the increase of the operation time but after membrane wash the rejection rate was increased again this is because of concentration polarization in the feed sample however in all the membranes a slight decrease in rejection was observed the results deflect that the membrane performance was decreased with the cycles of reusability 4 conclusion cellulose acetate with zno zeolite composite membranes were prepared by dips method the membrane was characterized by atr ir xrd sem and icp studies the prepared membrane is hydrophilic in nature at basic and acidic ph which is confirmed by water uptake studies at different ph the membrane showed better rejection of benzophenone 3 about 98 rejection was observed in maximum concentration of ca zno zeolite composite membrane however the rejection was decreased with respect to concentration of zno zeolite the feed concentration also affected the performance of the membrane increase in the concentration of benzophenone 3 increases the rejection efficiency however the rejection decreased with applying higher pressure finally the membrane has capability to remove 98 of benzophenone 3 from feed water acknowledgement the

14393,in thiswork cellulose acetate zinc oxide zeolite composite membranes were successfully synthesized via a simple dips method for the removal of benzophenone 3 from water the influence of the different concentrations of cellulose acetate and zeolites zinc oxide nano composite particles were prepared and inserted in the membrane matrix the resulting membrane was characterized by atr ir xrd sem icp oes and afm analysis the water uptake study was also carried out to know hydrophobicity of the membrane the membrane performances were significantly improved after the addition of zno zeolite in the cellulose acetate solution in ascending order the concentration of zeolite zno enhances the hydrophilicity of the membranes the membrane showed 98 rejection of benzophenone 3 in neutral ph however rejection and permeate flux increases with the concentration of zeolite zno the effect of applied pressure and feed concentration was studied and discussed with scientific reasons keywords nanotechnology benzophenone 3 cellulose acetate zeolites membrane and emerging contaminants 1 introduction in the fast growing population diminishing water resources and climate changes are extending the duration of droughts and floods by making drinking water a contentious resource in many parts of the world over the past decade the presence of pharmaceuticals personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs in water source are inevitably a growing global concern due to their noticeable effects on aquatic life notable skewing of sex ratios and their unknown effects on humans 1 these contaminants invade surface waters primarily via wastewater effluents and could also be the result of agricultural activities in this regard an exceptional and efficient water purification technology is considered as an urgent need to address the problems related to benzophenone 3 such as water shortages health energy and climate change benzophenone 3 bp 3 is well known sunscreen agent and its metabolite 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone have been detected in human urine it directly enters in to the gastrointestinal tract benzophenone 3 has complex receptor interactions in vitro and are estrogenic in fish hence removal of bp 3 is a major issue and it is very serious threat for aquatic ecosystem usually for removal of ec s photocatalytic degradation is feasible process but bp 3 lacks functional groups that difficult to degrade in the environmental water there are very well known treatments for benzophenone 3removal i e biological treatment systems activated sludge and biological trickling filter 2 physicochemical treatment like coagulation flocculation and lime softening 3 membrane processes like microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nano filtration nf and reverse osmosis ro are considered as promising alternatives in removing the huge amounts of organic micro pollutants 4 nf and ro are proven to be very effective filtration technologies in withdrawing micro pollutants 5 6 the preparation of a soft membrane with an excellent selective properties and molecular sieving properties is very desirable from both practical and fundamental stand points one of the common methods is to combine a crystalline such as porous solid metal oxide with a flexible cheap and abundant organic matrix cellulose acetate there are several reports found on metal oxides induced membranes for water purification tio2 7 zno 8 al2o3 9 zeolite 10 graphene oxide 11 and carbon nano tubes 12 are showed impact in membrane separation among these metal oxides zeolite has unique property which is very obliging to the membrane separation zeolites are crystalline micro porous and tetrahedral units of aluminosilicates these are made up of silicon oxygen and aluminum oxygen bonded tetrahedron units which are negatively charged hydrophilic pillers overall around 46 natural and 150 synthetic zeolite minerals are known in the literature among all these zeolite x showed better properties for membrane separation because of its wide micro porous nature however zno is also one of the impressed metal oxides in membrane technology zno repress the formation of macro void on the membrane surface which increases mechanical strength and dense surface a porous zeolite and zno nanoparticles combined together provide a better characteristic for membrane application the incorporation of these combined nanoparticles in cellulose acetate membrane matrix deserves significant attention for many potential applications they have excellent molecular sieving function large surface areas and controlled host sorbet interactions especially at low vapor pressure the current study reports on the structural and physiochemical features of inorganic polymer hybrid nanocomposite membranes the membranes prepared by infusing the synthesized zeolite supported zno nano particles into the cellulose acetate polymer matrix membrane to our knowledge limited studies were reported on mixed matrix membrane for bp 3 edc removal the present work was focused on removal of bp 3 using ca zno zeolite mixed matrix membrane the synthesized zeolite supported zno nanoparticle was characterized by atr ir spectroscopy to prove the influence of zno zeolite with variation in the ways of incorporation on the shifting of bonds and molecular level interactions occurring within the nanocomposite membrane changes in the surface morphologies of the skin layer of mixed matrix membranes were investigated via scanning electron microscopy sem quantitative surface roughness analysis is analyzed by using atomic force microscopy afm to probe the role of nanomaterials in influencing membrane topographies dead end filtration technique was employed to understand the performance of the

stirred for 40 min at ambient condition after the evaporation of solvent in a hot air oven at 90 c for two hours after complete evaporation of the solvent the dried solid powder was crushed by grinding in mortar and pestle for the formation of homogeneous solid state mixture the powdered mixture was then calcinted at 300 c for 5 h to get the zeolite supported zno catalyst 14 the zeolite

membranes table 1 displays the concentration of nanoparticles and cellulose acetate in the membranes 10 zno zeolite supported nanoparticle was initially sonicated for 1 h in dmf and acetone mixture 25 ml and 60 ml respectively followed by 4 h stirring to avoid agglomeration of nps cellulose acetate was added further into the casting solution and stirred for 24 h to get viscous casting solution finally solution was sonicated for 30 min and was left to stand for 10 min prior to casting to remove air bubbles then the solution was poured on 6 mm thick glass plate and casted using the smooth glass rod casted membrane was exposed in fume hood for 20 s to remove volatiles and to form dense layer on the membrane surface subsequently the glass plate was immersed in coagulation bath containing the cold water for 40 50 min membrane sheet precipitates out in the coagulation bath finally the membrane was thoroughly washed with distilled water several times and stored in distilled water at ambient temperature for 24 h to improve the membrane mechanical strength the composite membrane with different concentration of zeolite supported zno nanoparticle was labeled as cam caze 1 caze 2 and caze 3 2 4 characterization the crystal structure of the synthesized zno zeolite supported zno nanoparticles and zeolite powder was characterized by philips x pert pro x ray diffractometer xrd shimadzu xd d1 with graphite monochromatized cu k alpha 15418 å radiation source with a scanning speed of 20 min scanning electron microscopy sem micrographs were studied using carl zeiss field

then used for membrane shimadzu make uv 1800 uv vis spectrophotometer with uv probe software was used to measure the absorption spectrum of the sample 2 5 water uptake study hydrophilicity of the membrane was determined by water uptake capacity this study includes immersion of membrane samples in deionized water at room temperature for 24 h followed by blotting the wet membranes to remove surface adhering water droplets which are then quickly weighed finally these membranes were dried in and weighed again the water uptake of the membranes can be calculated by gravimetric analysis by comparing the weight gain of the wet membrane with reference to the dry membrane and reported as weight percent water absorption the water uptake can be calculated as follows 1 water uptake w w w d w d 100 where ww is the weight of wet membrane and wd is the weight of dry membrane 16 2 5 1 performance study of the membrane to evaluate the permeation and rejection properties of the membranes self constructed dead end filtration unit was used in the ambient temperature during the entire experiment 17 a circular membrane with 60 mm diameter was placed in the test cell with the active surface facing towards the incoming feed and membrane effective area is about 5 mm in order to minimize experimental errors the average of three reported values was taken 2 5 1 1 pure water flux water flux was measured by direct permeation measurement of distilled water and reported in liter per meter square per hour l m2h at different pressure from 200 to 1000 kpa 2 5 1 2 rejection study in order to determine the rejection properties of the prepared membranes the rejection of bp 3 experiment was carried in the same filtration unit the feed sample bp 3 solution of different concentrations 1 3 and 6 ppm was prepared and the rejection studies were conducted under different pressures from 200 kpa to 1000 kpa at the difference pressure interval of 200 kpa the concentration of bp 3 in feed and permeate was measured by uv spectrophotometer by photometric method at a wavelength of 298 nm the spectrum of feed and permeate was also recorded to evaluate the bp 3 peak absorbance in the feed and permeate the percent rejection was calculated using the following equation 18 2 rejection 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the concentrations of permeate and feed respectively experiments were conducted in triplicate and the average results were reported 3 results and discussions zeolites are porous alumino silicates with uniform pore sizes between 0 3 and 1 nm 19 and pore volumes from about 0 10 0 35 cm3 g the pore size distribution is very uniform and sharp due to the fact that the pores form the part of the crystal structure itself unlike clay which tends to swell during operation zeolites offer preferential flow paths for water molecules while maintaining the rigidity of its framework another special aspect of this structure is that the pore and channel sizes are nearly uniform allowing the crystal to act as a molecular sieve at the angstrom scale the porous zeolites act as a host to water and other small molecules allowing only appropriate molecular size to pass through its pores imparting the molecular sieving property 20 adsorption property of zeolites is closely related to the location of non framework cations and to their accessibility to adsorbed molecules in the studies we have used zeolite x faujasite it is known to be a very stable zeolite and hydration has very little impact on its overall structure unlike some other open framework solids clinoptilolite aluminophosphates 21 22 molecular simulations were performed in the classical limit no bond breaking take place for instance this justified by the fact that no hydrolysis is observed upon water adsorption 23 due to the weak bonding of water with the faujasite framework additionally the ion exchange capacity is inversely proportional to the si al ratio based on the previous studies the specific ion exchange capacity depends on the structure of the zeolite the si al ratio and the ions to be exchanged 24 however implementation of zno in zeolite matrix increases the hydrophilicity as well as charge to the metal oxide composites 3 1 x ray diffraction analysis the xrd studies of zno nanoparticle and zeolite supported 10 zno nanoparticles and zeolite powders were conducted xrd pattern of the same are shown in fig 1 xrd pattern of zno nanoparticles exhibited the peaks at 2θ equal to 31 67 34 31 36 14 47 40 56 52 62 73 66 28 67 91 and 69 03 which corresponded to a typical diffraction of zincite with hexagonal symmetry these peaks perfectly matched with the reference to jcpds card no 36 1451 and the lattice parameters are a 3 24982 å c 5 20661 å 25 synthesized zno nanoparticles are pure as no impurity peaks were detected crystalline size of zno was found to be 33 nm and it was determined using scherer s formula 26 from the xrd analysis of zeolite peaks are found at 12 16 19 20 24 27 31 and 32 are equal to 2θ and those are characteristic peaks of zeolite x type 27 xrd intensity of characteristic peaks of zeolite material indicates the crystallinity extent and the concentration of the crystalline content of zeolite 28 from the xrd pattern of zeolite supported 10 zno it is found that there is alittle increase in the intensity of peaks at 2θ equal to 12 16 19 20 24 27 31 67 34 31 36 14 47 40 56 52 62 73 66 28 67 91 and 69 03 confirms the impregnation of zno on the zeolite powder 10 zno zeolite powder low concentration of zno metal ion is used in this study and further crystalline phases of metal ions were not detected in any pattern still that metal ions are dispersed at the cation phases of zeolites rendering them undetectable by xrd the observed peaks in the range of 30 to 50 could be indexed as the wurtzite structure of zno which is well matched with standard diffraction data jcpds 36 145 3 2 scanning electron microscopic sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx analysis fig 2 presents the sem micrographs of zno zeolite and zeolite supported 10 znosamples sem analysis examines the distribution of zno species over the zeolite it is seen that the clean surface of zeolite crystals is covered by the zno particles and there is no noticeable change in the typical morphology of the support after the loading of zno as can be seen from the sem images zno nanoparticles are like clusters attaching to the zeolite surface the edx spectra of zno fig 2 nanoparticles confirm the presence of pure oxygen and zinc without impurities it is evidenced from the edx spectra and elemental compositions in table 2 the presence of si and al constituent of zeolite and also the presence of zn conforms the impregnation of zno on zeolite composite powder the molar si al ratio for used zeolite x is about 1 1 34 3 3 icp studies of zeolite supported zno nanoparticles inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes elemental analysis of zeolite supported zno powder was carried out after sample digestion in order to determine the concentration of aluminum silica and zinc it is found that the silica and aluminum content in zeolite powder is 25 28 and 18 6 respectively and the zinc content was found to be 10 3 w v basis this summarizes the zno loading by solid state dispersion technique based on the icp studies it is possible to calculate si al ratio of the zeolite the si al proportion is 1 1 34 and as per the literature in zeolite x si al ratio expected value ranges from 1 to 1 5 29 3 4 morphology studies of ca and ca zno zeolite composite membrane the surface morphology of the membrane as illustrated in fig 3 a c the cross section images are depicted in fig 3 d f clearly it is noted

14394,the demand for manufacturing and application of dyes and pigments in textile industries is increasing almost a quarter of the dyes used are discharged as wastewater and some of them are difficult to treat due to their complex structures herein the adsorption of congo red dye from aqueous solutions was conducted using natural low cost easy available and environmentally friendly materials such as stems from chromolaena odorata c odorata or co an alien invasive plant species in southern africa the adsorption of congo red dye was investigated in a series of batch experiments to study the effect of contact time initial concentration and initial ph on adsorption efficiency pes co adsorbent based membranes were fabricated using the phase inversion method fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir confirmed that pes co membranes had hydrophilic functional groups addition of c odorata in pes significantly decreased the surface charge of the prepared membranes by 93 dye adsorption percentages of 92 27 and 84 were recorded for the c odorata particles pes membranes and hybrid pes co membranes at ph 6 respectively the langmuir frendlich isotherms revealed that the adsorption of congo red occurred on the heterogeneous surface through formation of a multilayer the adsorption kinetics model suggested that diffusion was a rate determining step in the adsorption process keywords adsorptive membranes c odorata congo red phase inversion polyethersulfone 1 introduction the pollution of water sources by dyes produced from textile and other related industries remains a problem for water governing bodies and relevant authorities worldwide the use of dyes has increased in the industries that include textile cosmetics pulp and paper paint pharmaceutical food cart and printing 1 2 besides colouring wastewaters dyes and their metabolic products are toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic to life forms and they can cause allergies and skin diseases 3 4 the stability of the dyes makes them non biodegradable and thus persistent in water 5 7 amongst the convectional techniques employed in wastewater treatment adsorption has been considered as the cost effective method for removing dyes especially when natural low cost and easily available materials such plant materials agricultural waste and clays are employed 8 9 adsorption using plant materials or agricultural waste materials has received considerable attention from researchers around the globe because they are easily available environmentally friendly and they are efficient in the treatment of ionic derived effluents 10 11 some authors investigated the feasibility of the sisal fiber as a precursor for the production of carbon in the adsorption of different dyes from aqueous solution 12 the study revealed that sisal fibers were found to be an enormously viable adsorbent in removing dyes from aqueous solutions because the fibers were successfully converted to carbon at a lower ph the carbon acquires net positive charges on its surface and that attract the negatively charged functional groups located on the reactive dyes bousher and co workers 1997 who concluded that these materials contain high concentrations of cellulose examined the adsorption capacity of organic materials hence adsorb basic dyes irreversibly through the coulombic attraction and ion exchange processes while acidic dyes are adsorbed in a reversible process involving physical adsorption 13 furthermore bulgariu 2016 revealed that chitosan a hydrophilic natural polymer that is characterised by high nitrogen content present as amino groups is capable of adsorbing metal ions 14 yuh shan 2005 also confirmed that trunks of tree ferns can be used in the removal of lead from wastewaters 15 this is because these materials are rich in lignin and cellulose chemical adsorption occurred through the polar functional groups of lignin that includes alcohols aldehydes ketones acids phenols and hydroxides as chemical bonding agents c odorata is one of the alien plants that are widely known for destroying the natural vegetation and general ecosystems that may mainly comprise of indigenous plant species it easily grows in any vegetation type and may grow up to 2 4 m in height ftir analysis of the plant revealed that c odorata stems are very rich in hydroxyl oh and carboxylic cooh functional groups which make them hydrophilic while the particles of c odorata activated with carbon were also used for the removal of tartrazine molecules from aqueous solution 16 dlamini and co workers 2012 demonstrated the potential use of lantana camara alien plant similar to c odorata as an adsorbent for removing organic matter in wastewater the high polarity of l camara composites were recognized for their enhancement of water permeation furthermore these plants are capable of removing phenolic compounds in wastewaters 17 adsorption of pollutants using nanoparticles has gained interest from researchers due to their high active adsorption surface areas and treatment performance however separating nanoparticles from the final product is problematic thus researchers have explored alternative solutions it is for that reason that the powder of c odorata is dispersed in the polymer to form pes co based membranes as was done in this work pes co adsorptive based membranes have an advantage over other c odorata adsorbents due to ease of separation after the process and after the filtration process no requirement of treatment to the best of our knowledge there are no reports on the application of c odorata for the removal of pollutants from water therefore the current study aims to bridge that gap through fabrication of pes co hybrid adsorptive membrane for the removal of congo red dye from water the mechanism of the adsorption was also explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals and solvents that were used for the synthesis of pes co were purchased from sigma aldrich south africa these chemicals include pes white powder and its chemical structure fig 1 n methylpyrrolidone nmp with 99 purity and congo red dye 35 purity fig 1 stems of c odorata were sourced from swaziland in manzini region 2 2 preparation of c odorata powder the stems of c odorata were separated from the leaves and flowers and washed with tap water to remove soil debris and dust particles they were then dried in full sunlight for 1 week thereafter the dry stems were chopped into smaller pieces and were further crushed into a very fine powder using a sample mill the powder was then sieved using a 48 μm sized sieve the powder was then stored in a tight clean container ready for use no chemicals were added to c odorata powder and no purification was done in order to evaluate its feasibility as a raw material 2 3 preparation of pes co adsorbents pes co adsorbent based membranes were prepared using the phase inversion method via the immersion precipitation technique reported by mulder 1996 with few modifications 18 different amounts of c odorata particles 0 1 3 10 20 and 33 wt were dispersed in nmp solvent and ultra sonicated for 30 min to reduce the agglomeration of the particles the percentage weights of c odorata were calculated based on the final product of the pes co membrane pes powder was then added to the mixture of c odorata and nmp to form a polymer solution the weight percentage of nmp was kept at 85 for all the membranes in the polymer solution the polymer solution was stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 12 h at room temperature the homogenous polymer solution was allowed to settle for another 12 h to remove air bubbles pes was selected as a base material due to its interesting properties such as their ability to form a film as well as for their stability towards acidic and alkaline conditions 19 thereafter the polymer solution was casted on a cylindrical glass dish using a method reported by 20 after a few min the glass dish was immersed in de ionized water as a non solvent the solvent and water exchange in the water bath led to formation of white membrane sheets that separated from the glass dish the synthesized pes co membranes were then washed with deionized water to remove any remaining solvent dried in an oven for 12 h at temperature of 40 c the membranes were moulded into rectangular sheets with dimensions of 10 10 mm3 using a pair of scissors the fabrication of the pes co membranes is illustrated in fig 2 starting from stems of c odorata to the final product which is pes co membrane 2 4 adsorption tests a stock solution of the adsorbate was prepared by dissolving 1 g of congo red powder in a 1 l volumetric flask of deionized water to make a concentration of 1000 mg l ppm different concentrations were made by serial dilution from the stock solution batch adsorption studies were conducted to study the effects of the amount of adsorbent type of absorbent initial concentration contact time and initial ph of the solution each batch adsorption experiment was done in triplicate in order to record the average and minimize experimental errors to study the effects of initial ph of the solution during the adsorption processes the ph of the solution of congo red was adjusted using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide solutions the contact time was varied from 15 to 330 min the initial concentration was studied from a concentration of 10 100 mg l the range of masses used to study effect of adsorbent ranged from 0 05 to 0 20 g the adsorption experiments were conducted in 50 ml centrifuge tubes which were agitated in a thermostatic shaker model psi 320 at 150 rpm the volume was kept at 20 ml for all the samples all samples were shaken for 12 h with an exception of those whose contact time was studied after adsorption samples were withdrawn from a shaker and centrifuged or filtered through a 90 mm filter paper the solutions were then analysed using uv vs spectrometer perkin elmer lambda 650 s at 497 nm to determine the concentration of congo red after the adsorption together with initial concentration the amount of congo red absorbed which is the adsorption capacity qt mg g was calculated using eq 1 5 1 q t c 0 c f v m the percentage adsorption of congo red in aqueous solution was calculated using eq 2 2 a d s o r p t i o n c o c f c o 100 where co is the initial concentration of congo red mg l cf is the final concentration v is the volume of congo red solution l and m is the weight of the adsorbent g kinetic studies were performed to understand the mechanistic steps of the adsorption process and the rate at which congo red is adsorbed the swelling measurements of the membranes was determined by measuring and calculating the equilibrium water content percent ewc ewc of the prepared membranes was determined by obtaining the mass loss of wet membrane after drying the membrane sheet was immersed in water for 12 h to ensure maximum swelling the sheet was then removed from the water and remaining water on the surface of the membrane was wiped with a soft paper the weight of the membrane was recorded in wet state and it was then dried completely for 12 h at 25 c the weight of the membrane was also recorded in dry state calculations were then performed using eq 3 to get the value of ewc ewc is directly proportional to the porosity of the membranes 21 it also gives an indication of the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the membranes therefore it was crucial to calculate ewc in order to also study the porosity of pes co membranes 3 e w c w w w d w w 10 where ww is the weight of membrane in wet condition and wd is the weight of membrane in dry state 2 5 adsorbent characterization surface morphology of the prepared membranes was characterised using a jeol jsm it 300 scanning electron microscopy equipped with oxford instruments eds system before analysis the membranes were first dried in desiccators for at least 24 h and carbon coated at a current of 25 μa for 50 s using an scd 005 cool sputter coater bal tec germany coating improves the membrane conductivity for the electrons fourier transform infrared spectroscopy perkin elmer ft ir 100 perkin elmer inc usa was employed to record infrared ir spectra of the membranes and c odorata particles at 25 c in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 in order to evaluate their different functional groups and to verify the presence of the c odorata on the modified membranes surface a surpass electro kinetic analyzer was used to determine the zeta potential of the prepared membranes with 0 001 mol kcl aqueous solution at 25 c from ph 2 to ph 10 zeta potential measurements assists in the analysis of the surface charge in order to improve surface properties and to develop new specialized materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pes co membranes 3 1 1 ftir analysis the ftir spectra of c odorata particles pure pes and pes 20 co are shown in fig 3 in the spectra of c odorata particles a broad band at 3500 3000 cm 1 is observed and is attributed to oh stretching a small peak at 1750 cm 1 represents the ch2 and cooh stretching which might be caused by the presence of pectins another sharp distinctive peak at 1150 cm 1 indicate the presence of cooh in c odorata particles that are associated with ketones aldehydes esters amides and carboxylic acids the presence of hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups are reported as hydrophilic groups in literature hence c odorata is hydrophilic 15 22 these groups have the ability to bind aquatic pollutants through different mechanism thus they are useful in water treatment industries spectrum of pure pes shows stretching peaks between 500 and 1500 cm 1 indicating the presence of so2 and ch2 groups the spectra of modified pes membranes were found to be same due to similar compositions therefore only the spectrum of pes 20 co is shown in fig 3 the ir band at 3400 cm 1 which is not present in the spectrum of pure pes is due to the free hydroxyl groups from the particles of c odorata suggesting that the particles were successfully incorporated in pes membranes 3 1 2 sem and eds analysis of the membranes fig 4 shows the sem images of the prepared membranes the membrane samples are distinguished by the different amounts of c odorata dispersed in pes solution in fig 4 a there are no c odorata particles the amount of c odorata is increased from fig 4 b d by 10 20 and 33 respectively from the images it can be concluded that addition of c odorata changed the morphology of the membranes by increasing the sizes of the pores the particles were well dispersed in the polymer for the membrane with 20 loading of c odorata higher loadings of c odorata particles in pes membranes lead to particle aggregation as shown in fig 4 d eds analysis of the pes membrane revealed the presence of carbon sulphur and oxygen as shown in fig 5 the addition of c odorata in pes membranes reduced the percentage of sulphur elements from 57 7 to 35 5 and it increased the oxygen content from 42 2 to 63 5 the percentage of carbon was high in all the samples but slightly less in pure pes this is due to the presence of carbonyl and methyl functional groups as it was revealed from the ftir analysis 3 1 3 zeta potential analysis zeta potential measurements were done to evaluate the surface charge properties of the membranes fig 6 shows the zeta potential of c odorata pure pes and pes 20 co against ph the measurement of each sample showed a significant difference in the zeta potential over the ph range for example the zeta potential for pure pes was 25 mv at ph 3 and was 23 7 mv at ph 10 this difference was caused by the presence of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the membranes 23 24 at a lower ph this functional groups are protonated while at high ph values they are deprotonated addition of c odorata in pes decreased the surface charge of the resultant membranes 3 2 adsorption data 3 2 1 variation of the percentage mass of c odorata in the polymer matrix the results for the removal of congo red using different pes co membranes are summarized in fig 7 adsorption studies were conducted to assess the effect of different amount of c odorata particles in the polymer matrix and were also evaluated in terms of adsorption and ewc the adsorption of congo red by pes co membranes increases as the amount of c odorata in the membrane was also increased but after 20 the adsorption started decreasing pure pes adsorbed 27 pes 20 co adsorbed 85 of congo red and pes 33 co adsorbed 83 of congo red the increase in adsorption was caused by the addition of c odorata this trend is relatively comparable to results presented by zhang et al in 2013 where pes graphene oxide membranes were investigated for wastewater treatment 25 at higher concentrations of c odorata 33 the adsorption reduced probably due to agglomeration and overlapping between the c odorata particles furthermore increasing the percentage weight of c odorata in the polymer matrix also increased ewc fig 7 pure pes membrane revealed ewc of 5 pes 1 3 co was 62 pes 10 co was 70 pes 20 co was 73 and pes 33 co was 75 the sudden increase in ewc was largely contributed by the c odorata particles the increasing trend suggested that there was also an increase in porosity in the prepared membrane suggesting that the pores on the surface and within the membrane increased the adsorption sites of congo red thus increasing the percentage adsorption this trend is similar to the results reported by dlamini et al 2012 where l camara was blended with ethylene vinyl acetate for the removal of pollutants in water 17 3 2 2 effect of initial ph solution the ph is a master variable in adsorption processes h is attracted to negatively charged molecules 26 it is for that reason that the adsorption of congo red molecules was studied in the range ph 2 10 fig 8 shows that the optimum adsorption site for congo red by co particles pure pes and pes 20 co membranes was at ph 2 where 98 4 79 4 and 99 5 adsorption percentages were observed respectively congo red is one type of acid dyes and it is a heterocyclic aromatic chemical compound with molecular formula c33h22n6na2o6s2 27 at low ph the concentration of h ions is high thus the oh groups on the surface of the adsorbent get neutralized by protonation at a lower ph the presence of h ions increases the number of positively charged adsorbent sites hence it favors the adsorption of negatively charged congo red dye molecules 28 since there is an electrostatic attraction increase with decreasing ph this resulted in an increase in dye adsorption under basic conditions the concentration of the oh ions dye solution is high thus the negative charge density is located more on the surface of dye molecules and this account for the lower dye uptake on increasing negatively charged surface sites because electrostatic repulsion increases with increasing ph a similar trend was also observed by nemasivayam and kavita 2002 for removal of congo red using activated carbon prepared from coir pith and agricultural waste and attalah et al 2013 in the treatment of industrial wastewater containing congo red using metal hydroxides sludge 2 11 3 2 3 effect of the dosage adsorption studies were also conducted to study the effect of adsorbent dosage using pure pes pes 20 co membranes and c odorata particles the dosage mass varied from 0 005 g to 0 2 g and it was observed that adsorption percentage increased with dosage increment fig 9 this suggests that with increasing adsorbent dosage more surface area is available for adsorption due to increase in active sites on the adsorbent dawood and sen 2012 observed similar behavior where the adsorption was increased from 13 5 to 19 0 after increasing the dosage from 0 01 g to 0 03 g of pine cone adsorbents 29 kumar et al 2010 also observed the same trend in the adsorption of congo red using cashew nut shells adsorption was increased from 56 3 to 99 3 after increasing the dosage from 5 to 30 mg l 30 3 2 4 effect of contact time pure pes pes 20 co membranes and c odorata particles were used to study the effect of contact time using an initial concentration of 30 ppm a volume of 10 ml and at a dosage of 0 1 g it was observed that dye adsorption increases with contact time until equilibrium is reached fig 10 the adsorption of congo red by pes 20 co membranes took 270 min to reach equilibrium as compared to c odorata particles equilibrium was reached within 45 min the rapid uptake of congo red by c odorata particles suggest that a large number of sites were available for adsorption and adsorption takes place at the external surface of the adsorbent 31 in the solid membranes the adsorption sites were less exposed as compared to c odorata particles thus it took long to reach equilibrium these findings are relatively similar to results presented by cheng et al 2013 where the adsorption processes reached equilibrium after about 70 h using graphene oxide biopolymer gels the long equilibrium time was attributed by the multilevel porous structure of the biopolymer gels because there are abundant interior micropores in the gels for which the diffusion of the adsorbates would take a long time 32 3 2 5 effect of the initial concentration the effect of initial concentration on the adsorption of congo red was studied using pure pes pes 20 co membranes and c odorata particles fig 11 the concentration was varied from 10 to 100 ppm using a volume of 10 ml of congo red solution the adsorption trend for both membranes was similar since the adsorption percentage decreased with the increase in initial concentration the adsorption trend for the c odorata particles increased with the increase in initial concentration the lower uptake at higher concentration resulted from an increased ratio of initial adsorption number of moles of the dye to the available surface area 33 the initial dye concentration provides an important driving force to overcome the mass transfer resistance of the dye between the aqueous and solid phases therefore at higher initial dye concentration the number of ions compete for the available sites on the surface of the membranes a similar trend was observed by mezennes et al 2013 34 3 3 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms studies were carried out using the two commonly known isotherm models the langmuir and freundlich models the langmuir isotherm describes quantitatively the formation of a monolayer of the adsorbate on the outer surface of the adsorbent and thereafter no further adsorption takes place 35 the langmuir isotherm is presented in eq 4 4 c e q e c e q m 1 q m b l where qm and bl are langmuir constants and they are directly proportional to the adsorption capacity and energy of adsorption ce is the equilibrium concentration of congo red and qe is the amount absorbed at equilibrium if the data fits a langmuir isotherm a plot of ce qe vs ce should give a linear plot the constants were calculated from the slope of the linear plot between ce qe against ce fig 12 the intercepts are reported in table 1 since the data does not fit well the langmuir isotherm because the correction coefficient is closer to zero then the adsorption of congo red does not follow the langmuir isotherm the adsorption of congo red by pes co membranes were further analysed using the freundlich adsorption isotherm the freundlich isotherm assumes that the absorbent has a heterogeneous surface with adsorption sites that have different energies of adsorption 8 the logarithmic freundlich isotherm is expressed in eq 5 as follows 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where kf is the freundlich constant that signifies the quantity of congo red adsorbed on to the pes co membranes for a unit equilibrium concentration 36 reported that 1 n is the heterogeneity factor and it gives an idea of how much favorable the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is the freundlich constants 1 n and kf have been determined from the slope and intercept of the plot between log qe against log ce respectively and they are reported in table 1 the value of 1 n ranged between 0 and 1 therefore the adsorption of congo red is heterogeneous based on the results from the two models and correlation coefficient it can be concluded that the adsorption of congo red follows the freundlich isotherm fig 12 the applicability of freundlich was judged by higher value of the correlation coefficient 0 96 as compared to the langmuir correlation coefficient 0 14 3 4 adsorption kinetics analysis of the kinetics study of adsorption processes is important as it allows one to investigate the possible mechanism and interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate as such numerous experiments were conducted at different time intervals starting from 15 to 330 min ho mckay 2000 presented the pseudo second order eq 6 37 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e where k2 is the rate constant and can be determined from by plotting t qt against time the plot of t qt against t gives 1 qe as the slope and 1 k2qe 2 as the intercept k2 is then calculated from the intercept the experimental data were fitted in a pseudo first order and pseudo second order the results were well fitted in pseudo second order model and showed a linear relationship between t qt and t with a coefficient of correlation of 0 9957 fig 13 the rate constant for the pseudo second order kinetic was calculated from the intercept of the graph and was found to be 0 03591 ml min the linear relationship indicated that the pseudo second model can be used to describe the adsorption of congo red molecules in aqueous solutions this suggest that the overall rate of the adsorption process occurred under physical processes pointing to the adsorption processes involving van der waals interactions between the surface of the membranes and the congo red 4 conclusion a viable method for treating wastewater using low cost environmentally friendly and easily available materials such as c odorata has been presented c odorata was successfully incorporated in pes polymer in the fabrication of pes co membranes for the adsorption of congo red in water pes co adsorptive membranes have an advantage over c odorata particles in practical applications in wastewater because they can be easily separated from the final product unlike nano micro particles that require ultrahigh centrifugation after the adsorption process due to their high water dispersibility pes co adsorptive membranes have been found to be effective adsorbents for the removal of congo red 84 2 compared to pure pes 27 4 at ph of 6 the highest adsorption 99 9 was observed for pes 20 co at ph 2 while pure pes at ph 6 showed the lowest adsorption 27 4 the equilibrium time for adsorption on c odorata particles was 45 min while that for pes 20 co was longer 270 min the langmuir freundlich isotherms revealed that the adsorption of congo red occurred on the heterogeneous surface and formed a multilayer the adsorption kinetics model suggested that diffusion was the rate determining step in the adsorption process acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the university of south africa nanotechnology and water sustainability research unit nanows

14394,the demand for manufacturing and application of dyes and pigments in textile industries is increasing almost a quarter of the dyes used are discharged as wastewater and some of them are difficult to treat due to their complex structures herein the adsorption of congo red dye from aqueous solutions was conducted using natural low cost easy available and environmentally friendly materials such as stems from chromolaena odorata c odorata or co an alien invasive plant species in southern africa the adsorption of congo red dye was investigated in a series of batch experiments to study the effect of contact time initial concentration and initial ph on adsorption efficiency pes co adsorbent based membranes were fabricated using the phase inversion method fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir confirmed that pes co membranes had hydrophilic functional groups addition of c odorata in pes significantly decreased the surface charge of the prepared membranes by 93 dye adsorption percentages of 92 27 and 84 were recorded for the c odorata particles pes membranes and hybrid pes co membranes at ph 6 respectively the langmuir frendlich isotherms revealed that the adsorption of congo red occurred on the heterogeneous surface through formation of a multilayer the adsorption kinetics model suggested that diffusion was a rate determining step in the adsorption process keywords adsorptive membranes c odorata congo red phase inversion polyethersulfone 1 introduction the pollution of water sources by dyes produced from textile and other related industries remains a problem for water governing bodies and relevant authorities worldwide the use of dyes has increased in the industries that include textile cosmetics pulp and paper paint pharmaceutical food cart and printing 1 2 besides colouring wastewaters dyes and their metabolic products are toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic to life forms and they can cause allergies and skin diseases 3 4 the stability of the dyes makes them non biodegradable and thus persistent in water 5 7 amongst the convectional techniques employed in wastewater treatment adsorption has been considered as the cost effective method for removing dyes especially when natural low cost and easily available materials such plant materials agricultural waste and clays are employed 8 9 adsorption using plant materials or agricultural waste materials has received considerable attention from researchers around the globe because they are easily available environmentally friendly and they are efficient in the treatment of ionic derived effluents 10 11 some authors investigated the feasibility of the sisal fiber as a precursor for the production of carbon in the adsorption of different dyes from aqueous solution 12 the study revealed that sisal fibers were found to be an enormously viable adsorbent in removing dyes from aqueous solutions because the fibers were successfully converted to carbon at a lower ph the carbon acquires net positive charges on its surface and that attract the negatively charged functional groups located on the reactive dyes bousher and co workers 1997 who concluded that these materials contain high concentrations of cellulose examined the adsorption capacity of organic materials hence adsorb basic dyes irreversibly through the coulombic attraction and ion exchange

present in the spectrum of pure pes is due to the free hydroxyl groups from the particles of c odorata suggesting that the particles were successfully incorporated in pes membranes 3 1 2 sem and eds analysis of the membranes fig 4 shows the sem images of the prepared membranes the membrane samples are distinguished by the different amounts of c odorata dispersed in pes solution in fig 4 a there are no c odorata particles the amount of c odorata is increased from fig 4 b d by 10 20 and 33 respectively from the images it can be concluded that addition of c odorata changed the morphology of the membranes by increasing the sizes of the pores the particles were well dispersed in the polymer for the membrane with 20 loading of c odorata higher loadings of c odorata particles in pes membranes lead to particle aggregation as shown in fig 4 d eds analysis of the pes membrane revealed the presence of carbon sulphur and oxygen as shown in fig 5 the addition of c odorata in pes membranes reduced the percentage of sulphur elements from 57 7 to 35 5 and it increased the oxygen content from 42 2 to 63 5 the percentage of carbon was high in all the samples but slightly less in pure pes this is due to the presence of carbonyl and methyl functional groups as it was revealed from the ftir analysis 3 1 3 zeta potential analysis zeta potential measurements were done to evaluate the surface charge properties of the membranes fig 6 shows the zeta potential of c odorata pure pes and pes 20 co against ph the measurement of each sample showed a significant difference in the zeta potential over the ph range for example the zeta potential for pure pes was 25 mv at ph 3 and was 23 7 mv at ph 10 this difference was caused by the presence of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the membranes 23 24 at a lower ph this functional groups are protonated while at high ph values they are deprotonated addition of c odorata in pes decreased the surface charge of the resultant membranes 3 2 adsorption data 3 2 1 variation of the percentage mass of c odorata in the polymer matrix the results for the removal of congo red using different pes co membranes are summarized in fig 7 adsorption studies were conducted to assess the effect of different amount of c odorata particles in the polymer matrix and were also evaluated in terms of adsorption and ewc the adsorption of congo red by pes co membranes increases as the amount of c odorata in the membrane was also increased but after 20 the adsorption started decreasing pure pes adsorbed 27 pes 20 co adsorbed 85 of congo red and pes 33 co adsorbed 83 of congo red the increase in adsorption was caused by the addition of c odorata this trend is relatively comparable to results presented by zhang et al in 2013 where pes graphene oxide membranes were investigated for wastewater treatment 25 at higher concentrations of c odorata 33 the adsorption reduced probably due to agglomeration and overlapping between the c odorata particles furthermore increasing the percentage weight of c odorata in the polymer matrix also increased ewc fig 7 pure pes membrane revealed ewc of 5 pes 1 3 co was 62 pes 10 co was 70 pes 20 co was 73 and pes 33 co was 75 the sudden increase in ewc was largely contributed by the c odorata particles the increasing trend suggested that there was also an increase in porosity in the prepared membrane suggesting that the pores on the surface and within the membrane increased the adsorption sites of congo red thus increasing the percentage adsorption this trend is similar to the results reported by dlamini et al 2012 where l camara was blended with ethylene vinyl acetate for the removal of pollutants in water 17 3 2 2 effect of initial ph solution the ph is a master variable in adsorption processes h is attracted to negatively charged molecules 26 it is for that reason that the adsorption of congo red molecules was studied in the range ph 2 10 fig 8 shows that the optimum adsorption site for congo red by co particles pure pes and pes 20 co membranes was at ph 2 where 98 4 79 4 and 99 5 adsorption percentages were observed respectively congo red is one type of acid dyes and it is a heterocyclic aromatic chemical compound with molecular formula c33h22n6na2o6s2 27 at low ph the concentration of h ions is high thus the oh groups on the surface of the adsorbent get neutralized by protonation at a lower ph the presence of h ions increases the number of positively charged adsorbent sites hence it favors the adsorption of negatively charged congo red dye molecules 28 since there is an electrostatic attraction increase with decreasing ph this resulted in an increase in dye adsorption under basic conditions the concentration of the oh ions dye solution is high thus the negative charge density is located more on the surface of dye molecules and this account for the lower dye uptake on increasing negatively charged surface sites because electrostatic repulsion increases with increasing ph a similar trend was also observed by nemasivayam and kavita 2002 for removal of congo red using activated carbon prepared from coir pith and agricultural waste and attalah et al 2013 in the treatment of industrial wastewater containing congo red using metal hydroxides sludge 2 11 3 2 3 effect of the dosage adsorption studies were also conducted to study the effect of adsorbent dosage using pure pes pes 20 co membranes and c odorata particles the dosage mass varied from 0 005 g to 0 2 g and it was observed that adsorption percentage increased with dosage increment fig 9 this suggests that with increasing adsorbent dosage more surface area is available for adsorption due to increase in active sites on the adsorbent dawood and sen 2012 observed similar behavior where the adsorption was increased from 13 5 to 19 0 after increasing the dosage from 0 01 g to 0 03 g of pine cone adsorbents 29 kumar et al 2010 also observed the same trend in the adsorption of congo red using cashew nut shells adsorption was increased from 56 3 to 99 3 after increasing the dosage from 5 to 30 mg l 30 3 2 4 effect of contact time pure pes pes 20 co membranes and c odorata particles were used to study the effect of contact time using an initial concentration of 30 ppm a volume of 10 ml and at a dosage of 0 1 g it was observed that dye adsorption increases with contact time until equilibrium is reached fig 10 the adsorption of congo red by pes 20 co membranes took 270 min to reach equilibrium as compared to c odorata particles equilibrium was reached within 45 min the rapid uptake of congo red by c odorata particles suggest that a large number of sites were available for adsorption and adsorption takes place at the external surface of the adsorbent 31 in the solid membranes the adsorption sites were less exposed as compared to c odorata particles thus it took long to reach equilibrium these findings are relatively similar to results presented by cheng et al 2013 where the adsorption processes reached equilibrium after about 70 h using graphene oxide biopolymer gels the long equilibrium time was attributed by the multilevel porous structure of the biopolymer gels because there are abundant interior micropores in the gels for which the diffusion of the adsorbates would take a long time 32 3 2 5 effect of the initial concentration the effect of initial concentration on the adsorption of congo red was studied using pure pes pes 20 co membranes and c odorata particles fig 11 the concentration was varied from 10 to 100 ppm using a volume of 10 ml of congo red solution the adsorption trend for both membranes was similar since the adsorption percentage decreased with the increase in initial concentration the adsorption trend for the c odorata particles increased with the increase in initial concentration the lower uptake at higher concentration resulted from an increased ratio of initial adsorption number of moles of the dye to the available surface area 33 the initial dye concentration provides an important driving force to overcome the mass transfer resistance of the dye between the aqueous and solid phases therefore at higher initial dye concentration the number of ions compete for the available sites on the surface of the membranes a similar trend was observed by mezennes et al 2013 34 3 3 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms studies were carried out using the two commonly known isotherm models the langmuir and freundlich models the langmuir isotherm describes quantitatively the formation of a monolayer of the adsorbate on the outer surface of the adsorbent and thereafter no further adsorption takes place 35 the langmuir isotherm is presented in eq 4 4 c e q e c e q m 1 q m b l where qm and bl are langmuir constants and they are directly proportional to the adsorption capacity and energy of adsorption ce is the equilibrium concentration of congo red and qe is the amount absorbed at equilibrium if the data fits a langmuir isotherm a plot of ce qe vs ce should give a linear plot the constants were calculated from the slope of the linear plot between ce qe against ce fig 12 the intercepts are reported in table 1 since the data does not fit well the langmuir isotherm because the correction coefficient is closer to zero then the adsorption of congo red does not follow the langmuir isotherm the adsorption of congo red by pes co membranes were further analysed using the freundlich adsorption isotherm the freundlich isotherm assumes that the absorbent has a heterogeneous surface with adsorption sites that have different energies of adsorption 8 the logarithmic freundlich isotherm is expressed in eq 5 as follows 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where kf is the freundlich constant that signifies the quantity of congo red adsorbed on to the pes co membranes for a unit equilibrium concentration 36 reported that 1 n is the heterogeneity factor and it gives an idea of how much favorable the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is the freundlich constants 1 n and kf have been determined from the slope and intercept of the plot between log qe against log ce respectively and they are reported in table 1 the value of 1 n ranged between 0 and 1 therefore the adsorption of congo red is heterogeneous based on the results from the two models and correlation coefficient it can be concluded that the adsorption of congo red follows the freundlich isotherm fig 12 the applicability of freundlich was judged by higher value of the correlation coefficient 0 96 as compared to the langmuir correlation coefficient 0 14 3 4 adsorption kinetics analysis of the kinetics study of adsorption processes is important as it allows one to investigate the possible mechanism and interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate as such numerous experiments were conducted at different time intervals starting from 15 to 330 min ho mckay 2000 presented the pseudo second order eq 6 37 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e where k2 is the rate constant and can be determined from by plotting t qt against time the plot of t qt against t gives 1 qe as the slope and 1 k2qe 2 as the intercept k2 is then calculated from the intercept the experimental data were fitted in a pseudo first order and pseudo second order the results were well fitted in pseudo second order model and showed a linear relationship between t qt and t with a coefficient of correlation of 0 9957 fig 13 the rate constant for the pseudo second order kinetic was calculated from the intercept of the graph and was found to be 0 03591 ml min the linear relationship indicated that the pseudo second model can be used to describe the adsorption of congo red molecules in aqueous solutions this suggest that the overall rate of the adsorption process occurred under physical processes pointing to the adsorption processes involving van der waals interactions between the surface of the membranes and the congo red 4 conclusion a viable method for treating wastewater using low cost environmentally friendly and easily available materials such as c odorata has been presented c odorata was successfully incorporated in pes polymer in the fabrication of pes co membranes for the adsorption of congo red in water pes co adsorptive membranes have an advantage over c odorata particles in practical applications in wastewater because they can be easily separated from the final product unlike nano micro particles that require ultrahigh centrifugation after the adsorption process due to their high water dispersibility pes co adsorptive membranes have been found to be effective adsorbents for the removal of congo red 84 2 compared to pure pes 27 4 at ph of 6 the highest adsorption 99 9 was observed for pes 20 co at ph 2 while pure pes at ph 6 showed the lowest adsorption 27 4 the equilibrium time for adsorption on c odorata particles was 45 min while that for pes 20 co was longer 270 min the langmuir freundlich isotherms revealed that the adsorption of congo red occurred on the heterogeneous surface and formed a multilayer the adsorption kinetics model suggested that diffusion was
