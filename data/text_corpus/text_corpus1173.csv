5865,post seismic microbial changes in aquifer systems have rarely been documented and the processes to explain these changes have yet to be explicated microbial communities within groundwater in the kumamoto area japan were characterized in 2013 and 2014 prior to the occurrence of a large earthquake 7 0 richter scale in 2016 which provided a rare opportunity to compare samples obtained following the seismic activity with information from the previous and subsequent years 2017 and 2018 microbial changes were monitored for 4 representative wells in a regional groundwater flow system utilizing a previously proposed post seismic hydrogeological change model site specific microbial communities changed and became homogeneous for all of the wells after the earthquake the original microorganisms such as methylotrophs had decreased however exogenous microorganisms such as propionibacterium acnes increased at all sites in the 2 3 months following the earthquake these changes were consistent with the coseismic surface water drawdown model however the prevalence of p acnes clones decreased in the 2 3 years following the earthquake notably none of the microbial communities recovered to their original condition prior to the earthquake this suggested that a new water supply from mountain aquifers could have caused these second stage post seismic microbial changes our study demonstrated that large crustal earthquakes could dramatically alter microbial communities within aquifer systems caused by post seismic hydrogeological changes however future monitoring is required

unknown as these investigations are usually hindered by limited available data to compare information between before and after earthquakes some reports have discussed the changes in bacterial communities within municipal waters after major earthquakes wells et al 2013 uperty et al 2017 furthermore an italian study found significant changes in the subterranean fauna communities inhabiting groundwater fed springs following a large earthquake in italy galassi et al 2014 fattorini et al 2018 however microbiological changes are not well documented for the regional groundwater flow systems in response to large crustal earthquakes moreover no reports have investigated the recovery process of microbial communities following earthquakes kumamoto city lies in the center of the kyushu island

et al 2013 2014 chemical and isotopic signatures are supported by subsequent microbiological characterizations zeng et al 2016 to avoid potential environmental problems gurdak and qi 2012 in the kumamoto area there are primarily two significant groundwater flow systems a line and b line fig 1 thus far it has been reported that heterotrophic denitrification occurs via carbon and sulfur cycling in the b line while such activity is not prominent in the a line hosono et al 2013 2014 an investigation by zeng et al 2016 found denitrification hotspots in the b line fig 1 within the microbial communities prior to the earthquake the occurrence of denitrification hotspots in the b line is important for removal of nitrate from the kumamoto groundwater hosono et al 2013 in 2013 and 2014 the microbial community included denitrifying bacteria prior to the earthquake which was site specific and stable at each sampling site for both the a and b lines zeng et al 2016 moreover other research studied nitrate contamination including denitrification processes physicochemical parameters and the microbial communities in an effort to understand groundwater quality changes smith et al 2012 hug et al 2015 anantharaman et al 2016 since microbial diversity is an indicator of chemical characteristics within groundwater flynn et al 2013 maamar et al 2015 the microbial dna sequence data could be utilized as a biosensor for the identification of chemical contamination in groundwater smith et al 2015 interaction between surface water and groundwater could also be identified by using microbial community data as tracers assche et al 2018 van driezuma et al 2018 thus hydrogeological and hydrochemical changes induced by earthquakes could cause changes in the microbial community which are reflected in the microbial dna sequence data on april 16 2016 a very large mw 7 0 inland crustal earthquake hit the kumamoto area fig 1 the area hardest hit by this quake was referred to as the suizenji fault zone which was a new post seismic fault system see fig 1 coseismic groundwater drawdown into the deep crust occurred within 35 min following the main shock hosono et al 2019 shallow aquifer waters and surface waters were transported into deep aquifers and induced dramatic water level drops and the mixing of different waters over the fault areas furthermore following this initial water drop the water levels in the regional groundwater flow systems recovered and rose to a level higher than the original level due to the addition of new water released from the surrounding mountain aquifers at higher elevations triggered by coseismic permeability enhancement hosono et al 2019 this abnormal water level rise started at 1 2 weeks and has continued 3 5 years after the main shock in this study microbial communities inside and outside of the denitrification hotspot fig 1 were analyzed following the kumamoto earthquake and compared with the microbial communities that had existed before the earthquake 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling one and three groundwater samples along the a and b lines respectively were collected from the kumamoto groundwater area fig 1 table 1 between 2013 and 2018 on oct 22 2013 and jun 16 17 2014 before the earthquake following the earthquake samples were collected from the same sites on jun 16 17 2016 and jul 10 2016 jul 10 11 2017 and may 14 15 2018 these sampling sites were selected as representative wells located in the a and b lines of the regional groundwater flow systems in kumamoto to characterize the microbial features within the well waters zeng et al 2016 from the active groundwater flow a line where anaerobic biogeochemical reactions were not detected and from the b line where active anaerobic reactions were occurring including denitrification hosono et al 2013 2014 we collected samples from the same wells utilized for previous research thus recorded data on the microbial communities within the wells was available which was used to assess post seismic microbial changes the wells in flow line b were located in or close to the suizenji fault zone fig 1 all sites were located near the main shock epicenter and had structural deformations samples b id and b s were obtained from the b line where the denitrification hotspot hosono et al 2013 was detected before the earthquake confined b id and unconfined b is groundwater were sampled from site b i sample a w was obtained from a line denitrifying bacteria were not detected in a w before the earthquake zeng et al 2016 2 2 measurement of physicochemical parameters during sample collection physicochemical parameters such as temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were directly measured in the field using handheld meters however do and orp were not measured in 2014 and 2018 no3 was measured by ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm switzerland using standard solutions this technique had a detection limit below 0 05 mg l 1 in order to assess major hydrochemical changes in the long term we collected significant ion alkalinity cl so4 2 no3 na k ca2 and mg2 concentration data from the same wells during 2007 2018 which was determined by the kumamoto city government data source http www city kumamoto jp using ion chromatography and by titration methods for the determination of alkalinity 2 3 dna extraction and cloning library analysis groundwater samples were pumped up and stored in a 20 l polyethylene plastic tank by using an internal pump settled at the bottom of the sampling well and brought back to the laboratory approximately 10 l of each water sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm sterivex sterile filter unit millipore billerica ma usa to obtain microorganisms for dna extraction using a clean bench the total dna from each filtered sample was extracted using the powerwater sterivextm dna isolation kit mo bio carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions subsequently pcr amplification was performed the primer sets for pcr are shown in table 2 bacterial 16s rrna gene was targeted for the clone library analysis the functional genes mcra amoa and nirs from anaerobic methane produce archaea aerobic ammonia oxidizing archaea and facultatively anaerobic denitrifying bacteria respectively clone library was used to target nirs during the analysis of denitrifying bacteria since nirk was not amplified by pcr in all of the samples before and after the earthquake the amplified products were purified using the ultraclean pcr clean up kit mo bio inserted into the pmd20 t vector takara bio inc kusatsu japan and finally transferred into competent cells of escherichia coli dh5α according to the manufacturer s protocols after transformation and liquid culture plasmid extraction was subsequently performed using the wizard sv minipreps dna purification system promega madison wi usa both ecori and psti restriction enzymes were used to identify the positive clones as specified by the manufacturer the selected positive clones were sent to takara bio inc for sequencing after chimera checking of obtained sequences by uchime edgar et al 2011 similar strains of the representative clones were searched utilizing the ncbi database finally the phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbor joining method using mega 7 0 tamura et al 2011 3 results 3 1 characteristics of groundwater samples the physicochemical parameters of the water samples from the four wells during 2013 and 2017 are summarized in table 1 in 2013 prior to the earthquake b line samples were growing under anaerobic conditions while a line samples were aerobic based on do and orp however b line samples were slightly changed to aerobic after the earthquake in 2016 nitrate concentration was under the detection limit for the b line in 2013 which suggested that denitrification occurred in the b line in 2013 under anaerobic conditions nitrate increased in 2016 in b s and b is sites as it changed into an aerobic atmosphere suggesting that these changes reflected aquifer environmental changes caused by the earthquake in contrast for a w samples in the a line nitrate concentrations were relatively high and denitrification was not occurring before or after the earthquake under aerobic conditions ph was not constant and fluctuated in all of the samples in 2016 and 2017 temperature changes occurred in 2016 however in 2017 the temperatures returned to almost the same values as in 2013 however these changes were within the range of annual seasonal variations these physiological parameters were not measured during the 2018 sampling campaign 3 2 microbial communities before 2013 and 2014 and after the earthquake 2016 since the microbial communities obtained in 2013 and 2014 were almost the same all clones were used for the construction of a single phylogenetic tree prior to the earthquake in 2013 and 2014 a total of 103 clones including 20 18 30 and 35 clones obtained from samples a w b id b is and b s respectively were subjected to sequence analysis after chimera checking zeng et al 2016 microbial communities within each sample showed site specific clone groups as depicted in fig 2 the most numerous bacteria belonged to the phylum proteobacteria including α proteobacteria β proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria this finding was consistent with previous studies characterizing microbial communities within deep bedrock larentis et al 2015 and in confined and unconfined aquifer ecosystems located in a dairy farming region smith et al 2012 in the class α proteobacteria clones showed 99 identity to methylobacterium mesophilicum this organism is a type ii methylotrophic bacterium that can utilize methanol formate and other c1 sources via the serine synthesis pathway graham et al 1993 in the γ proteobacteria cluster both methylomonas and methylobacter are type i methylotrophic bacteria that can utilize c1 compounds via the ribulose monophosphate pathway graham et al 1993 grosskopf et al 1998 the growth of type ii methylotrophs is favored under low oxygen high methane conditions and type i methylotrophs outcompete type ii methylotrophs at low methane concentrations graham et al 1993 in the class of β proteobacteria a w clones showed 99 identity with sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans sk43h this strain was isolated from a freshwater lake sediment in japan kojima and fukui 2011 and this organism was originally characterized as a facultative anaerobe the clones were found in sample a w which displayed a do concentration of 8 08 mg l 1 table 1 s hydrogenivorans sk43h could oxidize thiosulfate elemental sulfur or hydrogen as a sole energy source for autotrophic growth alternatively this bacterium could oxidize acetate benzoate pyruvate or succinate for heterotrophic growth employing nitrate as an electron acceptor furthermore mapping to the β proteobacteria curvibacter was the second major group found in a w which was heterotrophic and aerobic or microaerobic bacteria ding and yokota 2010 mcra and nirs were amplified by pcr while amoa could not be amplified in the b line interestingly however only amoa was amplified in the a line obligate anaerobic bacteria and archaea were active in the b line and aerobic bacteria and archaea were active in the a line before the earthquake in 2016 the microbial community was drastically changed within 2 3 months after the kumamoto earthquake fig 3 compared with the microbial community in 2013 and 2014 the main cluster of methylotrophs such as methylobacterium methylobacter and methylomonas decreased in the samples of b s b id and b is the characteristic genus of curvibacter and sulfuritalea were not detected in a w meanwhile new clones close to propionibacterium acnes were detected in all samples of b s b id b is and a w p acnes is a well known bacterial skin commensal of humans scharschmidt and fischbach 2013 hsu et al 2016 in 2013 and 2014 before the earthquake 5 11 and 4 genera were detected in b s b id b is and a w respectively in 2016 following the earthquake the number of the observed genera was increased in all of the samples to 11 16 and 13 genera for b s b id b is and a w respectively 3 3 microbial communities following the earthquake in 2017 and 2018 the number of clones close to p acnes was drastically decreased compared to the community in 2016 as shown in fig 4 one of the methylotrophs methylomonas was recovered from b is and sulfuritalea was detected in a w although the number of clones was still low compared to those found in 2013 and 2014 before the earthquake therefore it seems that the microbial community in all of the samples might have recovered partially to that of the levels prior to the earthquake however the principal group of methylobacterium in b s which was found before the earthquake were not detected and the pattern of branching in the phylogenetic tree for each groundwater sample was not found to be site specific fig 2 in either 2013 or 2014 the total number of observed genera in 2017 was slightly decreased to 10 10 and 6 in b s b id b is and a w respectively compared to those in 2016 however their numbers were still high compared with those in 2013 and 2014 in 2018 methylomonas which is classified as γ proteobacteria and sulfuricurvum which was facultative anaerobic sulfur oxidizing bacteria and classified as ε proteobacteria were detected and considered the dominant clones in b is conversely the number of clones in the parcubacteria group was increased in b id and a w as shown in fig 5 notably the detected genera in the phylogenetic tree for each groundwater sample were not site specific in 2018 3 4 detection of denitrifying bacteria in 2018 changes in nitrate concentration during 2007 and 2018 at each sampling site are depicted in fig 6 the nitrate concentration was changed by the earthquake in b s which corresponded to our sampling results table 1 however the concentrations varied before and after the earthquake in b is and a w in b id the nitrate concentration steadily increased from 2007 to 2018 independently from the earthquake thus it is assumed that the systems controlling nitrate contamination and microbiologically mediated nitrogen cycles within aquifers were site specific and these features did not change quickly unless aquifer structures or the source of water and materials suddenly changed interestingly all of the other polyatomic ions in the water did not change before or after the earthquake in all sampling sites supplementary fig 1 denitrifying bacteria were detected in the b line but not in a line before the earthquake and nirs could not be amplified by pcr in all of the samples in 2016 and 2017 following the earthquake however nirs was amplified in all of the samples in a line as well as b line in 2018 sequences of the obtained nirs clones in 2018 after the earthquake were comparable with those in 2014 before the earthquake in 2018 the nirs clones constructed a different branch of the phylogenic tree from the clones found in 2014 as depicted in fig 7 detection of denitrifying bacteria after the earthquake showed a synchronous pattern in all the samples which was not entirely related to the changes in nitrate concentration 4 discussion observed changes in the microbial communities were used to discuss the potential causes of microbiological changes within aquifer systems in response to a large crustal earthquake and the effects of coseismic hydrological alterations were evaluated furthermore the recovery process of the microbial communities which included denitrifying bacteria in 2017 and 2018 was considered 4 1 changes of microbial communities by the earthquake in 2016 the microbial community before the earthquake indicated that heterotrophic denitrification with methane oxidation was the primary metabolism used under anaerobic conditions in the b line and organic compounds were utilized by curvibacter and sulfuritalea under aerobic conditions in the a line following the earthquake in 2016 the microbial communities were drastically changed in all sampling sites one of the most prevalent microbiological changes was the appearance of p acnes detected in all sampling sites within 2 3 months after the main shock this bacteria was not found before the earthquake and this is an unusual finding as p acnes is generally found on human skin and in homes not aquifers in contrast methylotrophs such as methylomonas methylobacter and methylobacterium which were the dominant group prior to the earthquake in the b line decreased drastically after the earthquake facultative anaerobic denitrifiers such as sulfuricella denitrificans and sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans were detected in the b line before the earthquake however they could not be detected in 2016 denitrifying bacteria and methane producing archaea could not be detected by pcr after the earthquake in the b line similar disappearances of the typical endogenous microorganisms that were replaced by exogenous ones were also observed in the a line groundwater hosono et al 2019 have recently reported the occurrence of coseismic shallow water drawdown along deep ruptures to explain water level drops observed immediately after the earthquake they suggested all surface waters river and surface springs shallow pore waters and groundwaters were co seismically transferred into the deep aquifers all studied wells were located in areas where such hydrological alteration was confirmed this water drawdown was most prominently observed in and around the suizenji fault zone but was also recorded in the eastern flow areas including the site where a w was located the appearance of increased numbers of p acnes in confined groundwaters was evidence of surface water intrusion into the deep aquifers since this bacteria is normally found on and around humans at the surface not underground material transport from the surface lands was also suggested by the elevated concentrations of the chlorofluorocarbons found in the deep groundwaters that were originally found in surface residential areas the disappearance of the original anaerobic microbial features in the b line partly corresponded with changes in the physicochemical parameters table 1 however this did not mean that all of the bacteria and archaea were transported into the deep crust since the majority of deep groundwater remained confined within aquifers therefore this was likely due to aquifer environmental changes our results implied that the microbiological ecosystems within aquifers were quite sensitive to groundwater environmental changes such as the mixing of different waters with different chemical compositions and redox condition changes thus large earthquakes can drastically alter their living potentialities and dominant distributions even in a deep confined aquifer system in summary coseismic surface water drawdown induced transportation of exogenous microorganisms such as p acnes into deep aquifers which caused a significant alteration within the microbial communities from site specific groups to overall homogeneous features that were largely influenced by the mixing of surface waters from human living areas such as rivers surface infiltrations or leakage of sewage pipes we assumed this change occurred at the time of water drawdown and was sustained for at least 2 3 months following the earthquake 4 2 recoveries of the microbial community after the earthquake in 2017 and 2018 changes in the microbial community from 2013 to 2018 at the phylum and class level are summarized in the bar graphs fig 8 as depicted in fig 8a β proteobacteria including curvibacter and sulfuritalea were predominant in 2013 and 2014 while actinobacteria including propionibacterium increased in 2016 and then decreased in 2017 and 2018 in a w in the b line samples fig 8b the phylum proteobacteria were predominant in 2013 and 2014 but were replaced by actinobacteria which increased in 2016 and then decreased in 2017 and 2018 in a w the microbial community time series indicates that the most significant coseismic changes were undertaken in 2016 and tended to recover their original features following the annual hydrological cycle however some unique microorganisms that were not found in past sampling campaigns were found more than one year after the earthquake most significantly in 2018 fig 8 for instance parcubacteria were increased in both the a and b lines in 2018 the parcubacteria were originally identified by phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna genes and amplified from a variety of environmental samples harris et al 2004 they were obligate anaerobes detected in contaminated aquifer water nelson and stegen 2015 hosono et al 2019 reported that after the initial groundwater level drop the water level recovered to several meters higher than the original levels due to coseismic mountain aquifer water release and this abnormal water level rise continued at least 3 5 years after the earthquake changes in stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of the water molecule discussed in a separate paper and the diluted ion concentrations kawagoshi et al 2018 suggest mixing of released mountain aquifer water into downslope aquifer systems in addition coseismic soil pore spaces releasing water from the unsaturated zone is suggested to explain elevated no3 in the regional groundwater recharge areas kawagoshi et al 2018 although the contribution of these waters were volumetrically less significant compared to the released mountain waters ion concentration changes other than nitrate were not found before or after the earthquake fig s1 these results might have been influenced by sampling at an interval of 6 months the above mentioned new water supply and hydrochemical changes are the probable cause of another phase of microbial community changes such as the amplification of nirs by pcr and the increase of clones from the parcubacteria group that appeared a few years after the earthquake although nirs was amplified in 2018 in all samples the detected denitrifiers were different from those in 2014 before the earthquake this implied that the denitrifiers detected in 2018 might be derived from other sources rather than the simple recovery of the original microbes continuous monitoring of the microbial communities will be required to evaluate the overall microbiological recovery process over time in the kumamoto groundwater flow systems the recovery process for denitrifying bacteria should also be studied continuously since denitrification is the key process for the removal of nitrates from groundwater 5 conclusion microbial communities showed site specific groups for each groundwater sample before the earthquake in 2013 and 2014 the site specific community has been maintained in accordance with physicochemical conditions at each site however following the earthquake in 2016 the community was significantly changed and did not show distinct site specific groups exogenous bacteria such as p acnes found in human living areas were detected in all of the sites after the earthquake detection of exogenous bacteria could be caused by coseismic surface water drawdown which occurred immediately after the main shock microbial communities in 2017 and 2018 showed partial recovery of the site specific community group however the microbial communities were different from that shown in 2013 and 2014 both in the phylogenetic tree and phylum and class level diversity we assumed it could be regarded as secondary post seismic microbial changes that were induced by mixing new water which was released from the mountain aquifers and the unsaturated zone this study provided the first detailed view of how microbial communities had changed within aquifer systems in response to a large crustal earthquake providing a new understanding of the coseismic structural hydrogeological and hydrochemical changes found further analysis of this microbial community in the future is required for understanding the comprehensive recovery process of the microbial communities and for further evaluation of the microbial nitrate removal system within the groundwater declaration of competing interest the authors

analysis of denitrifying bacteria since nirk was not amplified by pcr in all of the samples before and after the earthquake the amplified products were purified using the ultraclean pcr clean up kit mo bio inserted into the pmd20 t vector takara bio inc kusatsu japan and finally transferred into competent cells of escherichia coli dh5α according to the manufacturer s protocols after transformation and liquid culture plasmid extraction was subsequently performed using the wizard sv minipreps dna purification system promega madison wi usa both ecori and psti restriction enzymes were used to identify the positive clones as specified by the manufacturer the selected positive clones were sent to takara bio inc for sequencing after chimera checking of obtained sequences by uchime edgar et al 2011 similar strains of the representative clones were searched utilizing the ncbi database finally the phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbor joining method using mega 7 0 tamura et al 2011 3 results 3 1 characteristics of groundwater samples the physicochemical parameters of the water samples from the four wells during 2013 and 2017 are summarized in table 1 in 2013 prior to the earthquake b line samples were growing under anaerobic conditions while a line samples were aerobic based on do and orp however b line samples were slightly changed to aerobic after the earthquake in 2016 nitrate concentration was under the detection limit for the b line in 2013 which suggested that denitrification occurred in the b line in 2013 under anaerobic conditions nitrate increased in 2016 in b s and b is sites as it changed into an aerobic atmosphere suggesting that these changes reflected aquifer environmental changes caused by the earthquake in contrast for a w samples in the a line nitrate concentrations were relatively high and denitrification was not occurring before or after the earthquake under aerobic conditions ph was not constant and fluctuated in all of the samples in 2016 and 2017 temperature changes occurred in 2016 however in 2017 the temperatures returned to almost the same values as in 2013 however these changes were within the range of annual seasonal variations these physiological parameters were not measured during the 2018 sampling campaign 3 2 microbial communities before 2013 and 2014 and after the earthquake 2016 since the microbial communities obtained in 2013 and 2014 were almost the same all clones were used for the construction of a single phylogenetic tree prior to the earthquake in 2013 and 2014 a total of 103 clones including 20 18 30 and 35 clones obtained from samples a w b id b is and b s respectively were subjected to sequence analysis after chimera checking zeng et al 2016 microbial communities within each sample showed site specific clone groups as depicted in fig 2 the most numerous bacteria belonged to the phylum proteobacteria including α proteobacteria β proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria this finding was consistent with previous studies characterizing microbial communities within deep bedrock larentis et al 2015 and in confined and unconfined aquifer ecosystems located in a dairy farming region smith et al 2012 in the class α proteobacteria clones showed 99 identity to methylobacterium mesophilicum this organism is a type ii methylotrophic bacterium that can utilize methanol formate and other c1 sources via the serine synthesis pathway graham et al 1993 in the γ proteobacteria cluster both methylomonas and methylobacter are type i methylotrophic bacteria that can utilize c1 compounds via the ribulose monophosphate pathway graham et al 1993 grosskopf et al 1998 the growth of type ii methylotrophs is favored under low oxygen high methane conditions and type i methylotrophs outcompete type ii methylotrophs at low methane concentrations graham et al 1993 in the class of β proteobacteria a w clones showed 99 identity with sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans sk43h this strain was isolated from a freshwater lake sediment in japan kojima and fukui 2011 and this organism was originally characterized as a facultative anaerobe the clones were found in sample a w which displayed a do concentration of 8 08 mg l 1 table 1 s hydrogenivorans sk43h could oxidize thiosulfate elemental sulfur or hydrogen as a sole energy source for autotrophic growth alternatively this bacterium could oxidize acetate benzoate pyruvate or succinate for heterotrophic growth employing nitrate as an electron acceptor furthermore mapping to the β proteobacteria curvibacter was the second major group found in a w which was heterotrophic and aerobic or microaerobic bacteria ding and yokota 2010 mcra and nirs were amplified by pcr while amoa could not be amplified in the b line interestingly however only amoa was amplified in the a line obligate anaerobic bacteria and archaea were active in the b line and aerobic bacteria and archaea were active in the a line before the earthquake in 2016 the microbial community was drastically changed within 2 3 months after the kumamoto earthquake fig 3 compared with the microbial community in 2013 and 2014 the main cluster of methylotrophs such as methylobacterium methylobacter and methylomonas decreased in the samples of b s b id and b is the characteristic genus of curvibacter and sulfuritalea were not detected in a w meanwhile new clones close to propionibacterium acnes were detected in all samples of b s b id b is and a w p acnes is a well known bacterial skin commensal of humans scharschmidt and fischbach 2013 hsu et al 2016 in 2013 and 2014 before the earthquake 5 11 and 4 genera were detected in b s b id b is and a w respectively in 2016 following the earthquake the number of the observed genera was increased in all of the samples to 11 16 and 13 genera for b s b id b is and a w respectively 3 3 microbial communities following the earthquake in 2017 and 2018 the number of clones close to p acnes was drastically decreased compared to the community in 2016 as shown in fig 4 one of the methylotrophs methylomonas was recovered from b is and sulfuritalea was detected in a w although the number of clones was still low compared to those found in 2013 and 2014 before the earthquake therefore it seems that the microbial community in all of the samples might have recovered partially to that of the levels prior to the earthquake however the principal group of methylobacterium in b s which was found before the earthquake were not detected and the pattern of branching in the phylogenetic tree for each groundwater sample was not found to be site specific fig 2 in either 2013 or 2014 the total number of observed genera in 2017 was slightly decreased to 10 10 and 6 in b s b id b is and a w respectively compared to those in 2016 however their numbers were still high compared with those in 2013 and 2014 in 2018 methylomonas which is classified as γ proteobacteria and sulfuricurvum which was facultative anaerobic sulfur oxidizing bacteria and classified as ε proteobacteria were detected and considered the dominant clones in b is conversely the number of clones in the parcubacteria group was increased in b id and a w as shown in fig 5 notably the detected genera in the phylogenetic tree for each groundwater sample were not site specific in 2018 3 4 detection of denitrifying bacteria in 2018 changes in nitrate concentration during 2007 and 2018 at each sampling site are depicted in fig 6 the nitrate concentration was changed by the earthquake in b s which corresponded to our sampling results table 1 however the concentrations varied before and after the earthquake in b is and a w in b id the nitrate concentration steadily increased from 2007 to 2018 independently from the earthquake thus it is assumed that the systems controlling nitrate contamination and microbiologically mediated nitrogen cycles within aquifers were site specific and these features did not change quickly unless aquifer structures or the source of water and materials suddenly changed interestingly all of the other polyatomic ions in the water did not change before or after the earthquake in all sampling sites supplementary fig 1 denitrifying bacteria were detected in the b line but not in a line before the earthquake and nirs could not be amplified by pcr in all of the samples in 2016 and 2017 following the earthquake however nirs was amplified in all of the samples in a line as well as b line in 2018 sequences of the obtained nirs clones in 2018 after the earthquake were comparable with those in 2014 before the earthquake in 2018 the nirs clones constructed a different branch of the phylogenic tree from the clones found in 2014 as depicted in fig 7 detection of denitrifying bacteria after the earthquake showed a synchronous pattern in all the samples which was not entirely related to the changes in nitrate concentration 4 discussion observed changes in the microbial communities were used to discuss the potential causes of microbiological changes within aquifer systems in response to a large crustal earthquake and the effects of coseismic hydrological alterations were evaluated furthermore the recovery process of the microbial communities which included denitrifying bacteria in 2017 and 2018 was considered 4 1 changes of microbial communities by the earthquake in 2016 the microbial community before the earthquake indicated that heterotrophic denitrification with methane oxidation was the primary metabolism used under anaerobic conditions in the b line and organic compounds were utilized by curvibacter and sulfuritalea under aerobic conditions in the a line following the earthquake in 2016 the microbial communities were drastically changed in all sampling sites one of the most prevalent microbiological changes was the appearance of p acnes detected in all sampling sites within 2 3 months after the main shock this bacteria was not found before the earthquake and this is an unusual finding as p acnes is generally found on human skin and in homes not aquifers in contrast methylotrophs such as methylomonas methylobacter and methylobacterium which were the dominant group prior to the earthquake in the b line decreased drastically after the earthquake facultative anaerobic denitrifiers such as sulfuricella denitrificans and sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans were detected in the b line before the earthquake however they could not be detected in 2016 denitrifying bacteria and methane producing archaea could not be detected by pcr after the earthquake in the b line similar disappearances of the typical endogenous microorganisms that were replaced by exogenous ones were also observed in the a line groundwater hosono et al 2019 have recently reported the occurrence of coseismic shallow water drawdown along deep ruptures to explain water level drops observed immediately after the earthquake they suggested all surface waters river and surface springs shallow pore waters and groundwaters were co seismically transferred into the deep aquifers all studied wells were located in areas where such hydrological alteration was confirmed this water drawdown was most prominently observed in and around the suizenji fault zone but was also recorded in the eastern flow areas including the site where a w was located the appearance of increased numbers of p acnes in confined groundwaters was evidence of surface water intrusion into the deep aquifers since this bacteria is normally found on and around humans at the surface not underground material transport from the surface lands was also suggested by the elevated concentrations of the chlorofluorocarbons found in the deep groundwaters that were originally found in surface residential areas the disappearance of the original anaerobic microbial features in the b line partly corresponded with changes in the physicochemical parameters table 1 however this did not mean that all of the bacteria and archaea were transported into the deep crust since the majority of deep groundwater remained confined within aquifers therefore this was likely due to aquifer environmental changes our results implied that the microbiological ecosystems within aquifers were quite sensitive to groundwater environmental changes such as the mixing of different waters with different chemical compositions and redox condition changes thus large earthquakes can drastically alter their living potentialities and dominant distributions even in a deep confined aquifer system in summary coseismic surface water drawdown induced transportation of exogenous microorganisms such as p acnes into deep aquifers which caused a significant alteration within the microbial communities from site specific groups to overall homogeneous features that were largely influenced by the mixing of surface waters from human living areas such as rivers surface infiltrations or leakage of sewage pipes we assumed this change occurred at the time of water drawdown and was sustained for at least 2 3 months following the earthquake 4 2 recoveries of the microbial community after the earthquake in 2017 and 2018 changes in the microbial community from 2013 to 2018 at the phylum and class level are summarized in the bar graphs fig 8 as depicted in fig 8a β proteobacteria including curvibacter and sulfuritalea were predominant in 2013 and 2014 while actinobacteria including propionibacterium increased in 2016 and then decreased in 2017 and 2018 in a w in the b line samples fig 8b the phylum proteobacteria were predominant in 2013 and 2014 but were replaced by actinobacteria which increased in 2016 and then decreased in 2017 and 2018 in a w the microbial community time series indicates that the most significant coseismic changes were undertaken in 2016 and tended to recover their original features following the annual hydrological cycle however some unique microorganisms that were not found in past sampling campaigns were found more than one year after the earthquake most significantly in 2018 fig 8 for instance parcubacteria were increased in both the a and b lines in 2018 the parcubacteria were originally identified by phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna genes and amplified from a variety of environmental samples harris et al 2004 they were obligate anaerobes detected in contaminated aquifer water nelson and stegen 2015 hosono et al 2019 reported that after the initial groundwater level drop the water level recovered to several meters higher than the original levels due to coseismic mountain aquifer water release and this abnormal water level rise continued at least 3 5 years after the earthquake changes in stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of the water molecule discussed in a separate paper and the diluted ion concentrations kawagoshi et al 2018 suggest mixing of released mountain aquifer water into downslope aquifer systems in addition coseismic soil pore spaces releasing water from the unsaturated zone is suggested to explain elevated no3 in the regional groundwater recharge areas kawagoshi et al 2018 although the contribution of these waters were volumetrically less significant compared to the released mountain waters ion concentration changes other than nitrate were not found before or after the earthquake fig s1 these results might have been influenced by sampling at an interval of 6 months the above mentioned new water supply and hydrochemical changes are the probable cause of another phase of microbial community changes such as the amplification of nirs by pcr and the increase of clones from the parcubacteria group that appeared a few years after the earthquake although nirs was amplified in 2018 in all samples the detected denitrifiers were different from those in 2014 before the earthquake this implied that the denitrifiers detected in 2018 might be derived from other sources rather than the simple recovery of the original microbes continuous monitoring of the microbial communities will be required to evaluate the overall microbiological recovery process over time in the kumamoto groundwater flow systems the recovery process for denitrifying bacteria should also be studied continuously since denitrification is the key process for the removal of nitrates from groundwater 5 conclusion microbial communities showed site specific groups for each groundwater sample before the earthquake in 2013 and 2014 the site specific community has been maintained in accordance with physicochemical conditions at each site however following the earthquake in 2016 the community was significantly changed and did not show distinct site specific groups exogenous bacteria such as p acnes found in human living areas were detected in all of the sites after the earthquake detection of exogenous bacteria could be caused by coseismic surface water drawdown which occurred immediately after the main shock microbial communities in 2017 and 2018 showed partial recovery of the site specific community group however the microbial communities were different from that shown in 2013 and 2014 both in the phylogenetic tree and phylum and class level diversity we assumed it could be regarded as secondary post seismic microbial changes that were induced by mixing new water which was released from the mountain aquifers and the unsaturated zone this study provided the first detailed view of how microbial communities had changed within aquifer systems in response to a large crustal earthquake providing a new understanding of the coseismic structural hydrogeological and hydrochemical changes found further analysis of this microbial community in the future is required for understanding the comprehensive recovery process of the microbial communities and for further evaluation of the microbial nitrate removal system within the groundwater declaration of competing interest the authors

5866,ocean continent interaction is an important component of the global climate systems and influences hydrological cycles at regional and local scales oceanic moisture om advection and terrestrial evapotranspiration et are two main sources of precipitation in eastern china the objectives of this study are to quantify the contribution of the om to precipitation and to better understanding the water cycle processes in the region summer months when the east asian monsoon is strongest are studied and a two component mixing model using 18o as a tracer is applied to apportion the spatiotemporal contributions of om the gaussian first order approximation is employed to assess the uncertainty of the estimates in the entire study area om predominates summer precipitation with et playing a supplemental role the contributions of om to precipitation decrease from june to august in central china and northern china for example in central china the proportional contributions of om are 94 in june 92 in july and 81 in august spatially the om contributions decrease along the transport route from south to northeast the 95 confidence intervals of the estimated contributions range from 0 07 to 0 38 with the standard errors between 0 03 and 0 17 for all months and sub regions the relative uncertainty contributions of each source to the total uncertainty follow the order of precipitating vapor advection et the large variances of δ18o in precipitable water vapor account for the most uncertainty of the proportional estimates keywords oceanic moisture east asian monsoon water cycle oxygen isotope uncertainty analysis 1 introduction ocean continent interaction as a significant part of climate teleconnection systems impacts global water cycles and regulates regional extreme hydrological events eastern china is a typical region where ocean land interaction controls summer precipitation wang and ho 2002 ding et al 2009 the oceanic moisture driven by asian summer monsoon always causes intensive precipitation and leads to serious floods in eastern china qian and lee 2000 day et al 2015 understanding the mechanism of ocean land interaction is necessary for predicting hydrologic variability and improve water resource management the interaction is complicated and contains large spatial and temporary variabilities moisture advection from ocean or regions nearby as well as evapotranspiration et from plants and soil water surfaces are two major sources of precipitation brubaker et al 1993 trenberth 1999 relative impacts of advection and et on precipitation depend on the characteristics of the land surfaces and climate circulation patterns in specific regions kong et al 2013 for example in seashore regions with minimal plant cover oceanic moisture om controls the regional precipitation as om moves inland the et contribution increases as expected quantifying the oceanic moisture contribution to continental precipitation helps to evaluate the significance of ocean land interaction brubaker et al 1993 three categories of methods are usually employed to quantify the contribution of the above sources of precipitation that is analytical models numerical water vapor tracers and physical water vapor tracers gimeno et al 2012 pathak et al 2017 analytical models calculate the moisture contribution by formulating water budget equation under specific assumptions burde and zangvil 2001 schaefli et al 2012 this method taken as a black box approach is relatively simple but provides rough calculations in contrast the numerical water vapor tracers provide detailed information it tags water by simulating relevant atmospheric processes including convection evaporation condensation pathak et al 2017 etc however the high computational cost as well as the uncertainty in physical parameterizations and process representation are two main concerns for practical application dominguez et al 2006 analytical models and numerical water vapor tracers have been conducted to investigate the contribution of om to precipitation in eastern china numaguti 1999 trenberth 1999 chen et al 2005 hua et al 2015 the physical tracers method has seldom been employed to systematically quantify the processes in the region analytical models and numerical water vapor tracers are able to describe the sources and sinks of atmospheric water vapor however they cannot be validated without physical water vapor tracers gimeno et al 2012 hu and dominguez 2015 the physical water vapor tracers partitions different sources of the precipitation fluxes with the isotopic composition in water vapors gimeno et al 2012 the method can be classified into three and two component mixing models according to the number of the precipitation sources wang et al 2016a to identify the contribution of precipitation from independent sources three component mixing model needs two isotopic tracers such as δ2h and δ18o peng et al 2011 while two component mixing model can be developed with only one isotopic tracer in theory the uncertainties of the proportional estimates using physical tracer methods increase with the number of tracers and precipitation sources zhang and liu 2016 comparing with the three component mixing model the two component method is relatively simpler with lesser uncertainties the traditional two component method assumes that precipitation originates from evaporation and advection clark and fritz 1997 van der ent et al 2010 genereux 1998 this method eliminates the effect of transpiration wang et al 2016b and was usually applied to regions where transpiration is trivial source to precipitation shabir dar and ghosh 2017 froehlich et al 2008 gat and kendall 1994 kong et al 2013 in eastern china where vegetation coverage is very high during summer months gao et al 2000 the impact of plant transpiration to precipitation is strong and cannot be neglected thus the traditional two component method is not applicable in this case isotopic deuterium excess hydrogen and oxygen are three main tracing properties used to tag precipitation sources deuterium excess calculated by subtracting hydrogen and oxygen isotopes is a popular fingerprinting property in arid regions for eliminating the sub cloud evaporation effect on recycling moisture froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 aemisegger et al 2014 cui and li 2015 in wet regions where the sub cloud effect is negligible oxygen is the best tracer which contains less measurement uncertainty than deuterium excess and hydrogen dansgaard 1964 liu et al 2008 considering the meteorological conditions and estimated uncertainty oxygen isotope is chosen as the sole tracer consequently the objectives of this work are 1 to extend a two component mixing model to simulate three precipitable vapor sources atmospheric advection soil water evaporation and plant transpiration 2 to quantify the oceanic contribution to precipitation with δ18o and 3 to evaluate the uncertainty of the estimated proportions of each precipitation source using the gaussian approximation approach 2 materials 2 1 study area topographically the boundary between the china s 2nd and 3rd terrain steps great khingan mountain taihang mountain wu mountain and xuefeng mountain divides eastern monsoon region into two parts the eastern part lying on the 3rd step is mainly composed of plains and is below 500 m the western part sitting on the 2nd step mostly consists of basins and is about 1000 2000 m to eliminate the effect of topography on moisture transport the eastern part of the monsoon region is selected and called eastern china for this study fig 1 eastern china lies in the southeastern of eurasia and borders on the west pacific ocean it has a total length of approximately 3 731 km from south to north and a land area of 260 000 km2 the islands at the south margin of south china sea are not included in the study area because of the lack of observed isotope data in those islands for oceanic moisture analysis in addition these islands are not geographically connected to the southern china and hydrometeorology issues in these islands are different from those in southern china besides the land cover is also a key factor that influences et another combined source of precipitation generally normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is employed to represent the vegetative land cover aburas et al 2015 hansen et al 2000 in summer the vegetation coverage is very high in southeastern china and decreases northward fig 2 the water vapor flux whose direction is controlled by pressure fields and wind direction is calculated by eq 1 qin et al 2005 as shown in fig 2 om almost marches north in summer in the selected study domain 1 q 1 g p 0 p u v q d p where q is the horizonal water flux g is the gravitational acceleration v is wind vector q is specific humidity p0 and pu are surface and upper pressure of the air column usually taken as 300 hpa respectively 2 2 data observed isotopic composition of precipitation are mainly from two databases one is the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip established by the international atomic energy agency iaea and the world meteorological organization wmo the gnip database houses global stable isotope including oxygen hydrogen and tritium of monthly composite rainfall samples from 1961 to 2017 the other is the chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip collected by chinese academy of sciences cas the chnip aims to extend systematic observation nationwide and collects monthly composite precipitation samples from 2005 to 2010 liu et al 2014 the long term precision of gnip measurement is about 0 1 for δ18o and chnip measurement is about 0 3 for δ18o liu et al 2008 there are about 17 gnip stations and 15 chinp stations in the study area and the locations of these stations are shown in fig 1 to eliminate deviation of the simple mean isotope value caused by precipitation amounts the precipitation weighted mean precipitation isotope values δ 18 o p for a particular calendar month are calculated as follows dansgaard 1964 salamalikis et al 2016 wang et al 2016b 2 δ 18 o p i 1 n p i δ 18 o i i 1 n p i where n is the number of all observed hydrological years p i is the precipitation amount of the specific month in a hydrological year δ 18 o i is the oxygen isotope concentration in precipitation in the corresponding month the long term mean weighted isotopic data are summarized in table 1 to characterize the ocean land interactions in eastern china the study region is divided into different sub regions precipitating moisture in each sub region except sc is composed of advection from its upwind sub region and local et precipitating moisture in sc represents the origin of oceanic moisture and marches as advection to its downwind sub region cc considering the vapor flux isotope distribution fig 3 and geophysical conditions section 2 1 the study region is divided into four sub regions that is southern china sc central china cc northern china nc and northeastern china nec as shown in fig 1 simulated isotopic composition of soil water and precipitation is calculated

meteorological information the missing values are supplemented by the corresponding data at the nearest meteorological stations from the china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn en all the long term mean meteorological data in eastern china are collected in table 1 3 methods 3 1 a modified two component mixing model to better distinguishing the relative contributions of atmospheric moisture fluxes in eastern china a modified two component mixing model is extended in this study the modified two component mixing model is based on three assumptions first the isotopic composition of precipitating vapor is a complete mixture of advection vapor and et vapor brubaker et al 1993 trenberth 1999 evaporation from soil and water surfaces as well as plant transpiration are aggregated into the et source second the isotopic composition of each vapor flux is unique or statistically different brubaker et al 1993 burde and zangvil 2001 third the ratio of transpiration to precipitation is constant in each sub region in summer zhang et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 according to the first assumption the water mass balance equation can be expressed as 3 q pv q et q adv where qpv qet and qadv are the moisture quantity of precipitating vapor et vapor and advection vapor respectively considering the second assumption the chemical conservation law in terms of δ18o can be expressed as 4 δ 18 o pv q pv δ 18 o et q et δ 18 o adv q adv where δ18opv δ18oet and δ18oadv are the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitating vapor et and advection respectively to get the proportional contributions of each moisture source to precipitation eqs 3 and 4 are divided by qpv yielding 5 1 f et f adv 6 δ 18 o pv f et δ 18 o et f adv δ 18 o adv where fet and fadv are the fractions of et moisture and advection moisture in precipitating vapor respectively combining eqs 5 and 6 the contribution of advection to precipitation is given by 7 f adv δ 18 o pv δ 18 o et δ 18 o adv δ 18 o et based on the third assumption the contribution of transpiration to precipitations can be estimated from the following equation 8 f tr f et r t where ftr is the fractional contribution of transpiration to precipitation and rt is the ratio of transpiration to et we collected the t et parameter transpiration divided by et from publications in the literature for each sub region see table 2 and took the average of all the collected t et in the same region as rt the rt in nc in table 2 neglects evaporation from the bohai sea the bohai sea is considered as local evaporation contribution to precipitation in the nc because moisture from nc transports through the bohai sea to nec the actual rt in nc is obtained by area weighting 9 r t r t s e a s t s e a r t l a n d s t l a n d s t s e a s t l a n d where s t s e a and s t l a n d are acreage of the bohai sea and of the land in nc respectively r t l a n d and r t s e a are rt of the land in nc and of the bohai sea respectively there is no transpiration in the bohai sea so r t s e a is assumed 0 the r t l a n d shown in table 2 is 0 64 the s t l a n d s t l a n d s t s e a are calculated as 0 75 based on eq 9 and the data mentioned above the actual rt in nc is set to 0 48 et is a mixture of evaporation and transpiration so the contribution of et to precipitation is made up of the contribution of evaporation and transpiration and can be expressed as 10 f et f ev f tr to get the contribution of evaporation to precipitation eq 10 is transformed to 11 f ev f et f tr there is not enough station along the seashore can be taken as the original boundary of the om so the precipitating moisture in sc is assumed as the original source of the pacific ocean in other words 100 oceanic contribution is assumed for the sc as the moisture transports northward from the pacific ocean to the nec the direct oceanic contribution to precipitation in each region is the product of all advection assuming 100 contribution from the ocean for the most upwind sub region sub region 1 and can be calculated by 12 f oc i 1 n f adv i i 1 n δ 18 o pv i δ 18 o et i δ 18 o adv i δ 18 o et i where n denotes the total number of upwind sub regions i denotes the number of the product sub region foc is the contribution of moisture sourced from the ocean to precipitation in a particular sub region of interest fadv is the advection fraction to precipitation in a sub region and f 1 adv is 100 3 2 isotopic compositions for moisture fluxes 3 2 1 isotopic compositions for precipitating vapor according to equations and isotopic composition of each moisture flux δ18opv δ18oet and δ18oadv is needed to estimate the fractional contributions of om and et in each sub region in this study the isotopic composition of precipitating vapor is calculated by clark and fritz 1997 kendall and caldwell 1998 peng et al 2011 13 δ 18 o pv δ 18 o p 10 3 α w v 18 1 where α w v 18 represents the equilibrium fractionation factor δ 18 o p represents the isotopic composition of precipitation the fractionation factor α w v 18 can be given by the expression criss 1999 friedman and james 1997 14 10 3 ln α w v 18 1 137 10 6 t 273 15 2 0 4156 10 3 t 273 15 2 0667 where t represents the temperature in k 3 2 2 isotopic compositions for evapotranspiration flux et consists of evaporation and transpiration and its isotopic composition can be estimated as a weighted average 15 δ 18 o et δ 18 o ev 1 r t δ 18 o tr r t where δ 18 o ev is the isotopic composition of evaporation from soil or water surfaces and δ 18 o tr is the isotopic composition of plant transpiration 3 2 2 1 isotopic compositions for transpiration flux under the balance of hydrological process there is no fractionation in the transpiration from plant to atmosphere flanagan et al 1991 williams et al 2004 the isotopic composition of transpiration vapor is equal to the isotopic composition of water in plant stem and in soil water composition of the plant water approximately equals to local soil water or shallow groundwater which may be approximated by local precipitation peng et al 2011 wang et al 2016a since soil water is largely influenced by precipitation and long term shallow ground water a linear relationship between the isotopic composition of soil water and that of precipitation is assumed to better estimate soil water composition the isotopic composition of transpiration moisture is determined by 16 δ 18 o tr δ 18 o plant δ 18 o soil k δ 18 o p b where δ 18 o p δ 18 o plant and δ 18 o soil are the isotopic composition of precipitation plant and soil water respectively k and b are fitted parameters due to scarcity of measured δ18o data of soil water we used the simulation data from isotope enabled gcm to build the relationship between isotopic composition of precipitation and that of soil water all the grids during the summer months from 1994 to 2010 are divided into four sub region the relationships between soil water isotope and precipitation isotope in summer in each sub regions are significant the best fit equation and goodness of fit r 2 in each sub region are shown in fig 4 3 2 2 2 isotopic compositions for evaporation flux the isotopic composition of evaporation moisture is estimated by a modified craig gordon equation craig and gordon 1965 gat 1996 17 δ 18 o ev δ 18 o s h δ 18 o adv ε 1 h where h represents relative humidity and can be derived from eq 15 δ 18 o s represents isotopic composition of surface water and varies among different sub regions in sc and nec where there are no large lakes the isotopic composition is largely controlled by local precipitation peng et al 2011 and can be represented by the isotopic composition of long term local precipitation in cc where the poyang lake and dongting lake are located the isotopic composition of precipitation was similar to that of lake isotope in summer hu et al 2013 zhan et al 2015 2016 in nc the isotopic composition of lake isotope is set to 0 1 which is the isotopic composition of the bohai sea bigg and rohling 2000 ε represents enrichment factor determined by equilibrium or kinetic fractionation and can be estimated by 18 ε 1000 1 α w v 18 1 14 2 1 h 19 h e e where e represents the partial pressure of water vapor and e represents the saturated equilibrium vapor pressures at the same temperature and can be calculated as buck 1996 20 e 0 61121 exp 18 678 t 234 5 t 257 14 t 3 2 3 isotopic compositions for advection flux the isotopic compositions of advection flux are closely related to the rainout along the pathway of water vapor transport if there is no rainout along the transport trajectory there should be no fractionation caused by vapor condensation under this circumstance the isotopic composition of advection moisture is calculated as 21 δ 18 o adv i δ 18 o pv i 1 if precipitation occurs along the transport trajectory fractionation happens in the advection flux the process is well described by the rayleigh distillation and the fractionation of advection vapor can be estimated by 22 δ 18 o adv i δ 18 o pv i 1 1000 α w v 1 i n f where the parameter f a ratio between product and reactant the upwind vapor there are different ways to estimate f in the literature for example ratio of mean humidity mixing ratio peng et al 2011 and ratio of partial water vapor pressures in the final and initial regions wang et al 2016a have been used in this paper f is estimated as a ratio of the amounts of total water vapor in the atmospheric columns in the two sub regions 23 f q i q i 1 where q i and q i 1 represent the amount of total water in the product sub region and that in its upwind sub region respectively this approach assumes that steady state conditions exist at a monthly scale and the difference of qi 1 qi is treated as rained out during the vapor transport between the two sub regions the amounts of precipitable water vapor in each region are obtained from environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis data 3 3 gaussian first order approximation in this study the gaussian first order approximation phillips and gregg 2001 zhang et al 2016 zhang and liu 2016 is applied to evaluate the uncertainty of the mean proportion fadv and fet the variance i e the square of the standard error of advection moisture can be calculated as 24 σ f adv 2 f adv δ 18 o adv 2 σ δ 18 o adv 2 f adv δ 18 o et 2 σ δ 18 o et 2 f adv δ 18 o pv 2 σ δ 18 o pv 2 25 σ f et 2 f et δ 18 o adv 2 σ δ 18 o adv 2 f et δ 18 o et 2 σ δ 18 o et 2

dominated by the east asian monsoon in summer li et al 2014 other asian pacific monsoons such as indian monsoon have their own domains and make little contributions to summer precipitation wang and ho 2002 the sub regions influenced by om vary between summer months due to the changes of moisture transport pathways moisture from the pacific ocean migrates furthest to cc in june to the middle of nec in july and to nc in august thus the data only in sc and cc are used in june in july the processes in sc cc nc and the southeastern portion of nec are simulated in july and sc cc and nc are calculated in august in july only the stations jz sy and cb are within the om transport pathway and are chosen from nec for analyzing the land sea interaction stations in each sub region are averaged to obtain meteorological parameters and isotopic compositions of each moisture flux as shown in table 3 in order to better understanding regional ocean land interaction in eastern china we apply the mean data in table 3 to analyze the moisture transport processes during summer months as visualized in fig 5 sc is located on the coast of the pacific ocean and represents the region where the oceanic moisture om firstly marches into eastern china in cc the summer precipitating vapor comes from local et moisture and advection moisture that experiences fractionation from precipitating vapor in its upwind sub region of sc local et of precipitation water would continue to add recycled moisture to the advection stream along the transport trajectory the moisture from the ocean transports as part of advection moisture and decreases along the transport route similar hydrological processes happen in nc in july and august as well as in nec in july 4 1 2 the contribution of the three sources of precipitation in eastern china advection moisture is the predominant contributor to summer precipitation and its contributions change from sub region to sub region as well as from month to month as the strength of water vapor from the pacific ocean changes fig 6 in contrast the contributions of transpiration and evaporation are minor with the former being greater than the latter because of the high vegetation cover in the region in summer fig 2 the advection fractions are 94 in june 92 in july and 81 in august in cc fig 6a and the decrease over time is largely caused by changes in the monsoon strength resulting in gradual northward movement of the frontal rainy season from cc in june to nc and nec in july and august when the frontal rainy season stalls in cc in june a greater contribution from advection moisture is expected in contrast when the rainy front or zone advances north to nc and nec it is likely that more advection moisture in july and august than in june would pass over cc and reach the fronts in the north the advection contributions are 89 in july and 91 in august in nc this is because the rainy front moves to nec in july and retreats back to nc in august fig 2 the advection moisture contribution to nec is about 76 in july and the low contribution is due to increased contribution from et in the sub region especially evaporation from bohai sea spatially the advection contributions decrease from cc to nc to nec in july indicating increases in evaporation and transpiration contribution along the flux trajectory fig 6b however the increase from cc to nc in august may again indicates that advection moisture would pass over cc to reach the rainy fronts stationed in nc the fractional contributions of transpiration are 5 in june 7 in july and 16 in august in the sub region of cc which compensate for the temporal decline of the contributions from the om fig 6a the transpiration contributions are 7 in july and 6 in august in nc with little changes over time in comparison the highest contribution of transpiration is from the sub region of nec in july which accounts for 22 of precipitation water because of the highest transpiration to et ratio in the entire region table 2 the evaporation fractions are 1 in june 1 in july and 3 in august in cc 4 in july and 3 in august in nc and 3 in july in nec fig 6 the small evaporation fractions are largely due to high vegetation cover in the summer growing season in the region 4 1 3 the contribution of oceanic moisture temporally the om contributions tend to reduce from june to august in cc and nc under the assumption that the ocean moisture fraction is near 100 in sc in summer the om fractions decrease from 94 in june to 92 in july to 81 in august in cc fig 7 and decrease from 82 in july to 72 in august in nc the moisture from the pacific ocean reaches nec only in july so this sub region is not included in the analysis for june and august the temporal declines of the om contribution in each sub region are consistent with the northward movement of the rainy fronts in the eastern china the contribution tends to be the highest when and where the fronts stall and then declines after the fronts advance northward because more om would pass over the upwind sub regions and precipitate out in the frontal zones resulting in decreased contributions of ocean moisture in a sub region over time spatially the variations of om contributions in eastern china follow continental effect in other words the longer the transport path the smaller the om contribution due to the increase of recycled moisture through et the east asian monsoon streams northward from the southeastern to the northeastern china and brings oceanic moisture from the pacific ocean to northeastern china in cc the contribution of om to precipitation decreases to 89 during summer months in nc the ratio changes to 75 in nec the om fraction is 62 in july fig 7 some studies have focused on the hydrological processes in eastern china numaguti 1999 used an atmospheric general circulation model to examine the hydrological processes at a continental scale and found that the contribution of om to precipitation is as high as 80 or higher in southeastern china trenberth 1999 discovered that at a 1000 km scale about 82 of precipitation comes from the om in south central china by a one dimension analytical model chen et al 2005 analyzed the water cycle during precipitation anomalies in china and suggested that the om ratio is more than 92 for wet summer and 60 for dry summer in south central china and the ratio is 83 for wet summer and 52 for dry summer in nec hua et al 2015 argued that the summer means of the om fraction is 92 in sc and 84 in cc and 76 in nc based on the reanalysis data from 1979 to 2010 the results in this study are a little higher than the findings mentioned above under the assumption that the om fraction in sc is 100 4 2 uncertainty analysis to statistically estimate the accuracy of the proportions estimated above the standard errors and 95 cis given in table 4 are calculated by eqs 20 21 22 and 23 the standard errors of advection and et are the same from 0 03 to 0 17 during the three summer months in the four sub regions the 95 cis of advection and et are mostly independent table 4 except that in july in nec the large ci in nec is mainly because of the small sample number in this sub region to some extent the predicted mean proportions are meaningful based on eqs 23 24 and 25 the percent uncertainty contributions from advection et and precipitating vapor to the total uncertainty of the fraction estimates in the study region during summer months are presented in fig 8 the precipitating vapor accounts for the major uncertainty advection contributes about 5 38 to total uncertainty and the contribution of et is negligible the largest uncertainty contribution of precipitating vapor results from the largest spatial variance of δ18opv activities which is much higher than that of δ18oet and δ18oadv because precipitating vapor is the mixture of advection moisture and et moisture this fraction contains more uncertainty than either advection or et moisture in addition the lack of perfect mixing of the precipitating vapor as assumed causes additional uncertainty the small spatial variation in et within each sub region is largely owing to similar meteorological physiographical and biological conditions in each sub region in summer in addition et measurement techniques and estimation methods are well developed resulting in small uncertainty with et estimation even though the results are encouraging this study still has two main limitations one is the scarcity of isotopic data in eastern china the measured isotopic data are only provided from gnip and chnip database gnip database are collected from 1961 to 2017 while chnip database are from 2005 to 2010 similar temporal mismatch also happens between simulated data and measured data another limitation is the lack of measured isotopic composition of each moisture flux owing to the limited technology we are unable to directly measure the isotopic composition of advection evaporation and transpiration vapor but to use precipitation observations and many meteorological parameters to infer the isotopic composition of different vapor sources the estimation of meteorological parameters and isotopic compositions would cause uncertainties or errors in this study for example the ratio of transpiration to et i e rt is based on the magnitude of the fluxes in contrast we apply an area averaged rt over land and sea for nc generally the evaporation from broad open water such as bohai sea maybe larger than the et from land so the parameter rt calculated from eq 9 could be larger than the actual value calculated based on the total magnitudes of the transpiration and et fluxes for the nc region the ratio of the total transpiration flux in land to the total fluxes of transpiration in land and evaporation in both sea and land this parameter may result in a smaller oceanic moisture contribution to precipitation in nc 5 conclusions in this paper a two component isotopic mixing model is applied to systematically characterize the spatial and temporal variations of om contributions to summer precipitation in eastern china the gaussian first order approach is used for uncertainty analysis the study region is divided into four sub regions sc cc nc and nec according to the vapor flux trajectory isotope distribution and geographical conditions the contributions of om to precipitation in each sub region and every month in summer are assessed in summer om contributes predominantly to precipitation while et makes a minor contribution the om fractions are 94 in june 92 in july and 81 in august in cc 82 in july and 72 in august in nc and 62 in july in nec the spatial and temporal variations of the ocean contribution are mainly affected by the strength of water vapor that decreases along the transport route and the passage of time in summer standard errors 95 cis and percent uncertainty contributions of the precipitation sources are calculated to assess the accuracy of the proportional estimates the standard errors vary from 0 03 to 0 17 for proportional contributions of both advection moisture and et while the 95 cis vary from 0 07 to 0 38 for both sources the uncertainty of the fractional contributions mainly comes from the precipitating vapor the number of isotopic measurements and the accuracy of precipitation isotope data

5866,ocean continent interaction is an important component of the global climate systems and influences hydrological cycles at regional and local scales oceanic moisture om advection and terrestrial evapotranspiration et are two main sources of precipitation in eastern china the objectives of this study are to quantify the contribution of the om to precipitation and to better understanding the water cycle processes in the region summer months when the east asian monsoon is strongest are studied and a two component mixing model using 18o as a tracer is applied to apportion the spatiotemporal contributions of om the gaussian first order approximation is employed to assess the uncertainty of the estimates in the entire study area om predominates summer precipitation with et playing a supplemental role the contributions of om to precipitation decrease from june to august in central china and northern china for example in central china the proportional contributions of om are 94 in june 92 in july and 81 in august spatially the om contributions decrease along the transport route from south to northeast the 95 confidence intervals of the estimated contributions range from 0 07 to 0 38 with the standard errors between 0 03 and 0 17 for all months and sub regions the relative uncertainty contributions of each source to the total uncertainty follow the order of precipitating vapor advection et the large variances of δ18o in precipitable water vapor account for the most uncertainty of the proportional estimates keywords oceanic moisture east asian monsoon water cycle oxygen isotope uncertainty analysis 1 introduction ocean continent interaction as a significant part of climate teleconnection systems impacts global water cycles and regulates regional extreme hydrological events eastern china is a typical region where ocean land interaction controls summer precipitation wang and ho 2002 ding et al 2009 the oceanic moisture driven by asian summer monsoon always causes intensive precipitation and leads to serious floods in eastern china qian and lee 2000 day et al 2015 understanding the mechanism of ocean land interaction is necessary for predicting hydrologic variability and improve water resource management the interaction is complicated and contains large spatial and temporary variabilities moisture advection from ocean or regions nearby as well as evapotranspiration et from plants and soil water surfaces are two major sources of precipitation brubaker et al 1993 trenberth 1999 relative impacts of advection and et on precipitation depend on the characteristics of the land surfaces and climate circulation patterns in specific regions kong et al 2013 for example in seashore regions with minimal plant cover oceanic moisture om controls the regional precipitation as om moves inland the et contribution increases as expected quantifying the oceanic moisture contribution to continental precipitation helps to evaluate the significance of ocean land interaction brubaker et al 1993 three categories of methods are usually employed to quantify the contribution of the above sources of precipitation that is analytical models numerical water vapor tracers and physical water vapor tracers gimeno et al 2012 pathak et al 2017 analytical models calculate the moisture contribution by formulating water budget equation under specific assumptions burde and zangvil 2001 schaefli et al 2012 this method taken as a black box approach is relatively simple but provides rough calculations in contrast the numerical water vapor tracers provide detailed information it tags water by simulating relevant atmospheric processes including convection evaporation condensation pathak et al 2017 etc however the high computational cost as well as the uncertainty in physical parameterizations and process representation are two main concerns for practical application dominguez et al 2006 analytical models and numerical water vapor tracers have been conducted to investigate the contribution of om to precipitation in eastern china numaguti 1999 trenberth 1999 chen et al 2005 hua et al 2015 the physical tracers method has seldom been employed to systematically quantify the processes in the region analytical models and numerical water vapor tracers are able to describe the sources and sinks of atmospheric water vapor however they cannot be validated without physical water vapor tracers gimeno et al 2012 hu and dominguez 2015 the physical water vapor tracers partitions different sources of the precipitation fluxes with the isotopic composition in water vapors gimeno et al 2012 the method can be classified into three and two component mixing models according to the number of the precipitation sources wang et al 2016a to identify the contribution of precipitation from independent sources three component mixing model needs two isotopic tracers such as δ2h and δ18o peng et al 2011 while two component mixing model can be developed with only one isotopic tracer in theory the uncertainties of the proportional estimates using physical tracer methods increase with the number of tracers and precipitation sources zhang and liu 2016 comparing with the three component mixing model the two component method is relatively simpler with lesser uncertainties the traditional two component method assumes that precipitation originates from evaporation and advection clark and fritz 1997 van der ent et al 2010 genereux 1998 this method eliminates the effect of transpiration wang et al 2016b and was usually applied to regions where transpiration is trivial source to precipitation shabir dar and ghosh 2017 froehlich et al 2008 gat and kendall 1994 kong et al 2013 in eastern china where vegetation coverage is very high during summer months gao et al 2000 the impact of plant transpiration to precipitation is strong and cannot be neglected thus the traditional two component method is not applicable in this case isotopic deuterium excess hydrogen and oxygen are three main tracing properties used to tag precipitation sources deuterium excess calculated by subtracting hydrogen and oxygen isotopes is a popular fingerprinting property in arid regions for eliminating the sub cloud evaporation effect on recycling moisture froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 aemisegger et al 2014 cui and li 2015 in wet regions where the sub cloud effect is negligible oxygen is the best tracer which contains less measurement uncertainty than deuterium excess and hydrogen dansgaard 1964 liu et al 2008 considering the meteorological conditions and estimated uncertainty oxygen isotope is chosen as the sole tracer consequently the objectives of this work are 1 to extend a two component mixing model to simulate three precipitable vapor sources atmospheric advection soil water evaporation and plant transpiration 2 to quantify the oceanic contribution to precipitation with δ18o and 3 to evaluate the uncertainty of the estimated proportions of each precipitation source using the gaussian approximation approach 2 materials 2 1 study area topographically the boundary between the china s 2nd and 3rd terrain steps great khingan mountain taihang mountain wu mountain and xuefeng mountain divides eastern monsoon region into two parts the eastern part lying on the 3rd step is mainly composed of plains and is below 500 m the western part sitting on the 2nd step mostly consists of basins and is about 1000 2000 m to eliminate the effect of topography on moisture transport the eastern part of the monsoon region is selected and called eastern china for this study fig 1 eastern china lies in the southeastern of eurasia and borders on the west pacific ocean it has a total length of approximately 3 731 km from south to north and a land area of 260 000 km2 the islands at the south margin of south china sea are not included in the study area because of the lack of observed isotope data in those islands for oceanic moisture analysis in addition these islands are not geographically connected to the southern china and hydrometeorology issues in these islands are different from those in southern china besides the land cover is also a key factor that influences et another combined source of precipitation generally normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is employed to represent the vegetative land cover aburas et al 2015 hansen et al 2000 in summer the vegetation coverage is very high in southeastern china and decreases northward fig 2 the water vapor flux whose direction is controlled by pressure fields and wind direction is calculated by eq 1 qin et al 2005 as shown in fig 2 om almost marches north in summer in the selected study domain 1 q 1 g p 0 p u v q d p where q is the horizonal water flux g is the gravitational acceleration v is wind vector q is specific humidity p0 and pu are surface and upper pressure of the air column usually taken as 300 hpa respectively 2 2 data observed isotopic composition of precipitation are mainly from two databases one is the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip established by the international atomic energy agency iaea and the world meteorological organization wmo the gnip database houses global stable isotope including oxygen hydrogen and tritium of monthly composite rainfall samples from 1961 to 2017 the other is the chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip collected by chinese academy of sciences cas the chnip aims to extend systematic observation nationwide and collects monthly composite precipitation samples from 2005 to 2010 liu et al 2014 the long term precision of gnip measurement is about 0 1 for δ18o and chnip measurement is about 0 3 for δ18o liu et al 2008 there are about 17 gnip stations and 15 chinp stations in the study area and the locations of these stations are shown in fig 1 to eliminate deviation of the simple mean isotope value caused by precipitation amounts the precipitation weighted mean precipitation isotope values δ 18 o p for a particular calendar month are calculated as follows dansgaard 1964 salamalikis et al 2016 wang et al 2016b 2 δ 18 o p i 1 n p i δ 18 o i i 1 n p i where n is the number of all observed hydrological years p i is the precipitation amount of the specific month in a hydrological year δ 18 o i is the oxygen isotope concentration in precipitation in the corresponding month the long term mean weighted isotopic data are summarized in table 1 to characterize the ocean land interactions in eastern china the study region is divided into different sub regions precipitating moisture in each sub region except sc is composed of advection from its upwind sub region and local et precipitating moisture in sc represents the origin of oceanic moisture and marches as advection to its downwind sub region cc considering the vapor flux isotope distribution fig 3 and geophysical conditions section 2 1 the study region is divided into four sub regions that is southern china sc central china cc northern china nc and northeastern china nec as shown in fig 1 simulated isotopic composition of soil water and precipitation is calculated

meteorological information the missing values are supplemented by the corresponding data at the nearest meteorological stations from the china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn en all the long term mean meteorological data in eastern china are collected in table 1 3 methods 3 1 a modified two component mixing model to better distinguishing the relative contributions of atmospheric moisture fluxes in eastern china a modified two component mixing model is extended in this study the modified two component mixing model is based on three assumptions first the isotopic composition of precipitating vapor is a complete mixture of advection vapor and et vapor brubaker et al 1993 trenberth 1999 evaporation from soil and water surfaces as well as plant transpiration are aggregated into the et source second the isotopic composition of each vapor flux is unique or statistically different brubaker et al 1993 burde and zangvil 2001 third the ratio of transpiration to precipitation is constant in each sub region in summer zhang et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 according to the first assumption the water mass balance equation can be expressed as 3 q pv q et q adv where qpv qet and qadv are the moisture quantity of precipitating vapor et vapor and advection vapor respectively considering the second assumption the chemical conservation law in terms of δ18o can be expressed as 4 δ 18 o pv q pv δ 18 o et q et δ 18 o adv q adv where δ18opv δ18oet and δ18oadv are the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitating vapor et and advection respectively to get the proportional contributions of each moisture source to precipitation eqs 3 and 4 are divided by qpv yielding 5 1 f et f adv 6 δ 18 o pv f et δ 18 o et f adv δ 18 o adv where fet and fadv are the fractions of et moisture and advection moisture in precipitating vapor respectively combining eqs 5 and 6 the contribution of advection to precipitation is given by 7 f adv δ 18 o pv δ 18 o et δ 18 o adv δ 18 o et based on the third assumption the contribution of transpiration to precipitations can be estimated from the following equation 8 f tr f et r t where ftr is the fractional contribution of transpiration to precipitation and rt is the ratio of transpiration to et we collected the t et parameter transpiration divided by et from publications in the literature for each sub region see table 2 and took the average of all the collected t et in the same region as rt the rt in nc in table 2 neglects evaporation from the bohai sea the bohai sea is considered as local evaporation contribution to precipitation in the nc because moisture from nc transports through the bohai sea to nec the actual rt in nc is obtained by area weighting 9 r t r t s e a s t s e a r t l a n d s t l a n d s t s e a s t l a n d where s t s e a and s t l a n d are acreage of the bohai sea and of the land in nc respectively r t l a n d and r t s e a are rt of the land in nc and of the bohai sea respectively there is no transpiration in the bohai sea so r t s e a is assumed 0 the r t l a n d shown in table 2 is 0 64 the s t l a n d s t l a n d s t s e a are calculated as 0 75 based on eq 9 and the data mentioned above the actual rt in nc is set to 0 48 et is a mixture of evaporation and transpiration so the contribution of et to precipitation is made up of the contribution of evaporation and transpiration and can be expressed as 10 f et f ev f tr to get the contribution of evaporation to precipitation eq 10 is transformed to 11 f ev f et f tr there is not enough station along the seashore can be taken as the original boundary of the om so the precipitating moisture in sc is assumed as the original source of the pacific ocean in other words 100 oceanic contribution is assumed for the sc as the moisture transports northward from the pacific ocean to the nec the direct oceanic contribution to precipitation in each region is the product of all advection assuming 100 contribution from the ocean for the most upwind sub region sub region 1 and can be calculated by 12 f oc i 1 n f adv i i 1 n δ 18 o pv i δ 18 o et i δ 18 o adv i δ 18 o et i where n denotes the total number of upwind sub regions i denotes the number of the product sub region foc is the contribution of moisture sourced from the ocean to precipitation in a particular sub region of interest fadv is the advection fraction to precipitation in a sub region and f 1 adv is 100 3 2 isotopic compositions for moisture fluxes 3 2 1 isotopic compositions for precipitating vapor according to equations and isotopic composition of each moisture flux δ18opv δ18oet and δ18oadv is needed to estimate the fractional contributions of om and et in each sub region in this study the isotopic composition of precipitating vapor is calculated by clark and fritz 1997 kendall and caldwell 1998 peng et al 2011 13 δ 18 o pv δ 18 o p 10 3 α w v 18 1 where α w v 18 represents the equilibrium fractionation factor δ 18 o p represents the isotopic composition of precipitation the fractionation factor α w v 18 can be given by the expression criss 1999 friedman and james 1997 14 10 3 ln α w v 18 1 137 10 6 t 273 15 2 0 4156 10 3 t 273 15 2 0667 where t represents the temperature in k 3 2 2 isotopic compositions for evapotranspiration flux et consists of evaporation and transpiration and its isotopic composition can be estimated as a weighted average 15 δ 18 o et δ 18 o ev 1 r t δ 18 o tr r t where δ 18 o ev is the isotopic composition of evaporation from soil or water surfaces and δ 18 o tr is the isotopic composition of plant transpiration 3 2 2 1 isotopic compositions for transpiration flux under the balance of hydrological process there is no fractionation in the transpiration from plant to atmosphere flanagan et al 1991 williams et al 2004 the isotopic composition of transpiration vapor is equal to the isotopic composition of water in plant stem and in soil water composition of the plant water approximately equals to local soil water or shallow groundwater which may be approximated by local precipitation peng et al 2011 wang et al 2016a since soil water is largely influenced by precipitation and long term shallow ground water a linear relationship between the isotopic composition of soil water and that of precipitation is assumed to better estimate soil water composition the isotopic composition of transpiration moisture is determined by 16 δ 18 o tr δ 18 o plant δ 18 o soil k δ 18 o p b where δ 18 o p δ 18 o plant and δ 18 o soil are the isotopic composition of precipitation plant and soil water respectively k and b are fitted parameters due to scarcity of measured δ18o data of soil water we used the simulation data from isotope enabled gcm to build the relationship between isotopic composition of precipitation and that of soil water all the grids during the summer months from 1994 to 2010 are divided into four sub region the relationships between soil water isotope and precipitation isotope in summer in each sub regions are significant the best fit equation and goodness of fit r 2 in each sub region are shown in fig 4 3 2 2 2 isotopic compositions for evaporation flux the isotopic composition of evaporation moisture is estimated by a modified craig gordon equation craig and gordon 1965 gat 1996 17 δ 18 o ev δ 18 o s h δ 18 o adv ε 1 h where h represents relative humidity and can be derived from eq 15 δ 18 o s represents isotopic composition of surface water and varies among different sub regions in sc and nec where there are no large lakes the isotopic composition is largely controlled by local precipitation peng et al 2011 and can be represented by the isotopic composition of long term local precipitation in cc where the poyang lake and dongting lake are located the isotopic composition of precipitation was similar to that of lake isotope in summer hu et al 2013 zhan et al 2015 2016 in nc the isotopic composition of lake isotope is set to 0 1 which is the isotopic composition of the bohai sea bigg and rohling 2000 ε represents enrichment factor determined by equilibrium or kinetic fractionation and can be estimated by 18 ε 1000 1 α w v 18 1 14 2 1 h 19 h e e where e represents the partial pressure of water vapor and e represents the saturated equilibrium vapor pressures at the same temperature and can be calculated as buck 1996 20 e 0 61121 exp 18 678 t 234 5 t 257 14 t 3 2 3 isotopic compositions for advection flux the isotopic compositions of advection flux are closely related to the rainout along the pathway of water vapor transport if there is no rainout along the transport trajectory there should be no fractionation caused by vapor condensation under this circumstance the isotopic composition of advection moisture is calculated as 21 δ 18 o adv i δ 18 o pv i 1 if precipitation occurs along the transport trajectory fractionation happens in the advection flux the process is well described by the rayleigh distillation and the fractionation of advection vapor can be estimated by 22 δ 18 o adv i δ 18 o pv i 1 1000 α w v 1 i n f where the parameter f a ratio between product and reactant the upwind vapor there are different ways to estimate f in the literature for example ratio of mean humidity mixing ratio peng et al 2011 and ratio of partial water vapor pressures in the final and initial regions wang et al 2016a have been used in this paper f is estimated as a ratio of the amounts of total water vapor in the atmospheric columns in the two sub regions 23 f q i q i 1 where q i and q i 1 represent the amount of total water in the product sub region and that in its upwind sub region respectively this approach assumes that steady state conditions exist at a monthly scale and the difference of qi 1 qi is treated as rained out during the vapor transport between the two sub regions the amounts of precipitable water vapor in each region are obtained from environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis data 3 3 gaussian first order approximation in this study the gaussian first order approximation phillips and

dominated by the east asian monsoon in summer li et al 2014 other asian pacific monsoons such as indian monsoon have their own domains and make little contributions to summer precipitation wang and ho 2002 the sub regions influenced by om vary between summer months due to the changes of moisture transport pathways moisture from the pacific ocean migrates furthest to cc in june to the middle of nec in july and to nc in august thus the data only in sc and cc are used in june in july the processes in sc cc nc and the southeastern portion of nec are simulated in july and sc cc and nc are calculated in august in july only the stations jz sy and cb are within the om transport pathway and are chosen from nec for analyzing the land sea interaction stations in each sub region are averaged to obtain meteorological parameters and isotopic compositions of each moisture flux as shown in table 3 in order to better understanding regional ocean land interaction in eastern china we apply the mean data in table 3 to analyze the moisture transport processes during summer months as visualized in fig 5 sc is located on the coast of the pacific ocean and represents the region where the oceanic moisture om firstly marches into eastern china in cc the summer precipitating vapor comes from local et moisture and advection moisture that experiences fractionation from precipitating vapor in its upwind sub region of sc local et of precipitation water would continue to add recycled moisture to the advection stream along the transport trajectory the moisture from the ocean transports as part of advection moisture and decreases along the transport route similar hydrological processes happen in nc in july and august as well as in nec in july 4 1 2 the contribution of the three sources of precipitation in eastern china advection moisture is the predominant contributor to summer precipitation and its contributions change from sub region to sub region as well as from month to month as the strength of water vapor from the pacific ocean changes fig 6 in contrast the contributions of transpiration and evaporation are minor with the former being greater than the latter because of the high vegetation cover in the region in summer fig 2 the advection fractions are 94 in june 92 in july and 81 in august in cc fig 6a and the decrease over time is largely caused by changes in the monsoon strength resulting in gradual northward movement of the frontal rainy season from cc in june to nc and nec in july and august when the frontal rainy season stalls in cc in june a greater contribution from advection moisture is expected in contrast when the rainy front or zone advances north to nc and nec it is likely that more advection moisture in july and august than in june would pass over cc and reach the fronts in the north the advection contributions are 89 in july and 91 in august in nc this is because the rainy front moves to nec in july and retreats back to nc in august fig 2 the advection moisture contribution to nec is about 76 in july and the low contribution is due to increased contribution from et in the sub region especially evaporation from bohai sea spatially the advection contributions decrease from cc to nc to nec in july indicating increases in evaporation and transpiration contribution along the flux trajectory fig 6b however the increase from cc to nc in august may again indicates that advection moisture would pass over cc to reach the rainy fronts stationed in nc the fractional contributions of transpiration are 5 in june 7 in july and 16 in august in the sub region of cc which compensate for the temporal decline of the contributions from the om fig 6a the transpiration contributions are 7 in july and 6 in august in nc with little changes over time in comparison the highest contribution of transpiration is from the sub region of nec in july which accounts for 22 of precipitation water because of the highest transpiration to et ratio in the entire region table 2 the evaporation fractions are 1 in june 1 in july and 3 in august in cc 4 in july and 3 in august in nc and 3 in july in nec fig 6 the small evaporation fractions are largely due to high vegetation cover in the summer growing season in the region 4 1 3 the contribution of oceanic moisture temporally the om contributions tend to reduce from june to august in cc and nc under the assumption that the ocean moisture fraction is near 100 in sc in summer the om fractions decrease from 94 in june to 92 in july to 81 in august in cc fig 7 and decrease from 82 in july to 72 in august in nc the moisture from the pacific ocean reaches nec only in july so this sub region is not included in the analysis for june and august the temporal declines of the om contribution in each sub region are consistent with the northward movement of the rainy fronts in the eastern china the contribution tends to be the highest when and where the fronts stall and then declines after the fronts advance northward because more om would pass over the upwind sub regions and precipitate out in the frontal zones resulting in decreased contributions of ocean moisture in a sub region over time spatially the variations of om contributions in eastern china follow continental effect in other words the longer the transport path the smaller the om contribution due to the increase of recycled moisture through et the east asian monsoon streams northward from the southeastern to the northeastern china and brings oceanic moisture from the pacific ocean to northeastern china in cc the contribution of om to precipitation decreases to 89 during summer months in nc the ratio changes to 75 in nec the om fraction is 62 in july fig 7 some studies have focused on the hydrological processes in eastern china numaguti 1999 used an atmospheric general circulation model to examine the hydrological processes at a continental scale and found that the contribution of om to precipitation is as high as 80 or higher in southeastern china trenberth 1999 discovered that at a 1000 km scale about 82 of precipitation comes from the om in south central china by a one dimension analytical model chen et al 2005 analyzed the water cycle during precipitation anomalies in china and suggested that the om ratio is more than 92 for wet summer and 60 for dry summer in south central china and the ratio is 83 for wet summer and 52 for dry summer in nec hua et al 2015 argued that the summer means of the om fraction is 92 in sc and 84 in cc and 76 in nc based on the reanalysis data from 1979 to 2010 the results in this study are a little higher than the findings mentioned above under the assumption that the om fraction in sc is 100 4 2 uncertainty analysis to statistically estimate the accuracy of the proportions estimated above the standard errors and 95 cis given in table 4 are calculated by eqs 20 21 22 and 23 the standard errors of advection and et are the same from 0 03 to 0 17 during the three summer months in the four sub regions the 95 cis of advection and et are mostly independent table 4 except that in july in nec the large ci in nec is mainly because of the small sample number in this sub region to some extent the predicted mean proportions are meaningful based on eqs 23 24 and 25 the percent uncertainty contributions from advection et and precipitating vapor to the total uncertainty of the fraction estimates in the study region during summer months are presented in fig 8 the precipitating vapor accounts for the major uncertainty advection contributes about 5 38 to total uncertainty and the contribution of et is negligible the largest uncertainty contribution of precipitating vapor results from the largest spatial variance of δ18opv activities which is much higher than that of δ18oet and δ18oadv because precipitating vapor is the mixture of advection moisture and et moisture this fraction contains more uncertainty than either advection or et moisture in addition the lack of perfect mixing of the precipitating vapor as assumed causes additional uncertainty the small spatial variation in et within each sub region is largely owing to similar meteorological physiographical and biological conditions in each sub region in summer in addition et measurement techniques and estimation methods are well developed resulting in small uncertainty with et estimation even though the results are encouraging this study still has two main limitations one is the scarcity of isotopic data in eastern china the measured isotopic data are only provided from gnip and chnip database gnip database are collected from 1961 to 2017 while chnip database are from 2005 to 2010 similar temporal mismatch also happens between simulated data and measured data another limitation is the lack of measured isotopic composition of each moisture flux owing to the limited technology we are unable to directly measure the isotopic composition of advection evaporation and transpiration vapor but to use precipitation observations and many meteorological parameters to infer the isotopic composition of different vapor sources the estimation of meteorological parameters and isotopic compositions would cause uncertainties or errors in this study for example the ratio of transpiration to et i e rt is based on the magnitude of the fluxes in contrast we apply an area averaged rt over land and sea for nc generally the evaporation from broad open water such as bohai sea maybe larger than the et from land so the parameter rt calculated from eq 9 could be larger than the actual value calculated based on the total magnitudes of the transpiration and et fluxes for the nc region the ratio of the total transpiration flux in land to the total fluxes of transpiration in land and evaporation in both sea and land this parameter may result in a smaller oceanic moisture contribution to precipitation in nc 5 conclusions in this paper a two component isotopic mixing model is applied to systematically characterize the spatial and temporal variations of om contributions to summer precipitation in eastern china the gaussian first order approach is used for uncertainty analysis the study region is divided into four sub regions sc cc nc and nec according to the vapor flux trajectory isotope distribution and geographical conditions the contributions of om to precipitation in each sub region and every month in summer are assessed in summer om contributes predominantly to precipitation while et makes a minor contribution the om fractions are 94 in june 92 in july and 81 in august in cc 82 in july and 72 in august in nc and 62 in july in nec the spatial and temporal variations of the ocean contribution are mainly affected by the strength of water vapor that decreases along the transport route and the passage of time in summer standard errors 95 cis and percent uncertainty contributions of the precipitation sources are calculated to assess the accuracy of the proportional estimates the standard errors vary from 0 03 to 0 17 for proportional contributions of both advection moisture and et while the 95 cis vary from 0 07 to 0 38 for both sources the uncertainty of the fractional contributions mainly comes from the precipitating vapor the number of isotopic measurements and the accuracy of precipitation isotope data

5867,the lancang river and nu river are parallel rivers located in southwestern china while the lancang river has several dams the nu river has none to explore the impacts of cascade reservoirs on the grain size and mineral composition of fine sediments 9 fine sediment samples from the nu river and 29 samples from the lancang river were collected and tested the results indicate that in the free flowing reaches ffrs of the lancang river the sediment grain sizes fined systematically and the mineral compositions varied slightly and these results were similar to those of the nu river without dams along the whole mainstream in the regulated reaches rrs of the lancang river the sediment grain sizes and mineral compositions indicated discontinuous fluctuations due to the dams trapping in the reservoir head areas the sediments were composed of fine silt or medium silt with 50 clay minerals but the sediments immediately downstream of the dams were fine sand or medium sand with 71 quartz and feldspar the relative abundance of each mineral was altered differently by passing through the rrs quartz chlorite and illite increased by 13 33 and 20 respectively while feldspar and calcite decreased by 26 and 80 respectively and dolomite and pyrite were completely trapped in the cascade reservoirs all these common minerals may be replenished except pyrite which originates from mining

cascade reservoirs have attracted widespread attention from scholars and government administrators in the lancang mekong river basin in recent years bravard et al 2014 commission 2018 kakonen 2008 keskinen et al 2012 kummu varis 2007 li et al 2013 walling 2008a b dams and reservoirs interrupt and modify sediment flux and water discharge and change the flow regime which controls the form of channels grant 2012 topping et al 2007 venditti et al 2012 and impacts the ecology society and economy of the surrounding areas graf 2005 hauer et al 2016 sediments are the basic constituents of a river and commonly show a downstream fining trend morrison et al 1999 frings 2008 concluded that downstream fining processes fall into 3 categories abrasion selective transport and sediment addition extraction however the fining trend may be interrupted by tributary injection rice church 1998 and dam construction williams wolman 1984 dams are well known to trap water all of the bedload and a portion of the suspended load thereby causing siltation in reservoirs coarsening of downstream sediment and a reduction in the suspended load downstream curtis et al 2010 dade et al 2011 fu et al 2006 smith et al 1999 williams wolman 1984 xu 2005 the suspended sediment particle size is controlled by the bed material and flow velocity mazumder 1994 mazumder et al 2005 therefore the relative abundances of quartz feldspar and carbonate minerals increase in the reservoir tail area and decrease toward the head area li 2012 tang et al 2018 and the fine particles of clay minerals always predominate in the reservoir head area fonseca et al 2010 however below the dam relatively clear water is widely accepted to transport massive amounts of sediment and incise channel beds to maintain the water sediment equilibrium grant et al 2003 thus hard heavy and large particles are harder to transport therefore they appear in sediment starved reaches sediment grain size distributions are mainly changed in the fine particles sand silt and clay skalak et al 2009 the nutrients adsorbed on fine particles will also be trapped especially phosphorus muller et al 2007 which may lead to algal blooms in reservoir areas yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2013 and to reduction of primary productivity zhang et al 1999 and fish production fan et al 2015 nixon 2003 in downstream areas sediment characteristics are basic information for a basin and different minerals may play diverse roles in biogeochemical processes for example the permeability and adsorption capacity vary with the particle size and mineral compositions rusch et al 2001 six et al 2002 which then affect the organic mineralization rate rasheed et al 2003 and biodegradation rate of organic pollutants gong et al 2018 hwang cutright 2004 wang et al 2006 warr et al 2016 furthermore reduced fe and sulfides in pyrite can act as electron donors for the acid catalyzed destruction of no2 chemo denitrification thereby facilitating denitrification in the river postma et al 1991 seitzinger et al 2006 however the sediment characteristics especially the mineral compositions altered by cascade reservoirs are not well known at the watershed scale in the lancang river fu et al 2015 and whether all minerals are trapped synchronously and uniformly by dams or are influenced differently remains unclear the lancang subbasin within china is generally believed to contribute approximately 50 fu he 2007 to 65 kummu et al 2010 of the basin total sediment load and various values of the trapping efficiency of these cascade reservoirs have been reported fu he 2007 kummu et al 2010 liu et al 2013 walling 2008a b wang et al 2011 recently more studies focused on the cascade reservoir impacts to the environment fan et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2014 yi et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 however few reports have focused on the impacts of dams on the sediment characteristics therein especially the alteration of mineral compositions to compensate for the absence of detailed predam data the nu river was selected as a regional background reference the lancang river and nu river are located on the southwestern edge of china these rivers are divided by the nu mountains and run parallel for more than 170 km thereby constituting a unique wonder of the world wang 2006 however the development modes of the two rivers are different no dam has been constructed on the main stream of the nu river which is one of the world s last undammed and least studied rivers kibler tullos 2013 in contrast the lancang river is a typical regulated river with 8 dams within china and more dams are under construction in this study we focused on 1 the change in the grain size distribution and mineral compositions of the fine particles 2 mm in the free flowing reaches ffrs 2 the influence of cascade reservoirs on the grain size distribution and mineral compositions and 3 the recovery of the grain size distribution and mineral compositions in the downstream reaches drs the results of this study provide the subbasin wide spatial variations in basic sediment information for the lancang and nu rivers thereby supporting further biogeochemical research in this area 2 materials and methods 2 1 background the lancang river and nu river are both located in southwestern china to the east of the international border between china and myanmar fig 1 and are produced by the rapid drift of the indian tectonic plate toward the eurasian plate kumar et al 2007 the two rivers originate in the tanggula mountains on the qinghai tibetan plateau and follow the north south oriented x type hengduan mountains li 2008 zhao 1993 most mountain peaks on both sides of the rivers are covered with snow year round and are over 4000 m higher than the v shaped valleys he et al 2006 jia et al 2014 the upper regions of the two rivers are affected by the north plateau monsoon climate and the lower regions are affected by the southwest maritime monsoon climate the distribution of precipitation is controlled by the complex topography and the average annual precipitation of the studied reaches of these two rivers is 600 1700 mm xi 1988 the nu river is the headwater area of the international salween river within the border of china the studied river length is approximately 460 km from bingzhongluo bzl in the middle reach to bizhai bz at the river boundary section the runoff is controlled by rainfall in the study area li 2003 no dam has been constructed on the main stream while the tributaries have nearly 100 small dams kibler tullos 2013 the lancang river is the headwater area of the international mekong river within the borders of china the studied river length is approximately 1300 km from rumei rm in the middle reach to guanlei gl at the river boundary section within this study area the runoff above gongguoqiao ggq is supplied by a mix of rainfall snow meltwater and groundwater and the proportion provided by rainfall gradually increases downstream he 1995 precipitation dominates 60 the runoff below ggq to the boundary section and 57 of the precipitation occurs in summer he 1995 li li juan and

submerged bar heads costigan et al 2014 which were considered high energy sites rice church 1998 furthermore we sampled in winter because these samples were assumed to reflect the channel sediment texture without the influence of floods all reservoir sites were selected within the 1 2 km frontier area of each dam where the reservoirs were deeper than 30 m and the sediment textures were more stable than in other areas of the reservoir tang et al 2018 the uppermost 20 cm of surface sediment was collected from the thalweg using a gravity corer uwitec austria the longitude latitude and

where i represents the influence of the cascade reservoirs on minerals i represents each mineral mn represents the average relative content value of each mineral in the ffrs and md represents the average relative content in the drs if the result of i is positive the mineral is replenished while passing through the rrs in contrast if the result is negative the mineral is trapped by the cascade reservoirs 3 results 3 1 longitudinal variability in the sediment grain size distribution in the lancang and nu rivers fig 2 illustrates the longitudinal variability in sediment grain size in the lancang and nu rivers the grain size distributions of all 9 samples from the nu river and 21 of the 29 samples from the lancang river were unimodal the 8 bimodal samples were obtained from the reservoir sites and presented a minor secondary peak of fine or medium silt particles in an otherwise predominately fine sand sample since only the reservoir sites had small bimodal grain size distributions standard parameters such as the mean grain size sorting skewness and kurtosis were calculated the mean grain size of the sediments in the nu river varied from 0 539 mm to 0 111 mm with an average of 0 210 mm as shown in fig 2 b all the sediments were well sorted coarse skewed and leptokurtic in the lancang river the sediment grain size fined systematically downstream in the ffrs but fluctuated strongly in the rrs the mean grain size of the sediment in the ffrs varied from 0 458 mm to 0 012 mm with a mean of 0 176 mm in the rrs the mean grain size fluctuated strongly from 0 005 mm to 0 255 mm with an average of 0 068 mm as shown in fig 2 a smaller grain size values were observed at the reservoir sites as denoted in red in fig 2 a these sites consisted of mostly fine silt or medium silt with an average grain size of 0 016 mm larger values were observed at the downstream sites where the sediments were mostly fine sand or medium sand with an average grain size of 0 117 mm the mean grain sizes at glb and gl in the drs were 0 093 and 0 142 mm respectively with an average of 0 117 mm all the sediments were well sorted and the sediments at the reservoir sites were symmetrical or fine skewed and mesokurtic or platykurtic while the other sediment samples were coarse skewed or symmetrical and leptokurtic or mesokurtic fig 2 c and d show the sediment grain size distributions of d10 d50 and d90 from the ffrs of the lancang river and nu river there were significant downstream fining trends in d10 d50 and d90 in both rivers as shown in table 1 the slopes of the regressions were an order of magnitude steeper for d50 and d90 in the lancang river than in the nu river while the slopes for d10 were mostly the same in both rivers 3 2 longitudinal variability in the sediment mineral compositions in the lancang and nu rivers quartz k feldspar albite calcite dolomite tremolite chlorite illite kaolinite and pyrite were contained in the nu river sediments fig 3 b the content percentages of quartz k feldspar albite calcite dolomite tremolite chlorite and illite varied from 34 to 46 5 to 18 10 to 20 3 to 6 1 to 5 2 to 4 6 to 13 and 8 to 20 respectively in addition to the same minerals observed in the nu river kaolinite and pyrite were observed in the lancang river sediments fig 3 a the content percentages of quartz k feldspar albite calcite chlorite and illite varied from 41 to 68 2 to 10 10 to 18 2 to 8 3 to 14 and 7 to 13 respectively in the ffrs and from 20 to 65 0 to 26 4 to 23 0 to 9 4 to 25 and 9 to 52 respectively in the rrs several samples contained small amounts of dolomite tremolite and kaolinite regression analyses demonstrated significant correlations between the mean grain size and quartz r2 0 46 f 25 05 p 0 0001 chlorite r2 0 46 f 25 25 p 0 0001 and illite r2 0 51 f 29 73 p 0 0001 as shown in fig 3 c and table 2 quartz accounted for a greater percentage in the ffrs of the lancang river 54 than in the nu river 40 while k feldspar and illite were present in lower proportions in the ffrs of the lancang river 4 and 10 respectively than in the nu river 11 and 15 respectively albite chlorite calcite and dolomite showed comparable proportions in both rivers 3 3 differences in sediment characteristics between the lancang and nu rivers 3 3 1 differences in grain size distributions no dams are present in the nu river main stream or from rm to zp in the lancang river fig 4 a shows that the mean grain size was not significantly different and that the mean grain sizes fined systematically downstream in both rivers fig 2 c and d compared to those in the ffrs the grain sizes in the rrs of the lancang river changed discontinuously fig 4 b the mean grain sizes of the sediments from the reservoir sites were smaller than those from the downstream sites the sediments from the reservoir sites were highly concentrated and dominated by fine or medium silt while at the downstream sites the sediments suddenly coarsened to fine or medium sand fig 4 c 3 3 2 differences in mineral compositions the mineral compositions of the sediments were quite similar between the ffrs of the lancang and nu rivers and the sediments from both rivers were composed of minerals in the same order and presented slight longitudinal variations fig 4 d and e in contrast notable differences between the rrs and the ffrs in the lancang river in mineral compositions were observed as shown in fig 5 quartz and feldspar were prevalent in the ffrs with an average of 73 but fluctuated strongly in the rrs controlled by dams quartz and feldspar showed lower proportions in the reservoir sites with an average of 47 which are denoted by slashes in fig 5 than in the downstream sites that followed with an average of 71 as shown in table 3 at the opposite extreme the clay mineral proportions in the downstream sites were nearly half those in the reservoir sites which were 26 and 50 respectively the carbonate minerals calcite and dolomite both decreased to zero in the rrs and small amounts of pyrite 1 2 intermittently appeared in the rrs from u hd to u nzd because of the mining areas located north of the hd dam and northeast of the nzd dam zhao 1993 in the drs the proportions of quartz and feldspar increased to 61 and 14 respectively while illite and chlorite both decreased to 12 and these contents were comparable to those in the ffrs 54 19 9 and 10 respectively calcite was slightly replenished to 1 as shown in table 3 the alteration of the average proportion of each mineral in the drs compared to that in the ffrs was calculated and represented by influence in table 3 the results showed that quartz chlorite and illite were recharged by passing through the rrs which provided supplies of 13 33 and 20 of these minerals respectively feldspar calcite and dolomite were trapped in the cascade reservoirs which presented trapping efficiencies of 26 80 and 100 respectively for these minerals 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of cascade reservoirs on the sediment grain size distribution many previous studies have analyzed the spatial variations in bed surface grain size distribution along gravel and sand bed rivers morris williams 1999 the two common mechanisms that affect the grain size distribution are downstream fining trends attributable to abrasion and selective transport processes frings 2008 paola et al 1992 weltje prins 2007 and mixing of sediments from different sources such as tributary disturbances curtis et al 2010 rice church 1998 the sediments in the ffrs of the lancang river and in the nu river were well sorted and both fined systematically downstream due to current scouring because only gullies and no large tributaries were observed in the reaches of both rivers the mean grain size fined from medium sand to medium silt in the ffrs of the lancang river and from medium sand to fine sand in the nu river in this study the total length of the ffrs of the lancang river is approximately 400 km with a slop of 3 and a mean flow velocity of 1 m s the overall length of the nu river in this study is approximately 460 km with a slope of 1 93 and a mean flow velocity of 0 9 m s as sediment incipient motion is related to the channel slope and flow velocity blom et al 2016 qian and wan 2003 similar downstream fining trends were observed in these reaches however the grain size in the rrs of the lancang river fluctuated dramatically as the previous studies revealed reservoir impoundments may cut off the fining trend and cause downstream coarsening curtis et al 2010 graf 1980 the sediments from the reservoir sites were primarily fine silt or medium silt however at the downstream sites where we sampled only the fine particles the sediments suddenly coarsened to mostly fine sand or medium sand a prevalent theory is that relatively clear water selectively transports fine particles and incises channel beds to maintain the water sediment equilibrium dade et al 2011 fisrwg 2001 smith mohrig 2017 hard heavy and large particles are harder to transport and are observed in sediment starved reaches the sediment grain sizes between adjacent dams showed fining trends similar to the ffrsbecause high speed flow flushes bed materials downstream coarse particles are preferentially deposited paola et al 1992 especially in the backwater reaches where the flow velocity decreases sharply cahill 1981 tang et al 2018 furthermore tributary injection may change the grain size distribution especially in the regulated curtis et al 2010 in this study area there are more than 100 small hydropower stations in the nu river tributaries but none in the main stream and there is a significant downstream fining trend of grain size in the nu river in the regulated reaches of the lancang river high variality occurs for both grain size and mineral compositions and significat differences of mean grain sizes are observed between upstream and downstream of the cascade dams as shown in fig 4 c there s no big tributary but gullies between the hd and mv reservoirs and the xw and mw reservoirs there are significant fining trends of grain size therefore we conclude that the grain size variations in the rrs were dominated by reservoir trapping and were slightly affected by tributary injection the differences in the sediment grain sizes in the reservoir sites and those in the downstream sites were calculated as the changing degree table 4 as shown in fig 6 an approximate trend r2 0 49 f 7 73 p 0 032 was observed between the changing degree and the transformed values of the reservoir capacity a larger reservoir capacity corresponded to a stronger trapping effect by the dam and greater flushing power of the discharged flow which is one parameter included in the brune and siyam reservoir trapping efficiency models brune 1953 fu he 2007 4 2 impacts of cascade reservoirs on the sediment mineral compositions the mineral compositions of the sediments in the ffrs of the lancang river and in the nu river were similar and stable fig 4 d and e in contrast the mineral compositions varied greatly in the rrs of the lancang river fig 5 quartz and feldspar were dominant in the ffrs and downstream sites the proportions of clay minerals increased in the reservoir sites table 3 which is consistent with the results of other studies fonseca et al 2010 moreover the proportions of quartz chlorite and illite showed significant correlations with the sediment mean grain size especially in the rrs these correlations were related to the mineral crystal hardness density and particle size xu fangjian et al 2008 analyzed more than 500 sediment samples from the inner shelves of the east and south china seas and the grain sizes showed negative correlations with clay minerals but positive correlations with quartz and feldspar because of differences in the hardness density and particle size of mineral crystals coarse and fine sediments are often dominated by different minerals via hydrodynamic sorting jin 2011 illite chlorite and kaolinite have lower hardness and density and smaller size thus they are easier to transport by water flow while minerals with a greater hardness and density and larger size such as quartz and feldspar are easier to deposit on the riverbed jin 2011 these results are consistent with the sediment differentiation processes proposed by pustovalov л b пycтoвaлoв which stated that sediments would be deposited in order according to the particle size shape relative density mineral compositions and chemical composition during transport c i g 1978 shen et al 2010 tang et al 2018 zuo 2013 therefore the sediment grain size and mineral compositions showed jagged outlines due to the obstruction of cascade reservoirs similar to the effects of tributary injection on grain size distribution the mineral compositions changed slightly in longitudinal direction in the ru river with regulated tributaries while in the rrs with no big tributaries between the hd and mv reservoirs and the xw and mw reservoirs the mineral compositions changed strongly therefore we concluded that the mineral compositions changing in the rrs were affected by reservoir trapping sediments from tributaries mixed with the mainstream and fining with distance from the tails to the head areas of the next reservoirs and the mineral compositions consequently changed thus all of the bedload is trapped in the cascade reservoirs and a portion of the suspended load flows downstream in the drs the proportions of quartz feldspar illite and chlorite recovered to levels comparable to those in the ffrs calcite dolomite and pyrite were trapped in the rrs and dolomite and pyrite were not replenished within the river reaches in the study area as curtis et al 2010 noted the sediments coarsened due to a mixing of sediments from tributary source consequently minerals from the tributaries may also alter those in the main stream eberl 2004 quartz k feldspar albite illite chlorite and kaolinite were detected in the tributary sediments because quartz feldspar clay minerals and carbonate minerals originate from granite and carbonatite which are common in this region liu et al 2007 shan fa et al 2006 these minerals may be replenished in the reaches farther downstream however pyrite is transported by tributaries from mining areas in the lancang subbasin and thus may not recover 5 conclusions sediments are well known to be strongly affected by dams the results of this study demonstrated that the fine particles in addition to the boulders in the sediments from the lancang river were significantly influenced by the cascade reservoirs compared with the undammed nu river the sediment grain sizes were comparable and showed similar downstream fining trends along the nu river and in the ffrs of the lancang river no big triburtaries but gullies in these reaches and the mineral compositions were also similar and showed slight changes downstream in the two rivers which reflected the nature of the fluvial processes in the rrs of the lancang river the sediment grain sizes and mineral compositions fluctuated dramatically significant correlations were observed between the mean grain size and the quartz chlorite and illite contents and the mineral compositions showed synchronous changes with the grain sizes the sediments at the reservoir sites were fine silt or medium silt and clay minerals were prevalent however at the downstream sites the fine particles suddenly coarsened to mostly fine sand or medium sand and the quartz and feldspar contents increased regression analyses showed that a greater coarsening of the fine sediments corresponded to a larger reservoir capacity between two adjacent dams the sediments maintained the same downstream fining trend as in the ffrs and there was an increase in clay minerals each mineral was altered differently by passing through the rrs specifically the quartz chlorite and illite contents increased by 13 33 and 20 respectively the feldspar and calcite contents which were partially trapped by the cascade reservoirs decreased by 26 and 80 respectively and dolomite and pyrite were completely trapped by the cascade reservoirs quartz feldspar clay minerals and carbonate minerals are common minerals and may recover downstream however such recovery may not occur for pyrite which originates from mining areas these results indicate that the sediment mineral compositions were more similar to the local riverbed mineral compositions the fine particles of the sediment were strongly influenced by the cascade reservoirs and each mineral was distinctively altered based on its own physical characteristics and additional sources from tributaries the results of

5867,the lancang river and nu river are parallel rivers located in southwestern china while the lancang river has several dams the nu river has none to explore the impacts of cascade reservoirs on the grain size and mineral composition of fine sediments 9 fine sediment samples from the nu river and 29 samples from the lancang river were collected and tested the results indicate that in the free flowing reaches ffrs of the lancang river the sediment grain sizes fined systematically and the mineral compositions varied slightly and these results were similar to those of the nu river without dams along the whole mainstream in the regulated reaches rrs of the lancang river the sediment grain sizes and mineral compositions indicated discontinuous fluctuations due to the dams trapping in the reservoir head areas the sediments were composed of fine silt or medium silt with 50 clay minerals but the sediments immediately downstream of the dams were fine sand or medium sand with 71 quartz and feldspar the relative abundance of each mineral was altered differently by passing through the rrs quartz chlorite and illite increased by 13 33 and 20 respectively while feldspar and calcite decreased by 26 and 80 respectively and dolomite and pyrite were completely trapped in the cascade reservoirs all these common minerals may be replenished except pyrite which originates from mining

cascade reservoirs have attracted widespread attention from scholars and government administrators in the lancang mekong river basin in recent years bravard et al 2014 commission 2018 kakonen 2008 keskinen et al 2012 kummu varis 2007 li et al 2013 walling 2008a b dams and reservoirs interrupt and modify sediment flux and water discharge and change the flow regime which controls the form of channels grant 2012 topping et al 2007 venditti et al 2012 and impacts the ecology society and economy of the surrounding areas graf 2005 hauer et al 2016 sediments are the basic constituents of a river and commonly show a downstream fining trend morrison et al 1999 frings 2008 concluded that downstream fining processes fall into 3 categories abrasion selective transport and sediment addition extraction however the fining trend may be interrupted by tributary injection rice church 1998 and dam construction williams wolman 1984 dams are well known to trap water all of the bedload and a portion of the suspended load thereby causing siltation in reservoirs coarsening of downstream sediment and a reduction in the suspended load downstream curtis et al 2010 dade et al 2011 fu et al 2006 smith et al 1999 williams wolman 1984 xu 2005 the suspended sediment particle size is controlled by the bed material and flow velocity mazumder 1994 mazumder et al 2005 therefore the relative abundances of quartz feldspar and carbonate minerals increase in the reservoir tail area and decrease toward the head area li 2012 tang et al 2018 and the fine particles of clay minerals always predominate in the reservoir head area fonseca et al 2010 however below the dam relatively clear water is widely accepted to transport massive amounts of sediment and incise channel beds to maintain the water sediment equilibrium grant et al 2003 thus hard heavy and large particles are harder to transport therefore they appear in sediment starved reaches sediment grain size distributions are mainly changed in the fine particles sand silt and clay skalak et al 2009 the nutrients adsorbed on fine particles will also be trapped especially phosphorus muller et al 2007 which may lead to algal blooms in reservoir areas yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2013 and to reduction of primary productivity zhang et al 1999 and fish production fan et al 2015 nixon 2003 in downstream areas sediment characteristics are basic information for a basin and different minerals may play diverse roles in biogeochemical processes for example the permeability and adsorption capacity vary with the particle size and mineral compositions rusch et al 2001 six et al 2002 which then affect the organic mineralization rate rasheed et al 2003 and biodegradation rate of organic pollutants gong et al 2018 hwang cutright 2004 wang et al 2006 warr et al 2016 furthermore reduced fe and sulfides in pyrite can act as electron donors for the acid catalyzed destruction of no2 chemo denitrification thereby facilitating denitrification in the river postma et al 1991 seitzinger et al 2006 however the sediment characteristics especially the mineral compositions altered by cascade reservoirs are not well known at the watershed scale in the lancang river fu et al 2015 and whether all minerals are trapped synchronously and uniformly by dams or are influenced differently remains unclear the lancang subbasin within china is generally believed to contribute approximately 50 fu he 2007 to 65 kummu et al 2010 of the basin total sediment load and various values of the trapping efficiency of these cascade reservoirs have been reported fu he 2007 kummu et al 2010 liu et al 2013 walling 2008a b wang et al 2011 recently more studies focused on the cascade reservoir impacts to the environment fan et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2014 yi et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 however few reports have focused on the impacts of dams on the sediment characteristics therein especially the alteration of mineral compositions to compensate for the absence of detailed predam data the nu river was selected as a regional background reference the lancang river and nu river are located on the southwestern edge of china these rivers are divided by the nu mountains and run parallel for more than 170 km thereby constituting a unique wonder of the world wang 2006 however the development modes of the two rivers are different no dam has been constructed on the main stream of the nu river which is one of the world s last undammed and least studied rivers kibler tullos 2013 in contrast the lancang river is a typical regulated river with 8 dams within china and more dams are under construction in this study we focused on 1 the change in the grain size distribution and mineral compositions of the fine particles 2 mm in the free flowing reaches ffrs 2 the influence of cascade reservoirs on the grain size distribution and mineral compositions and 3 the recovery of the grain size distribution and mineral compositions in the downstream reaches drs the results of this study provide the subbasin wide spatial variations in basic sediment information for the lancang and nu rivers thereby supporting further biogeochemical research in this area 2 materials and methods 2 1 background the lancang river and nu river are both located in southwestern china to the east of the international border between china and myanmar fig 1 and are produced by the rapid drift of the indian tectonic plate toward the eurasian plate kumar et al 2007 the two rivers originate in the tanggula mountains on the qinghai tibetan plateau and follow the north south oriented x type hengduan mountains li 2008 zhao 1993 most mountain peaks on both sides of the rivers are covered with snow year round and are over 4000 m higher than the v shaped valleys he et al 2006 jia et al 2014 the upper regions of the two rivers are affected by the north plateau monsoon climate and the lower regions are affected by the southwest maritime monsoon climate the distribution of precipitation is controlled by the complex topography and the average annual precipitation of the studied reaches of these two rivers is 600 1700 mm xi 1988 the nu river is the headwater area of the international salween river within the border of china the studied river length is approximately 460 km from bingzhongluo bzl in the middle reach to bizhai bz at the river boundary section the runoff is controlled by rainfall in the study area li 2003 no dam has been constructed on the main stream while the tributaries have nearly 100 small dams kibler tullos 2013 the lancang river is the headwater area of the international mekong river within the borders of china the studied river length is approximately 1300 km from rumei rm in the middle reach to guanlei gl at the river boundary section within this study area the runoff above gongguoqiao ggq is supplied by a mix of rainfall snow meltwater and groundwater and the proportion provided by rainfall gradually increases downstream he 1995 precipitation dominates 60 the runoff below ggq to the boundary section and 57 of the precipitation occurs in summer he 1995 li li juan and

baijixun bjx jiale jl and zhongpai zp which are denoted by green points in fig 1 the sample sites from the nu river and the ffrs of the lancang river supplementary figs 1 and 2 were selected on relatively straight sections and separated by distances of 50 10 km according to the differences in their accessibility the 18 sample sites in the regulated reaches rrs of the lancang river include 8 reservoir sites in the reservoir head areas which are denoted by dark blue points 8 downstream sites approximately 5 km downstream of the dams which are denoted by yellow points and 2 sites at the riverine reaches of two adjacent dams which are denoted by green points in fig 1 these sites in order are as follows upstream of huangdeng u hd downstream of huangdeng d hd lamadeng lmd upstream of

in the drs are ganlanba glb and guanlei gl as shown by green points in fig 1 at each free flowing and downstream site two mixed grab samples of sand bed material beneath boulders were collected from submerged bar heads costigan et al 2014 which were considered high energy sites rice church 1998 furthermore we sampled in winter because these samples were assumed to reflect the channel sediment texture without the influence of floods all reservoir sites were selected within the 1 2 km frontier area of each dam where the reservoirs were deeper than 30 m and the sediment textures were more stable than in other areas of the reservoir tang et al 2018 the uppermost 20 cm of surface sediment was collected from the thalweg using a gravity corer uwitec austria the longitude latitude and elevation of each sample site were measured in the field by a handheld gps mobilemapper 20 spectra precision usa the velocities were measured by an acoustic doppler vector velocimeter adv nortek norway for each sediment sample hydrogen peroxide was added to remove organic matter the sediment sample was then washed with pure water all the air dried sediments were passed through a 2 mm sieve

composition was determined by an x ray diffraction analyzer x pert pro mpd panalytical holland 2 3 data analysis the particle size classification used in this study followed pearl 1978 from blott and pye 2001 the grain size parameters were calculated using the folk and ward 1957 formulae from blott and blott and pye 2001 the mean grain size was calculated as follows m g e x p ln d 16 ln d 50 ln d 84 3 to quantify the sediment mineral composition variations influenced by the cascade reservoirs the formula was set up as follows to assess the alteration of each mineral i i md i mn i mn i 100 where i represents the influence of the cascade reservoirs on minerals i represents each mineral mn represents the average relative content value of each mineral in the ffrs and md represents the average relative content in the drs if the result of i is positive the mineral is replenished while passing through the rrs in contrast if the result is negative the mineral is trapped by the cascade reservoirs 3 results 3 1 longitudinal variability in the sediment grain size distribution in the lancang and nu rivers fig 2 illustrates the longitudinal variability in sediment grain size in the lancang and nu rivers the grain size distributions of all 9 samples from the nu river and 21 of the 29 samples from the lancang river were unimodal the 8 bimodal samples were obtained from the reservoir sites and presented a minor secondary peak of fine or medium silt particles in an otherwise predominately fine sand sample since only the reservoir sites had small bimodal grain size distributions standard parameters such as the mean grain size sorting skewness and kurtosis were calculated the mean grain size of the sediments in the nu river varied from 0 539 mm to 0 111 mm with an average of 0 210 mm as shown in fig 2 b all the sediments were well sorted coarse skewed and leptokurtic in the lancang river the sediment grain size fined systematically downstream in the ffrs but fluctuated strongly in the rrs the mean grain size of the sediment in the ffrs varied from 0 458 mm to 0 012 mm with a mean of 0 176 mm in the rrs the mean grain size fluctuated strongly from 0 005 mm to 0 255 mm with an average of 0 068 mm as shown in fig 2 a smaller grain size values were observed at the reservoir sites as denoted in red in fig 2 a these sites consisted of mostly fine silt or medium silt with an average grain size of 0 016 mm larger values were observed at the downstream sites where the sediments were mostly fine sand or medium sand with an average grain size of 0 117 mm the mean grain sizes at glb and gl in the drs were 0 093 and 0 142 mm respectively with an average of 0 117 mm all the sediments were well sorted and the sediments at the reservoir sites were symmetrical or fine skewed and mesokurtic or platykurtic while the other sediment samples were coarse skewed or symmetrical and leptokurtic or mesokurtic fig 2 c and d show the sediment grain size distributions of d10 d50 and d90 from the ffrs of the lancang river and nu river there were significant downstream fining trends in d10 d50 and d90 in both rivers as shown in table 1 the slopes of the regressions were an order of magnitude steeper for d50 and d90 in the lancang river than in the nu river while the slopes for d10 were mostly the same in both rivers 3 2 longitudinal variability in the sediment mineral compositions in the lancang and nu rivers quartz k feldspar albite calcite dolomite tremolite chlorite illite kaolinite and pyrite were contained in the nu river sediments fig 3 b the content percentages of quartz k feldspar albite calcite dolomite tremolite chlorite and illite varied from 34 to 46 5 to 18 10 to 20 3 to 6 1 to 5 2 to 4 6 to 13 and 8 to 20 respectively in addition to the same minerals observed in the nu river kaolinite and pyrite were observed in the lancang river sediments fig 3 a the content percentages of quartz k feldspar albite calcite chlorite and illite varied from 41 to 68 2 to 10 10 to 18 2 to 8 3 to 14 and 7 to 13 respectively in the ffrs and from 20 to 65 0 to 26 4 to 23 0 to 9 4 to 25 and 9 to 52 respectively in the rrs several samples contained small amounts of dolomite tremolite and kaolinite regression analyses demonstrated significant correlations between the mean grain size and quartz r2 0 46 f 25 05 p 0 0001 chlorite r2 0 46 f 25 25 p 0 0001 and illite r2 0 51 f 29 73 p 0 0001 as shown in fig 3 c and table 2 quartz accounted for a greater percentage in the ffrs of the lancang river 54 than in the nu river 40 while k feldspar and illite were present in lower proportions in the ffrs of the lancang river 4 and 10 respectively than in the nu river 11 and 15 respectively albite chlorite calcite and dolomite showed comparable proportions in both rivers 3 3 differences in sediment characteristics between the lancang and nu rivers 3 3 1 differences in grain size distributions no dams are present in the nu river main stream or from rm to zp in the lancang river fig 4 a shows that the mean grain size was not significantly different and that the mean grain sizes fined systematically downstream in both rivers fig 2 c and d compared to those in the ffrs the grain sizes in the rrs of the lancang river changed discontinuously fig 4 b the mean grain sizes of the sediments from the reservoir sites were smaller than those from the downstream sites the sediments from the reservoir sites were highly concentrated and dominated by fine or medium silt while at the downstream sites the sediments suddenly coarsened to fine or medium sand fig 4 c 3 3 2 differences in mineral compositions the mineral compositions of the sediments were quite similar between the ffrs of the lancang and nu rivers and the sediments from both rivers were composed of minerals in the same order and presented slight longitudinal variations fig 4 d and e in contrast notable differences between the rrs and the ffrs in the lancang river in mineral compositions were observed as shown in fig 5 quartz and feldspar were prevalent in the ffrs with an average of 73 but fluctuated strongly in the rrs controlled by dams quartz and feldspar showed lower proportions in the reservoir sites with an average of 47 which are denoted by slashes in fig 5 than in the downstream sites that followed with an average of 71 as shown in table 3 at the opposite extreme the clay mineral proportions in the downstream sites were nearly half those in the reservoir sites which were 26 and 50 respectively the carbonate minerals calcite and dolomite both decreased to zero in the rrs and small amounts of pyrite 1 2 intermittently appeared in the rrs from u hd to u nzd because of the mining areas located north of the hd dam and northeast of the nzd dam zhao 1993 in the drs the proportions of quartz and feldspar increased to 61 and 14 respectively while illite and chlorite both decreased to 12 and these contents were comparable to those in the ffrs 54 19 9 and 10 respectively calcite was slightly replenished to 1 as shown in table 3 the alteration of the average proportion of each mineral in the drs compared to that in the ffrs was calculated and represented by influence in table 3 the results showed that quartz chlorite and illite were recharged by passing through the rrs which provided supplies of 13 33 and 20 of these minerals respectively feldspar calcite and dolomite were trapped in the cascade reservoirs which presented trapping efficiencies of 26 80 and 100 respectively for these minerals 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of cascade reservoirs on the sediment grain size distribution many previous studies have analyzed the spatial variations in bed surface grain size distribution along gravel and sand bed rivers morris williams 1999 the two common mechanisms that affect the grain size distribution are downstream fining trends attributable to abrasion and selective transport processes frings 2008 paola et al 1992 weltje prins 2007 and mixing of sediments from different sources such as tributary disturbances curtis et al 2010 rice church 1998 the sediments in the ffrs of the lancang river and in the nu river were well sorted and both fined systematically downstream due to current scouring because only gullies and no large tributaries were observed in the reaches of both rivers the mean grain size fined from medium sand to medium silt in the ffrs of the lancang river and from medium sand to fine sand in the nu river in this study the total length of the ffrs of the lancang river is approximately 400 km with a slop of 3 and a mean flow velocity of 1 m s the overall length of the nu river in this study is approximately 460 km with a slope of 1 93 and a mean flow velocity of 0 9 m s as sediment incipient motion is related to the channel slope and flow velocity blom et al 2016 qian and wan 2003 similar downstream fining trends were observed in these reaches however the grain size in the rrs of the lancang river fluctuated dramatically as the previous studies revealed reservoir impoundments may cut off the fining trend and cause downstream coarsening curtis et al 2010 graf 1980 the sediments from the reservoir sites were primarily fine silt or medium silt however at the downstream sites where we sampled only the fine particles the sediments suddenly coarsened to mostly fine sand or medium sand a prevalent theory is that relatively clear water selectively transports fine particles and incises channel beds to maintain the water sediment equilibrium dade et al 2011 fisrwg 2001 smith mohrig 2017 hard heavy and large particles are harder to transport and are observed in sediment starved reaches the sediment grain sizes between adjacent dams showed fining trends similar to the ffrsbecause high speed flow flushes bed materials downstream coarse particles are preferentially deposited paola et al 1992 especially in the backwater reaches where the flow velocity decreases sharply cahill 1981 tang et al 2018 furthermore tributary injection may change the grain size distribution especially in the regulated curtis et al 2010 in this study area there are more than 100 small hydropower stations in the nu river tributaries but none in the main stream and there is a significant downstream fining trend of grain size in the nu river in the regulated reaches of the lancang river high variality occurs for both grain size and mineral compositions and significat differences of mean grain sizes are observed between upstream and downstream of the cascade dams as shown in fig 4 c there s no big tributary but gullies between the hd and mv reservoirs and the xw and mw reservoirs there are significant fining trends of grain size therefore we conclude that the grain size variations in the rrs were dominated by reservoir trapping and were slightly affected by tributary injection the differences in the sediment grain sizes in the reservoir sites and those in the downstream sites were calculated as the changing degree table 4 as shown in fig 6 an approximate trend r2 0 49 f 7 73 p 0 032 was observed between the changing degree and the transformed values of the reservoir capacity a larger reservoir capacity corresponded to a stronger trapping effect by the dam and greater flushing power of the discharged flow which is one parameter included in the brune and siyam reservoir trapping efficiency models brune 1953 fu he 2007 4 2 impacts of cascade reservoirs on the sediment mineral compositions the mineral compositions of the sediments in the ffrs of the lancang river and in the nu river were similar and stable fig 4 d and e in contrast the mineral compositions varied greatly in the rrs of the lancang river fig 5 quartz and feldspar were dominant in the ffrs and downstream sites the proportions of clay minerals increased in the reservoir sites table 3 which is consistent with the results of other studies fonseca et al 2010 moreover the proportions of quartz chlorite and illite showed significant correlations with the sediment mean grain size especially in the rrs these correlations were related to the mineral crystal hardness density and particle size xu fangjian et al 2008 analyzed more than 500 sediment samples from the inner shelves of the east and south china seas and the grain sizes showed negative correlations with clay minerals but positive correlations with quartz and feldspar because of differences in the hardness density and particle size of mineral crystals coarse and fine sediments are often dominated by different minerals via hydrodynamic sorting jin 2011 illite chlorite and kaolinite have lower hardness and density and smaller size thus they are easier to transport by water flow while minerals with a greater hardness and density and larger size such as quartz and feldspar are easier to deposit on the riverbed jin 2011 these results are consistent with the sediment differentiation processes proposed by pustovalov л b пycтoвaлoв which stated that sediments would be deposited in order according to the particle size shape relative density mineral compositions and chemical composition during transport c i g 1978 shen et al 2010 tang et al 2018 zuo 2013 therefore the sediment grain size and mineral compositions showed jagged outlines due to the obstruction of cascade reservoirs similar to the effects of tributary injection on grain size distribution the mineral compositions changed slightly in longitudinal direction in the ru river with regulated tributaries while in the rrs with no big tributaries between the hd and mv reservoirs and the xw and mw reservoirs the mineral compositions changed strongly therefore we concluded that the mineral compositions changing in the rrs were affected by reservoir trapping sediments from tributaries mixed with the mainstream and fining with distance from the tails to the head areas of the next reservoirs and the mineral compositions consequently changed thus all of the bedload is trapped in the cascade reservoirs and a portion of the suspended load flows downstream in the drs the proportions of quartz feldspar illite and chlorite recovered to levels comparable to those in the ffrs calcite dolomite and pyrite were trapped in the rrs and dolomite and pyrite were not replenished within the river reaches in the study area as curtis et al 2010 noted the sediments coarsened due to a mixing of sediments from tributary source consequently minerals from the tributaries may also alter those in the main stream eberl 2004 quartz k feldspar albite illite chlorite and kaolinite were detected in the tributary sediments because quartz feldspar clay minerals and carbonate minerals originate from granite and carbonatite which are common in this region liu et al 2007 shan fa et al 2006 these minerals may be replenished in the reaches farther downstream however pyrite is transported by tributaries from mining areas in the lancang subbasin and thus may not recover 5 conclusions sediments are well known to be strongly affected by dams the results of this study demonstrated that the fine particles in addition to the boulders in the sediments from the lancang river were significantly influenced by the cascade reservoirs compared with the undammed nu river the sediment grain sizes were comparable and showed similar downstream fining trends along the nu river and in the ffrs of the lancang river no big triburtaries but gullies in these reaches and the mineral compositions were also similar and showed slight changes downstream in the two rivers which reflected the nature of the fluvial processes in the rrs of the lancang river the sediment grain sizes and mineral compositions fluctuated dramatically significant correlations were observed between the mean grain size and the quartz chlorite and illite contents and the mineral compositions showed synchronous changes with the grain sizes the sediments at the reservoir sites were fine silt or medium silt and clay minerals were prevalent however at the downstream sites the fine particles suddenly coarsened to mostly fine sand or medium sand and the quartz and feldspar contents increased regression analyses showed that a greater coarsening of the fine sediments corresponded to a larger reservoir capacity between two adjacent dams the sediments maintained the same downstream fining trend as in the ffrs and there was an increase in clay minerals each mineral was altered differently by passing through the rrs specifically the quartz chlorite and illite contents increased by 13 33 and 20 respectively the feldspar and calcite contents which were partially trapped by the cascade reservoirs decreased by 26 and 80 respectively and dolomite and pyrite were completely trapped by the cascade reservoirs quartz feldspar clay minerals and carbonate minerals are common minerals and may recover downstream however such recovery may not occur for pyrite which originates from mining areas these results indicate that the sediment mineral compositions were more similar to the local riverbed mineral compositions the fine particles of the sediment were strongly influenced by the cascade reservoirs and each mineral was distinctively altered based on its own physical characteristics and additional sources from tributaries the results of this study provide basic sediment information on the nu river and lancang river which can be a reference for future studies about cascade reservoirs impacts on ecosystem changes declaration of

5868,non darcy flow due to pumping may occur at the well screen and yields some head loss unlike the wellbore skin yielding a constant head loss at the well the studies in petroleum engineering indicate that the head loss due to the non darcy flow is proportional to the pumping rate the head loss due to non darcy flow is quantified by a rate dependent factor at the well screen to our knowledge such a head loss is never considered in the area of groundwater hydraulics in light of this this study develops a groundwater flow model for the constant head pumping with a head loss expressed in terms of a rate dependent factor at a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer a skin factor representing the head loss due to the presence of wellbore skin is also incorporated into the model the consideration of the rate dependent factor however would make the model nonlinear the model has a steady state flow equation with a time dependent finite outer boundary to approximate the transient groundwater flow in the aquifer system the solutions to the model for the drawdown and wellbore flowrate are developed and compared with the finite difference solutions with the help of the present solutions the sensitivity analyses of the aquifer drawdown and wellbore flowrate are made the effects of the wellbore skin and non darcy flow on the drawdown are also investigated the wellbore flowrate solution is then applied to estimate the aquifer parameters based on the field data from a constant head injection test in a confined aquifer the prediction of the present solution gives the best fit to the field measured data as compared with three existing solutions indicating that the consideration of the rate dependent factor improves the aquifer parameter estimation the

introduction the test for constant head pumping chp is commonly performed to estimate the aquifer parameters i e hydraulic conductivity and specific storage for low permeability aquifers in engineering practices the method of chp can avoid over dewatering problems in a shallow aquifer hiller and levy 1994 or overdrawing the pumping well in low permeability formations jones 1993 ciftci 2018 the chp is usually carried out by maintaining a constant water level or drawdown in the test well and the wellbore flowrate and the drawdown at the observation well are recorded continuously and simultaneously the aquifer parameters can then be determined by a type curve match approach or by an analytical drawdown model coupled with an optimization method to analyze the recorded data in the past many studies addressed the issue involved the chp at the aquifer with various configurations for instance jacob and lohman 1952 firstly presented a formula in analogy to smith s 1937 work for heat conduction to describe the wellbore flowrate due to chp in a confined aquifer hantush 1964 obtained a drawdown solution for the chp in confined and leaky aquifer systems later mishra and guyonnet 1992 employed the boltzmann transform to obtain approximate solutions for both wellbore flowrate and drawdown in a confined aquifer a problem similar to the chp was also explored in the field of electrochemistry which has the same mathematical formulation expressed in terms of a radial diffusion equation fang et al 2009 proposed an approximate solution for chronoamperometric current at a microcylinder electrode they solved the model from a steady state diffusion equation with a finite outer boundary represented by a time dependent function called the diffusion boundary layer in analogy with fang et al s 2009 work yang et al 2014 proposed a solution for the chp by coupling two steady state flow equations to describe the hydraulic head distribution in a confined aquifer in their model an averaging hydraulic head along the screened part and zero flux along the unscreened part are specified as the inner boundary condition and a time dependent function in analogy to fang et al s 2009 work is employed as the outer boundary condition a region around the wellbore having different hydraulic properties from the aquifer may be presented due to the well drilling development and or completion the region known as wellbore skin would lead to a head loss during the pumping the wellbore skin sometimes can be depicted as a zone with a finite thickness near the pumping well barker and herbert 1982 novakowski 1989 yang and yeh 2005 barua and bora 2010 lin et al 2016 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the properties of the wellbore skin are commonly lumped as a parameter called skin factor and included in the inner boundary condition many studies have been devoted to the model incorporating the skin factor for estimating the aquifer parameters subject to the constant rate pumping crp e g van everdingen and hurst 1949 van everdingen 1953 hawkins 1956 agarwal et al 1970 moench 1997 chen and chang 2006 slug test e g moench and hsien 1985 and chp e g cassiani et al 1999 chang and chen 2003 lin et al 2017 van everdingen and hurst 1949 indicated that the darcian model usually leads to an underestimate of the pressure at the well he therefore proposed a term with a skin factor in the model to reflect such a pressure drop hawkins 1956 introduced a skin factor in terms of the hydraulic conductivity ratio and thickness ratio of the formation zone to the skin zone to represent the skin effect hurst et al 1969 derived a wellbore flowrate solution for a flowing well problem by adding a skin factor at the inner boundary in a manner similar to that described by van everdingen and hurst 1949 moench 1997 developed a skin factor model for the crp at a finite radius well in an unconfined aquifer he assumed that the water flux across the pumping well is equal to the difference between the averaged hydraulic head within the wellbore and the averaged head in the skin divided by the skin thickness chen and chang 2006 explored the problem regarding the effect of non uniform skin zone on the groundwater flow due to crp in confined aquifers chen and chang 2002 conducted two constant head injection tests and analyzed the measured cumulative volume data of both tests using a large time solution developed with a skin factor accounting for the skin effect in petroleum engineering the skin factor determined from a build up test or pressure drawdown test commonly display a linear relation with the pumping rate e g smith 1961 ramey 1965 meehan and schell 1983 gunaydin et al 2007 gringarten et al 2011 beidokhti et al 2011 mohamed et al 2016 al rbeawi 2016 such a rate dependent effect may be attributed to the problem of non darcy flow at the well screen smith 1961 to reflect this effect ramey 1965 firstly introduced a rate dependent factor expressed as a product of a non darcy flow constant and the wellbore flowrate further ramey 1982 demonstrated that combining van everdingen and hurst s 1949 skin factor solution and the rate dependent factor has an equivalent form to the well loss equation proposed by jacob 1946 beidokhti et al 2011 derived the rate dependent factor from the forchheimer equation the result shows a similar form to ramey s 1965 one the factor is widely applied to pressure models in petroleum engineering contrarily the use of this factor for non darcy flow at the well screen is overlooked in the field of groundwater hydraulics instead the forchheimer and izbash laws commonly used in the groundwater area are applied along with the conservation of mass to develop the groundwater flow equation see e g mathias et al 2008 wen et al 2013 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2017 those approaches implying the flow in the entire aquifer system under the non darcy flow condition may not be suitable to depict the pump induced flow because the flow at a farther distance from the pumping well usually complies with the darcy law commonly the water from the aquifer formation flowing through the gravel pack and wellbore screen is under non darcian condition shekhar 2006 mentioned that the flow near the well screen has the turbulence nature even when the water is pumped with a rate lower than a critical limit to avoid the turbulent flow hence the non darcy flow effect may play a role influencing the groundwater flow near the wellbore motivated by this problem the objective of this article is to develop a groundwater flow model with considering the non darcy flow effect at the inner boundary for the chp problems the use of rate dependent factor for the non darcy flow effect however would result in a nonlinear model which cannot be solved by the integral transform method notice that the approach proposed by yang et al 2014 and fang et al 2009 for the time dependent outer boundary can solve the present model without using the integral transform method we herein propose a transient flow model for chp at a fully penetrating well composed of a steady state flow equation with an inner boundary condition having skin and rate dependent factors and a time dependent outer boundary condition under zero drawdown the drawdown solution to the model is verified by comparing with the finite difference solutions then the present solution is used to examine the effects of the wellbore skin and non darcy flow on the drawdown distribution further we perform the sensitivity analysis to explore the aquifer drawdown and wellbore flowrate behavior in response to the change in each of the hydraulic parameters finally the present solution coupled with the least squares approach is used to determine the aquifer parameters when analyzing the recorded data obtained from a constant head injection test reported in the article of chen and chang 2002 the quality of the well installation for these two test wells is also discussed based on the results of the parameter estimation 2 method 2 1 model description fig 1 shows a schematic representation for the conceptual model depicting the aquifer drawdown distribution s r t l induced by a chp at a fully penetrating well in confined aquifers the variable r l represents the radial direction and t t denotes the operating time the well has a radius r w l and a constant drawdown s w l the origin of the cylindrical coordinates is set at the center of the test well the aquifer has the transmissivity denoted as t l2 t the water extracted by the chp is assumed instantaneously from the storativity s of the aquifer the groundwater flow equation describing the drawdown distribution in an aquifer can be expressed as 1 t 1 r r r s r s s t the initial condition is 2 s 0 t 0 the head loss at the interface between the aquifer and the wellbore may be expressed as 3a s r w s e s r s w r r w where s e is called the effective skin factor the first term on the left hand side lhs of eq 3a represents the aquifer drawdown the second lhs term denotes as the additional head loss generated around the well screen and the term on the right hand side is the wellbore drawdown according to ramey s 1965 work s e can be further defined as s f d q in which s f is a skin factor due to the drilling damage adjacent to the wellbore and dq represents a rate dependent factor due to the non darcy flow effect at the well screen with a constant d t l3 and wellbore flowrate q l3 t the variable q is equal to 2 π r w t s r at r r w thus eq 3a can be written as 3b s r w s f 2 π r w t d s r s r s w r r w if the non darcy effect is negligible i e d 0 eq 3b reduces to 3c s r w s f s r s w r r w which is commonly adopted in the existing groundwater models for the chp problems e g chen and chang 2003 2006 lin et al 2017 the outer boundary condition can be written as 4 s 0 r 2 2 similarity to well loss function jacob 1946 proposed a well loss formula for describing the wellbore drawdown for the step drawdown test he gave 5a bq c q 2 s w r r w where b t l2 and c t2 l5 are linear and nonlinear well loss coefficients respectively kruseman and de ridder 1994 defined that b is the sum of linear aquifer loss coefficient b 1 t l2 and linear well loss coefficient b 2 t l2 the coefficient b 1 is to reflect the aquifer head loss due to pumping and b 1 q is the aquifer drawdown s the coefficient b 2 is to represent the linear head loss due to the flow across the residual mud gravel pack and or the screen entrance and the coefficient c is to denote the nonlinear loss due to the turbulent flow at the well screen thus eq 5a can be arranged as 5b s b 2 q c q 2 s w r r w substituting q 2 π r w t s r into eq 5b yields 5c s r w 2 π t b 2 4 π 2 t 2 r w c s r s r s w r r w comparing eq 3b with eq 5c the relations of parameters in both equations can be found as 6a s f 2 π t b 2 and 6b d 2 π t c these findings have been pointed out by ramey 1982 2 3 dimensionless equations the use of the dimensionless parameters can reduce the number of variables in the system for the analysis herein we define the dimensionless parameters as 7 s d s s w r d r r w r s d r s r w t d t t s r w 2 q d q 2 π s w t d 2 π s w t d the dimensionless form for eq 1 can be written as 8 1 r d r d r d s d r d s d t d the dimensionless initial condition is 9 s d 0 t d 0 the dimensionless inner boundary condition eqs 3b is 10 s d s f d s d r d s d r d 1 r d 1 the outer boundary condition eq 4 in a dimensionless form is 11 s d 0 r d 2 4 steady state model with time dependent outer boundary it should be noted that eq 10 is nonlinear such that the model cannot be solved by using the method of integral transforms alternatively we adopt the approach of yang et al 2014 by defining a steady state dimensionless flow equation as 12 1 r d d d r d r d d s d d r d 0 furthermore eq 11 is replaced by a transient boundary condition specified at a finite distance from the pumping well as 13 s d 0 r d r d where r d is defined as 1 π t d yang et al 2014 notice that the initial condition of eq 9 becomes redundant in solving eq 12 eq 12 can be written as 14 d 2 s d d r d 2 1 r d d s d d r d 0 it has a general solution denoted as 15 s d a 1 a 2 l n r d where a 1 and a 2 are undetermined coefficients and l n is the natural logarithm with the boundary conditions eqs 10 and 13 the coefficients can be determined as 16a a 1 ln r d s f 4 d ln r d s f 2 2 d ln r d and 16b a 2 ln r d s f 4 d ln r d s f 2 2 d substituting eqs 16a and 16b into 15 the dimensionless aquifer drawdown solution is then obtained as 17 s d ln r d s f 4 d ln r d s f 2 2 d ln r d r d the symbol indicates that there are two solutions to the model to ensure eq 17 having a positive value eq 17 should be 18 s d ln r d s f 4 d ln r d s f 2 2 d ln r d r d the dimensionless wellbore flowrate is obtained by applying darcy s law as 19 q d s f ln r d 4 d ln r d s f 2 2 d 2 5 special cases if the skin factor s f is negligible eqs 18 and 19 can be respectively reduced to 20 s d ln r d 4 d ln r d 2 2 d ln r d r d and 21 q d ln r d 4 d ln r d 2 2 d if d 0 eq 18 reduces to 22 s d ln r d r d ln r d s f and eq 19 becomes 23 q d 1 ln r d s f moreover if the effective skin factor exerts an insignificant effect on the flow system eqs 18 and 19 may be respectively simplified as 24 s d ln r d r d ln r d and 25 q d 1 ln r d note that eqs 24 and 25 are the same as the equations given in yang et al 2014 eqs 35 and 36 3 results and discussion consider a chp conducted in a confined aquifer with the following parameter values r w 0 05 m s w 10 m t 1 10 3 m2 min s 1 10 5 s f 1 and d 50 min m3 the following sections are analyzed based on these values 3 1 verification of present solution to verify the present aquifer drawdown solution an implicit finite difference solution is developed based on the transient groundwater model composed of eqs 8 10 using the mathematica function ndsolve the remote boundary condition for the finite difference model is set at r d 10 5 the grid size in radial direction is discretized as unit and the time increment is also unit fig 2 displays a temporal and b spatial dimensionless aquifer drawdown curves predicted by the present solution and finite difference solution when d equals 0 1 1 and 10 with s f 1 ramey 1965 mentioned that the non darcy flow profoundly affects the flow near the wellbore at the early time thus r d is set as one at the screen in fig 2 a and t d is 100 3 s in fig 2 b to emphasize its effect fig 2 a indicates that the curves predicted by the present solution gives a fairly good match with the finite difference solution within t d 5 10 7 around 21 h fig 2 b demonstrates that the present solution gives good aquifer drawdown predictions except at the observation point close to the time dependent outer boundary i e 1 π t d overall the results indicate that the present solution is well developed 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a useful tool to examine the influence of each aquifer parameter on the aquifer drawdown or wellbore flowrate the normalized sensitivity defined by liou and yeh 1997 gives 26 x k p k o p k where x k is the normalized sensitivity of the output o the aquifer drawdown or wellbore flowrate to the k th input parameter p k eq 26 can then be approximated by the forward finite difference formula as 27 x k p k o p k δ p k o p k δ p k where δ p k is set to 10 3 p k yeh and han 1989 fig 3 demonstrates the temporal normalized sensitivity curves for a the aquifer drawdown s observed at r r w and b the wellbore flowrate q note that the positive value of the normalized sensitivity indicates the increment of the specific parameter leading to an increase in s or q at a given time on the other hand the negative value of that implies that the increasing parameter value would result in a decrease in s or q fig 3 a indicates that s is the most sensitive parameter before the pumping time at 30 sec according to the absolute value of the normalized sensitivity after that time s f has the largest influence on the aquifer drawdown followed by t and d this is contrary to our expectation that t should be the most sensitive parameter the reason may be that the non darcy flow effect which delays the water flow propagation reduces the influence of the parameter t on the aquifer drawdown one can observe that t and s decreasingly affect the aquifer drawdown when operating time elapses however s f and d constantly exert certain effects on the aquifer drawdown with increasing time fig 3 b shows that t has the largest sensitivity values fallowed by s f s and d for the case of q this result is different from that given in fig 3 a because the wellbore flowrate is mainly dependent on t i e q 2 π r w t s r notably s and d are relatively insensitive parameters compared with others but they still produce some effects on the wellbore flowrate judged from these results the parameters appear to have varying degrees of influence on the aquifer drawdown and wellbore flowrate therefore analyzing the data set from the aquifer drawdown or wellbore flowrate would reveal different impacts of the aquifer parameters 3 3 effect of skin factor and rate dependent factor in eq 10 the head loss due to wellbore skin is described by s f s d r d while that due to the non darcy flow effect at the well screen is represented by d s d r d 2 obviously the head loss at the well increases as the coefficient s f or d increases fig 4 shows the temporal dimensionless aquifer drawdown curves for a s f varying from 0 01 to 100 with d 1 and b d from 0 01 to 100 with s f 1 observed at the rim of wellbore i e r d 1 the figure shows that the aquifer drawdown curves decrease with increasing s f and d because more head loss occurs at the well screen the aquifer drawdown is sensitive to the change in s f than in d because the loss value due to d s d r d 2 yields a smaller value than that due to s f s d r d it helps account for the outcome of the sensitivity analysis in the previous section that why the parameter d always yields a smaller impact than s f additionally the aquifer drawdown curves for d 0 01 and 0 1 almost coincide with each other indicating that d exerts an insignificant effect on the aquifer drawdown when its value is less than 0 1 3 4 field data analyses chen and chang 2002 conducted two constant head injection tests one was at well 2 referred to as the chit1 in their study and the other at well 5 chit2 both wells have a 0 05 m radius and fully penetrate a silty sand confined aquifer of 10 m thickness at taoyuan tableland in the northern part of taiwan the test at the chit1 ran 58 h with the s w kept at 10 1 m while the chit2 ran 67 h with s w maintained at 13 48 m they measured the cumulative volume in the injection well for parameter estimations the formula they used to estimate the parameters is 28 s w t v w 0 183 t log 0 83 t t s r w 2 s f 2 π t where v w is the cumulative volume defined as 0 t q x d x which can be easily evaluated by a numerical integral function in mathematica called nintegrate wolfram research inc 2018 the aquifer parameters were estimated by graphically fitting the measured data in a semi log plot of s w t v w versus time chen and chang 2002 pointed out that the measured data displayed two different portions in early time and late time periods one can expect that the late time portion can reflect the feature of the flow behavior in the formation zone and the well losses therefore the data points from the chit1 and chit2 after around 100 min were used to analyze for the aquifer parameters they firstly determined the value of t as 1 68 10 3 m2 min by fitting the late time data from the chit1 and chit2 later they determined the value of s as 2 52 10 4 by assuming the absent of the wellbore skin in the chit2 with the obtained t and s the skin factor s f was finally determined as 18 57 for the chit1 their results of the parameter estimation are listed in table 1 following their work the s w t v w data of chit1 and chit2 after 100 min were read from chen and chang 2002 fig 4 by using webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2018 we analyze these data using three different approaches the first approach is to use jacob and lohman s 1952 solution in which both skin factor and rate dependent factor are not considered the second one is to employ hurst et al s 1969 solution in which only the skin factor is considered while the third is the present solution each of three solutions is coupled with the least squares approach and solved by the levenberg marquardt algorithm in mathematica routine nonlinearmodelfit wolfram research inc 2018 for the parameter estimation two statistics are chosen to assess the goodness of fit for different solutions with the estimated parameters they are standard error of estimate see and mean error me defined in yeh 1987 and respectively expressed as 29a see 1 ν i 1 n e i 2 and 29b me 1 n i 1 n e i where ν is the degree of freedom defined as the number of observed data n minus the number of unknown parameters m i e ν n m and e i is the i th prediction error between the predicted s w t v w and observed data the estimated results by three different solutions are also listed in table 1 according to the estimated results of the chit1 the values of t are obtained as 1 04 10 3 m2 min 1 62 10 3 m2 min and 1 61 10 3 m2 min by jacob and lohman s 1952 hurst et al s 1969 and present solutions respectively the estimate of t obtained from the first solution has the smallest value compared to the others that obtained from the second and the present solutions are rather close to that determined by chen and chang 2002 the first solution however gives the estimated s unrealistically small it may be attributed to the fact that the skin effect was not considered in jacob and lohman s 1952 model additionally the estimated values of s by the second and present solutions are larger than that by chen and chang 2002 about an order of magnitude the reason for that is chen and chang 2002 determined its value by analyzing the data set from the chit2 based on the see and me values shown in table 1 we consider that the value of s estimated by chen and chang 2002 cannot represent the estimated result from the chit1 the s f values estimated by hurst et al s 1969 and present solutions confirms that the wellbore has a positive skin as indicated by chen and chang 2002 table 1 indicates that the present solution yields the smallest see and me values indicating that the consideration of both skin factor and rate dependent factor gives the best fit to the data set of chit1 the estimated results for data from chit2 indicate that those three solutions give the same estimates of t i e 1 64 10 3 m2 min which are not far from chen and chang s 2002 estimation the values of s estimated by all solutions are on the same order of magnitude besides the estimates of s f obtained by hurst et al s 1969 and present solutions and that of d obtained by the present solution are smaller than those obtained from the chit1 both effects of wellbore skin and non darcy flow are insignificant for data in the chit2 it is consistent with chen and chang s 2002 statement that there are little or no wellbore skin existing around the well 5 fig 5 shows the measured data of a chit1 and b chit2 and the temporal curves of s w t v w predicted by three solutions with the parameters listed in table 1 it demonstrates that the curve predicted by the present solution matches well with the measured data while those by the other solutions show some significant departure from the measured data especially for the chit1 it implies that the consideration of the rate dependent factor improves the parameter estimation if non darcy flow effect is profound 3 5 performance of test wells kurtulus et al 2019 proposed a well efficiency criterion by analyzing the data of step drawdown test from 290 wells coupled with rorabaugh s 1953 well loss function notice that rorabaugh s 1953 well loss function can be viewed as a modified version of jacob s 1946 one that is 30 bq c q k s w r r w in which k is the exponent parameter equal to 2 in this study kurtulus et al 2019 table 3 summarized the following that the well is in the deteriorating condition when c 1800 s2 m5 or 0 5 min2 m5 for k within 1 and 2 employing the estimated results we obtain that c equals 1163 51 min2 m5 for well 2 and 0 97 min2 m5 for well 5 these values indicate that both test wells were not properly designed or developed it may be explained why the measured data from the chit1 and chit2 are merely capable of reflecting the feature of the flow behavior in the aquifer formation after the operating time up to 100 min 1 67 h 4 concluding remarks this study presents a new mathematical model with considering both skin factor and rate dependent factor at the pumping well for describing aquifer drawdown distribution and wellbore flowrate induced by a chp at a fully penetrating well in confined aquifers the inner boundary condition is nonlinear due to the consideration of the rate dependent factor in light of this we adopt the work of yang et al 2014 to formula the model comprised of a steady state groundwater flow equation with a time dependent finite outer boundary the solutions to the model for the wellbore flowrate and the drawdown can then be derived the comparison of the aquifer drawdown predicted by the present and finite difference solutions indicates that the present solution is well developed the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that s is the most sensitive parameter to the aquifer drawdown before the pumping time of 30 sec while t is the most sensitive parameter for the wellbore flowrate the non darcy flow constant d exerts relatively small effect on both aquifer drawdown and wellbore flowrate as compared to other aquifer parameters an increase in the skin factor or rate dependent factor has the effect of decreasing the drawdown and the flowrate values because the head losses are generated the present solution is used to estimate the aquifer parameters when analyzing a measured data set from a field constant head injection test the results show that the present solution used in the parameter estimation gives the best estimated results compared with those estimated by jacob and lohman solution 1952 and hurst et al 1969 solution as well as that determined by chen and chang 2002 according to these results the consideration of the rate dependent factor improves the parameter estimation also the results of the parameter estimation indicate that the test wells in chen and chang s 2002 work may be not properly installed or developed overall the present solutions can be used as a convenient tool to estimate the aquifer parameters and predict the aquifer drawdown and flowrate distributions credit authorship contribution

5868,non darcy flow due to pumping may occur at the well screen and yields some head loss unlike the wellbore skin yielding a constant head loss at the well the studies in petroleum engineering indicate that the head loss due to the non darcy flow is proportional to the pumping rate the head loss due to non darcy flow is quantified by a rate dependent factor at the well screen to our knowledge such a head loss is never considered in the area of groundwater hydraulics in light of this this study develops a groundwater flow model for the constant head pumping with a head loss expressed in terms of a rate dependent factor at a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer a skin factor representing the head loss due to the presence of wellbore skin is also incorporated into the model the consideration of the rate dependent factor however would make the model nonlinear the model has a steady state flow equation with a time dependent finite outer boundary to approximate the transient groundwater flow in the aquifer system the solutions to the model for the drawdown and wellbore flowrate are developed and compared with the finite difference solutions with the help of the present solutions the sensitivity analyses of the aquifer drawdown and wellbore flowrate are made the effects of the wellbore skin and non darcy flow on the drawdown are also investigated the wellbore flowrate solution is then applied to estimate the aquifer parameters based on the field data from a constant head injection test in a confined aquifer the prediction of the present solution gives the best fit to the field measured data as compared with three existing solutions indicating that the consideration of the rate dependent factor improves the aquifer parameter estimation the

introduction the test for constant head pumping chp is commonly performed to estimate the aquifer parameters i e hydraulic conductivity and specific storage for low permeability aquifers in engineering practices the method of chp can avoid over dewatering problems in a shallow aquifer hiller and levy 1994 or overdrawing the pumping well in low permeability formations jones 1993 ciftci 2018 the chp is usually carried out by maintaining a constant water level or drawdown in the test well and the wellbore flowrate and the drawdown at the observation well are recorded continuously and simultaneously the aquifer parameters can then be determined by a type curve match approach or by an analytical drawdown model coupled with an optimization method to analyze the recorded data in the past many studies addressed the issue involved the chp at the aquifer with various configurations for instance jacob and lohman 1952 firstly presented a formula in analogy to smith s 1937 work for heat conduction to describe the wellbore flowrate due to chp in a confined aquifer hantush 1964 obtained a drawdown solution for the chp in confined and leaky aquifer systems later mishra and guyonnet 1992 employed the boltzmann transform to obtain approximate solutions for both wellbore flowrate and drawdown in a confined aquifer a problem similar to the chp was also explored in the field of electrochemistry which has the same mathematical formulation expressed in terms of a radial diffusion equation fang et al 2009 proposed an approximate solution for chronoamperometric current at a microcylinder electrode they solved the model from a steady state diffusion equation with a finite outer boundary represented by a time dependent function called the diffusion boundary layer in analogy with fang et al s 2009 work yang et al 2014 proposed a solution for the chp by coupling two steady state flow equations to describe the hydraulic head distribution in a confined aquifer in their model an averaging hydraulic head along the screened part and zero flux along the unscreened part are specified as the inner boundary condition and a time dependent function in analogy to fang et al s 2009 work is employed as the outer boundary condition a region around the wellbore having different hydraulic properties from the aquifer may be presented due to the well drilling development and or completion the region known as wellbore skin would lead to a head loss during the pumping the wellbore skin sometimes can be depicted as a zone with a finite thickness near the pumping well barker and herbert 1982 novakowski 1989 yang and yeh 2005 barua and bora 2010 lin et al 2016 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the properties of the wellbore skin are commonly lumped as a parameter called skin factor and included in the inner boundary condition many studies have been devoted to the model incorporating the skin factor for estimating the aquifer parameters subject to the constant rate pumping crp e g van everdingen and hurst 1949 van everdingen 1953 hawkins 1956 agarwal et al 1970 moench 1997 chen and chang 2006 slug test e g moench and hsien 1985 and chp e g cassiani et al 1999 chang and chen 2003 lin et al 2017 van everdingen and hurst 1949 indicated that the darcian model usually leads to an underestimate of the pressure at the well he therefore proposed a term with a skin factor in the model to reflect such a pressure drop hawkins 1956 introduced a skin factor in terms of the hydraulic conductivity ratio and thickness ratio of the formation zone to the skin zone to represent the skin effect hurst et al 1969 derived a wellbore flowrate solution for a flowing well problem by adding a skin factor at the inner boundary in a manner similar to that described by van everdingen and hurst 1949 moench 1997 developed a skin factor model for the crp at a finite radius well in an unconfined aquifer he assumed that the water flux across the pumping well is equal to the difference between the averaged hydraulic head within the wellbore and the averaged head in the skin divided by the skin thickness chen and chang 2006 explored the problem regarding the effect of non uniform skin zone on the groundwater flow due to crp in confined aquifers chen and chang 2002 conducted two constant head injection tests and analyzed the measured cumulative volume data of both tests using a large time solution developed with a skin factor accounting for the skin effect in petroleum engineering the skin factor determined from a build up test or pressure drawdown test commonly display a linear relation with the pumping rate e g smith 1961 ramey 1965 meehan and schell 1983 gunaydin et al 2007 gringarten et al 2011 beidokhti et al 2011 mohamed et al 2016 al rbeawi 2016 such a rate dependent effect may be attributed to the problem of non darcy flow at the well screen smith 1961 to reflect this effect ramey 1965 firstly introduced a rate dependent factor expressed as a product of a non darcy flow constant and the wellbore flowrate further ramey 1982 demonstrated that combining van everdingen and hurst s 1949 skin factor solution and the rate dependent factor has an equivalent form to the well loss equation proposed by jacob 1946 beidokhti et al 2011 derived the rate dependent factor from the forchheimer equation the result shows a similar form to ramey s 1965 one the factor is widely applied to pressure models in petroleum engineering contrarily the use of this factor for non darcy flow at the well screen is overlooked in the field of groundwater hydraulics instead the forchheimer and izbash laws commonly used in the groundwater area are applied along with the conservation of mass to develop the groundwater flow equation see e g mathias et al 2008 wen et al 2013 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2017 those approaches implying the flow in the entire aquifer system under the non darcy flow condition may not be suitable to depict the pump induced flow because the flow at a farther distance from the pumping well usually complies with the darcy law commonly the water from the aquifer formation flowing through the gravel pack and wellbore screen is under non darcian condition shekhar 2006 mentioned that the flow near the well screen has the turbulence nature even when the water is pumped with a rate lower than a critical limit to avoid the turbulent flow hence the non darcy flow effect may play a role influencing the groundwater flow near the wellbore motivated by this problem the objective of this article is to develop a groundwater flow model with considering the non darcy flow effect at the inner boundary for the chp problems the use of rate dependent factor for the non darcy flow effect however would result in a nonlinear model which cannot be solved by the integral transform method notice that the approach proposed by yang et al 2014 and fang et al 2009 for the time dependent outer boundary can solve the present model without using the integral transform method we herein propose a transient flow model for chp at a fully penetrating well composed of a steady state flow equation with an inner boundary condition having skin and rate dependent factors and a time dependent outer boundary condition under zero drawdown the drawdown solution to the model is verified by comparing with the finite difference solutions then the present solution is used to examine the effects of the wellbore skin and non darcy flow on the drawdown distribution further we perform the sensitivity analysis to explore the aquifer drawdown and wellbore flowrate behavior in response to the change in each of the hydraulic parameters finally the present solution coupled with the least squares approach is used to determine the aquifer parameters when analyzing the recorded data obtained from a constant head injection test reported in the article of chen and chang 2002 the quality of the well installation for these two test wells is also discussed based on the results of the parameter estimation 2 method 2 1 model description fig 1 shows a schematic representation for the conceptual model depicting the aquifer drawdown distribution s r t l induced by a chp at a fully penetrating well in confined aquifers the variable r l represents the radial direction and t t denotes the operating time the well has a radius r w l and a constant drawdown s w l the origin of the cylindrical coordinates is set at the center of the test well the aquifer has the transmissivity denoted as t l2 t the water extracted by the chp is assumed instantaneously from the storativity s of the aquifer the groundwater flow equation describing the drawdown distribution in an aquifer can be expressed as 1 t 1 r r r s r s s t the initial condition is 2 s 0 t 0 the head loss at the interface between the aquifer and the wellbore may be expressed as 3a s r w s e s r s w r r w where s e is called the effective skin factor the first term on the left hand side lhs of eq 3a represents the aquifer drawdown the second lhs term denotes as the additional head loss generated around the well screen and the term on the right hand side is the wellbore drawdown according to ramey s 1965 work s e can be further defined as s f d q in which s f is a skin factor due to the drilling damage adjacent to the wellbore and dq represents a rate dependent factor due to the non darcy flow effect at the well screen with a constant d t l3 and wellbore flowrate q l3 t the variable q is equal to 2 π r w t s r at r r w thus eq 3a can be written as 3b s r w s f 2 π r w t d s r s r s w r r w if the non darcy effect is negligible i e d 0 eq 3b reduces to 3c s r w s f s r s w r r w which is commonly adopted in the existing groundwater models for the chp problems e g chen and chang 2003 2006 lin et al 2017 the outer boundary condition can be written as 4 s 0 r 2 2 similarity to well loss function jacob 1946 proposed a well loss formula for describing the wellbore drawdown for the step drawdown test he gave 5a bq c q 2 s w r r w where b t l2 and c t2 l5 are linear and nonlinear well loss coefficients respectively kruseman and de ridder 1994 defined that b is the sum of linear aquifer loss coefficient b 1 t l2 and linear well loss coefficient b 2 t l2 the coefficient b 1 is to reflect the aquifer head loss due to pumping and b 1 q is the aquifer drawdown s the coefficient b 2 is to represent the linear head loss due to the flow across the residual mud gravel pack and or the screen entrance and the coefficient c is to denote the nonlinear loss due to the turbulent flow at the well screen thus eq 5a can be arranged as 5b s b 2 q c q 2 s w r r w substituting q 2 π r w t s r into eq 5b yields 5c s r w 2 π t b 2 4 π 2 t 2 r w c s r s r s w r r w comparing eq 3b with eq 5c the relations of parameters in both equations can be found as 6a s f 2 π t b 2 and 6b d 2 π t c these findings have been pointed out by ramey 1982 2 3 dimensionless equations the use of the dimensionless parameters can reduce the number of variables in the system for the analysis herein we define the dimensionless parameters as 7 s d s s w r d r r w r s d r s r w t d t t s r w 2 q d q 2 π s w t d 2 π s w t d the dimensionless form for eq 1 can be written as 8 1 r d r d r d s d r d s d t d the dimensionless initial condition is 9 s d 0 t d 0 the dimensionless inner boundary condition eqs 3b is 10 s d s f d s d r d s d r d 1 r d 1 the outer boundary condition eq 4 in a dimensionless form is 11 s d 0 r d 2 4 steady state model with time dependent outer boundary it should be noted that eq 10 is nonlinear such that the model cannot be solved by using the method of integral transforms alternatively we adopt the approach of yang et al 2014 by defining a steady state dimensionless flow equation as 12 1 r d d d r d r d d s d d r d 0 furthermore eq 11 is replaced by a transient boundary condition specified at a finite distance from the pumping well as 13 s d 0 r d r d where r d is defined as 1 π t d yang et al 2014 notice that the initial condition of eq 9 becomes redundant in solving eq 12 eq 12 can be written as 14 d 2 s d d r d 2 1 r d d s d d r d 0 it has a general solution denoted as 15 s d a 1 a 2 l n r d where a 1 and a 2 are undetermined coefficients and l n is the natural logarithm with the boundary conditions eqs 10 and 13 the coefficients can be determined as 16a a 1 ln r d s f 4 d ln r d s f 2 2 d ln r d and 16b a 2 ln r d s f 4 d ln r d s f 2 2 d substituting eqs 16a and 16b into 15 the dimensionless aquifer drawdown solution is then obtained as 17 s d ln r d s f 4 d ln r d s f 2 2 d ln r d r d the symbol indicates that there are two solutions to the model to ensure eq 17 having a positive value eq 17 should be 18 s d ln r d s f 4 d ln r d s f 2 2 d ln r d r d the dimensionless wellbore flowrate is obtained by applying darcy s law as 19 q d s f ln r d 4 d ln r d s f 2 2 d 2 5 special cases if the skin factor s f is negligible eqs 18 and 19 can be respectively reduced to 20 s d ln r d 4 d ln r d 2 2 d ln r d r d and 21 q d ln r d 4 d ln r d 2 2 d if d 0 eq 18 reduces to 22 s d ln r d r d ln r d s f and eq 19 becomes 23 q d 1 ln r d s f moreover if the effective skin factor exerts an insignificant effect on the flow system eqs 18 and 19 may be respectively simplified as 24 s d ln r d r d ln r d and 25 q d 1 ln r d note that eqs 24 and 25 are the same as the equations given in yang et al 2014 eqs 35 and 36 3 results and discussion consider a chp conducted in a confined aquifer with the following parameter values r w 0 05 m s w 10 m t 1 10 3 m2 min s 1 10 5 s f 1 and d 50 min m3 the following sections are analyzed based on these values 3 1 verification of present solution to verify the present aquifer drawdown solution an implicit finite difference solution is developed based on the transient groundwater model composed of eqs 8 10 using the mathematica function ndsolve the remote boundary condition for the finite difference model is set at r d 10 5 the grid size in radial direction is discretized as unit and the time increment is also unit fig 2 displays a temporal and b spatial dimensionless aquifer drawdown curves predicted by the present solution and finite difference solution when d equals 0 1 1 and 10 with s f 1 ramey 1965 mentioned that the non darcy flow profoundly affects the flow near the wellbore at the early time thus r d is set as one at the screen in fig 2 a and t d is 100 3 s in fig 2 b to emphasize its effect fig 2 a indicates that the curves predicted by the present solution gives a fairly good match with the finite difference solution within t d 5 10 7 around 21 h fig 2 b demonstrates that the present solution gives good aquifer drawdown predictions except at the observation point close to the time dependent outer boundary i e 1 π t d overall the results indicate that the present solution is well developed 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a useful tool to examine the influence of each aquifer parameter on the aquifer drawdown or wellbore flowrate the normalized sensitivity defined by liou and yeh 1997 gives 26 x k p k o p k where x k is the normalized sensitivity of the output o the aquifer drawdown or wellbore flowrate to the k th input parameter p k eq 26 can then be approximated by the forward finite difference formula as 27 x k p k o p k δ p k o p k δ p k where δ p k is set to 10 3 p k yeh and han 1989 fig 3 demonstrates the temporal normalized sensitivity curves for a the aquifer drawdown s observed at r r w and b the wellbore flowrate q note that the positive value of the normalized sensitivity indicates the increment of the specific parameter leading to an increase in s or q at a given time on the other hand the negative value of that implies that the increasing parameter value would result in a decrease in s or q fig 3 a indicates that s is the most sensitive parameter before the pumping time at 30 sec according to the absolute value of the normalized sensitivity after that time s f has the largest influence on the aquifer drawdown followed by t and d this is contrary to our expectation that t should be the most sensitive parameter the reason may be that the non darcy flow effect which delays the water flow propagation reduces the influence of the parameter t on the aquifer drawdown one can observe that t and s decreasingly affect the aquifer drawdown when operating time elapses however s f and d constantly exert certain effects on the aquifer drawdown with increasing time fig 3 b shows that t has the largest sensitivity values fallowed by s f s and d for the case of q this result is different from that given in fig 3 a because the wellbore flowrate is mainly dependent on t i e q 2 π r w t s r notably s and d are relatively insensitive parameters compared with others but they still produce some effects on the wellbore flowrate judged from these results the parameters appear to have varying degrees of influence on the aquifer drawdown and wellbore flowrate therefore analyzing the data set from the aquifer drawdown or wellbore flowrate would reveal different impacts of the aquifer parameters 3 3 effect of skin factor and rate dependent factor in eq 10 the head loss due to wellbore skin is described by s f s d r d while that due to the non darcy flow effect at the well screen is represented by d s d r d 2 obviously the head loss at the well increases as the coefficient s f or d increases fig 4 shows the temporal dimensionless aquifer drawdown curves for a s f varying from 0 01 to 100 with d 1 and b d from 0 01 to 100 with s f 1 observed at the rim of wellbore i e r d 1 the figure shows that the aquifer drawdown curves decrease with increasing s f and d because more head loss occurs at the well screen the aquifer drawdown is sensitive to the change in s f than in d because the loss value due to d s d r d 2 yields a smaller value than that due to s f s d r d it helps account for the outcome of the sensitivity analysis in the previous section that why the parameter d always yields a smaller impact than s f additionally the aquifer drawdown curves for d 0 01 and 0 1 almost coincide with each other indicating that d exerts an insignificant effect on the aquifer drawdown when its value is less than 0 1 3 4 field data analyses chen and chang 2002 conducted two constant head injection tests one was at well 2 referred to as the chit1 in their study and the other at well 5 chit2 both wells have a 0 05 m radius and fully penetrate a silty sand confined aquifer of 10 m thickness at taoyuan tableland in the northern part of taiwan the test at the chit1 ran 58 h with the s w kept at 10 1 m while the chit2 ran 67 h with s w maintained at 13 48 m they measured the cumulative volume in the injection well for parameter estimations the formula they used to estimate the parameters is 28 s w t v w 0 183 t log 0 83 t t s r w 2 s f 2 π t where v w is the cumulative volume defined as 0 t q x d x which can be easily evaluated by a numerical integral function in mathematica called nintegrate wolfram research inc 2018 the aquifer parameters were estimated by graphically fitting the measured data in a semi log plot of s w t v w versus time chen and chang 2002 pointed out that the measured data displayed two different portions in early time and late time periods one can expect that the late time portion can reflect the feature of the flow behavior in the formation zone and the well losses therefore the data points from the chit1 and chit2 after around 100 min were used to analyze for the aquifer parameters they firstly determined the value of t as 1 68 10 3 m2 min by fitting the late time data from the chit1 and chit2 later they determined the value of s as 2 52 10 4 by assuming the absent of the wellbore skin in the chit2 with the obtained t and s the skin factor s f was finally determined as 18 57 for the chit1 their results of the parameter estimation are listed in table 1 following their work the s w t v w data of chit1 and chit2 after 100 min were read from chen and chang 2002 fig 4 by using webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2018 we analyze these data using three different approaches the first approach is to use jacob and lohman s 1952 solution in which both skin factor and rate dependent factor are not considered the second one is to employ hurst et al s 1969 solution in which only the skin factor is considered while the third is the present solution each of three solutions is coupled with the least squares approach and solved by the levenberg marquardt algorithm in mathematica routine nonlinearmodelfit wolfram research inc 2018 for the parameter estimation two statistics are chosen to assess the goodness of fit for different solutions with the estimated parameters they are standard error of estimate see and mean error me defined in yeh 1987 and respectively expressed as 29a see 1 ν i 1 n e i 2 and 29b me 1 n i 1 n e i where ν is the degree of freedom defined as the number of observed data n minus the number of unknown parameters m i e ν n m and e i is the i th prediction error between the predicted s w t v w and observed data the estimated results by three different solutions are also listed in table 1 according to the estimated results of the chit1 the values of t are obtained as 1 04 10 3 m2 min 1 62 10 3 m2 min and 1 61 10 3 m2 min by jacob and lohman s 1952 hurst et al s 1969 and present solutions respectively the estimate of t obtained from the first solution has the smallest value compared to the others that obtained from the second and the present solutions are rather close to that determined by chen and chang 2002 the first solution however gives the estimated s unrealistically small it may be attributed to the fact that the skin effect was not considered in jacob and lohman s 1952 model additionally the estimated values of s by the second and present solutions are larger than that by chen and chang 2002 about an order of magnitude the reason for that is chen and chang 2002 determined its value by analyzing the data set from the chit2 based on the see and me values shown in table 1 we consider that the value of s estimated by chen and chang 2002 cannot represent the estimated result from the chit1 the s f values estimated by hurst et al s 1969 and present solutions confirms that the wellbore has a positive skin as indicated by chen and chang 2002 table 1 indicates that the present solution yields the smallest see and me values indicating that the consideration of both skin factor and rate dependent factor gives the best fit to the data set of chit1 the estimated results for data from chit2 indicate that those three solutions give the same estimates of t i e 1 64 10 3 m2 min which are not far from chen and chang s 2002 estimation the values of s estimated by all solutions are on the same order of magnitude besides the estimates of s f obtained by hurst et al s 1969 and present solutions and that of d obtained by the present solution are smaller than those obtained from the chit1 both effects of wellbore skin and non darcy flow are insignificant for data in the chit2 it is consistent with chen and chang s 2002 statement that there are little or no wellbore skin existing around the well 5 fig 5 shows the measured data of a chit1 and b chit2 and the temporal curves of s w t v w predicted by three solutions with the parameters listed in table 1 it demonstrates that the curve predicted by the present solution matches well with the measured data while those by the other solutions show some significant departure from the measured data especially for the chit1 it implies that the consideration of the rate dependent factor improves the parameter estimation if non darcy flow effect is profound 3 5 performance of test wells kurtulus et al 2019 proposed a well efficiency criterion by analyzing the data of step drawdown test from 290 wells coupled with rorabaugh s 1953 well loss function notice that rorabaugh s 1953 well loss function can be viewed as a modified version of jacob s 1946 one that is 30 bq c q k s w r r w in which k is the exponent parameter equal to 2 in this study kurtulus et al 2019 table 3 summarized the following that the well is in the deteriorating condition when c 1800 s2 m5 or 0 5 min2 m5 for k within 1 and 2 employing the estimated results we obtain that c equals 1163 51 min2 m5 for well 2 and 0 97 min2 m5 for well 5 these values indicate that both test wells were not properly designed or developed it may be explained why the measured data from the chit1 and chit2 are merely capable of reflecting the feature of the flow behavior in the aquifer formation after the operating time up to 100 min 1 67 h 4 concluding remarks this study presents a new mathematical model with considering both skin factor and rate dependent factor at the pumping well for describing aquifer drawdown distribution and wellbore flowrate induced by a chp at a fully penetrating well in confined aquifers the inner boundary condition is nonlinear due to the consideration of the rate dependent factor in light of this we adopt the work of yang et al 2014 to formula the model comprised of a steady state groundwater flow equation with a time dependent finite outer boundary the solutions to the model for the wellbore flowrate and the drawdown can then be derived the comparison of the aquifer drawdown predicted by the present and finite difference solutions indicates that the present solution is well developed the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that s is the most sensitive parameter to the aquifer drawdown before the pumping time of 30 sec while t is the most sensitive parameter for the wellbore flowrate the non darcy flow constant d exerts relatively small effect on both aquifer drawdown and wellbore flowrate as compared to other aquifer parameters an increase in the skin factor or rate dependent factor has the effect of decreasing the drawdown and the flowrate values because the head losses are generated the present solution is used to estimate the aquifer parameters when analyzing a measured data set from a field constant head injection test the results show that the present solution used in the parameter estimation gives the best estimated results compared with those estimated by jacob and lohman solution 1952 and hurst et al 1969 solution as well as that determined by chen and chang 2002 according to these results the consideration of the rate dependent factor improves the parameter estimation also the results of the parameter estimation indicate that the test wells in chen and chang s 2002 work may be not properly installed or developed overall the present solutions can be used as a convenient tool to estimate the aquifer parameters and predict the aquifer drawdown and flowrate distributions credit authorship contribution

5869,the traditional inspection method of runoff simulation sequences is based on statistical parameters while the method can reflect the coincidence of statistical parameters of runoff simulation series and observed data at different time intersections it ignores the characteristics of runoff as time series e g nonlinearity dissipation and complexity which might be required in hydrological engineering by introducing the concept of sample entropy to quantify complexity we proposed a new method based on sample entropy and statistical parameters for inspecting random simulation runoff sequences which can supplement the previous test method to test the new method we used the monthly runoff simulation series of luohe hydrological station in huaihe river basin tanghe hydrological station in yangtze river basin and heishiguan hydrological station in yellow river basin as examples our evaluation revealed that this new inspection method can effectively find anomalies ignored by statistical parameters about flow value and distribution location of the monthly runoff and estimate the error values of flow and distribution location in simulation sequences of three basins compared to the previous inspection method this new method can screen out the simulation sequences of higher accuracy more effectively which offers a new way to improve the accuracy of simulation sequences

global population it is vital to ensure sufficient water resources to support the increasing water demand for urbanization and agricultural intensification hutchins et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 in developing countries especially in drought prone areas hydrological research plays an important role in water resources planning and management such as protection of hydro environment operations of water supply utilities reservoir operation and hydropower generation yang et al 2012 xu and qin 2013 ma et al 2014 yin et al 2018 typically runoff simulation approach is adopted to extend existing hydrologic data for water resources planning and management therefore it is crucial to ensure that the synthetic runoff data are of high precision the difficulty of obtaining high precision simulation runoff is caused by the hydrological uncertainty which includes aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty gong 2012 as shown in fig 1 aleatory uncertainty is driven by natural factors such as meteorology soil water content and etc which cause the hydrological stations to be unable to gather all hydrological information from nature that is to say the information flow from nature to hydrological stations decreases also due to epistemic uncertainty caused by the selection of hydrological simulation models and simulation sequences the information of simulation sequences is less than this of original recorded data thus the sequences might lose some characteristics of natural runoff 1 2 literature review about epistemic uncertainty the process of obtaining synthetic runoff includes two steps the selection of hydrological simulation models and the selection of simulation sequences they are influenced by basin features and simulation purposes therefore the epistemic uncertainty comes into being in this process wang et al 2008 in hydrological simulation a modeler optimizes each model in order to adequately capture the characteristics of the original hydrological sequence for example carlson et al 1970 proposed a simple method for describing random time series applied in lawrence the missouri neva and niger rivers they applied sample autocorrelation function of each series to identify the appropriate form of the general autoregressive moving average arma model and then estimated the values of the parameters wu et al 2014 studied the feasibility of different order seasonal autoregressive model sar p the monthly runoff simulation in renli hydrologic station revealed that the mixed sar p model can preserve the distributional characteristics based on coupling discrete wavelet transforms and artificial neural network ann for flow forecasting adamowski and sun 2010 proposed a wavelet regression method by applying it to two different non perennial rivers in cyprus kargotis at evrychou and xeros at lazarides they demonstrated that the coupled wavelet neural network models can outperform the artificial neural network models 2 research gap the findings of hydrological model optimization gradually improved the accuracy of synthetic runoff data nonetheless regarding the later inspection and selection of simulated data which can reduce the epistemic uncertainty many hydrologists utilize statistical parameters such as mean standard deviation sd coefficient of variation cv and coefficient of skewness cs as the evaluation criteria to evaluate the proximity between the simulated sequence and observation ignoring the different requirements about runoff process s characteristics in different hydrological engineering construction xiao et al 2007 wang et al 2008 hao and singh 2012 yan et al 2010 wu et al 2014 kong et al 2014 in the inspection method based on statistical parameters the sequences from either the simulated or observed data at different time intersections are known as random variables the random variables of the simulated and observed data at the same time intersection are regarded as the inspection objects by comparing the degree of coincidence of statistical parameters of the random variable from the simulated data and observed data at each time intersection we could evaluate the performance of the simulated data due to various factors such as topography geological conditions soil type vegetation and human activities runoff is becoming a more complex open system with multi factor coupling which is highly nonlinear dissipative and complex sivakumar et al 2001 sang et al 2010 chou 2014 wang and wang 2015 the evaluation criteria based on statistical parameters merely consider the statistical relationship in the random variables at different time intersections such approach ignores the complex characteristics such as self similarity and high nonlinearity in the runoff process which might not assist the researchers in selecting simulation consequences with higher accuracy this is because in certain applications such as the annual regulating reservoir the annual regulating water the reservoir group project and etc the characteristics of the runoff process are the focus of inspection runoff series liu 2013 chang and wang 2010 2 1 literature review about entropy to account for the complexity of runoff process we attempt to quantify it most of the complexity analyses are based on nonlinear dynamics parameters such as lyapunov index fractal dimension and kolmogorov entropy however these complexity measurement methods require many calculation data and are sensitive to noise they are insufficient due to small data sets and highly complex dynamic and nonlinear runoff time series in changing environment thus they cannot fully reflect the process and mechanism of the evolution of hydrological systems in a changing environment alcaraz and rieta 2010 the concept of entropy originates from thermodynamics and is an effective method to quantify the complexity of a system a greater the entropy value equates a higher the complexity in the 1990s pincus 1991 proposed the concept of approximate entropy from the perspective of measuring the complexity of nonlinear time series and successfully applied it to the study of the complexity of biological time series to overcome the shortcomings in approximate entropy such as bias relative inconsistency and dependence on the sample length richman and moorman 2000 developed the sample entropy which is different from the approximate entropy and does not count its own match the sample entropy has the advantages of not relying on data length high consistency and insensitivity to missing data and is widely used for measuring the complexity of runoff in hydro meteorological studies sang et al 2010 wang and wang 2015 peng et al 2009 wang and wang 2015 analyzed three hydrological control stations in the yangtze river basin namely yichang station hankou station and datong station that study suggested that the complexity of runoff series in the main stream of the yangtze river has obvious spatial differences and exhibits an increasing trend from upstream to downstream however the peak and trough of the entropy value in three stations have obvious consistency xue et al 2015 used the sliding sample entropy algorithm to test the abrupt change of rainfall and runoff time series in xiangjiang river basin they revealed that the sample entropy of the abrupt change point would produce obvious abrupt change based on the nash sutcliffe model and sample entropy information measure wang et al 2007 evaluated the performances of xin anjiang model and nam model in simulating daily runoff in zishui basin ma and zhu 2019 introduced the concept of sample entropy for examining the simulated runoff and tentatively studied its feasibility at the luohe hydrological station huaihe river basin 2 2 contribution and objective this paper aims to inspect and select simulation series in order to satisfy the requirements about runoff sequences in different engineering application such as the requirements about the characteristics of runoff of each month and between months in the annual regulating reservoir the requirements about the runoff characteristics of the relationship between years and between years in the annual regulating water the requirements about the relationship between the annual and monthly runoff of each reservoir in the reservoir group project and etc these requirements are about the characteristics of runoff process which can be shown in the nonlinear dissipative and complex feature of runoff as a series process based on the sample entropy and statistical parameters we attempt to propose an inspection method for random simulation of monthly runoff which complements the traditional method that merely relies on statistical parameters fig 2 this new inspection method accounts for the complexity of runoff series when selecting the simulation sequences to evaluate the feasibility of the new inspection method in a larger scale we follow ma and zhu 2019 and test it at the luohe hydrological station huaihe river basin china tanghe hydrological station yangtze river basin china and heishiguan hydrological station yellow river basin china the layout of this paper is as follows section 3 introduces the methodology of sar 1 and sample entropy the hydrological simulation of sar 1 model model evaluation using by statistical parameters and root mean square error rmse are provided in section 4 2 while the calculation of sample entropy and sensitivity analysis are shown in section 4 3 section 5 evaluates the accuracy of results using sample entropy finally conclusions are summarized in section 6 3 methodology 3 1 sar 1 model because of the seasonal variation of monthly runoff we chose seasonal autoregressive sar 1 wang et al 2012 model to simulate monthly runoff series given seasonal hydrological sequences x t τ t 1 2 n n is the number of years τ 1 2 3 4 τ is the number of seasons in order to eliminate the effects of seasonal changes in mean and variance the sequences are first standardized 1 z t τ x t τ μ τ σ τ where μ τ is the average of the τ t h season of n year σ τ is the standard deviation wang et al 2012 of the τ t h season of n year the sar 1 model is represented by standardized variables 2 z t τ φ 1 τ z t τ 1 ε t τ where φ 1 τ is an autoregressive coefficient of the τ th monthly runoff ε t τ is an error term of τ t h season in the t t h

in n years ζ t is a random number ζ t n 0 1 c sx τ is cs of x t τ in the τ th month 3 2 sample entropy if the data length of the time series u i u i 1 u i m 1 is n then the sample entropy of the time series is calculated as the following steps richman and moorman 2000 step 1 the time series comprises a m dimensional vector 7 x m i u i u i 1 u i m 1 1 i n m 1 where m is the pre selected mode

hydrological station in huaihe river basin tanghe hydrological station in yangtze river basin and heishiguang hydrological station in yellow river basin the geographical location of these study areas are shown in fig 3 the huaihe river basin is located in the eastern part of china between the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin it is situated in the north south climate transition zone of china spanning the east longitude 111 55 121 25 and north latitude 30 55 36 36 it consists of two major river systems i e huaihe river and yanmo rive and spans four provinces i e hubei henan anhui and jiangsu the total length of huaihe river is 1000 km while its total basin area is 270 000 km2 the average hydrological network density of the huaihe river basin is 822 km2 due to complex topographic conditions the density of hydrological stations in the upper reaches of huaihe river is 1507 km2 and that of shihe river is 1148 km2 which fails to satisfy the control standard of 300 1000 km2 in temperate zone and inland hilly area zhao 2010 therefore hydrological stations are mainly scattered in the plain area hrcmwr 2017 the luohe hydrological station selected in this paper is 1 50 km away from the intersection where shahe river meets lihe river in luohe city downstream as a hydrological control station in plain area it covers a catchment area of 12 150 km2 undertaking the observation items including precipitation hydrology flow hydrological investigation water quality water temperature ice clearance and etc hwrp 2009 the monthly runoff recorded from 1951 to 2006 at the luohe hydrological station were used in this analysis yang 2015 niu et al 2017 li et al 2019 the yangtze river basin is located in the south central part of china it originates from the ladandong snow mountain group in the middle section of the tanggula mountains in the qinghai tibet plateau the total length of the main stream is more than 6 300 km flowing through 11 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities more than 3 600 tributaries are involved in eight provinces autonomous regions the total basin area is about 1 8 million km2 zhuo et al 2019 the yangtze river commission divides yangtze river into 1 hilly and river areas in the upper reaches 2 plain and river areas in the middle reaches and 3 tidal river areas in the lower reaches network information center changjiang archives cwrc consistent with the current regional socioeconomic and water conservancy construction pattern in the yangtze river basin the distributions of hydrological stations in the yangtze river basin are generally sparse in the east and dense in the west moreover as a bridge between the eastern areas and western areas the plain and river areas where the majority of stations are located in have a hydrological station network with a density of 1000 km2 li et al 2011 located on the right bank of the south of tanghe county the tanghe hydrological station selected here is a typical plain river station and an national hydrological station with a catchment area of 4 771 km2 this station undertakes water regime tasks of the national flood control departments and observation items like water level precipitation water temperature water volume survey and etc hwrp 2009 wang and ma 2011 the monthly runoff recorded from 1951 to 2006 at the tanghe hydrological station were used in this paper wang and ma 2011 the yellow river basin is located in the north central part of china it originates from the gu guzong basin in the northern foot of the bayan kala mountain on the qinghai tibet plateau and injects into the bohai sea in kenli county shandong province the river has a total length of 5 464 km and flows through nine provinces with a basin area of 795 000 km2 zhang et al 2019 according to the different topographic conditions of yellow river basin scholars have divided this basin into three zones source hilly and the plain areas zhang et al 2013 the average hydrological network density of the yellow river basin is 2 330 km2 which meets the international standard lin et al 2012 nonetheless the topographic conditions are rather complex causing the concentration of blank areas of hydrological stations in the source areas of the yellow river like qinghai and in the hilly area like inner mongolia plateau li 2009 therefore the hydrological network density of the source area and the hilly area is far below the requirements of the sparsest network density and the hydrological stations are mainly scattered in the plain area the heishiguan hydrological station selected in this paper is located along the yiluo river a main tributary of the yellow river as an national key hydrological station in plain area of this basin it is built in 1934 and has a catchment area of 18 563 km2 hwrp 2009 current study used the monthly runoff recorded from 1952 to 2006 at the heishiguan hydrological station chen et al 2017 here all data recorded at the three stations above are derived from handbook of water conditions in henan province the hydrological data participating in the statistics and calculations are all extracted from the hydrological yearbook the base is consistent with the hydrological yearbook and the water conservancy project data comes from the relevant project management unit hwrp 2009 4 2 sar 1 simulation and evaluation of statistical parameter we applied the monthly runoff data recorded at the three hydrological stations above as inputs of sar 1 model and performed hydrological modeling finally we obtained runoff simulation sequences with a length of 1000 years and calculated the mean sd cv and cs of the random variable at the twelve months intersections of simulated sequences and original data the results are shown in figs 4 6 from figs 4 6 we can see that the statistical parameters of simulation sequences in the three hydrological stations such as mean sd cv and cs match well with those of the original data this means that the sar 1 model can effectively preserve the statistical characteristics of the original data from the above calculations we find that one random variable selected from a simulation sequence at a certain month intersection will have an evaluation about one statistical parameter since a simulation sequence contains twelve intersections it will have twelve evaluations at twelve months intersections about every statistical parameter however a simulation sequence acting as time series only has one sample entropy value which makes it difficult to compare the quality of evaluation criteria based on one value of sample entropy and on several values of statistical parameters to quantitatively evaluate the overall simulation performance of the sar 1 model we applied a comprehensive evaluation index root mean square error rmse rmse indicates the fitting degree between simulated and measured values which can reflect the simulation performance of simulation model to a certain extent the smaller the rmse value is the better the overall simulation performs xiao et al 2007 yan et al 2010 14 rmse 1 m j 1 m δ o j δ s j δ o j 2 where δ o j is the statistical parameter value at the jth interception of the original data δ s j is the statistical parameter value at the jth interception of the simulated sequences m is the number of interceptions m 12 the results are shown in table 1 basically table 1 indicates that the values of rmse of simulation sequences meet the accuracy requirements of statistical parameters according to the traditional evaluation criteria based on statistical parameters researchers can use them in hydrological study because of the good fitting between simulated and recorded runoff consequences nonetheless the values of rmse have some differences among three hydrological stations for example the values of rmse of mean at the luohe hydrological station and tanghe hydrological station are similar and both a little smaller than those at the heishiguan hydrological station moreover some differences in the simulation sequences of the same station also exist to further analyze the simulation performance of monthly runoff series in three basins we introduced sample entropy to quantitatively evaluate the simulation accuracy about complexity of runoff series the rule of sample entropy is that the larger the value of sample entropy is the more complex the time series are and thus it is more difficult to predict the series wang and wang 2015 4 3 evaluation of sample entropy 4 3 1 calculation of sample entropy before calculating sample entropy two unknown parameters i e the embedding dimension m and tolerance threshold r need to be set in many studies when the length of the series is 100 5000 the recommended values of m is 2 the range of r is 0 1 0 25 times the sd of the time series in this paper we set m as 2 r as 0 15 sd for original data and 0 2 sd for simulation sequences pincus 2004 wang and wang 2015 table 2 reveals that there are some differences in sample entropy of simulation series among three hydrological stations and in three hydrological stations in terms of the sample entropy s values of the recorded data of three stations the results demonstrate that the values of sample entropy of heishiguan hydrological station are greater than those of the other stations following the rules of sample entropy the larger the sample entropy is the more complex the time series are wang and wang 2015 hence we deduce that the complexity of the recorded runoffs of this station is the highest based on the studies about factors that may influence the runoff we infer that the reasons for the high complexity at heishiguan hydrological station could be due to the water conservancy projects human activities and planting sun 2015 a heishiguan hydrological station is located along the yiluo river where many water conservancy projects e g water lifting and diversion are built to support production industry hydroelectric power generation and agricultural irrigation etc b this station is located between luoyang and gongyi the population growth and ongoing urbanization reflected on the increase of gdp output values also aggravate the complexity of runoff simulation at heishiguan hydrological station c in the 1980 s people began to plant the forest and green planting in yiluo river basin since then the area covered by forest has great increased at the same time evapotranspiration has also increased resulting in less runoff during dry seasons however changes at luohe hydrological station and tanghe hydrological station are limited therefore compared to these two stations heishiguan hydrological station has experienced more changes this could enhance the complexity of recorded series at heishiguan hydrological station and lead to greater values of sample entropy sun 2015 liu and xia 2013 wang et al 2013 wang and ma 2011 in terms of the sample entropy s values of simulation series the relative errors of sample entropy at luohe hydrological station and heishiguan hydrological station are all negative moreover the absolute values of relative errors at tanghe hydrological station are smaller than those of the other two stations which indicates that the complexity of simulation series and recorded data at tanghe hydrological station are similar that is to say the performance of simulation series at tanghe hydrological station is the best this result agrees with the rules of sample entropy the time series with smaller value of sample entropy has less complexity and has less difficulties to predict and thus simulation series is more accurate and performs better further analysis shows that the variation range of simulated sequences sample entropy values is wider than that of rmse s values this means that relative to the evaluation criteria based on statistical parameters the evaluation criteria based on sample entropy are more sensitivity to the changes of sequences sample entropy will magnify differences in simulation runoff with similar accuracy of statistical parameters to further investigate the relationship between the relative errors of sample entropy and the accuracy of monthly runoff simulation sequences in three basins with different characteristics and find out the reasons behind the errors differences of sample entropy of simulation series we analyzed the sensitivity of sample entropy 4 3 2 sensitivity analysis of sample entropy 1 sample entropy and flow value of the top monthly runoffs the sensitivity analysis between sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs involves these steps step 1 rank the monthly runoffs n 12 month runoffs n is the number of years in descending order and get the top three monthly runoffs a b c a b c step 2 reduce a certain flow value of the first largest monthly runoff a and record the changed flow value as δ q m 3 s 1 step 3 increase uniformly the flow value of the same month as a in the remaining n 1 years at the same time keep the absolute value of the sum of increment is equal to δ q m 3 s 1 for the purpose of keeping the similar statistical parameters after step 2 after above steps the monthly runoff series are called new runoff series lx 1 x 1 2 3 step 4 repeat step 2 3 complete the increment of the flow value of the first largest monthly runoff a and get a new runoff series lx 2 step 5 repeat step 2 3 complete the reduction of the same flow value in step4 for more specific comparison and name as new runoff series lx 3 step 6 repeat step 2 5 complete the change of the two top monthly runoffs a and b as a whole and the three a b and c as a whole finally get the new runoff series lx 4 lx 5 lx 6 and new runoff series lx 7 lx 6 lx 9 according to step 1 6 we obtained the new runoff series in three hydrological stations respectively then we calculated the sample entropy of new runoff series and the relative errors of sample entropy see table 3 from table 3 we can confirm that the correlation between the relative errors of sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs changed in three hydrological stations is consistent when the value of the top monthly runoffs of the original data decreases that is when the flow value of the top monthly runoffs changed is negative the relative errors of sample entropy turns positive and vice versa to better characterize the relationship between the flow value of the top monthly runoffs changed and the relative errors of sample entropy we respectively established three regression fitting equations in three hydrological stations using the results in table 3 fig 7 a c suggest that there is a strong linear relationship between the relative errors of sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs changed the fitting equations in three hydrological stations are similar to improve the adaptability of sample entropy to basins with different characteristics we established a co fitting equation about the relative errors of sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoff changed in the three hydrological stations see fig 7d the correlation between sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs is strong r2 of the co fitting equation is equal to 0 9021 fig 7d in this sense sample entropy can detect the change of flow value of the top monthly runoffs in time 2 sample entropy and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs the sensitivity analysis between sample entropy and the distribution location of the top monthly runoffs includes the following steps taking luohe hydrological station in huaihe river basin as an example step 1 rank the 672 monthly runoffs of original data at luohe hydrological station 56 years 672 months in descending order and select the top ten largest monthly runoffs corresponding months 1040 m 3 s july 1040 m 3 s july august 966 m 3 s august 853 m 3 s august 798 m 3 s august 777 m 3 s august 690 m 3 s august 631 m 3 s september 623 m 3 s august 622 m 3 s july three of the above ten largest monthly runoffs were in july six in august and one in september step 2 rank the monthly runoffs of july august and september in 56 years in ascending order select the first second and third smallest monthly runoff in july the first to the sixth in august and the first in september step 3 swap the first largest monthly runoff 1040 m 3 s july 1957 of the top ten largest monthly runoffs with the first smallest monthly runoff 6 36 m 3 s july 1993 of the three july monthly runoffs selected in step 2 the total number of years about location changed named as δ n year always positive is 36 years the changed monthly runoff series after this step is called new runoff series w1 1 step 4 swap the first and second largest monthly runoffs 1040 m 3 s and 1010 m 3 s july 1957 july 2000 of the top ten largest monthly runoffs with the first and second smallest runoffs 6 36 m 3 s and 8 42 m 3 s july 1993 july 1974 of the three july monthly runoffs selected in step 2 the total number of years about location changed δ n year always positive is 62 years name the changed monthly runoff series as new runoff series w1 2 step 5 exchange the first second and third largest monthly runoffs 1040 m 3 s 1010 m 3 s and 966 m 3 s july 1957 july 2000 august 1995 of the top ten largest monthly runoffs with the first and second smallest runoffs 1010 m 3 s and 8 42 m 3 s july 1993 july 1974 of the three july monthly runoffs and the first smallest 9 93 m 3 s august 1966 of the six august monthly runoffs selected in step 2 the total number of years about location changed δ n year always positive is 73 years name the changed monthly runoff series as new runoff series w1 3 step 6 following step 3 5 complete the position changes of the remaining seven largest monthly runoffs selected in step 1 then obtain new runoff series w1 4 the first to fourth largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 5 the first to fifth largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 6 the first to sixth largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 7 the first to seventh largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 8 the first to eighth largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 9 the first to ninth largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 10 the first to tenth largest monthly runoffs step 7 calculate sample entropy and the relative errors of sample entropy of ten new runoff series by repeating steps 1 7 at luohe hydrological station we analyzed the sensitivity between sample entropy and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs at tanghe hydrological station and heishiguan hydrological station in turn all results are displayed in table 4 table 4 shows that suppose the distribution location of the top monthly runoffs of original data changes i e when the number of changed years δ n year increases the relative errors of sample entropy also increase as a whole to further analyze the relationship between the relative errors of sample entropy and δ n year always positive we respectively established three regression fitting equations in three hydrological stations using the above results see fig 8 from fig 8a c we find that the correlations between the relative errors of sample entropy and the number of years the largest monthly runoff changed at the three hydrological stations are similar the relative errors of sample entropy about distribution location of the top monthly runoffs are almost positive to improve the adaptability of sample entropy to basins with different characteristics we established a co fitting equation fig 8d about the relative errors of sample entropy and the number of years the largest monthly runoff changed in three hydrological stations fig 8d and the co fitting equation reflect that the minimum of the co fitting equation is positive and the relative errors of sample entropy trend upward when the number of years δ n year increases this is consistent with the formulas fitted separately in the three basins 5 result analysis we evaluated the simulation accuracy of simulation sequences about flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs in three basins by the fitting equations and co fitting equations obtained in section 4 3 these results are presented in table 5 5 1 absolute value of relative errors of sample entropy from tables 2 and 5 whilst the rmse of these simulation sequences satisfied the accuracy requirements of statistical parameters the absolute values of relative errors of sample entropy of simulation sequences at three hydrological stations are quite different in other words sample entropy is more sensitive to the differences between the original recorded data and the simulation runoff series therefore it can magnify differences in simulation runoff with similar accuracy of statistical parameters and assist us to identify anomalies of simulation series and select good ones in terms of the performance of simulation series among three stations the results indicated that the absolute values of relative errors of sample entropy of four simulation sequences at tanghe hydrological station are the smallest while those of the four simulation sequences at heishiguan hydrological station are the largest according to the sensitivity analysis between sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs we deduce that the overall simulation errors about flow value of simulation sequences 2 1 to 2 4 at tanghe hydrological station are smaller than those at other hydrological stations consistent with the rules of sample entropy the reduction accuracy in this station is higher than that in luohe hydrological station and heishiguan hydrological station in terms of the absolute values of relative errors of sample entropy of the simulation sequences at the same station there are also some differences the simulation sequence 1 2 luohe hydrological station simulation sequence 2 2 tanghe hydrological station and simulation sequence 3 1 heishiguan hydrological station contains less errors than the other three simulation sequences at the same station this means that these three simulation sequences can reflect the recorded data better than the rest at the same station as such we can select better simulation series using sample entropy 5 2 relative errors of sample entropy the relative errors of sample entropy at tanghe hydrological station could be positive or negative table 2 at luohe hydrological station and heishiguan hydrological station they are all negative according to the sensitivity analysis of sample entropy the simulation sequences 2 1 2 3 and 2 4 with positive relative errors might have reductive errors in flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs this is because these two co fitting equations have positive values however the remaining simulation sequences with negative relative errors at three stations might perform poorly only in the flow value of the top monthly runoffs this is because the co fitting equation about distribution location of the top monthly runoffs has no negative values hence these fitting equations can connect the sample entropy s errors and the flow value and distribution location of top monthly runoffs this should enable us to find out the reasons behind the errors differences of sample entropy of simulation series and get quantitative results 5 3 main error source of the simulation series by comparing the simulation series with negative relative errors of sample entropy and that with positive relative errors of sample entropy we confirmed that whilst the rmse of these simulation sequences are similar different main error sources exist in them they can be detected using fitting equations of sample entropy the main error source of the simulation series with negative relative errors of sample entropy is the reduction of the flow value of the top monthly runoffs by contrast the main error source of the simulation series with positive relative errors of sample entropy are both the reduction of the flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs for example at luohe hydrological station and tanghe hydrological station the rmse of mean in both stations are similar but the main error sources of simulation sequences are from different aspects table 5 at tanghe hydrological station the main errors of the simulation sequences 2 1 2 3 and 2 4 with positive relative errors of sample entropy are caused by the reduction of the flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs at luohe hydrological station the main errors of the simulation series 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 with negative relative errors of sample entropy and similar rmse of mean are driven by the reduction of the flow value of the top monthly runoffs the values of reduction errors in flow or location are quantitatively estimated using co fitting equations which cannot be achieved only by the criteria based on statistical parameters this is relevant for identifying different reasons of simulation series with similar errors and selecting or improving the process of runoff sequences to meet the needs of hydrological work 6 conclusions from the non linear perspective in runoff time series we proposed a new method which considers sample entropy and statistical parameters for inspecting and selecting runoff simulation series we used sar 1 model for hydrological simulation rmse of statistical parameters and sample entropy for accuracy evaluation of simulation series at luohe hydrological station huaihe river basin china tanghe hydrological station yangtze river basin china and heishiguang hydrological station yellow river basin china the main conclusions are 1 whilst the simulated sequences meet the accuracy requirements of statistical parameters there are still some errors between the simulated sequences and the original data in addition although relative errors of statistical parameters and those of sample entropy are obtained from the same hydrological model they are different in different basins 2 a strong correlation exists between sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs and between sample entropy and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs moreover the fitting equations obtained respectively in three basins are almost identical to the co fitting equations in three basins as a whole the results of accuracy evaluation of simulation series using these equations are similar 3 the sample entropy can diagnose the anomalies ignored by statistical parameters of the monthly runoff simulation series it can reveal the flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs in different basins and estimate the error values therefore it is more advantageous than the previous inspection method which only relies on statistical parameters in a nutshell relative to the previous inspection method the new method proposed here can further detect and quantify the reduction error values of the flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs in the three basins based on the rough selection approach using rmse of statistical parameters we can apply the co fitting equations of sample entropy s sensitivity analysis to further screen out the simulation sequences with higher accuracy in this way it is easier to get good simulation consequences for adapting the different requirements of hydrological engineering in future study we would examine the performance of this new method in some special areas with extreme climate like arid area and some regions with more hydrological differences in the world as a part of the efforts to further expand the application scope of the proposed model it would be interesting to study the application of this new method from time scale by using different hydrological models such as daily runoff simulation or annual runoff simulation in order to improve the study of this model credit authorship contribution statement x x ma conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft

5869,the traditional inspection method of runoff simulation sequences is based on statistical parameters while the method can reflect the coincidence of statistical parameters of runoff simulation series and observed data at different time intersections it ignores the characteristics of runoff as time series e g nonlinearity dissipation and complexity which might be required in hydrological engineering by introducing the concept of sample entropy to quantify complexity we proposed a new method based on sample entropy and statistical parameters for inspecting random simulation runoff sequences which can supplement the previous test method to test the new method we used the monthly runoff simulation series of luohe hydrological station in huaihe river basin tanghe hydrological station in yangtze river basin and heishiguan hydrological station in yellow river basin as examples our evaluation revealed that this new inspection method can effectively find anomalies ignored by statistical parameters about flow value and distribution location of the monthly runoff and estimate the error values of flow and distribution location in simulation sequences of three basins compared to the previous inspection method this new method can screen out the simulation sequences of higher accuracy more effectively which offers a new way to improve the accuracy of simulation sequences

global population it is vital to ensure sufficient water resources to support the increasing water demand for urbanization and agricultural intensification hutchins et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 in developing countries especially in drought prone areas hydrological research plays an important role in water resources planning and management such as protection of hydro environment operations of water supply utilities reservoir operation and hydropower generation yang et al 2012 xu and qin 2013 ma et al 2014 yin et al 2018 typically runoff simulation approach is adopted to extend existing hydrologic data for water resources planning and management therefore it is crucial to ensure that the synthetic runoff data are of high precision the difficulty of obtaining high precision simulation runoff is caused by the hydrological uncertainty which includes aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty gong 2012 as shown in fig 1 aleatory uncertainty is driven by natural factors such as meteorology soil water content and etc which cause the hydrological stations to be unable to gather all hydrological information from nature that is to say the information flow from nature to hydrological stations decreases also due to epistemic uncertainty caused by the selection of hydrological simulation models and simulation sequences the information of simulation sequences is less than this of original recorded data thus the sequences might lose some characteristics of natural runoff 1 2 literature review about epistemic uncertainty the process of obtaining synthetic runoff includes two steps the selection of hydrological simulation models and the selection of simulation sequences they are influenced by basin features and simulation purposes therefore the epistemic uncertainty comes into being in this process wang et al 2008 in hydrological simulation a modeler optimizes each model in order to adequately capture the characteristics of the original hydrological sequence for example carlson et al 1970 proposed a simple method for describing random time series applied in lawrence the missouri neva and niger rivers they applied sample autocorrelation function of each series to identify the appropriate form of the general autoregressive moving average arma model and then estimated the values of the parameters wu et al 2014 studied the feasibility of different order seasonal autoregressive model sar p the monthly runoff simulation in renli hydrologic station revealed that the mixed sar p model can preserve the distributional characteristics based on coupling discrete wavelet transforms and artificial neural network ann for flow forecasting adamowski and sun 2010 proposed a wavelet regression method by applying it to two different non perennial rivers in cyprus kargotis at evrychou and xeros at lazarides they demonstrated that the coupled wavelet neural network models can outperform the artificial neural network models 2 research gap the findings of hydrological model optimization gradually improved the accuracy of synthetic runoff data nonetheless regarding the later inspection and selection of simulated data which can reduce the epistemic uncertainty many hydrologists utilize statistical parameters such as mean standard deviation sd coefficient of variation cv and coefficient of skewness cs as the evaluation criteria to evaluate the proximity between the simulated sequence and observation ignoring the different requirements about runoff process s characteristics in different hydrological engineering construction xiao et al 2007 wang et al 2008 hao and singh 2012 yan et al 2010 wu et al 2014 kong et al 2014 in the inspection method based on statistical parameters the sequences from either the simulated or observed data at different time intersections are known as random variables the random variables of the simulated and observed data at the same time intersection are regarded as the inspection objects by comparing the degree of coincidence of statistical parameters of the random variable from the simulated data and observed data at each time intersection we could evaluate the performance of the simulated data due to various factors such as topography geological conditions soil type vegetation and human activities runoff is becoming a more complex open system with multi factor coupling which is highly nonlinear dissipative and complex sivakumar et al 2001 sang et al 2010 chou 2014 wang and wang 2015 the evaluation criteria based on statistical parameters merely consider the statistical relationship in the random variables at different time intersections such approach ignores the complex characteristics such as self similarity and high nonlinearity in the runoff process which might not assist the researchers in selecting simulation consequences with higher accuracy this is because in certain applications such as the annual regulating reservoir the annual regulating water the reservoir group project and etc the characteristics of the runoff process are the focus of inspection runoff series liu 2013 chang and wang 2010 2 1 literature review about entropy to account for the complexity of runoff process we attempt to quantify it most of the complexity analyses are based on nonlinear dynamics parameters such as lyapunov index fractal dimension and kolmogorov entropy however these complexity measurement methods require many calculation data and are sensitive to noise they are insufficient due to small data sets and highly complex dynamic and nonlinear runoff time series in changing environment thus they cannot fully reflect the process and mechanism of the evolution of hydrological systems in a changing environment alcaraz and rieta 2010 the concept of entropy originates from thermodynamics and is an effective method to quantify the complexity of a system a greater the entropy value equates a higher the complexity in the 1990s pincus 1991 proposed the concept of approximate entropy from the perspective of measuring the complexity of nonlinear time series and successfully applied it to the study of the complexity of biological time series to overcome the shortcomings in approximate entropy such as bias relative inconsistency and dependence on the sample length richman and moorman 2000 developed the sample entropy which is different from the approximate entropy and does not count its own match the sample entropy has the advantages of not relying on data length high consistency and insensitivity to missing data and is widely used for measuring the complexity of runoff in hydro meteorological studies sang et al 2010 wang and wang 2015 peng et al 2009 wang and wang 2015 analyzed three hydrological control stations in the yangtze river basin namely yichang station hankou station and datong station that study suggested that the complexity of runoff series in the main stream of the yangtze river has obvious spatial differences and exhibits an increasing trend from upstream to downstream however the peak and trough of the entropy value in three stations have obvious consistency xue et al 2015 used the sliding sample entropy algorithm to test the abrupt change of rainfall and runoff time series in xiangjiang river basin they revealed that the sample entropy of the abrupt change point would produce obvious abrupt change based on the nash sutcliffe model and sample entropy information measure wang et al 2007 evaluated the performances of xin anjiang model and nam model in simulating daily runoff in zishui basin ma and zhu 2019 introduced the concept of sample entropy for examining the simulated runoff and tentatively studied its feasibility at the luohe hydrological station huaihe river basin 2 2 contribution and objective this paper aims to inspect and select simulation series in order to satisfy the requirements about runoff sequences in different engineering application such as the requirements about the characteristics of runoff of each month and between months in the annual regulating reservoir the requirements about the runoff characteristics of the relationship between years and between years in the annual regulating water the requirements about the relationship between the annual and monthly runoff of each reservoir in the reservoir group project and etc these requirements are about the characteristics of runoff process which can be shown in the nonlinear dissipative and complex feature of runoff as a series process based on the sample entropy and statistical parameters we attempt to propose an inspection method for random simulation of monthly runoff which complements the traditional method that merely relies on statistical parameters fig 2 this new inspection method accounts for the complexity of runoff series when selecting the simulation sequences to evaluate the feasibility of the new inspection method in a larger scale we follow ma and zhu 2019 and test it at the luohe hydrological station huaihe river basin china tanghe hydrological station yangtze river basin china and heishiguan hydrological station yellow river basin china the layout of this paper is as follows section 3 introduces the methodology of sar 1 and sample entropy the hydrological simulation of sar 1 model model evaluation using by statistical parameters and root mean square error rmse are provided in section 4 2 while the calculation of sample entropy and sensitivity analysis are shown in section 4 3 section 5 evaluates the accuracy of results using sample entropy finally conclusions are summarized in section 6 3 methodology 3 1 sar 1 model because of the seasonal variation of monthly runoff we chose seasonal autoregressive sar 1 wang et al 2012 model to simulate monthly runoff series given seasonal hydrological sequences x t τ t 1 2 n n is the number of years τ 1 2 3 4 τ is the number of seasons in order to eliminate the effects of seasonal changes in mean and variance the sequences are first standardized 1 z t τ x t τ μ τ σ τ where μ τ is the average of the τ t h season of n year σ τ is the standard deviation wang et al 2012 of the τ t h season of n year the sar 1 model is represented by standardized variables 2 z t τ φ 1 τ z t τ 1 ε t τ where φ 1 τ is an autoregressive coefficient of the τ th monthly runoff ε t τ is an error term of τ t h season in the t t h year a random variable independent of z t τ 1 considering the skewness we used the independent random term transformation method ding and deng 1988 to transform the above simulation model 3 z t τ ρ 1

in n years ζ t is a random number ζ t n 0 1 c sx τ is cs of x t τ in the τ th month 3 2 sample entropy if the data length of the time series u i u i 1 u i m 1 is n then the sample entropy of the time series is calculated as the following steps richman and moorman 2000 step 1 the time series comprises a m dimensional vector 7 x m i u i u i 1 u i m 1 1 i n m 1 where m is the pre selected mode

hydrological station in huaihe river basin tanghe hydrological station in yangtze river basin and heishiguang hydrological station in yellow river basin the geographical location of these study areas are shown in fig 3 the huaihe river basin is located in the eastern part of china between the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin it is situated in the north south climate transition zone of china spanning the east longitude 111 55 121 25 and north latitude 30 55 36 36 it consists of two major river systems i e huaihe river and yanmo rive and spans four provinces i e hubei henan anhui and jiangsu the total length of huaihe river is 1000 km while its total basin area is 270 000 km2 the average hydrological network density of the huaihe river basin is 822 km2 due to complex topographic conditions the density of hydrological stations in the upper reaches of huaihe river is 1507 km2 and that of shihe river is 1148 km2 which fails to satisfy the control standard of 300 1000 km2 in temperate zone and inland hilly area zhao 2010 therefore hydrological stations are mainly scattered in the plain area hrcmwr 2017 the luohe hydrological station selected in this paper is 1 50 km away from the intersection where shahe river meets lihe river in luohe city downstream as a hydrological control station in plain area it covers a catchment area of 12 150 km2 undertaking the observation items including precipitation hydrology flow hydrological investigation water quality water temperature ice clearance and etc hwrp 2009 the monthly runoff recorded from 1951 to 2006 at the luohe hydrological station were used in this analysis yang 2015 niu et al 2017 li et al 2019 the yangtze river basin is located in the south central part of china it originates from the ladandong snow mountain group in the middle section of the tanggula mountains in the qinghai tibet plateau the total length of the main stream is more than 6 300 km flowing through 11 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities more than 3 600 tributaries are involved in eight provinces autonomous regions the total basin area is about 1 8 million km2 zhuo et al 2019 the yangtze river commission divides yangtze river into 1 hilly and river areas in the upper reaches 2 plain and river areas in the middle reaches and 3 tidal river areas in the lower reaches network information center changjiang archives cwrc consistent with the current regional socioeconomic and water conservancy construction pattern in the yangtze river basin the distributions of hydrological stations in the yangtze river basin are generally sparse in the east and dense in the west moreover as a bridge between the eastern areas and western areas the plain and river areas where the majority of stations are located in have a hydrological station network with a density of 1000 km2 li et al 2011 located on the right bank of the south of tanghe county the tanghe hydrological station selected here is a typical plain river station and an national hydrological station with a catchment area of 4 771 km2 this station undertakes water regime tasks of the national flood control departments and observation items like water level precipitation water temperature water volume survey and etc hwrp 2009 wang and ma 2011 the monthly runoff recorded from 1951 to 2006 at the tanghe hydrological station were used in this paper wang and ma 2011 the yellow river basin is located in the north central part of china it originates from the gu guzong basin in the northern foot of the bayan kala mountain on the qinghai tibet plateau and injects into the bohai sea in kenli county shandong province the river has a total length of 5 464 km and flows through nine provinces with a basin area of 795 000 km2 zhang et al 2019 according to the different topographic conditions of yellow river basin scholars have divided this basin into three zones source hilly and the plain areas zhang et al 2013 the average hydrological network density of the yellow river basin is 2 330 km2 which meets the international standard lin et al 2012 nonetheless the topographic conditions are rather complex causing the concentration of blank areas of hydrological stations in the source areas of the yellow river like qinghai and in the hilly area like inner mongolia plateau li 2009 therefore the hydrological network density of the source area and the hilly area is far below the requirements of the sparsest network density and the hydrological stations are mainly scattered in the plain area the heishiguan hydrological station selected in this paper is located along the yiluo river a main tributary of the yellow river as an national key hydrological station in plain area of this basin it is built in 1934 and has a catchment area of 18 563 km2 hwrp 2009 current study used the monthly runoff recorded from 1952 to 2006 at the heishiguan hydrological station chen et al 2017 here all data recorded at the three stations above are derived from handbook of water conditions in henan province the hydrological data participating in the statistics and calculations are all extracted from the hydrological yearbook the base is consistent with the hydrological yearbook and the water conservancy project data comes from the relevant project management unit hwrp 2009 4 2 sar 1 simulation and evaluation of statistical parameter we applied the monthly runoff data recorded at the three hydrological stations above as inputs of sar 1 model and performed hydrological modeling finally we obtained runoff simulation sequences with a length of 1000 years and calculated the mean sd cv and cs of the random variable at the twelve months intersections of simulated sequences and original data the results are shown in figs 4 6 from figs 4 6 we can see that the statistical parameters of simulation sequences in the three hydrological stations such as mean sd cv and cs match well with those of the original data this means that the sar 1 model can effectively preserve the statistical characteristics of the original data from the above calculations we find that one random variable selected from a simulation sequence at a certain month intersection will have an evaluation about one statistical parameter since a simulation sequence contains twelve intersections it will have twelve evaluations at twelve months intersections about every statistical parameter however a simulation sequence acting as time series only has one sample entropy value which makes it difficult to compare the quality of evaluation criteria based on one value of sample entropy and on several values of statistical parameters to quantitatively evaluate the overall simulation performance of the sar 1 model we applied a comprehensive evaluation index root mean square error rmse rmse indicates the fitting degree between simulated and measured values which can reflect the simulation performance of simulation model to a certain extent the smaller the rmse value is the better the overall simulation performs xiao et al 2007 yan et al 2010 14 rmse 1 m j 1 m δ o j δ s j δ o j 2 where δ o j is the statistical parameter value at the jth interception of the original data δ s j is the statistical parameter value at the jth interception of the simulated sequences m is the number of interceptions m 12 the results are shown in table 1 basically table 1 indicates that the values of rmse of simulation sequences meet the accuracy requirements of statistical parameters according to the traditional evaluation criteria based on statistical parameters researchers can use them in hydrological study because of the good fitting between simulated and recorded runoff consequences nonetheless the values of rmse have some differences among three hydrological stations for example the values of rmse of mean at the luohe hydrological station and tanghe hydrological station are similar and both a little smaller than those at the heishiguan hydrological station moreover some differences in the simulation sequences of the same station also exist to further analyze the simulation performance of monthly runoff series in three basins we introduced sample entropy to quantitatively evaluate the simulation accuracy about complexity of runoff series the rule of sample entropy is that the larger the value of sample entropy is the more complex the time series are and thus it is more difficult to predict the series wang and wang 2015 4 3 evaluation of sample entropy 4 3 1 calculation of sample entropy before calculating sample entropy two unknown parameters i e the embedding dimension m and tolerance threshold r need to be set in many studies when the length of the series is 100 5000 the recommended values of m is 2 the range of r is 0 1 0 25 times the sd of the time series in this paper we set m as 2 r as 0 15 sd for original data and 0 2 sd for simulation sequences pincus 2004 wang and wang 2015 table 2 reveals that there are some differences in sample entropy of simulation series among three hydrological stations and in three hydrological stations in terms of the sample entropy s values of the recorded data of three stations the results demonstrate that the values of sample entropy of heishiguan hydrological station are greater than those of the other stations following the rules of sample entropy the larger the sample entropy is the more complex the time series are wang and wang 2015 hence we deduce that the complexity of the recorded runoffs of this station is the highest based on the studies about factors that may influence the runoff we infer that the reasons for the high complexity at heishiguan hydrological station could be due to the water conservancy projects human activities and planting sun 2015 a heishiguan hydrological station is located along the yiluo river where many water conservancy projects e g water lifting and diversion are built to support production industry hydroelectric power generation and agricultural irrigation etc b this station is located between luoyang and gongyi the population growth and ongoing urbanization reflected on the increase of gdp output values also aggravate the complexity of runoff simulation at heishiguan hydrological station c in the 1980 s people began to plant the forest and green planting in yiluo river basin since then the area covered by forest has great increased at the same time evapotranspiration has also increased resulting in less runoff during dry seasons however changes at luohe hydrological station and tanghe hydrological station are limited therefore compared to these two stations heishiguan hydrological station has experienced more changes this could enhance the complexity of recorded series at heishiguan hydrological station and lead to greater values of sample entropy sun 2015 liu and xia 2013 wang et al 2013 wang and ma 2011 in terms of the sample entropy s values of simulation series the relative errors of sample entropy at luohe hydrological station and heishiguan hydrological station are all negative moreover the absolute values of relative errors at tanghe hydrological station are smaller than those of the other two stations which indicates that the complexity of simulation series and recorded data at tanghe hydrological station are similar that is to say the performance of simulation series at tanghe hydrological station is the best this result agrees with the rules of sample entropy the time series with smaller value of sample entropy has less complexity and has less difficulties to predict and thus simulation series is more accurate and performs better further analysis shows that the variation range of simulated sequences sample entropy values is wider than that of rmse s values this means that relative to the evaluation criteria based on statistical parameters the evaluation criteria based on sample entropy are more sensitivity to the changes of sequences sample entropy will magnify differences in simulation runoff with similar accuracy of statistical parameters to further investigate the relationship between the relative errors of sample entropy and the accuracy of monthly runoff simulation sequences in three basins with different characteristics and find out the reasons behind the errors differences of sample entropy of simulation series we analyzed the sensitivity of sample entropy 4 3 2 sensitivity analysis of sample entropy 1 sample entropy and flow value of the top monthly runoffs the sensitivity analysis between sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs involves these steps step 1 rank the monthly runoffs n 12 month runoffs n is the number of years in descending order and get the top three monthly runoffs a b c a b c step 2 reduce a certain flow value of the first largest monthly runoff a and record the changed flow value as δ q m 3 s 1 step 3 increase uniformly the flow value of the same month as a in the remaining n 1 years at the same time keep the absolute value of the sum of increment is equal to δ q m 3 s 1 for the purpose of keeping the similar statistical parameters after step 2 after above steps the monthly runoff series are called new runoff series lx 1 x 1 2 3 step 4 repeat step 2 3 complete the increment of the flow value of the first largest monthly runoff a and get a new runoff series lx 2 step 5 repeat step 2 3 complete the reduction of the same flow value in step4 for more specific comparison and name as new runoff series lx 3 step 6 repeat step 2 5 complete the change of the two top monthly runoffs a and b as a whole and the three a b and c as a whole finally get the new runoff series lx 4 lx 5 lx 6 and new runoff series lx 7 lx 6 lx 9 according to step 1 6 we obtained the new runoff series in three hydrological stations respectively then we calculated the sample entropy of new runoff series and the relative errors of sample entropy see table 3 from table 3 we can confirm that the correlation between the relative errors of sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs changed in three hydrological stations is consistent when the value of the top monthly runoffs of the original data decreases that is when the flow value of the top monthly runoffs changed is negative the relative errors of sample entropy turns positive and vice versa to better characterize the relationship between the flow value of the top monthly runoffs changed and the relative errors of sample entropy we respectively established three regression fitting equations in three hydrological stations using the results in table 3 fig 7 a c suggest that there is a strong linear relationship between the relative errors of sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs changed the fitting equations in three hydrological stations are similar to improve the adaptability of sample entropy to basins with different characteristics we established a co fitting equation about the relative errors of sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoff changed in the three hydrological stations see fig 7d the correlation between sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs is strong r2 of the co fitting equation is equal to 0 9021 fig 7d in this sense sample entropy can detect the change of flow value of the top monthly runoffs in time 2 sample entropy and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs the sensitivity analysis between sample entropy and the distribution location of the top monthly runoffs includes the following steps taking luohe hydrological station in huaihe river basin as an example step 1 rank the 672 monthly runoffs of original data at luohe hydrological station 56 years 672 months in descending order and select the top ten largest monthly runoffs corresponding months 1040 m 3 s july 1040 m 3 s july august 966 m 3 s august 853 m 3 s august 798 m 3 s august 777 m 3 s august 690 m 3 s august 631 m 3 s september 623 m 3 s august 622 m 3 s july three of the above ten largest monthly runoffs were in july six in august and one in september step 2 rank the monthly runoffs of july august and september in 56 years in ascending order select the first second and third smallest monthly runoff in july the first to the sixth in august and the first in september step 3 swap the first largest monthly runoff 1040 m 3 s july 1957 of the top ten largest monthly runoffs with the first smallest monthly runoff 6 36 m 3 s july 1993 of the three july monthly runoffs selected in step 2 the total number of years about location changed named as δ n year always positive is 36 years the changed monthly runoff series after this step is called new runoff series w1 1 step 4 swap the first and second largest monthly runoffs 1040 m 3 s and 1010 m 3 s july 1957 july 2000 of the top ten largest monthly runoffs with the first and second smallest runoffs 6 36 m 3 s and 8 42 m 3 s july 1993 july 1974 of the three july monthly runoffs selected in step 2 the total number of years about location changed δ n year always positive is 62 years name the changed monthly runoff series as new runoff series w1 2 step 5 exchange the first second and third largest monthly runoffs 1040 m 3 s 1010 m 3 s and 966 m 3 s july 1957 july 2000 august 1995 of the top ten largest monthly runoffs with the first and second smallest runoffs 1010 m 3 s and 8 42 m 3 s july 1993 july 1974 of the three july monthly runoffs and the first smallest 9 93 m 3 s august 1966 of the six august monthly runoffs selected in step 2 the total number of years about location changed δ n year always positive is 73 years name the changed monthly runoff series as new runoff series w1 3 step 6 following step 3 5 complete the position changes of the remaining seven largest monthly runoffs selected in step 1 then obtain new runoff series w1 4 the first to fourth largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 5 the first to fifth largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 6 the first to sixth largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 7 the first to seventh largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 8 the first to eighth largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 9 the first to ninth largest monthly runoffs new runoff series w1 10 the first to tenth largest monthly runoffs step 7 calculate sample entropy and the relative errors of sample entropy of ten new runoff series by repeating steps 1 7 at luohe hydrological station we analyzed the sensitivity between sample entropy and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs at tanghe hydrological station and heishiguan hydrological station in turn all results are displayed in table 4 table 4 shows that suppose the distribution location of the top monthly runoffs of original data changes i e when the number of changed years δ n year increases the relative errors of sample entropy also increase as a whole to further analyze the relationship between the relative errors of sample entropy and δ n year always positive we respectively established three regression fitting equations in three hydrological stations using the above results see fig 8 from fig 8a c we find that the correlations between the relative errors of sample entropy and the number of years the largest monthly runoff changed at the three hydrological stations are similar the relative errors of sample entropy about distribution location of the top monthly runoffs are almost positive to improve the adaptability of sample entropy to basins with different characteristics we established a co fitting equation fig 8d about the relative errors of sample entropy and the number of years the largest monthly runoff changed in three hydrological stations fig 8d and the co fitting equation reflect that the minimum of the co fitting equation is positive and the relative errors of sample entropy trend upward when the number of years δ n year increases this is consistent with the formulas fitted separately in the three basins 5 result analysis we evaluated the simulation accuracy of simulation sequences about flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs in three basins by the fitting equations and co fitting equations obtained in section 4 3 these results are presented in table 5 5 1 absolute value of relative errors of sample entropy from tables 2 and 5 whilst the rmse of these simulation sequences satisfied the accuracy requirements of statistical parameters the absolute values of relative errors of sample entropy of simulation sequences at three hydrological stations are quite different in other words sample entropy is more sensitive to the differences between the original recorded data and the simulation runoff series therefore it can magnify differences in simulation runoff with similar accuracy of statistical parameters and assist us to identify anomalies of simulation series and select good ones in terms of the performance of simulation series among three stations the results indicated that the absolute values of relative errors of sample entropy of four simulation sequences at tanghe hydrological station are the smallest while those of the four simulation sequences at heishiguan hydrological station are the largest according to the sensitivity analysis between sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs we deduce that the overall simulation errors about flow value of simulation sequences 2 1 to 2 4 at tanghe hydrological station are smaller than those at other hydrological stations consistent with the rules of sample entropy the reduction accuracy in this station is higher than that in luohe hydrological station and heishiguan hydrological station in terms of the absolute values of relative errors of sample entropy of the simulation sequences at the same station there are also some differences the simulation sequence 1 2 luohe hydrological station simulation sequence 2 2 tanghe hydrological station and simulation sequence 3 1 heishiguan hydrological station contains less errors than the other three simulation sequences at the same station this means that these three simulation sequences can reflect the recorded data better than the rest at the same station as such we can select better simulation series using sample entropy 5 2 relative errors of sample entropy the relative errors of sample entropy at tanghe hydrological station could be positive or negative table 2 at luohe hydrological station and heishiguan hydrological station they are all negative according to the sensitivity analysis of sample entropy the simulation sequences 2 1 2 3 and 2 4 with positive relative errors might have reductive errors in flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs this is because these two co fitting equations have positive values however the remaining simulation sequences with negative relative errors at three stations might perform poorly only in the flow value of the top monthly runoffs this is because the co fitting equation about distribution location of the top monthly runoffs has no negative values hence these fitting equations can connect the sample entropy s errors and the flow value and distribution location of top monthly runoffs this should enable us to find out the reasons behind the errors differences of sample entropy of simulation series and get quantitative results 5 3 main error source of the simulation series by comparing the simulation series with negative relative errors of sample entropy and that with positive relative errors of sample entropy we confirmed that whilst the rmse of these simulation sequences are similar different main error sources exist in them they can be detected using fitting equations of sample entropy the main error source of the simulation series with negative relative errors of sample entropy is the reduction of the flow value of the top monthly runoffs by contrast the main error source of the simulation series with positive relative errors of sample entropy are both the reduction of the flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs for example at luohe hydrological station and tanghe hydrological station the rmse of mean in both stations are similar but the main error sources of simulation sequences are from different aspects table 5 at tanghe hydrological station the main errors of the simulation sequences 2 1 2 3 and 2 4 with positive relative errors of sample entropy are caused by the reduction of the flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs at luohe hydrological station the main errors of the simulation series 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 with negative relative errors of sample entropy and similar rmse of mean are driven by the reduction of the flow value of the top monthly runoffs the values of reduction errors in flow or location are quantitatively estimated using co fitting equations which cannot be achieved only by the criteria based on statistical parameters this is relevant for identifying different reasons of simulation series with similar errors and selecting or improving the process of runoff sequences to meet the needs of hydrological work 6 conclusions from the non linear perspective in runoff time series we proposed a new method which considers sample entropy and statistical parameters for inspecting and selecting runoff simulation series we used sar 1 model for hydrological simulation rmse of statistical parameters and sample entropy for accuracy evaluation of simulation series at luohe hydrological station huaihe river basin china tanghe hydrological station yangtze river basin china and heishiguang hydrological station yellow river basin china the main conclusions are 1 whilst the simulated sequences meet the accuracy requirements of statistical parameters there are still some errors between the simulated sequences and the original data in addition although relative errors of statistical parameters and those of sample entropy are obtained from the same hydrological model they are different in different basins 2 a strong correlation exists between sample entropy and the flow value of the top monthly runoffs and between sample entropy and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs moreover the fitting equations obtained respectively in three basins are almost identical to the co fitting equations in three basins as a whole the results of accuracy evaluation of simulation series using these equations are similar 3 the sample entropy can diagnose the anomalies ignored by statistical parameters of the monthly runoff simulation series it can reveal the flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs in different basins and estimate the error values therefore it is more advantageous than the previous inspection method which only relies on statistical parameters in a nutshell relative to the previous inspection method the new method proposed here can further detect and quantify the reduction error values of the flow value and distribution location of the top monthly runoffs in the three basins based on the rough selection approach using rmse of statistical parameters we can apply the co fitting equations of sample entropy s sensitivity analysis to further screen out the simulation sequences with higher accuracy in this way it is easier to get good simulation consequences for adapting the different requirements of hydrological engineering in future study we would examine the performance of this new method in some special areas with extreme climate like arid area and some regions with more hydrological differences in the world as a part of the efforts to further expand the application scope of the proposed model it would be interesting to study the application of this new method from time scale by using different hydrological models such as daily runoff simulation or annual runoff simulation in order to improve the study of this model credit authorship contribution statement x x ma conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft
