halogenated byproducts are formed during the electrochemical treatment the practical system should be designed carefully to minimize the formation of toxic byproducts because the color and the turbidity of treated urine samples drop drastically by electrochemical treatment further developed treatment system could be with the idea of passing the treated water through a reaction chamber which is coated with visible light driven semiconductor under the sunlight this system may help reduce the level of halogenated compound after the treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of ti iro2 nano tio2 electrode an inner iro2 layer was prepared on the titanium plate by soaking the plate into a solution of tacl5 aldrich and hircl5 aldrich dissolved in hcl duksan followed by six times of drying and heating at 525 c the tio2 layer was prepared by spraying a solution where 3 8 wt of tio2 particles and 2 2 wt of ethyl cellulose binder were dispersed with ultra apex mill in a mixed liquid of ethanol and terpineol 16 19 wt the thickness of the sprayed tio2 layer was around 80 100 nm it was baked twice at 450 c for 30 min each time the detailed description for the preparation of ti iro2 tio2 electrode is shown elsewhere 32 45 the cathode of the electrochemical reactor was prepared by cutting stainless steel 316 two differently sized electrodes were prepared with the dimensions of 228 420 0 5 mm3 and 35 60 0 5 mm3 each for different experimental purposes scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive x ray sem edx spectroscopic test jsm 7100 f jeol was run to image the surface of the prepared anode an x ray diffraction xrd test was run on the oxide layers with a d8 advance mkii1 xrd bruker 2 2 electrochemical reactor two differently sized electrochemical reactors were prepared a small reactor with 420 ml volume was stacked with electrodes of 35 60 0 5 mm3 and one with 20 l volume was stacked with electrodes of 228 420 0 5 mm3 the anode and cathode were vertically stacked in the reactor the gap between electrodes was maintained at 3 mm electrochemical treatment of urine sample was performed with a batch type reaction electrodes were connected to the dc rectifier i tech electronics co for 4 0 v of running applied potential the input current density was monitored throughout the experiment experiments were run at 25 c 2 3 sample preparation and analytical methods the collected urine was diluted with tap water 1 20 v v urine water for the electrochemical reactions to simulate the volume ratio between urine and toilet flush water the smaller reactor with a volume of 420 ml was used for the efficiency tests volumes of 0 3 0 4 ml were collected at 0 5 10 and 15 min evolution of free chlorine from the electrochemical reaction was tested with 50 mm nacl duksan solution in water hach dr 2000 was used to analyze free chlorine 46 generation of hydroxyl radical was tested by using the disappearance of p nitrosodimethylaniline rno 47 the test sample was prepared by dissolving 67 μm of rno in the aqueous solution of 50 mm of kh2po4 samples were collected at 0 4 10 15 20 and 25 min the disappearance of rno was monitored by the absorbance changes at 440 nm with uv vis spectrometer mecasys urine samples were treated by using electrochemical reaction urine was diluted with water with the same method for the generation of free chlorine test larger reactor with 20 l volume was used for the treatment of urine samples after adding 40 mm amount of nacl externally to the urine sample the electric potential of 4 0 v was applied test samples from the electrochemical reactor were collected every 1 h up to 6 h analytical items were the content of cod ammonia total nitrogen turbidity and color hach dr 2000 was used for the sample analyses with the individual analytical method 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of ti iro2 nano tio2 electrode titanium as a support material has been studied for a long time because of its properties it is hard highly conducting and chemically inert and stable 48 49 its oxide form tio2 has a lot of potentials to be used as the surface of anode electrode because of its property of higher chemical inertness the capability of charge transport through the oxide layer and mechanical stability 50 51 the prepared anode with double oxide layers of tio2 over iro2 was analyzed for its morphology this ti iro2 tio2 electrode was cut into pieces to take an sem image the sem images in fig 1 shows the inner iro2 a and the final nano tio2 coated over the iro2 b the surface and cross sectional morphology of the electrode together with the elemental composition was observed by sem edx jsm 7100 f jeol the crystals of iro2 were grown angular shaped over the ti plate the tio2 layer was completely covering all of the iro2 and the remaining area of ti plate the sem image of fig 1 c shows the junction between the two oxide layers the depths of coated iro2 and tio2 layers were 8 25 μm and 3 66 μm respectively the composition of each layer was confirmed by exd results as shown in fig 2 x 1 and x 2 prepared ti iro2 tio2 was tested for the effective surface area and the generated free chlorine the result is shown in fig 2 a potentiodynamic measurement was performed autolab 302 n metrohm autolab b v at room temperature in 50 mm nacl solution the electrochemically effective surface area was obtained based on the cyclic voltammetry cv the voltammogram in fig 2 a shows obtained cv profiles running under ea between 0 and 0 8 v the extent of faradaically admitted charge depends pretty much linearly on the applied voltage for some metal oxide electrode for such a situation the behavior of electrode is quite equivalent to a capacitor it is known that the electrochemical activity of oxide electrode can be characterized by the integrated charge q of the voltammogram in the potential region between the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction 52 53 as shown in the fig 2 b the integrated charges in anodic current were almost identical to that of integrated cathode current the plot shows that 70 more activity was obtained from the ti iro2 nano tio2 electrode than the ti iro2 electrode in terms of concerned indirect oxidation under consideration the most important electrochemical oxidant may be chlorine 2 free chlorine can react with organic substances and ammonia in urine for the oxidation reactions the amounts of electrochemically generated free chlorine from a 50 mm nacl aqueous solution were measured with the dimension of 35 60 mm2 the running efficiencies between ti iro2 and ti iro2 tio2 anodes were compared based on the generated amounts of free chlorine the result is shown in fig 2 c the applied voltage for the experiment for generation of free chlorine experiment was maintained at 4 0 v with the given current density of 11 ma cm2 4 95 mg l 1 cm2 of free chlorine was generated in one hour from the ti iro2 tio2 electrode while 3 86 mg l 1 cm2 was generated from the ti iro2 electrode the excessive amount of free chlorine generated from the ti iro2 tio2 was 28 higher than that from the ti iro2 one it is known that rno has a very high 2nd order rate constant of 1 25 1010 l mol 1 s 1 with hydroxyl radical and working as a hydroxyl radical scavenger 54 55 an aqueous solution with 67 μm of rno and 50 mm kh2po4 was prepared the amount of generated hydroxyl radicals was compared between the ti iro2 and the ti iro2 tio2 anodes with the indirect quantification of hydroxyl radical by the disappearance of rno samples were collected each at 0 4 10 15 20 and 25 min the disappearance of rno was plotted with ln rno rno o versus time in minutes the result is shown in fig 3 the plots in fig 3 show the linearly disappearing trends of rno with time when the slopes of 0 011of the ti iro2 anode and 0 017 of the ti iro2 tio2 anode were compared it could be determined that the ti iro2 tio2 anode generates 55 more hydroxyl radicals than the ti iro2 in a given time frame 3 2 experimental results from the treatment of urine sample the collected human urine was diluted in a 1 20 with water 1 20 v v urine water considering the normal volume ratio between urine and flush water in flush toilets electrochemical treatment of urine sample was performed using a cell with a ti iro2 tio2 anode and a stainless steel 316 cathode in order to focus more on the recycling of the treated urine sample further experiments were performed by diluting fresh urine with treated water recycle test instead of pristine tap water the diluted urine sample was added with external nacl 40 mm a large volume reactor of 20 l was used in this experiment an applied potential of 4 0 v was maintained throughout the experiments analytical samples of 50 ml were collected before applying the voltage and the same amount was collected each hour for up to 6 h of the run the initial ph of the solution before treatment was 8 9 and it changed to 9 1 after 6 h of electrochemical reaction meaning not much change in ph was observed throughout the experiment removal of cod in the urine sample by the electrochemical reaction was performed because the removal of contaminants in urine sample is significantly affected by the presence of organic substances that compete for the generated hydroxyl radicals and active chlorine species 56 the experimental result is shown in fig 4 the changes of cod in urine sample were measured by the hach reactor digestion method 57 starting from the initial cod of 149 the level of cod steadily decreased up to 2 h then the removal of rate became slow up to 3 h the removal of cod became steady again after 3 h and reached to cod level of 41 which corresponds to 72 removal of cod after 6 h of reaction the changes of color turbidity and the amount of free chlorine were monitored through the 6 h of electrochemical reactions the results are shown in fig 5 the color change of the sample was measured by the hach platinum cobalt standard method 58 the color unit of the fresh sample was 23 before the reaction then suddenly increased to 50 after 1 h after which it began to steadily decrease to 1 resulting in 96 removal after 6 h the turbidity was measured by the hach absorptometric method 59 the turbidity of 16 units before the reaction was eventually steadily decreased to an undetectable range after 6 h because increased ph led to the precipitation of alkali earth metal ions with the corresponding forms of calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide eqs 10 and 11 the amount of free chlorine was measured by the hach dnp method 46 the detected amount of free chlorine has fluctuated at low concentration levels between 0 1 and 0 3 mg l throughout 5 h reaction then suddenly after 6 h of reaction the concentration surged to 157 mg l meaning no more removable substances remained in the sample solution after 5 h of reaction breakpoint the electrochemically treated water was recycled as mixing water for fresh urine to test the feasibility of building a toilet without liquid discharge there was no external nacl addition for the sample preparation when recycled water was mixed with fresh urine recycle tests were repeated two times recycle 1 and 2 where recycle 2 meant the 2nd recycle of treated water the results of turbidity removal by electrochemical reactions are shown in fig 6 turbidity was continuously removed from the urine sample which was mixed with fresh tap water the original 24 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit was reduced to 1 ntu after 6 h there was sudden drop of turbidity to 7 ntu after simply mixing urine with recycled water even before electrochemical reaction it is a general idea that higher ph conditions help reduce the turbidity of the solution because of sedimentation of alkali bases would be accelerated under basic condition 60 dilution of urine sample with recycled water with the ph value of 9 1 demonstrated the drop in turbidity by the settling down of some stably suspending colloid particles the time needed for the turbidity to drop to the proposed ntu of 1 by the electrochemical reaction was drastically reduced to 4 h which is 2 h less than the result taken from urine sample mixed with pristine tap water further recycle of treated water showed almost the same trend of turbidity removal as the first recycle color from the organic substance can be removed by breaking the conjugations of π bonds with the reactions of hydroxyl radicals and or free chlorine molecules the degree of removal of color from the urine sample by the electrochemical reaction was measured recycle tests were performed by using treated waters to be mixed with fresh urine the results are shown in fig 7 under electrochemical reaction the urine sample prepared with tap water showed the sudden increase in color to 108 units after 1 h of running from 28 units before the reaction then the color decreased steadily to 6 units after 6 h the appearance of color from organic molecules is caused by the electronic transitions from bonding molecular orbital to antibonding molecular orbital π π or n π which is happening in the visible light range such electronic transitions in visible light range are possible in multiplely conjugated systems with many alternating single and double bonds 61 even with partial breakage of the π bond conjugation in colored molecules at the initial stage reactions with hydroxyl radicals or free chlorine molecules the color level can be significantly reduced and further breakages of π bonds can eventually wipe out long range conjugations that can lead to a very low level of color in the treated water recycle test 1 was performed with the treated water and the result showed the similar trend to that of the urine sample mixed with tap water starting from 24 units before the reaction the value jumped to 48 units after 1 h then it steadily decreased to 6 units after 4 h recycle test 2 did not show such sudden increase in color but showed a steadily decreasing trend to 6 units after 4 h both recycle tests of 1 and 2 showed reaction times reduced by two hours to reach the target color units compared to that of the tap water mixture removal of ammonia from the urine sample by the electrochemical reaction was performed while a report was published on the direct treatment of urea by the electrochemical method under highly basic condition 62 it is believed that the treatment of urea in urine is working through the removal of ammonia under electrochemical oxidation reaction it was reported that the ammonia removal rate from both direct oxidation at the anode and indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radical was too slow and the conversion of ammonia to n2 was mostly achieved by the external addition of chloride ion 41 chlorine molecule formed from the anode reacts with water to form hypochlorous acid hclo which ultimately removes ammonia as the form of n2 gas the reaction mechanisms are shown for the removal of nitrogen in ammonia eq 12 41 and for the removal of ammonium ion eqs 13 16 41 63 65 the chloride ion is regenerated from some reactions where it is working as a catalyst 12 3hocl 2nh3 n2 3h2o 3h 3cl 13 hocl nh4 nh2cl h2o h 14 hocl nh2cl nhcl2 h2o 15 h2o nhcl2 noh 2h 2cl 16 noh nhcl2 n2 hocl h cl the amount of nitrogen in urine sample was quantified by measuring the amount of ammonium cations with the hach salicylate method 66 and the total nitrogen by using the hach tnt persulfate digestion method 67 the results are shown in fig 8 with the removal of ammonium cation a and the removal of total nitrogen b the amount of ammonium cation in urine sample steadily decreased from initial concentration of 18 3 mg l to 2 mg l after 6 h of electrochemical reaction when it was mixed with tap water fig 7 a the addition of the 1st recycle water to the urine simply made the concentration of ammonium cation dropped from 18 3 mg l to 8 7 mg l probably because of increased ph of recycled water which would cause the equilibrium of ammonia in water to be shifted toward left side eq 17 17 nh3 h2o nh4 oh the time needed to reach the same ammonium cation concentration of 2 mg l was merely 4 h which is 2 h shorter than that was needed for the urine sample prepared with tap water the amount of total nitrogen was measured throughout the electrochemical reaction the changes in the amount of total nitrogen are shown in fig 7 b starting from initial total nitrogen concentration of 150 mg l the urine sample prepared with tap was took 6 h for the concentration to decrease to 51 mg l which is equivalent to 66 removal compared to this removal rate the addition of the 1 st recycle water to the urine made the time required to remove 82 of total nitrogen to take just 4 h with the electrochemical oxidation reaction the second recycle made the initial total nitrogen of 150 mg l to drop to 30 mg l in 4 h which is the same as the result from first recycling the recycling of an electrochemically treated urine sample for flush water has been proven to be a good option based on this research 4 conclusions urine was electrochemically treated after dilution with tap water a new type of anode electrode of ti iro2 nano tio2 was prepared and its effectiveness was compared with that of conventional ti iro2 electrode the electrochemical activity of oxides characterized by the integrated charge q of the voltammogram showed that the ti iro2 tio2 electrode was 70 more active than the ti iro2 one the excessive generation of free chlorine and hydroxyl radical from the ti iro2 tio2 electrode was measured to be 28 and 55 respectively the prepared urine sample after dilution with water was electrochemically treated with 40 mm amount of externally added nacl a variety of water quality factors cod color turbidity ammonia and total nitrogen were measured and 72 96 100 85 and 71 of respective removal resulted after 6 h of treatment using recycled water for diluting urine showed even faster treatment results reaching the same or better degree of removal in 4 h of treatment the quality of electrochemically treated urine sample was good enough to be recycled except the possible existence of chlorinated organic substances formed from the reaction between organic substances and reactive chlorine species which was not dealt in this study further study is under proposition to use visible light driven semiconductor materials under the sunlight to remove chlorine from organic moiety acknowledgments the first author d c greatly

of ethanol and terpineol 16 19 wt the thickness of the sprayed tio2 layer was around 80 100 nm it was baked twice at 450 c for 30 min each time the detailed description for the preparation of ti iro2 tio2 electrode is shown elsewhere 32 45 the cathode of the electrochemical reactor was prepared by cutting stainless steel 316 two differently sized electrodes were prepared with the dimensions of 228 420 0 5 mm3 and 35 60 0 5 mm3 each for different experimental purposes scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive x ray sem edx spectroscopic test jsm 7100 f jeol was run to image the surface of the prepared anode an x ray diffraction xrd test was run on the oxide layers with a d8 advance mkii1 xrd bruker 2 2 electrochemical reactor two differently sized electrochemical reactors were prepared a small reactor with 420 ml volume was stacked with electrodes of 35 60 0 5 mm3 and one with 20 l volume was stacked with electrodes of 228 420 0 5 mm3 the anode and cathode were vertically stacked in the reactor the gap between electrodes was maintained at 3 mm electrochemical treatment of urine sample was performed with a batch type reaction electrodes were connected to the dc rectifier i tech electronics co for 4 0 v of running applied potential the input current density was monitored throughout the experiment experiments were run at 25 c 2 3 sample preparation and analytical methods the collected urine was diluted with tap water 1 20 v v urine water for the electrochemical reactions to simulate the volume ratio between urine and toilet flush water the smaller reactor with a volume of 420 ml was used for the efficiency tests volumes of 0 3 0 4 ml were collected at 0 5 10 and 15 min evolution of free chlorine from the electrochemical reaction was tested with 50 mm nacl duksan solution in water hach dr 2000 was used to analyze free chlorine 46 generation of hydroxyl radical was tested by using the disappearance of p nitrosodimethylaniline rno 47 the test sample was prepared by dissolving 67 μm of rno in the aqueous solution of 50 mm of kh2po4 samples were collected at 0 4 10 15 20 and 25 min the disappearance of rno was monitored by the absorbance changes at 440 nm with uv vis spectrometer mecasys urine samples were treated by using electrochemical reaction urine was diluted with water with the same method for the generation of free chlorine test larger reactor with 20 l volume was used for the treatment of urine samples after adding 40 mm amount of nacl externally to the urine sample the electric potential of 4 0 v was applied test samples from the electrochemical reactor were collected every 1 h up to 6 h analytical items were the content of cod ammonia total nitrogen turbidity and color hach dr 2000 was used for the sample analyses with the individual analytical method 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of ti iro2 nano tio2 electrode titanium as a support material has been studied for a long time because of its properties it is hard highly conducting and chemically inert and stable 48 49 its oxide form tio2 has a lot of potentials to be used as the surface of anode electrode because of its property of higher chemical inertness the capability of charge transport through the oxide layer and mechanical stability 50 51 the prepared anode with double oxide layers of tio2 over iro2 was analyzed for its morphology this ti iro2 tio2 electrode was cut into pieces to take an sem image the sem images in fig 1 shows the inner iro2 a and the final nano tio2 coated over the iro2 b the surface and cross sectional morphology of the electrode together with the elemental composition was observed by sem edx jsm 7100 f jeol the crystals of iro2 were grown angular shaped over the ti plate the tio2 layer was completely covering all of the iro2 and the remaining area of ti plate the sem image of fig 1 c shows the junction between the two oxide layers the depths of coated iro2 and tio2 layers were 8 25 μm and 3 66 μm respectively the composition of each layer was confirmed by exd results as shown in fig 2 x 1 and x 2 prepared ti iro2 tio2 was tested for the effective surface area and the generated free chlorine the result is shown in fig 2 a potentiodynamic measurement was performed autolab 302 n metrohm autolab b v at room temperature in 50 mm nacl solution the electrochemically effective surface area was obtained based on the cyclic voltammetry cv the voltammogram in fig 2 a shows obtained cv profiles running under ea between 0 and 0 8 v the extent of faradaically admitted charge depends pretty much linearly on the applied voltage for some metal oxide electrode for such a situation the behavior of electrode is quite equivalent to a capacitor it is known that the electrochemical activity of oxide electrode can be characterized by the integrated charge q of the voltammogram in the potential region between the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction 52 53 as shown in the fig 2 b the integrated charges in anodic current were almost identical to that of integrated cathode current the plot shows that 70 more activity was obtained from the ti iro2 nano tio2 electrode than the ti iro2 electrode in terms of concerned indirect oxidation under consideration the most important electrochemical oxidant may be chlorine 2 free chlorine can react with organic substances and ammonia in urine for the oxidation reactions the amounts of electrochemically generated free chlorine from a 50 mm nacl aqueous solution were measured with the dimension of 35 60 mm2 the running efficiencies between ti iro2 and ti iro2 tio2 anodes were compared based on the generated amounts of free chlorine the result is shown in fig 2 c the applied voltage for the experiment for generation of free chlorine experiment was maintained at 4 0 v with the given current density of 11 ma cm2 4 95 mg l 1 cm2 of free chlorine was generated in one hour from the ti iro2 tio2 electrode while 3 86 mg l 1 cm2 was generated from the ti iro2 electrode the excessive amount of free chlorine generated from the ti iro2 tio2 was 28 higher than that from the ti iro2 one it is known that rno has a very high 2nd order rate constant of 1 25 1010 l mol 1 s 1 with hydroxyl radical and working as a hydroxyl radical scavenger 54 55 an aqueous solution with 67 μm of rno and 50 mm kh2po4 was prepared the amount of generated hydroxyl radicals was compared between the ti iro2 and the ti iro2 tio2 anodes with the indirect quantification of hydroxyl radical by the disappearance of rno samples were collected each at 0 4 10 15 20 and 25 min the disappearance of rno was plotted with ln rno rno o versus time in minutes the result is shown in fig 3 the plots in fig 3 show the linearly disappearing trends of rno with time when the slopes of 0 011of the ti iro2 anode and 0 017 of the ti iro2 tio2 anode were compared it could be determined that the ti iro2 tio2 anode generates 55 more hydroxyl radicals than the ti iro2 in a given time frame 3 2 experimental results from the treatment of urine sample the collected human urine was diluted in a 1 20 with water 1 20 v v urine water considering the normal volume ratio between urine and flush water in flush toilets electrochemical treatment of urine sample was performed using a cell with a ti iro2 tio2 anode and a stainless steel 316 cathode in order to focus more on the recycling of the treated urine sample further experiments were performed by diluting fresh urine with treated water recycle test instead of pristine tap water the diluted urine sample was added with external nacl 40 mm a large volume reactor of 20 l was used in this experiment an applied potential of 4 0 v was maintained throughout the experiments analytical samples of 50 ml were collected before applying the voltage and the same amount was collected each hour for up to 6 h of the run the initial ph of the solution before treatment was 8 9 and it changed to 9 1 after 6 h of electrochemical reaction meaning not much change in ph was observed throughout the experiment removal of cod in the urine sample by the electrochemical reaction was performed because the removal of contaminants in urine sample is significantly affected by the presence of organic substances that compete for the generated hydroxyl radicals and active chlorine species 56 the experimental result is shown in fig 4 the changes of cod in urine sample were measured by the hach reactor digestion method 57 starting from the initial cod of 149 the level of cod steadily decreased up to 2 h then the removal of rate became slow up to 3 h the removal of cod became steady again after 3 h and reached to cod level of 41 which corresponds to 72 removal of cod after 6 h of reaction the changes of color turbidity and the amount of free chlorine were monitored through the 6 h of electrochemical reactions the results are shown in fig 5 the color change of the sample was measured by the hach platinum cobalt standard method 58 the color unit of the fresh sample was 23 before the reaction then suddenly increased to 50 after 1 h after which it began to steadily decrease to 1 resulting in 96 removal after 6 h the turbidity was measured by the hach absorptometric method 59 the turbidity of 16 units before the reaction was eventually steadily decreased to an undetectable range after 6 h because increased ph led to the precipitation of alkali earth metal ions with the corresponding forms of calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide eqs 10 and 11 the amount of free chlorine was measured by the hach dnp method 46 the detected amount of free chlorine has fluctuated at low concentration levels between 0 1 and 0 3 mg l throughout 5 h reaction then suddenly after 6 h of reaction the concentration surged to 157 mg l meaning no more removable substances remained in the sample solution after 5 h of reaction breakpoint the electrochemically treated water was recycled as mixing water for fresh urine to test the feasibility of building a toilet without liquid discharge there was no external nacl addition for the sample preparation when recycled water was mixed with fresh urine recycle tests were repeated two times recycle 1 and 2 where recycle 2 meant the 2nd recycle of treated water the results of turbidity removal by electrochemical reactions are shown in fig 6 turbidity was continuously removed from the urine sample which was mixed with fresh tap water the original 24 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit was reduced to 1 ntu after 6 h there was sudden drop of turbidity to 7 ntu after simply mixing urine with recycled water even before electrochemical reaction it is a general idea that higher ph conditions help reduce the turbidity of the solution because of sedimentation of alkali bases would be accelerated under basic condition 60 dilution of urine sample with recycled water with the ph value of 9 1 demonstrated the drop in turbidity by the settling down of some stably suspending colloid particles the time needed for the turbidity to drop to the proposed ntu of 1 by the electrochemical reaction was drastically reduced to 4 h which is 2 h less than the result taken from urine sample mixed with pristine tap water further recycle of treated water showed almost the same trend of turbidity removal as the first recycle color from the organic substance can be removed by breaking the conjugations of π bonds with the reactions of hydroxyl radicals and or free chlorine molecules the degree of removal of color from the urine sample by the electrochemical reaction was measured recycle tests were performed by using treated waters to be mixed with fresh urine the results are shown in fig 7 under electrochemical reaction the urine sample prepared with tap water showed the sudden increase in color to 108 units after 1 h of running from 28 units before the reaction then the color decreased steadily to 6 units after 6 h the appearance of color from organic molecules is caused by the electronic transitions from bonding molecular orbital to antibonding molecular orbital π π or n π which is happening in the visible light range such electronic transitions in visible light range are possible in multiplely conjugated systems with many alternating single and double bonds 61 even with partial breakage of the π bond conjugation in colored molecules at the initial stage reactions with hydroxyl radicals or free chlorine molecules the color level can be significantly reduced and further breakages of π bonds can eventually wipe out long range conjugations that can lead to a very low level of color in the treated water recycle test 1 was performed with the treated water and the result showed the similar trend to that of the urine sample mixed with tap water starting from 24 units before the reaction the value jumped to 48 units after 1 h then it steadily decreased to 6 units after 4 h recycle test 2 did not show such sudden increase in color but showed a steadily decreasing trend to 6 units after 4 h both recycle tests of 1 and 2 showed reaction times reduced by two hours to reach the target color units compared to that of the tap water mixture removal of ammonia from the urine sample by the electrochemical reaction was performed while a report was published on the direct treatment of urea by the electrochemical method under highly basic condition 62 it is believed that the treatment of urea in urine is working through the removal of ammonia under electrochemical oxidation reaction it was reported that the ammonia removal rate from both direct oxidation at the anode and indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radical was too slow and the conversion of ammonia to n2 was mostly achieved by the external addition of chloride ion 41 chlorine molecule formed from the anode reacts with water to form hypochlorous acid hclo which ultimately removes ammonia as the form of n2 gas the reaction mechanisms are shown for the removal of nitrogen in ammonia eq 12 41 and for the removal of ammonium ion eqs 13 16 41 63 65 the chloride ion is regenerated from some reactions where it is working as a catalyst 12 3hocl 2nh3 n2 3h2o 3h 3cl 13 hocl nh4 nh2cl h2o h 14 hocl nh2cl nhcl2 h2o 15 h2o nhcl2 noh 2h 2cl 16 noh nhcl2 n2 hocl h cl the amount of nitrogen in urine sample was quantified by measuring the amount of ammonium cations with the hach salicylate method 66 and the total nitrogen by using the hach tnt persulfate digestion method 67 the results are shown in fig 8 with the removal of ammonium cation a and the removal of total nitrogen b the amount of ammonium cation in urine sample steadily decreased from initial concentration of 18 3 mg l to 2 mg l after 6 h of electrochemical reaction when it was mixed with tap water fig 7 a the addition of the 1st recycle water to the urine simply made the concentration of ammonium cation dropped from 18 3 mg l to 8 7 mg l probably because of increased ph of recycled water which would cause the equilibrium of ammonia in water to be shifted toward left side eq 17 17 nh3 h2o nh4 oh the time needed to reach the same ammonium cation concentration of 2 mg l was merely 4 h which is 2 h shorter than that was needed for the urine sample prepared with tap water the amount of total nitrogen was measured throughout the electrochemical reaction the changes in the amount of total nitrogen are shown in fig 7 b starting from initial total nitrogen concentration of 150 mg l the urine sample prepared with tap was took 6 h for the concentration to decrease to 51 mg l which is equivalent to 66 removal compared to this removal rate the addition of the 1 st recycle water to the urine made the time required to remove 82 of total nitrogen to take just 4 h with the electrochemical oxidation reaction the second recycle made the initial total nitrogen of 150 mg l to drop to 30 mg l in 4 h which is the same as the result from first recycling the recycling of an electrochemically treated urine sample for flush water has been proven to be a good option based on this research 4 conclusions urine was electrochemically treated after dilution with tap water a new type of anode electrode of ti iro2 nano tio2 was prepared and its effectiveness was compared with that of conventional ti iro2 electrode the electrochemical activity of oxides characterized by the integrated charge q of the voltammogram showed that the ti iro2 tio2 electrode was 70 more active than the ti iro2 one the excessive generation of free chlorine and hydroxyl radical from the ti iro2 tio2 electrode was measured to be 28 and 55 respectively the prepared urine sample after dilution with water was electrochemically treated with 40 mm amount of externally added nacl a variety of water quality factors cod color turbidity ammonia and total nitrogen were measured and 72 96 100 85 and 71 of respective removal resulted after 6 h of treatment using recycled water for diluting urine showed even faster treatment results reaching the same or better degree of removal in 4 h of treatment the quality of electrochemically treated urine sample was good enough to be recycled except the possible existence of chlorinated organic substances formed from the reaction between organic substances and reactive chlorine species which was not dealt in this study further study is under proposition to use visible light driven semiconductor materials under the sunlight to remove chlorine from organic moiety acknowledgments the first author d c greatly

intensity turbidity and organic load of biochemical oxygen demand which still not achieved the discharged requirement by department of environment and led to detrimental to the aquatic life photocatalysis process is one of the promising method in wastewater treatment due to its advantages this study reports on the pomse treatment using photocatalysis process in presence of zno polyethylene glycol zno peg nanoparticles the characterization results using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy show that there are no impurities present in the samples and presenting the nature and chemical bonds of zno peg besides having less agglomeration and smaller average in size 25 150 nm compared to commercial zno 25 200 nm zno peg nanoparticles have a great potential in degradation of pomse and this is supported with the results obtained from the experimental works four potential factors which are different type of a photocatalysts b ph of the pomse c zno peg loading and d concentration of pomse were evaluated for the significance design of experiment it is found that all the main factors were significant with contributions of a 66 b 73 c 84 and d 84 respectively to the pomse degradation accordingly the most favorable condition for the photocatalysis degradation process of pomse is under ph 6 5 in presence of 0 5 g l zno peg for the 50 of pomse dilution it is believed that this integrated approach can be implemented in the industry to achieve discharged standard of pomse and maintain the green environment for future generation keywords palm oil mill secondary effluent photocatalysis zinc oxide nanoparticles 1 introduction palm oil mill effluent pome has high organic load chemical oxygen demand cod 45 500 65 000 mg l biochemical oxygen demand bod 21 500 28 500 mg l which is detrimental to aquatic life 1 although pome is not the only waste generated during processing of fresh fruit bunch ffb however it is the most expensive and difficult waste to manage by mill operators for these reasons raw pome or partially treated pome is still being discharged into nearby rivers or land as this is the easiest and cheapest method for disposal however excessive quantities of untreated pome deplete a water body of its oxygen and suffocate aquatic life 2 therefore these wastes must be genuine treated before they are discharged to the environment in order to comply with the environmental protection for the receiving water in malaysia more than 85 of the millers employ open ponding system for the pome treatment and the implementation is carried out by the department of environment doe that was enacted in the year 1984 3 according to the doe malaysia the safe level for pome waste to be discharged is fixed at 100 ppm of biochemical oxygen demand bod level while the chemical oxygen demand cod level must be reduced down to 50 ppm before being discharged into the waterway 4 however the existing ponding treatment failed to meet the permitted level for discharge where the bod and cod level are still higher than the discharge threshold 1 the standard discharge limit that had been set by doe malaysia and environment quality act eqa 1974 one of the post treatment technology that had been used is electrocoagulation process and by using combine persulphate hydrogen peroxide oxidation 5 6 this pre treated pome is also known as palm oil mill secondary effluent pomse as they have been treated at the first stage although the pomse has been through under a few series of treatment the characteristics of pomse still not meet the discharged criterion by the department of environment where the values of the cod bod as well as the colour intensity still high and considered as dangerous to be discharged 7 the reduction of oils and grease however is seen to be significantly reduced at the primary treatment therefore another treatment is proposed in this study to solve this problem which is the photocatalytic degradation process recent study by ng cheng et al shows that pome photo treatment using ultraviolet uv activated photocatalysts leads to another interesting pathway 8 in 20 h of uv exposure around 80 of the organics in the pome was photomineralized significantly this process is known as photocatalytic degradation and considered as an emerging technology of wastewater treatment this process is promising as in the past decades photocatalytic techniques have been shown many advantages over the traditional technique including quick oxidation no formation of polycyclic products and oxidation of pollutants up to the parts per billion ppb level 9 however the pomse treatment using photocatalytic degradation process is still limited different nanoparticles have been used in photocatalysis studies such as titanium dioxide tio2 zinc oxide zno tin dioxide sno2 cadmium sulphide cds iron oxide fe2o3 etc for various wastewater treatment 10 among these nanoparticles zno has been claimed as the most effective photocatalyst when the photocatalytic degradation by zno is applied hydroxyl radicals oh are generated as soon as the photocatalyst is illuminated by the uv light these radicals then attacked the organic compounds in the bulk solution and consequently results in the degradation of the pomse the degradation efficiency can be further enhanced by studying the factors that influencing the photocatalysis performance according to the theory recently chiranont et al confirmed that the industrial newsprint wastewater was successfully treated by photocatalytic degradation process with utilization of self synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles in the presence of polyethylene glycol as capping agent zno peg 11 however the characterization of zno peg and its application for pomse treatment has not been investigated therefore this proposed research aims to characterize the zno peg nanoparticles in order to identify its chemical bonds crystallinity and purity consequently zno peg nanoparticles then be used for the photocatalytic degradation of pomse under various parameters it is believed that the standard discharge value can be achieved via photocatalytic degradation process for the industrial pomse treatment for the effective treatment of organic pollutant in the pomse it is essential for the incorporation of semiconductor in the photo reactor and understanding operation parameters or factors leading the kinetics of photo mineralization 12 the best condition for pomse treatment via photocatalytic degradation process has not been establish yet which brings to the fact that the required condition that are suitable to run the experiments on the pomse is unknown therefore to ensure the pomse treatment done under the required condition every factor and parameter that will influence the photocatalysis performance of zno photocatalysts had been employed the amount of photocatalysts desired to effect a photocatalysis process grossly affect the overall photo degradation process just as its concentration is likewise significant to certify a true heterogeneous photocatalytic system 13 other factor that is very vital in photocatalytic treatment is ph of the solution and has been generally testified in literature 14 15 it really affects the charge on the photocatalysts particle the point at which conductance and valance bands are positioned as well as size of agglomeration of the particles 16 this is supported by hairom et al as the samples exhibited maximum dye rejection at ph 9 by using zno as photocatalysts 17 in industrial dye wastewater treatment preliminary or primary treatment may include ph adjustment flow equalization or chemical addition which is extremely important to the overall treatment process it is very important to regulate ph since treatment processes can be harmed by dangerous acidic or basic wastes regulation of this parameter may be necessary to meet effluent levels specified for secondary treatment in general ph is a crucial characteristic of wastewater because it determines degradation efficiency in order to study the effect of ph on photocatalytic activity of zno peg 0 015 g l of peg the photocatalytic activity has been studied in different ph condition ph 4 6 5 and 9 moreover the photocatalysts morphologies play a major role in establishing relationship between organic compounds existing in wastewater the surface structure of the photocatalysts 18 other study had been conducted by hairom et al which claimed the morphology of the photocatalysts associated well with the photocatalytic activity during the treatment due to the effective surface area 19 the other factor determines by the concentration and nature of the pollutants which will affected the photocatalytic degradation capacity of the photocatalysts 20 concentration of pomse is one of important factors which affecting the effectiveness of the photocatalytic degradation process this is due to the nature and concentration of organic constituents present in the pomse where the higher the concentration of pomse the higher the concentration of organic constituents in the pomse if the surface of the photocatalyst is highly saturated with the concentration of the pollutants there will be a reduction on the photonic efficiency and the catalyst becomes deactivated 28 thus by varying all the factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of the zno nanoparticles would give the preeminent result in favoring the best condition of the photocatalysis process this research would be focusing in treating the pomse the important factors which will largely affected the result ph of the solution type of the photocatalysts photocatalyst s loading and the concentration of the pomse hence the outcome would give a best picture in relating the morphological of the photocatalysts with their photocatalytic degradation performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis and characterization of zno nanoparticles zno peg nanoparticles were synthesized by precipitation method in a manner corresponding to hairom et al 21 it was prepared by added 0 15 m of oxalic acid dehydrate solution obtained from r m marketing essex uk slowly into 0 1 m zinc acetate dehydrate solution obtained from r m marketing essex uk with the molar ratio 1 5 it was conducted in the room temperature 25 c by vigorous stirring in the presence of polyethylene glycol for the preparation of zno peg nanoparticle 0 015 peg obtained from r m marketing essex uk was transferred into the mixture after 5 min of reaction then the mixture was stirred for 12 h under room temperature the reaction yields precipitate which was filtered and dried at 100 c in oven for 1 h to remove the excessive water afterward the obtained precipitate was calcined in furnace under 550 c for 3 h to remove all the impurities commercial zno nanoparticles from sigma aldrich usa was used in comparison with the zno peg characterizations of the zno nanoparticles were conducted by x ray diffractometer xrd bruker axs gmbh model fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir agilent technologies cary 600 series and high resolution transmission electron microscopy tem 120kv jeol jem arm 200 f the purity crystallinity and morphology of the zno peg and commercial zno were shown in figs 3 5 it was clearly shown that the nanoparticle that had been employed during this study contains high purity and crystallinity of zno with the nanoparticle size ranging from 7 to 30 nm zno peg and 50 to 140 nm commercial zno 2 2 pomse sampling raw pomse samples were directly collected from the polishing pond of the ponding treatment system of palm oil mill located in johor as depicted in flow diagram in fig 1 the samples were transported to the laboratory in 5 l sample bottles and stored at 4 c until they need to be treated the initial pomse characteristics such as the wastewater characteristics such as colour intensity turbidity dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod were analyzed by using standard methods cod was digested by using cod reactor and determined using hach digital reactor block drb200 according to method 8000 reactor digestion method cod were determined after being diluted by dilution factor df of 3 the method of bod consists of filling with sample to overflowing an airtight bottle of the specified size and incubating it at the specified temperature for 5 d dissolved oxygen is measured initially and after incubation and the bod is computed from the difference between initial and final do 2 3 photocatalytic treatment of pomse the photocatalytic treatment of pomse were conducted in different factors which governing the photocatalytic performance of the zno peg nanoparticles first and foremost the photocatalysis process will be conducted by using different photocatalysts which were zno peg and commercial zno at 0 dilution ph 9 and 0 08 g l loading then the experiment ensued by using 0 08 g l zno peg as photocatalyst in various ph which were ph 4 6 5 and 9 next the zno nanoparticle photocatalytic performance was studied in term of various loading which were 0 08 g l 0 5 g l and 0 9 g l respectively last but not least the final factor was via different dilution of the pomse 50 75 and 100 for the 75 and 50 of the pomse dilution the water was added to dilute the pomse the uv lamp predominately emit at 365 nm with the definite power of 15 w will be employed as the light source the schematic diagram of the laboratory scale of this study is shown in fig 2 before starting the photocatalysis process the mixture will be well agitated at 300 rpm for 30 min in the dark to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium of photocatalyst the head stirrer had been used to agitate the mixture the operation temperature was kept constant at room temperature 25 c by immerse it inside the water bath 5 ml of degraded wastewater was sampled at the interval of 5 min and the mixed solution pomse and zno was separated by using centrifuge gyrozen 1736r model for 20 min the treated wastewater will be analyzed in term of colour intensity turbidity bod and cod the colour intensity was determined with uv vis spectrophotometer labomed inc spectro uv2650 dissolved oxygen and bod were measured by using do meter hach h280 g cod and the turbidity was analyzed using dr6000 spectrophotometer and turbidity meter respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 zno nanoparticles characterization 3 1 1 ftir analysis of zno nanoparticles the purity nature and chemicals bonds of zno nanoparticles were shown in fig 3 both of photocatalyst with different type of photocatalyst zno peg and commercial zno were characterized to examine their components by using ftir fig 3 a indicated the ir spectra of zno peg while fig 3 b designated for commercial zno a series of sharp peaks appears at bands 3000 4000 cm 1 at stretching mode for ir of zno peg and commercial zno the bands were indicated by the oh components presented at the sample this was due to the adsorption of the water vapor from the surrounding and the moisture residue during the synthesizing of the photocatalyst the peaks at 1634 and 620 cm 1 were corresponded to zn o stretching and deformation vibration respectively the similar result was reported by tamuly et al 22 c2o complex band at about 2350 cm 1 was founded at both peaks of zno peg and commercial zno due to the oxidative decomposition of organic species 23 3 1 2 xrd analysis of zno nanoparticles the crystallinity of the zno nanoparticles had been shown by the xrd pattern in fig 4 the crystalline regions of the zno nanoparticles had been clearly observed at the range 30 to 40 2θ values the results of the xrd patterns corresponded well with the standard wurzite structure at planes 1 0 0 0 0 2 and 1 0 1 furthermore it was found that the less intense peak at the range 40 to 80 which indicates the high crystallinity of the different forms of zno 3 1 3 tem analysis of zno nanoparticles the morphology and size of the zno peg and commercial zno nanoparticle were studied using tem as shown in fig 5 the result showed a less agglomerated particle for zno peg nanoparticle but otherwise for the commercial zno it was observed that the particle size of zno peg provided almost similar size compared to commercial zno nanoparticles the particle size of zno peg ranged from 25 to 150 nm and particle size of commercial zno ranged from 25 to 200 nm respectively according the result in average zno peg give a smaller particle in due to the high performance of the peg as capping agent compared to commercial zno during the synthesis of the zno nanoparticle the smaller size of the zno peg is due to the peg capped performance during the synthesize of the zinc oxide nanoparticles as proven by tshabalala et al and rahim et al 24 25 3 2 effect of various photocatalyst as mentioned by holenda et al 26 the particle size of the photocatalysts performing an important role in creating relationship between organic compounds existing in wastewater and the surface structure of the photocatalysts fig 6 shows the percentage of colour degradation in presence of different photocatalysts commercial zno and zno peg the effect of particle size of the photocatalysis can be explained in terms of available surface area of zno for the reaction as both of the photocatalysts had been characterized in term of their morphological and size the photocatalytic degradation efficiency can be examined through the colour removal percentage of pomse after treated therefore the effect of various zno photocatalysts on colour degradation was analyzed in fig 6 the photocatalysts process was carried out under the most optimum ph 6 5 obtained from the previous experiment to degrade maximum colour degradation based on the fig 6 and table 1 it was noticeable that zno peg is the most effective photocatalyst to degrade the pomse colour since it has the highest amount of colour removal percentage 73 fig 6 also shown that the percentage of colour removal with addition of commercial zno are slightly less effective than zno peg by 56 this is might be due to the smaller average size of nanoparticles and less agglomerate particles that had been exhibited by zno peg compared to commercial zno the peg polymer did benefit in reducing the agglomeration of the nanoparticles as it will adsorb to the nanoparticles surface and control the size during their formation 27 since a larger ratio of surface to volume of a photocatalysts would aid a better photocatalytic activity it is very significant to control the size of zno nanoparticles during its synthesizing to produce a greater ratio of surface to volume turbidity can be inferred as a degree of the relative clarity of water and showing the presence of the minute particle and the silt in the pomse table 1 shows the pattern of turbidity removal percentage under different photocatalysts commercial zno and zno peg based on the figure the highest percentage of turbidity removal for colour removal in the presence of zno peg and commercial zno is 96 and 94 respectively at ph 6 5 and 0 08 g l loading this results are supported by previous analysis in fig 6 which means as the colour of the pomse reduce the turbidity value reduced as well all the turbidity results portray the highest percentage of turbidity reduced between all the photocatalysts as the results different are very insignificant bod values and cod reduction percentage of the treated pomse under different photocatalysts is shown in the table 1 the lowest bod value and cod reduction was attained by zno peg as photocatalysts by 101 mg l and 92 respectively compared to commercial zno which was merely 167 mg l and 67 even though the result was not meet the discharge criterion by the eqa they will undergo few series of treatment by using membrane photocatalytic reactor which make the result much lower compared to the photocatalysis process this pattern indicates during the photocatalysis process the colour of pomse was not hundred percent degraded which resulting intermediates that contributes to the bod and cod of the treated pomse 28 as a conclusion zno peg nanoparticles has better performance compared to commercial zno by 73 colour degradation of pomse 3 3 effect of various ph fig 7 and table 2 showed the pattern of the colour degradation and turbidity reduction of pomse under various ph in 30 min duration based on the result obtained the photocatalysis process under ph 6 5 indicated the highest percentage of colour degradation in contrast to ph 4 and ph 9 which was 73 while the highest turbidity reduction was possessed under ph 9 by 95 2 even though ph depicted the highest turbidity reduction there was only slightly different comparing to the turbidity reduction of ph 6 5 which was by 0 27 after being treated the declination of the bod value is observed as in table 2 where ph 6 5 shows the lowest bod value which is 101 mg l compared to the ph 9 103 mg l and ph 4 144 mg l low value of bod indicates that there is low quantity of the organic pollutant which reduced the consumption of the oxygen in the water cod percentage of the treated pomse were relatively associated with the bod value the highest reduction of cod was possessed by zno peg by 92 followed by commercial zno which obtained the same cod reduction percentage based on this finding it exhibited that the photocatalytic degradation of pomse was favoured to ph 6 5 in basic and acidic solution ph 4 and ph 9 the colour of pomse did removed even though the percentage were slightly low compared to ph 6 5 the results showed that the ph significantly affected the degradation efficiency the impact of ph on photocatalytic performance has been extensively studied and reported in the literature through adoption of point of zero charge pzc on photocatalyst s surface 29 at pzc on photocatalysts surface there is minimum interaction between the water contaminants and photocatalyst because of the absence of electrostatic force it has been established that at lower ph the functional groups are protonated thus raising the positive charge of the photocatalyst surface which decreases the degradation of organic molecules alkaline conditions have generally inhibited the rate of photocatalytic degradation hence it can be concluded that ph 6 5 is the best condition for degrading dye particles since it show the highest percentage of dye degradation 3 4 effect of various zno loading effect of zno peg loading from 0 08 to 0 9 g l for photocatalytic degradation of pomse was investigated under ph 6 5 with fixed concentration 25 it can be observed that in fig 8 the colour intensity of the treated pomse decreased significantly when the loading of zno peg at its lowest the high amount of loading increasing the photocatalytic activity however once a saturation phase had been obtained the increase in the loading of the catalyst causes cloudiness in the pomse the effect of the different catalyst loading can be observed where 0 5 g l shows the highest degradation percentage 84 in contrast to 0 08 g l and 0 90 g l 82 and 83 though there are only small differences based on the table 3 it can be analyzed that the most effective loading of a catalyst in the photocatalytic activity is 0 5 g l table 3 shows the trend of the turbidity removal percentage under different loading of photocatalysts 0 50 g l 0 9 g l and 0 08 g l the percentage of turbidity removal of pomse for different loading of zno peg 0 08 g l 0 50 g l and 0 90 g l are 98 95 and 94 the highest turbidity removal obtained was for the loading of 0 08 g l this might be the few amount of the zno peg affected the turbidity reduction percentage bod values of the treated pomse under different zno peg loading is shown in the fig 8 and table 2 the results show that low value of bod 81 mg l for 0 5 g l loading compared to 0 08 g l and 0 9 g l same trend portrays by the cod reduction as 0 5 g l of zno peg cope to reduce the cod by 92 generally when bod levels are high there is a decline in do levels this is because the demand for oxygen by the bacteria is high and they are taking that oxygen from the oxygen dissolved in the water if there is no organic waste present in the water there won t be as many bacteria present to decompose it and thus the bod will tend to be lower and the do level will tend to be higher 4 value greater than 100 mg l is considered as poor and causes stress to the aquatic life therefore the values of bod of treated pomse obtained by using 0 5 g l are lower than 100 mg l as obtained in the experiment shows the efficiency of the treatment the amount of zno peg required to affect a photocatalytic reaction grossly affect the overall process photo degradation just as its concentration is equally important to ensure a true heterogeneous photocatalytic system 30 the high amount of loading increasing the photocatalytic activity however once a saturation phase had been attained the increase in the loading of the catalyst causes cloudiness in the pomse 3 5 effect of various dilution of pomse this experiment was proceeding under optimum ph ph 6 5 and optimum loading 0 5 g l based on the result obtained from the various ph and various loading experiment during this research fig 9 shows the percentage of colour degradation under different concentration of pomse the results obtained for the three different concentrations 0 50 and 75 are 72 84 and 84 respectively this shows that the low concentrated of the pollutant would make the photocatalysis more effective even though only 50 pomse was diluted while at 0 dilution of pomse the percentage of degradation shows the lowest result turbidity level of the pomse was also been investigated to observe the effect of the pomse concentration on the turbidity level table 4 shows the percentage of degradation of pomse for the turbidity under different concentration of the photocatalyst the results obtained for the three different dilution 0 50 and 75 are 90 94 and 94 respectively the highest turbidity reduction was achieved by 50 and 75 dilution this is correlated to the nature of the concentration of organic pollutants where the existence of more organic pollutants can lead to the deactivation of the catalyst hence it can be concluded that at the lowest concentration of pomse the highest degradation can be obtained bod value of the treated pomse is highly influenced by the concentration of the pomse as the concentration of the organic constituents is higher at higher pomse concentration the value of the bod value obtained is also higher this is correlated with the nature of the pomse concentration as shown in the fig 9 at 75 of pomse concentration the bod value obtained is 81 mg l as for the other concentration 0 and 100 the bod value obtained are 201 mg l and 99 mg l this shows the effect of pomse concentration on the bod value and conclude that lowest concentration of pomse have the greatest bod value for the cod reduction 94 cod reduction was reduced successfully by 50 dilution followed by 75 and 0 dilution which were 92 and 66 of cod reduction respectively concentration of pomse is one of important factors which affecting the effectiveness of the photocatalytic degradation process this is due to the nature and concentration of organic constituents present in the pomse where the higher the concentration of pomse the higher the concentration of organic constituents in the pomse if the surface of the photocatalyst is highly saturated with the concentration of the pollutants there will be a reduction on the photonic efficiency and the catalyst becomes deactivated 31 4 conclusion the chemical and physical characteristics of zno peg nanoparticles were successfully characterized by using the x ray diffractometer xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and transmission electron microscopy tem accordingly the favorable condition for pomse treatment is under ph 6 5 and 0 5 g l of zno peg loading for 50 of the dilution of pomse the treated pomse have the percentage of the degraded colour intensity 84 turbidity 94 bod 99 mg l and cod 94 the analysis of the treated pomse results shows that peg capped zno nanoparticles gave a better performance and appropriate to be practiced in industrial wastewater treatment application

intensity turbidity and organic load of biochemical oxygen demand which still not achieved the discharged requirement by department of environment and led to detrimental to the aquatic life photocatalysis process is one of the promising method in wastewater treatment due to its advantages this study reports on the pomse treatment using photocatalysis process in presence of zno polyethylene glycol zno peg nanoparticles the characterization results using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy show that there are no impurities present in the samples and presenting the nature and chemical bonds of zno peg besides having less agglomeration and smaller average in size 25 150 nm compared to commercial zno 25 200 nm zno peg nanoparticles have a great potential in degradation of pomse and this is supported with the results obtained from the experimental works four potential factors which are different type of a photocatalysts b ph of the pomse c zno peg loading and d concentration of pomse were evaluated for the significance design of experiment it is found that all the main factors were significant with contributions of a 66 b 73 c 84 and d 84 respectively to the pomse degradation accordingly the most favorable condition for the photocatalysis degradation process of pomse is under ph 6 5 in presence of 0 5 g l zno peg for the 50 of pomse dilution it is believed that this integrated approach can be implemented in the industry to achieve discharged standard of pomse and maintain the green environment for future generation keywords palm oil mill secondary effluent photocatalysis zinc oxide nanoparticles 1 introduction palm oil mill effluent pome has high organic load chemical oxygen demand cod 45 500 65 000 mg l biochemical oxygen demand bod 21 500 28 500 mg l which is detrimental to aquatic life 1 although pome is not the only waste generated during processing of fresh fruit bunch ffb however it is the most expensive and difficult waste to manage by mill operators for these reasons raw pome or partially treated pome is still being discharged into nearby rivers or land as this is the easiest and cheapest method for disposal however excessive quantities of untreated pome deplete a water body of its oxygen and suffocate aquatic life 2 therefore these wastes must be genuine treated before they are discharged to the environment in order to comply with the environmental protection for the receiving water in malaysia more than 85 of the millers employ open ponding system for the pome treatment and the implementation is carried out by the department of environment doe that was enacted in the year 1984 3 according to the doe malaysia the safe level for pome waste to be discharged is fixed at 100 ppm of biochemical oxygen demand bod level while the chemical oxygen demand cod level must be reduced down to 50 ppm before being discharged into the waterway 4 however the existing ponding treatment failed to meet the permitted level for discharge where the bod and cod level are still higher than the discharge threshold 1 the standard discharge limit that had been set by doe malaysia and environment quality act eqa 1974 one of the post treatment technology that had been used is electrocoagulation process and by using combine persulphate hydrogen peroxide oxidation 5 6 this pre treated pome is also known as palm oil mill secondary effluent pomse as they have been treated at the first stage although the pomse has been through under a few series of treatment the characteristics of pomse still not meet the discharged criterion by the department of environment where the values of the cod bod as well as the colour intensity still high and considered as dangerous to be discharged 7 the reduction of oils and grease however is seen to be significantly reduced at the primary treatment therefore another treatment is proposed in this study to solve this problem which is the photocatalytic degradation process recent study by ng cheng et al shows that pome photo treatment using ultraviolet uv activated photocatalysts leads to another interesting pathway 8 in 20 h of uv exposure around 80 of the organics in the pome was photomineralized significantly this process is known as photocatalytic degradation and considered as an emerging technology of wastewater treatment this process is promising as in the past decades photocatalytic techniques have been shown many advantages over the traditional technique including quick oxidation no formation of polycyclic products and oxidation of pollutants up to the parts per billion ppb level 9 however the pomse treatment using photocatalytic degradation process is still limited different nanoparticles have been used in photocatalysis studies such as titanium dioxide tio2 zinc oxide zno tin dioxide sno2 cadmium sulphide cds iron oxide fe2o3 etc for various wastewater treatment 10 among these nanoparticles zno has been claimed as the most effective photocatalyst when the photocatalytic degradation by zno is applied hydroxyl radicals oh are generated as soon as the photocatalyst is illuminated by the uv light these radicals then attacked the organic compounds in the bulk solution and consequently results in the degradation of the pomse the degradation efficiency can be further enhanced by studying the factors that influencing the photocatalysis performance according to the theory recently chiranont et al confirmed that the industrial newsprint wastewater was successfully treated by photocatalytic degradation process with utilization of self synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles in the presence of polyethylene glycol as capping agent zno peg 11 however the characterization of zno peg and its application for pomse treatment has not been investigated therefore this proposed research aims to characterize the zno peg nanoparticles in order to identify its chemical bonds crystallinity and purity consequently zno peg nanoparticles then be used for the photocatalytic degradation of pomse under various parameters it is believed that the standard discharge value can be achieved via photocatalytic degradation process for the industrial pomse treatment for the effective treatment of organic pollutant in the pomse it is essential for the incorporation of semiconductor in the photo reactor and understanding operation parameters or factors leading the kinetics of photo mineralization 12 the best condition for pomse treatment via photocatalytic degradation process has not been establish yet which brings to the fact that the required condition that are suitable to run the experiments on the pomse is unknown therefore to ensure the pomse treatment done under the required condition every factor and parameter that will influence the photocatalysis performance of zno photocatalysts had been employed the amount of photocatalysts desired to effect a photocatalysis process grossly affect the overall photo degradation process just as its concentration is likewise significant to certify a true heterogeneous photocatalytic system 13 other factor that is very vital in photocatalytic treatment is ph of the solution and has been generally testified in literature 14 15 it really affects the charge on the photocatalysts particle the point at which conductance and valance bands are positioned as well as size of agglomeration of the particles 16 this is supported by hairom et al as the samples exhibited maximum dye rejection at ph 9 by using zno as photocatalysts 17 in industrial dye wastewater treatment preliminary or primary treatment may include ph adjustment flow equalization or chemical addition which is extremely important to the overall treatment process it is very important to regulate ph since treatment processes can be harmed by dangerous acidic or basic wastes regulation of this parameter may be necessary to meet effluent levels specified for secondary treatment in general ph is a crucial characteristic of wastewater because it determines degradation efficiency in order to study the effect of ph on photocatalytic activity of zno peg 0 015 g l of peg the photocatalytic activity has been studied in different ph condition ph 4 6 5 and 9 moreover the photocatalysts morphologies play a major role in establishing relationship between organic compounds existing in wastewater the surface structure of the photocatalysts 18 other study had been conducted by hairom et al which claimed the morphology of the photocatalysts associated well with the photocatalytic activity during the treatment due to the effective surface area 19 the other factor determines by the concentration and nature of the pollutants which will affected the photocatalytic degradation capacity of the photocatalysts 20 concentration of pomse is one of important factors which affecting the effectiveness of the photocatalytic degradation process this is due to the nature and concentration of organic constituents present in the pomse where the higher the concentration of pomse the higher the concentration of organic constituents in the pomse if the surface of the photocatalyst is highly saturated with the concentration of the pollutants there will be a reduction on the photonic efficiency and the catalyst becomes deactivated 28 thus by varying all the factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of the zno nanoparticles would give the preeminent result in favoring the best condition of the photocatalysis process this research would be focusing in treating the pomse the important factors which will largely affected the result ph of the solution type of the photocatalysts photocatalyst s loading and the concentration of the pomse hence the outcome would give a best picture in relating the morphological of the photocatalysts with their photocatalytic degradation performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis and characterization of zno nanoparticles zno peg nanoparticles were synthesized by precipitation method in a manner corresponding to hairom et al 21 it was prepared by added 0 15 m of oxalic acid dehydrate solution obtained from r m marketing essex uk slowly into 0 1 m zinc acetate dehydrate solution obtained from r m marketing essex uk with the molar ratio 1 5 it was conducted in the room temperature 25 c by vigorous stirring in the presence of polyethylene glycol for the preparation of zno peg nanoparticle 0 015 peg obtained from r m marketing essex uk was transferred into the mixture after 5 min of reaction then the mixture was stirred for 12 h under room temperature the reaction yields precipitate which was filtered and dried at 100 c in oven for 1 h to remove the excessive water afterward the obtained precipitate was calcined in furnace under 550 c for 3 h to remove all the impurities commercial zno nanoparticles from sigma aldrich usa was used in comparison with the zno peg characterizations of the zno nanoparticles were conducted by x ray diffractometer xrd bruker axs gmbh model fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir agilent technologies cary 600 series and high resolution transmission electron microscopy tem 120kv jeol jem arm 200 f the purity crystallinity and morphology of the zno peg and commercial zno were shown in figs 3 5 it was clearly shown that the nanoparticle that had been employed during this study contains high purity and crystallinity of zno with the nanoparticle size ranging from 7 to 30 nm zno peg and 50 to 140 nm commercial zno 2 2 pomse sampling raw pomse samples were directly collected from the polishing pond of the ponding treatment system of palm oil mill located in johor as depicted in flow diagram in fig 1 the samples were transported to the laboratory in 5 l sample bottles and stored at 4 c until they need to be treated the initial pomse characteristics such as the wastewater characteristics such as colour intensity turbidity dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod were analyzed by using standard methods cod was digested by using cod reactor and determined using hach digital reactor block drb200 according to method 8000 reactor digestion method cod were determined after being diluted by dilution factor df of 3 the method of bod consists of filling with sample to overflowing an airtight bottle of the specified size and incubating it at the specified temperature for 5 d dissolved oxygen is measured initially and after incubation and the bod is computed from the difference between initial and final do 2 3 photocatalytic treatment of pomse the photocatalytic treatment of pomse were conducted in different factors which governing the photocatalytic performance of the zno peg nanoparticles first and foremost the photocatalysis process will be conducted by using different photocatalysts which were zno peg and commercial zno at 0 dilution ph 9 and 0 08 g l loading then the experiment ensued by using 0 08 g l zno peg as photocatalyst in various ph which were ph 4 6 5 and 9 next the zno nanoparticle photocatalytic performance was studied in term of various loading which were 0 08 g l 0 5 g l and 0 9 g l respectively last but not least the final factor was via different dilution of the pomse 50 75 and 100 for the 75 and 50 of the pomse dilution the water was added to dilute the pomse the uv lamp predominately emit at 365 nm with the definite power of 15 w will be employed as the light source the schematic diagram of the laboratory scale of this study is shown in fig 2 before starting the photocatalysis process the mixture will be well agitated at 300 rpm for 30 min in the dark to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium of photocatalyst the head stirrer had been used to agitate the mixture the operation temperature was kept constant at room temperature 25 c by immerse it inside the water bath 5 ml of degraded wastewater was sampled at the interval of 5 min and the mixed solution pomse and zno was separated by using centrifuge gyrozen 1736r model for 20 min the treated wastewater will be analyzed in term of colour intensity turbidity bod and cod the colour intensity was determined with uv vis spectrophotometer labomed inc spectro uv2650 dissolved oxygen and bod were measured by using do meter hach h280 g cod and the turbidity was analyzed using dr6000 spectrophotometer and turbidity meter respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 zno nanoparticles characterization 3 1 1 ftir analysis of zno nanoparticles the purity nature and chemicals bonds of zno nanoparticles were shown in fig 3 both of photocatalyst with different type of photocatalyst zno peg and commercial zno were characterized to examine their components by using ftir fig 3 a indicated the ir spectra of zno peg while fig 3 b designated for commercial zno a series of sharp peaks appears at bands 3000 4000 cm 1 at stretching mode for ir of zno peg and commercial zno the bands were indicated by the oh components presented at the sample this was due to the adsorption of the water vapor from the surrounding and the moisture residue during the synthesizing of the photocatalyst the peaks at 1634 and 620 cm 1 were corresponded to zn o stretching and deformation vibration respectively the similar result was reported by tamuly et al 22 c2o complex band at about 2350 cm 1 was founded at both peaks of zno peg and commercial zno due to the oxidative decomposition of organic species 23 3 1 2 xrd analysis of zno nanoparticles the crystallinity of the zno nanoparticles had been shown by the xrd pattern in fig 4 the crystalline regions of the zno nanoparticles had been clearly observed at the range 30 to 40 2θ values the results of the xrd patterns corresponded well with the standard wurzite structure at planes 1 0 0 0 0 2 and 1 0 1 furthermore it was found that the less intense peak at the range 40 to 80 which indicates the high crystallinity of the different forms of zno 3 1 3 tem analysis of zno nanoparticles the morphology and size of the zno peg and commercial zno nanoparticle were studied using tem as shown in fig 5 the result showed a less agglomerated particle for zno peg nanoparticle but otherwise for the commercial zno it was observed that the particle size of zno peg provided almost similar size compared to commercial zno nanoparticles the particle size of zno peg ranged from 25 to 150 nm and particle size of commercial zno ranged from 25 to 200 nm respectively according the result in average zno peg give a smaller particle in due to the high performance of the peg as capping agent compared to commercial zno during the synthesis of the zno nanoparticle the smaller size of the zno peg is due to the peg capped performance during the synthesize of the zinc oxide nanoparticles as proven by tshabalala et al and rahim et al 24 25 3 2 effect of various photocatalyst as mentioned by holenda et al 26 the particle size of the photocatalysts performing an important role in creating relationship between organic compounds existing in wastewater and the surface structure of the photocatalysts fig 6 shows the percentage of colour degradation in presence of different photocatalysts commercial zno and zno peg the effect of particle size of the photocatalysis can be explained in terms of available surface area of zno for the reaction as both of the photocatalysts had been characterized in term of their morphological and size the photocatalytic degradation efficiency can be examined through the colour removal percentage of pomse after treated therefore the effect of various zno photocatalysts on colour degradation was analyzed in fig 6 the photocatalysts process was carried out under the most optimum ph 6 5 obtained from the previous experiment to degrade maximum colour degradation based on the fig 6 and table 1 it was noticeable that zno peg is the most effective photocatalyst to degrade the pomse colour since it has the highest amount of colour removal percentage 73 fig 6 also shown that the percentage of colour removal with addition of commercial zno are slightly less effective than zno peg by 56 this is might be due to the smaller average size of nanoparticles and less agglomerate particles that had been exhibited by zno peg compared to commercial zno the peg polymer did benefit in reducing the agglomeration of the nanoparticles as it will adsorb to the nanoparticles surface and control the size during their formation 27 since a larger ratio of surface to volume of a photocatalysts would aid a better photocatalytic activity it is very significant to control the size of zno nanoparticles during its synthesizing to produce a greater ratio of surface to volume turbidity can be inferred as a degree of the relative clarity of water and showing the presence of the minute particle and the silt in the pomse table 1 shows the pattern of turbidity removal percentage under different photocatalysts commercial zno and zno peg based on the figure the highest percentage of turbidity removal for colour removal in the presence of zno peg and commercial zno is 96 and 94 respectively at ph 6 5 and 0 08 g l loading this results are supported by previous analysis in fig 6 which means as the colour of the pomse reduce the turbidity value reduced as well all the turbidity results portray the highest percentage of turbidity reduced between all the photocatalysts as the results different are very insignificant bod values and cod reduction percentage of the treated pomse under different photocatalysts is shown in the table 1 the lowest bod value and cod reduction was attained by zno peg as photocatalysts by 101 mg l and 92 respectively compared to commercial zno which was merely 167 mg l and 67 even though the result was not meet the discharge criterion by the eqa they will undergo few series of treatment by using membrane photocatalytic reactor which make the result much lower compared to the photocatalysis process this pattern indicates during the photocatalysis process the colour of pomse was not hundred percent degraded which resulting intermediates that contributes to the bod and cod of the treated pomse 28 as a conclusion zno peg nanoparticles has better performance compared to commercial zno by 73 colour degradation of pomse 3 3 effect of various ph fig 7 and table 2 showed the pattern of the colour degradation and turbidity reduction of pomse under various ph in 30 min duration based on the result obtained the photocatalysis process under ph 6 5 indicated the highest percentage of colour degradation in contrast to ph 4 and ph 9 which was 73 while the highest turbidity reduction was possessed under ph 9 by 95 2 even though ph depicted the highest turbidity reduction there was only slightly different comparing to the turbidity reduction of ph 6 5 which was by 0 27 after being treated the declination of the bod value is observed as in table 2 where ph 6 5 shows the lowest bod value which is 101 mg l compared to the ph 9 103 mg l and ph 4 144 mg l low value of bod indicates that there is low quantity of the organic pollutant which reduced the consumption of the oxygen in the water cod percentage of the treated pomse were relatively associated with the bod value the highest reduction of cod was possessed by zno peg by 92 followed by commercial zno which obtained the same cod reduction percentage based on this finding it exhibited that the photocatalytic degradation of pomse was favoured to ph 6 5 in basic and acidic solution ph 4 and ph 9 the colour of pomse did removed even though the percentage were slightly low compared to ph 6 5 the results showed that the ph significantly affected the degradation efficiency the impact of ph on photocatalytic performance has been extensively studied and reported in the literature through adoption of point of zero charge pzc on photocatalyst s surface 29 at pzc on photocatalysts surface there is minimum interaction between the water contaminants and photocatalyst because of the absence of electrostatic force it has been established that at lower ph the functional groups are protonated thus raising the positive charge of the photocatalyst surface which decreases the degradation of organic molecules alkaline conditions have generally inhibited the rate of photocatalytic degradation hence it can be concluded that ph 6 5 is the best condition for degrading dye particles since it show the highest percentage of dye degradation 3 4 effect of various zno loading effect of zno peg loading from 0 08 to 0 9 g l for photocatalytic degradation of pomse was investigated under ph 6 5 with fixed concentration 25 it can be observed that in fig 8 the colour intensity of the treated pomse decreased significantly when the loading of zno peg at its lowest the high amount of loading increasing the photocatalytic activity however once a saturation phase had been obtained the increase in the loading of the catalyst causes cloudiness in the pomse the effect of the different catalyst loading can be observed where 0 5 g l shows the highest degradation percentage 84 in contrast to 0 08 g l and 0 90 g l 82 and 83 though there are only small differences based on the table 3 it can be analyzed that the most effective loading of a catalyst in the photocatalytic activity is 0 5 g l table 3 shows the trend of the turbidity removal percentage under different loading of photocatalysts 0 50 g l 0 9 g l and 0 08 g l the percentage of turbidity removal of pomse for different loading of zno peg 0 08 g l 0 50 g l and 0 90 g l are 98 95 and 94 the highest turbidity removal obtained was for the loading of 0 08 g l this might be the few amount of the zno peg affected the turbidity reduction percentage bod values of the treated pomse under different zno peg loading is shown in the fig 8 and table 2 the results show that low value of bod 81 mg l for 0 5 g l loading compared to 0 08 g l and 0 9 g l same trend portrays by the cod reduction as 0 5 g l of zno peg cope to reduce the cod by 92 generally when bod levels are high there is a decline in do levels this is because the demand for oxygen by the bacteria is high and they are taking that oxygen from the oxygen dissolved in the water if there is no organic waste present in the water there won t be as many bacteria present to decompose it and thus the bod will tend to be lower and the do level will tend to be higher 4 value greater than 100 mg l is considered as poor and causes stress to the aquatic life therefore the values of bod of treated pomse obtained by using 0 5 g l are lower than 100 mg l as obtained in the experiment shows the efficiency of the treatment the amount of zno peg required to affect a photocatalytic reaction grossly affect the overall process photo degradation just as its concentration is equally important to ensure a true heterogeneous photocatalytic system 30 the high amount of loading increasing the photocatalytic activity however once a saturation phase had been attained the increase in the loading of the catalyst causes cloudiness in the pomse 3 5 effect of various dilution of pomse this experiment was proceeding under optimum ph ph 6 5 and optimum loading 0 5 g l based on the result obtained from the various ph and various loading experiment during this research fig 9 shows the percentage of colour degradation under different concentration of pomse the results obtained for the three different concentrations 0 50 and 75 are 72 84 and 84 respectively this shows that the low concentrated of the pollutant would make the photocatalysis more effective even though only 50 pomse was diluted while at 0 dilution of pomse the percentage of degradation shows the lowest result turbidity level of the pomse was also been investigated to observe the effect of the pomse concentration on the turbidity level table 4 shows the percentage of degradation of pomse for the turbidity under different concentration of the photocatalyst the results obtained for the three different dilution 0 50 and 75 are 90 94 and 94 respectively the highest turbidity reduction was achieved by 50 and 75 dilution this is correlated to the nature of the concentration of organic pollutants where the existence of more organic pollutants can lead to the deactivation of the catalyst hence it can be concluded that at the lowest concentration of pomse the highest degradation can be obtained bod value of the treated pomse is highly influenced by the concentration of the pomse as the concentration of the organic constituents is higher at higher pomse concentration the value of the bod value obtained is also higher this is correlated with the nature of the pomse concentration as shown in the fig 9 at 75 of pomse concentration the bod value obtained is 81 mg l as for the other concentration 0 and 100 the bod value obtained are 201 mg l and 99 mg l this shows the effect of pomse concentration on the bod value and conclude that lowest concentration of pomse have the greatest bod value for the cod reduction 94 cod reduction was reduced successfully by 50 dilution followed by 75 and 0 dilution which were 92 and 66 of cod reduction respectively concentration of pomse is one of important factors which affecting the effectiveness of the photocatalytic degradation process this is due to the nature and concentration of organic constituents present in the pomse where the higher the concentration of pomse the higher the concentration of organic constituents in the pomse if the surface of the photocatalyst is highly saturated with the concentration of the pollutants there will be a reduction on the photonic efficiency and the catalyst becomes deactivated 31 4 conclusion the chemical and physical characteristics of zno peg nanoparticles were successfully characterized by using the x ray diffractometer xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and transmission electron microscopy tem accordingly the favorable condition for pomse treatment is under ph 6 5 and 0 5 g l of zno peg loading for 50 of the dilution of pomse the treated pomse have the percentage of the degraded colour intensity 84 turbidity 94 bod 99 mg l and cod 94 the analysis of the treated pomse results shows that peg capped zno nanoparticles gave a better performance and appropriate to be practiced in industrial wastewater treatment application

14477,tannin and lignin from pulp and paper wastewater ppw are two compounds that have been proven to cause a variety of toxic effects in several aquatic species aerobic granular sludge ags technology has emerged with strong potential to provide the desired treatment this work presents the first attempt at the microbial degradation of these compounds using ags technology with promising results granules were cultivated within 9 days of operation of the sequencing batch reactor sbr with svi30 of 51 6 ml g achieving steady state within the first three weeks of operation on average cod removal efficiency was 90 granules cultivated from the sbr were transferred into a batch system with real pulp mill effluent tannin lignin removal efficiency was 97 at an initial concentration of 50 mg l and slowly decreased to about 60 when the influent concentration increased to 100 mg l the most prominent species responsible for the degradation of these toxic substances were pseudomonas corynebacteriaceae and flavobacterium these key findings demonstrate the capability of ags to provide adequate treatment for ppw abbreviations ags aerobic granular sludge ppw pulp and paper wastewater keywords aerobic granular sludge industrial wastewater pulp and paper wastewater ppw tannin and lignin wastewater treatment 1 introduction the pulp and paper industry contributes significantly to the canadian and the us economy however the production process of pulp and paper results in significant amount of toxic pollutants the hazards posed by the pollutants cause environmental disturbance to the natural ecosystems while the recycling of pulp and paper wastewater ppw is usually employed to reduce operational costs and to protect the environment 1 the particulate matter present in ppw poses a challenge filtration is necessary to remove excess pollutants prior to water reuse which increases the capital and operating costs of pulp and paper mills pulp and paper wastewater ppw is not biodegradable in nature biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand ratio bod cod of 0 4 2 and contains a diverse range of toxic pollutants that are harmful to marine life 3 ppw exhibits both acute and chronic toxicity 4 causing respiratory issues in several aquatic species 5 contributing heavily to methanogenic toxicity 6 causing mutagenic and carcinogenic effects 7 and other genotoxic effects 3 while several innovative biotechnologies have been recently reviewed for treatment of ppw 3 most of the technologies are quite limited in terms of operation and cost technologies such as membrane bioreactors mbr and reverse osmosis ro systems can be efficient in reducing the effect of dissolved solids in ppw up to 99 however biofouling of the membrane modules causes an increase in maintenance costs anaerobic systems have the potential of removing complex recalcitrant compounds can remove up to 85 of chlorinated phenols but again they prove to be ineffective as the start up time of these systems can be up to 3 months the capital costs of physical chemical processes such as ozonation can cost up to 10 of the overall total construction cost additionally the cost of chemicals increases maintenance costs heavily therefore there is a need for a novel technology that can provide effective treatment at a reasonable cost to produce a high quality pulp product lignin and tannin must be separated to produce a high cellulose fiber pulp such a process results in the production of a considerable volume of tannin and lignin contaminated effluents tannin and lignin are essential plant components comprising 30 of plant biomass 8 the chemical structure of lignin is quite complex in that it is dominated by phenylpropanoid aryl c3 units these units are joined mainly by co and cc bonds making these compounds thermodynamically and chemically stable 9 it is protected by strong van der waal forces on the intermolecular level making it difficult for natural bacterial enzymes to metabolize the compound industrial lignin is combined with industrial chemicals which are isolated as by products these lignin based compounds go through various chemical changes and contain a diverse range of impurities that originate from the specific processing method used therefore the structure and chemical properties of industrial lignin can vary greatly based on the isolation separation method used 10 tannin is a polar polyphenolic compound used by plant biomass to protect against predators and is located mainly in the vacuoles or surface wax of plants 11 tannin tends to contribute towards 50 of the organic content in ppw 6 without treatment tannin can absorb light and heat when discharged into receiving water bodies reducing both the dissolved oxygen and temperature 12 in recent years aerobic granular sludge ags has emerged as a promising technology for ppw treatment the stratified granular structure of aerobic granules allows for the coexistence of an anaerobic core followed by a zone of anoxic conditions and an outer aerobic layer 13 thereby making it possible for different microbes to thrive within the same granule this mechanism provides the necessary conditions for the treatment of recalcitrant organics including phenols and nuclear waste 14 moreover ags can reduce annual maintenance costs and land requirements of domestic wastewater treatment plants by 17 and 75 respectively 15 ags has been tested towards the treatment of several types of industrial waste with extremely toxic and recalcitrant compounds initially ags was used towards the treatment of dairy 16 and pharmaceutical 17 wastewater then it was tested on the treatment of various phenolic compounds 18 as the technology became more versatile it was applied towards the treatment of radioactive and nuclear wastes 19 with time ags holds strong potential to replace many common industrial wastewater treatment technologies because of its ability to degrade a variety of recalcitrant organics in a small footprint the current study is aimed at applying ags technology for the treatment of pulp mill effluent particularly looking into the degradation of tannin and lignin ags has been tested on ppw degrading compounds such as adsorbable organic halides aox 20 and paper mill effluent 21 however to the authors best knowledge this is the first attempt of testing the degradation of tannin and lignin compounds using ags 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and seed sludge a cylindrical acrylic reactor of diameter of 15 mm and 18 l working volume see fig 1 a was used for this study influent was introduced from the bottom of the reactor using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s 15 effluent was decanted from the system at roughly 9 l yielding a 50 volumetric exchange ratio aeration was provided through ceramic micro bubble diffusers at 10 l min corresponding to a superficial air velocity of 2 3 cm s the reactor was operated at a total cycle time of 4 h resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h at this hrt the organic loading rate olr was 6 kg cod m3 day the reactor was operated sequentially as shown in table 1 the inoculum for the sbr in these experiments was return activated sludge ras from the pine creek wastewater treatment plant in calgary canada which employs a biological nutrient removal bnr process the ras samples had a mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of around 6000 mg l the aerated sbr column was inoculated with 4 l of the sludge the initial sludge volume index svi of the seed sludge was 200 ml g with a mean particle size of 110 μm 2 2 media the base feed had sodium acetate as the main carbon source the base feed solution composition is as follows sodium acetate 2 93 g l nh4cl 350 mg l k2hpo4 50 mg l kh2po4 45 mg l cacl2 2h2o 30 mg l mgso4 7h2o 25 mg l feso4 7h2o 20 mg l and microelement solution 1 0 ml l this yielded a cod concentration of 2000 mg l the microelement solution is similar to that used in tay et al 22 2 3 batch studies with ppw once steady state conditions were achieved excess granules found in the effluent of the sbr were transferred to a 2 l column for batch studies with real ppw from millar western forestry products see fig 1b the real ppw had cod bod5 total nitrogen and total phosphate concentrations of 4000 mg l 2300 mg l 12 mg l and 5 mg l respectively this resulted in a bod5 n p ratio of 100 0 5 0 2 signifying that this wastewater is high strength and nutrient deficient additionally the tannin lignin concentration was 250 mg l and total phenol concentration was 42 mg l making this wastewater extremely toxic the total suspended solids tss concentration was about 500 mg l while initial ph of the effluent was 7 50 and had a brownish tint about 800 ml of the mature aerobic granules collected from the sbr were transferred into a 2 l column the column was then inoculated with ppw in step wise increments in the initial stages of the system ppw was diluted with synthetic feed 1 in 10 for proper acclimatization and growth of microorganisms thereafter the dilution was reduced successively ensuring that steady state conditions were met after each increment and results were plotted accordingly the reactor was run on a 24 hour cycle with a manual decant and filling routine being applied on a daily basis the exchange ratio was maintained at 50 similar to that of the sbr 2 4 analytical methods standard methods 23 were used to determine biomass characteristics mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and svi30 for the measurement of svi5 5 min settling time was used instead of 30 min as described by tay et al 22 influent and effluent samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters and were measured for soluble cod scod phosphate po4 3 tannin lignin and total phenols by hach dr 2400 hach company cod high range hr hach kits were used for scod measurements using the usepa reactor digestion method the usepa ascorbic acid method was employed for po4 3 measurements using the reactive phosphorus kits the tyrosine method was utilized for tannin lignin measurements using the tannin and lignin reagent set results are reported as mg l as tannic acid according to this method lastly the 4 aminoantipyrine method was employed using tnt plus 868 for total phenols measurement total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were measured using a shimadzu toc and tn measuring unit toc l and tnm l samples were analyzed in duplicates to account for analytical or measurement precision errors mean particle size and size distribution were measured using a laser particle size analysis system with a measuring range from 0 to 2000 μm malvern mastersizer series 2000 malvern instruments ltd 2 5 microbial community analysis dneasy powersoil kit from qiagen inc md usa was used to extract deoxyribonucleic acid dna from the biomass details of paired end sequencing based on the 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna gene and subsequent analyses are as outlined in hamza et al 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 settling property and biomass concentration svi provides an indication of the settling ability of biomass ags exhibits low svi values 50 ml g which is in sharp contrast to the activated sludge process with svi values in excess of 120 ml g 25 fig 2 b presents the profile of svi during the experiment decreasing svi values can be seen from reactor start up until day 25 this shows the gradual transformation of floccular biomass to granular biomass granules became visible in the reactor after 9 days of operation a stable granular reactor was however achieved after three weeks of operation at this stage the svi was below 50 ml g and the svi5 and svi30 values started converging which is a strong indication of granular sludge systems it is widely accepted that a granular sludge system is attained when the values of svi5 and svi30 are within 10 26 fig 2b also shows the granulation percentage as an indication of the amount of granular biomass that exists in the system and can be calculated by the following equation 100 x svi30 svi5 27 upon initial inoculation with activated sludge the granulation percentage was 35 after achieving steady state conditions the granulation percentage remained around 95 98 for the remainder of the experiments during this time svi5 and svi30 values were below 50 ml g the mlss concentration in the reactor increased over time during the experiment as seen in fig 2a in the first 36 days the mlss values varied from 2000 to 8000 mg l but once a steady biomass growth was attained in the reactor the mlss jumped to a maximum value of 14 000 mg l and stayed consistent for most of the operation although the settling time was decreased from 30 min to 10 min during start up of the system the biomass seemed to recover relatively quickly indicating that the initial seed sludge was quite healthy 3 2 granule size distribution images of the granules snapped with a digital camera are presented in fig 3 the figure shows the granules at day 9 when transition to granular sludge became evident day 21 when granular biomass became dominant in the reactor and day 50 when stable and mature granules dominated the reactor granules from day 21 onwards exhibited a clear and spherical outline at steady state conditions the mean particle size was in the range of 348 μm 977 μm fig 4 presents the particle size distribution on day 9 at the onset of granulation and day 60 mature granules there was a visible shift in the biomass from the beginning of granulation wherein the mean particle size was 129 μm towards a more steady state granular system mean particle size of 548 μm the mean particle size tended to drop as the operational period continued due to drastic environmental changes temperature drop ph shift etc however it was observed that the system was able to recover from those disturbances with relative ease within a couple of days 3 3 reactor performance the sbr was allowed to operate for 150 days to allow for the cultivation and the maturation of strong aerobic granules during this time the cod concentration was maintained at 2000 mg l nitrogen was maintained around 92 mg l and phosphorus around 20 mg l this yielded a cod n p of roughly 100 5 1 cod removal of 97 was maintained throughout the experiment as shown in fig 5 a fig 5b and c present total nitrogen and phosphorus removal profiles the total nitrogen removal efficiency was around 97 phosphorus removal was limited to an average value of 41 achieving a maximum removal of 67 this could be potentially due to the fact that the nutrient growth requirement for heterotrophic growth was met and excess phosphorus was discharged in the effluent controversial results have been reported in the literature with respect to the nutrient requirements for heterotrophic growth municipal wastewater treatment plants typically design their aerobic reactors such that the c n p ratio is maintained at 100 5 1 for proper biomass growth this value is obtained when carbonaceous organic matter ammonia and phosphorus are oxidized in an aerobic reactor yielding the general biomass chemical formula c5h7no2p0 074 28 it is assumed that the amount of nitrogen in biomass is 12 3 and that phosphorus is 20 of the mass of nitrogen this results in a yield coefficient of 0 41 assuming that the substrate removal is 100 however this assumption is invalid as different wastewaters will have different biomass yields this is especially true of industrial wastewaters with a wide variety of pollutants and low removal efficiencies of these compounds 29 these wastewaters often have low yield coefficients as well therefore the c n p ratio of 100 5 1 is inappropriate for these cases when addressing nutrient needs for biological systems it is necessary to consider both the removal efficiency of substrate and yield coefficients for each type of wastewater in a study by ammary 30 the effect of both removal efficiency and observed biomass yield on nutrient requirements was tested using olive mill wastewater and pulp and paper mill effluent the study reported that for aerobic treatment a cod n p ratio of 823 5 1 was sufficient for 83 organic matter removal using olive mill wastewater for ppw 75 of organic matter was removed using the ratio 176 56 1 in addition several authors have reported promising results for nutrient removal by inducing a slow feeding strategy to increase the consumption of easily biodegradable substrate by paos phosphorus accumulating organisms or gaos glycogen accumulating organisms 31 these microorganisms have the ability to convert substrate into storage polymers and can thereby maintain a relatively low growth rate during the aerobic phase 32 this helps in maintaining a stable granular system while achieving high removal efficiencies of nutrients however this strategy was not applied in this study as ppw tends to be deficient in nutrients the removal efficiencies of the sbr are shown in fig 5 3 4 application of aerobic granules to pulp and paper wastewater fig 6 shows the removal efficiencies of all the pollutants including tannin and lignin measured as mg l of tannic acid in the batch column throughout the period of operation the reactor maintained a high removal of cod achieving an average removal of 94 up to day 52 the system maintained a healthy granular biomass during this time however upon further increase in the concentration of ppw to 1 in 2 dilution there was a noticeable decrease in the removal of cod averaging 80 leading up to the end of the experiments this reduced cod removal is attributable to the limited microbial growth in an increased toxic environment additionally an increased lignin concentration could limit the removal of cod as lignin tends to be difficult to biodegrade 8 however in the literature cod removals have been reported to be much lower for both biological and physical treatment abhishek et al 33 reported a 67 reduction in cod with a mixed bacterial culture using serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii with model and kraft lignin from a paper mill in uttar pradesh india ugurlu et al 34 used electrocoagulation for the treatment of lignin and phenol from paper mill effluents in turkey and reported a 75 removal of cod using an al electrode this proves that ags technology is superior in degrading organics from ppw in comparison to other technologies the toc further confirms this finding with an average removal of 95 during the operational period nitrogen in the wastewater was degraded easily however phosphorus removal was limited as mentioned previously due to the growth requirement of heterotrophic bacteria being met at a reduced cod p ratio therefore in future studies supplemental phosphorus will not be added to the system and a higher cod p ratio will be used such that excess phosphorus does not remain in the effluent the addition of phosphorus is not a requirement for granule stability 35 which makes this technology ideal for ppw treatment this will significantly reduce the cost of biological treatment as the addition of nutrients increases the operational costs requirement tannin and lignin were removed up to 97 within the first 10 days of operation this is most likely attributed to removal by adsorption onto the granule surface along with biodegradation as the granular biomass grew within the batch system the adsorptive capacity of the biomass also increased however after a certain period of time the adsorption capacity of the aerobic granules is exhausted and the removal is dominated by bacterial degradation after day 10 the removal efficiency of tannin and lignin decreased to 66 as the biomass growth stabilized thus limiting the adsorption sites for the compounds and microbial degradation prevailed further studies are required to confirm the removal of tannin and lignin by adsorption in combination with biodegradation after day 10 and up to day 30 the removal efficiency increased with time attaining a maximum degradation of 87 at day 30 once the next increment in concentration was introduced the removal efficiency dropped to about 50 and increased again with time up to 60 on day 50 overall the average removal efficiency of tannin and lignin was 74 in a study by wu et al 36 white rot fungi were used for lignin degradation achieving over 71 reduction in lignin and 46 reduction in cod however in most biological systems including conventional activated sludge the range of lignin removal is from 16 to 63 37 38 therefore ags technology proves to be one of the most superior treatment methods for tannin and lignin degradation in pulp and paper mill effluent 3 5 microbial analysis tannin and lignin degradation is mostly attributed to the pseudomonas class as reported by many authors 8 39 both pseudomonadacaeae and moraxellaceae represented 34 7 of the microbial community within the granular biomass in the flocculent sludge these species only comprised 1 2 of the community in several studies these species have been able to degrade a diverse range of toxic pollutants 40 41 showcasing the versatility of these bacteria they have the ability to degrade not only natural lignin but also aromatic rings 42 lignin degradation tests performed by wang et al 43 confirmed that pseudomonas sp was able to degrade the high molecular weight lignin and tannins into lower weight fractions which other species could capably degrade this is the primary reason why granular sludge was superior to floccular sludge in terms of the degradation potential of tannin and lignin other species present in the granular biomass capable of degrading tannin and lignin are corynebacteriaceae 9 40 and flavobacterium 8 62 shen et al 44 along with several other authors 45 46 have highlighted the potential of corynebacteriaceae towards the degradation of complex aromatic compounds this specie was used as a model organism in these studies due to its fast growth non pathogenic quality and ability to metabolize aromatic compounds flavobacterium is another key specie used in lignin degradation along with other phenolics 8 flavobacterium is also a significant floc forming bacteria and produces great extracellular polymers which binds cells together and creates aerobic granules 47 a higher abundance of these species was evident in aerobic granules as compared to floccular sludge aerobic granules have been known to be dominated by filaments ciliates and rotifers as they provide a structural backbone for bacterial species in the granular system 48 49 microbial varieties from the batch experiments sample taken on day 60 and microscopic photos of the biomass taken from the sbr are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively 4 conclusion this study investigated the treatability of ppw using ags technology particularly towards the degradation of industrial tannin and lignin granules were attained within 9 days of operation of the sbr achieving steady state within the first three weeks of operation batch experiments showed that tannin lignin removal efficiency was 97 at an initial concentration of 50 mg l and slowly decreased to about 60 at a concentration of 100 mg l the most prominent species responsible for the degradation of these toxic substances were pseudomonas corynebacteriaceae and flavobacterium there was a noticeable decrease in the removal efficiency of tannin and lignin after 10 days of operation this could be potentially due to the fact that granular biomass growth stabilized in the reactor thus limiting the adsorptive sites for the compounds at this point microbial degradation prevailed in the system however this hypothesis is yet to be confirmed and further research is needed to study the routes of removal for tannin and lignin in ags the present work demonstrates the capability of ags to provide adequate treatment for ppw acknowledgement this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada the authors would also like to acknowledge the support

degradation of tannin and lignin compounds using ags 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and seed sludge a cylindrical acrylic reactor of diameter of 15 mm and 18 l working volume see fig 1 a was used for this study influent was introduced from the bottom of the reactor using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s 15 effluent was decanted from the system at roughly 9 l yielding a 50 volumetric exchange ratio aeration was provided through ceramic micro bubble diffusers at 10 l min corresponding to a superficial air velocity of 2 3 cm s the reactor was operated at a total cycle

the sbr in these experiments was return activated sludge ras from the pine creek wastewater treatment plant in calgary canada which employs a biological nutrient removal bnr process the ras samples had a mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of around 6000 mg l the aerated sbr column was inoculated with 4 l of the sludge the initial sludge volume index svi of the seed sludge was 200

similar to that used in tay et al 22 2 3 batch studies with ppw once steady state conditions were achieved excess granules found in the effluent of the sbr were transferred to a 2 l column for batch studies with real ppw from millar western forestry products see fig 1b the real ppw had cod bod5 total nitrogen and total phosphate concentrations of 4000 mg l 2300 mg l 12 mg l and 5 mg l respectively this resulted in a bod5 n p ratio of 100 0 5 0 2 signifying that this wastewater is high strength and nutrient deficient additionally the tannin lignin concentration was 250 mg l and total phenol concentration was 42 mg l making this wastewater extremely toxic the total suspended solids tss concentration was about 500 mg l while initial ph of the effluent was 7 50 and had a brownish tint about 800 ml of the mature aerobic granules collected from the sbr were transferred into a 2 l column the column was then inoculated with ppw in step wise increments in the initial stages of the system ppw was diluted with synthetic feed 1 in 10 for proper acclimatization and growth of microorganisms thereafter the dilution was reduced successively ensuring that steady state conditions were met after each increment and results were plotted accordingly the reactor was run on a 24 hour cycle with a manual decant and filling routine being applied on a daily basis the exchange ratio was maintained at 50 similar to that of the sbr 2 4 analytical methods standard methods 23 were used to determine biomass characteristics mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and svi30 for the measurement of svi5 5 min settling time was used instead of 30 min as described by tay et al 22 influent and effluent samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters and

organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were measured using a shimadzu toc and tn measuring unit toc l and tnm l samples were analyzed in duplicates to account for analytical or measurement precision

ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna gene and subsequent analyses are as outlined in hamza et al 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 settling property and biomass concentration svi provides an indication of the settling ability of biomass ags exhibits low svi values 50 ml g which is in sharp contrast to the activated sludge process with svi values in excess of 120 ml g 25 fig 2 b presents the profile of svi during the experiment decreasing svi values can be seen from reactor start up until day 25 this shows the gradual transformation of floccular biomass to granular biomass granules became visible in the reactor after 9 days of operation a stable granular reactor was however achieved after three weeks of operation at this stage the svi was below 50 ml g and the svi5 and svi30 values started converging which is a strong indication of granular sludge systems it is widely accepted that a granular sludge system is attained when the values of svi5 and svi30 are within 10 26 fig 2b also shows the granulation percentage as an indication of the amount of granular biomass that exists in the system and can be calculated by the following equation 100 x svi30 svi5 27 upon initial inoculation with activated sludge the granulation percentage was 35 after achieving steady state conditions the granulation percentage remained around 95 98 for the remainder of the experiments during this time svi5 and svi30 values were below 50 ml g the mlss concentration in the reactor increased over time during the experiment as seen in fig 2a in the first 36 days the mlss values varied from 2000 to 8000 mg l but once a steady biomass growth was attained in the reactor the mlss jumped to a maximum value of 14 000 mg l and stayed consistent for most of the operation although the settling time was decreased from 30 min to 10 min during start up of the system the biomass seemed to recover relatively quickly indicating that the initial seed sludge was quite healthy 3 2 granule size distribution images of the granules snapped with a digital camera are presented in fig 3 the figure shows the granules at day 9 when transition to granular sludge became evident day 21 when granular biomass became dominant in the reactor and day 50 when stable and mature granules dominated the reactor granules from day 21 onwards exhibited a clear and spherical outline at steady state conditions the mean particle size was in the range of 348 μm 977 μm fig 4 presents the particle size distribution on day 9 at the onset of granulation and day 60 mature granules there was a visible shift in the biomass from the beginning of granulation wherein the mean particle size was 129 μm towards a more steady state granular system mean particle size of 548 μm the mean particle size tended to drop as the operational period continued due to drastic environmental changes temperature drop ph shift etc however it was observed that the system was able to recover from those disturbances with relative ease within a couple of days 3 3 reactor performance the sbr was allowed to operate for 150 days to allow for the cultivation and the maturation of strong aerobic granules during this time the cod concentration was maintained at 2000 mg l nitrogen was maintained around 92 mg l and phosphorus around 20 mg l this yielded a cod n p of roughly 100 5 1 cod removal of 97 was maintained throughout the experiment as shown in fig 5 a fig 5b and c present total nitrogen and phosphorus removal profiles the total nitrogen removal efficiency was around 97 phosphorus removal was limited to an average value of 41 achieving a maximum removal of 67 this could be potentially due to the fact that the nutrient growth requirement for heterotrophic growth was met and excess phosphorus was discharged in the effluent controversial results have been reported in the literature with respect to the nutrient requirements for heterotrophic growth municipal wastewater treatment plants typically design their aerobic reactors such that the c n p ratio is maintained at 100 5 1 for proper biomass growth this value is obtained when carbonaceous organic matter ammonia and phosphorus are oxidized in an aerobic reactor yielding the general biomass chemical formula c5h7no2p0 074 28 it is assumed that the amount of nitrogen in biomass is 12 3 and that phosphorus is 20 of the mass of nitrogen this results in a yield coefficient of 0 41 assuming that the substrate removal is 100 however this assumption is invalid as different wastewaters will have different biomass yields this is especially true of industrial wastewaters with a wide variety of pollutants and low removal efficiencies of these compounds 29 these wastewaters often have low yield coefficients as well therefore the c n p ratio of 100 5 1 is inappropriate for these cases when addressing nutrient needs for biological systems it is necessary to consider both the removal efficiency of substrate and yield coefficients for each type of wastewater in a study by ammary 30 the effect of both removal efficiency and observed biomass yield on nutrient requirements was tested using olive mill wastewater and pulp and paper mill effluent the study reported that for aerobic treatment a cod n p ratio of 823 5 1 was sufficient for 83 organic matter removal using olive mill wastewater for ppw 75 of organic matter was removed using the ratio 176 56 1 in addition several authors have reported promising results for nutrient removal by inducing a slow feeding strategy to increase the consumption of easily biodegradable substrate by paos phosphorus accumulating organisms or gaos glycogen accumulating organisms 31 these microorganisms have the ability to convert substrate into storage polymers and can thereby maintain a relatively low growth rate during the aerobic phase 32 this helps in maintaining a stable granular system while achieving high removal efficiencies of nutrients however this strategy was not applied in this study as ppw tends to be deficient in nutrients the removal efficiencies of the sbr are shown in fig 5 3 4 application of aerobic granules to pulp and paper wastewater fig 6 shows the removal efficiencies of all the pollutants including tannin and lignin measured as mg l of tannic acid in the batch column throughout the period of operation the reactor maintained a high removal of cod achieving an average removal of 94 up to day 52 the system maintained a healthy granular biomass during this time however upon further increase in the concentration of ppw to 1 in 2 dilution there was a noticeable decrease in the removal of cod averaging 80 leading up to the end of the experiments this reduced cod removal is attributable to the limited microbial growth in an increased toxic environment additionally an increased lignin concentration could limit the removal of cod as lignin tends to be difficult to biodegrade 8 however in the literature cod removals have been reported to be much lower for both biological and physical treatment abhishek et al 33 reported a 67 reduction in cod with a mixed bacterial culture using serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii with model and kraft lignin from a paper mill in uttar pradesh india ugurlu et al 34 used electrocoagulation for the treatment of lignin and phenol from paper mill effluents in turkey and reported a 75 removal of cod using an al electrode this proves that ags technology is superior in degrading organics from ppw in comparison to other technologies the toc further confirms this finding with an average removal of 95 during the operational period nitrogen in the wastewater was degraded easily however phosphorus removal was limited as mentioned previously due to the growth requirement of heterotrophic bacteria being met at a reduced cod p ratio therefore in future studies supplemental phosphorus will not be added to the system and a higher cod p ratio will be used such that excess phosphorus does not remain in the effluent the addition of phosphorus is not a requirement for granule stability 35 which makes this technology ideal for ppw treatment this will significantly reduce the cost of biological treatment as the addition of nutrients increases the operational costs requirement tannin and lignin were removed up to 97 within the first 10 days of operation this is most likely attributed to removal by adsorption onto the granule surface along with biodegradation as the granular biomass grew within the batch system the adsorptive capacity of the biomass also increased however after a certain period of time the adsorption capacity of the aerobic granules is exhausted and the removal is dominated by bacterial degradation after day 10 the removal efficiency of tannin and lignin decreased to 66 as the biomass growth stabilized thus limiting the adsorption sites for the compounds and microbial degradation prevailed further studies are required to confirm the removal of tannin and lignin by adsorption in combination with biodegradation after day 10 and up to day 30 the removal efficiency increased with time attaining a maximum degradation of 87 at day 30 once the next increment in concentration was introduced the removal efficiency dropped to about 50 and increased again with time up to 60 on day 50 overall the average removal efficiency of tannin and lignin was 74 in a study by wu et al 36 white rot fungi were used for lignin degradation achieving over 71 reduction in lignin and 46 reduction in cod however in most biological systems including conventional activated sludge the range of lignin removal is from 16 to 63 37 38 therefore ags technology proves to be one of the most superior treatment methods for tannin and lignin degradation in pulp and paper mill effluent 3 5 microbial analysis tannin and lignin degradation is mostly attributed to the pseudomonas class as reported by many authors 8 39 both pseudomonadacaeae and moraxellaceae represented 34 7 of the microbial community within the granular biomass in the flocculent sludge these species only comprised 1 2 of the community in several studies these species have been able to degrade a diverse range of toxic pollutants 40 41 showcasing the versatility of these bacteria they have the ability to degrade not only natural lignin but also aromatic rings 42 lignin degradation tests performed by wang et al 43 confirmed that pseudomonas sp was able to degrade the high molecular weight lignin and tannins into lower weight fractions which other species could capably degrade this is the primary reason why granular sludge was superior to floccular sludge in terms of the degradation potential of tannin and lignin other species present in the granular biomass capable of degrading tannin and lignin are corynebacteriaceae 9 40 and flavobacterium 8 62 shen et al 44 along with several other authors 45 46 have highlighted the potential of corynebacteriaceae towards the degradation of complex aromatic compounds this specie was used as a model organism in these studies due to its fast growth non pathogenic quality and ability to metabolize aromatic compounds flavobacterium is another key specie used in lignin degradation along with other phenolics 8 flavobacterium is also a significant floc forming bacteria and produces great extracellular polymers which binds cells together and creates aerobic granules 47 a higher abundance of these species was evident in aerobic granules as compared to floccular sludge aerobic granules have been known to be dominated by filaments ciliates and rotifers as they provide a structural backbone for bacterial species in the granular system 48 49 microbial varieties from the batch experiments sample taken on day 60 and microscopic photos of the biomass taken from the sbr are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively 4 conclusion this study investigated the treatability of ppw using ags technology particularly towards the degradation of industrial tannin and lignin granules were attained within 9 days of operation of the sbr achieving steady state within the first three weeks of operation batch experiments showed that tannin lignin removal efficiency was 97 at an initial concentration of 50 mg l and slowly decreased to about 60 at a concentration of 100 mg l the most prominent species responsible for the degradation of these toxic substances were pseudomonas corynebacteriaceae and flavobacterium there was a noticeable decrease in the removal efficiency of tannin and lignin after 10 days of operation this could be potentially due to the fact that granular biomass growth stabilized in the reactor thus limiting the adsorptive sites for the compounds at this point microbial degradation prevailed in the system however this hypothesis is yet to be confirmed and further research is needed to study the routes of removal for tannin and lignin in ags the present work demonstrates the capability of ags to provide adequate treatment for ppw acknowledgement this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada the authors would also like to acknowledge the support

14478,this study evaluated the inactivation kinetics and the bactericidal mechanism of chlorine dioxide towards pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 on a laboratory scale with the view of determining the optimal operational conditions of its application as an alternative disinfectant in water treatment bacteria inactivation was conducted in batch reactors at varied disinfectant concentrations ph temperature and initial bacteria densities in buffered disinfectant demand free water the bactericidal mechanism in terms of the effect on the permeability of the outer and cytoplasmic cell membranes and the morphology of the cells were explored at the highest studied concentration 5 0 mg l at least 5 log reductions in bacterial population were observed for each strain of bacteria chlorine dioxide inactivation showed a stronger sensitivity to changes in water ph conditions with the inactivation rate at 8 5 being at least 4 fold of what pertained at 6 5 but efficiency was less impacted by changes in the initial bacteria density a rise in temperature from 4 c to 15 c resulted in approximately 56 increase in the inactivation rate of s aureus chlorine dioxide was found to increase the permeability of outer and cytoplasmic cell membranes and consequently resulting in the release of vital nuclear materials which strongly correlated with loss of cell activity or death however from tem micrographs significant morphological damages or cells lysis was not observed these results provide vital data on operational strategies to enhance efficient disinfection of water with chlorine dioxide whilst monitoring regulatory requirements on disinfection by products keywords chlorine dioxide pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus disinfection kinetics 1 introduction chlorine dioxide clo2 is a powerful oxidant with broad spectrum biocidal activity 1 it has thus found considerable application as a sanitizer in the food industry 2 3 decreasing biofouling in industrial cooling water systems 4 5 disinfection of potable and wastewater 6 7 and in the pulp industry as a bleaching agent for producing excellent strong and bright fibers 1 8 most especially in potable and wastewater disinfection it has proven to be an excellent alternative technology to conventional chlorination against the threats of potential waterborne pathogenic and infectious agents such as bacteria viruses and protozoa 9 11 besides the regular application as a disinfectant in water treatment recent reports have also indicated promising potentials for the oxidation and removal of pharmaceutical residues such as diclofenac 12 tetracyclines 13 and sulfamethoxazole 14 in wastewaters chlorine dioxide inactivates microbial threats by selective oxidation where a single electron is usually abstracted this results in the formation of chlorite clo2 and chlorate clo3 as the main by products with chlorite constituting approximately 70 15 of the total reaction by products 1 clo2 e clo2 2 2clo2 2oh clo2 clo3 h2o chlorites levels in drinking water are increasingly being regulated due to potential health concerns associated with them the who recently reaffirmed a maximum acceptable threshold for chlorite in drinking water as 0 7 mg l 16 the us epa also regulates the maximum contaminant level mcl for chlorite in drinking water at 1 0 mg l 17 consequently the maximum residual disinfectant levels mrdl for chlorine dioxide in drinking water is enforced at 0 8 mg l in the united states the associated challenge in the potable water treatment industry thus lies with satisfying the regulatory guidelines without compromising the adequacy of disinfection this is further exacerbated by the increasing reports of some bacterial strains developing resistance to antibiotics in water due to inadequate disinfection 18 19 in this regard designing and operating an efficient chlorine dioxide disinfection system for either potable water or wastewater and simultaneously controlling the formation of deleterious disinfection by products would require due consideration of suitable operational conditions to a target microorganism in a recent communication 20 we assessed the efficiency of chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant against escherichia coli under different operational conditions of water treatment in addition to a proposed bactericidal mechanism however it is well established that the intrinsic susceptibilities of organisms to disinfectants vary widely 21 22 and thus an appropriate determination of optimal operational conditions of a disinfectant would partly be dependent on the target organism a broader data regarding the disinfection of other bacterial species with chlorine dioxide thus becomes necessary pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram negative bacterium that is ubiquitous in the environment and able to adapt to several conditions it could also be found in water including swimming pools hot tubs and tap water 23 25 indeed the transmission via hospital tap water has been described as highly significant 26 there are even reports of p aeruginosa having been isolated from bottled water 25 it is often described as an opportunistic pathogen due to its association with life threatening ailments in burn and surgical patients and in immunocompromised patients in hospital environments it is also a common cause of infections in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis 27 staphylococcus aureus on the other hand is prevalent in diverse food products such as meat and milk 28 29 additionally it could as well be found in environmental water samples 30 31 the methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa strains have particularly gained considerable attention in recent times owing to the risks of transmitting potential infections from animals to humans 32 in previous related studies designed to monitor the efficiency of chlorine dioxide at controlling these strains of bacteria relatively high concentrations of the disinfectant were employed 33 34 such concentrations however may not be suitable for satisfying regulatory requirements when applied for disinfecting drinking water moreover the available data from a systematic study in literature involving the use of chlorine dioxide to inactivate p aeruginosa and s aureus is quite limited in the present work the kinetics of chlorine dioxide inactivation of p aeruginosa and s aureus were studied under varied conditions of oxidant concentration water ph temperature and initial bacterial density the bactericidal mechanism of chlorine dioxide on the bacteria strains was also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and preparation of suspension culture collection strains of p aeruginosa atcc 27853 and s aureus atcc 29213 were obtained from the microbiology discipline university of kwazulu natal westville bacterial cell suspensions were prepared for the inactivation studies by growing the stock cultures in 100 ml of lysogeny broth lb merck south africa contained in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask and incubated for 18 24 h at 37 c cells were then harvested by centrifuging at 6000 x g for 5 min at 4 c washed twice in phosphate buffered saline pbs 10 mm at ph 7 4 and pellets suspended in an oxidant demand free odf buffered water to an initial density of approximately 108 cfu ml 2 2 chlorine dioxide preparation and measurement stock solutions of chlorine dioxide were prepared as described previously 20 35 by oxidizing approximately 25 w v solutions of sodium chlorite naclo2 in a gas generating bottle with a dilute solution of sulphuric acid h2so4 2 m the generated gas was harvested through a stream of compressed air into a connecting chlorine scrubber system which contained a saturated solution of sodium chlorite 10 w v to scrub contaminants such as chlorine gas chlorine dioxide gas was collected in a connecting bottle of demand free deionized water the concentrations of the prepared stock solutions were analyzed by the iodometric method whilst the residual concentrations were determined by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method 35 2 3 bacteria inactivation kinetics each of the inactivation kinetic reactions of p aeruginosa and s aureus with chlorine dioxide were carried out in a 500 ml of sterile oxidant demand free odf deionized water buffered with phosphate buffered saline pbs in a glass batch reactor prior to each inactivation reactions glasswares were soaked in 10 mg l chlorine dioxide solution for 4 h and thoroughly rinsed with deionized water to remove all possible chlorine dioxide consuming species that might interfere with the applied dose during the reaction bacterial suspensions estimated to yield a final concentration of 108 cfu ml based on prior calibrations were added to the water in the reactor and allowed to equilibrate with the surrounding temperature under continuous stirring with a magnetic stirrer to ensure uniform mixing throughout the reaction period samples of bacterial suspensions from the reactor were withdrawn before the addition of the chlorine dioxide to determine the initial bacteria populations subsequently calculated desired concentrations of chlorine dioxide 0 5 1 0 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 mg l were added to initiate the reaction in the reactor five milliliters samples were withdrawn with 10 ml sterile syringes at predetermined time points into tubes containing excess 0 1 m sodium thiosulphate na2s2o3 solutions to immediately quench the residual chlorine dioxide and consequently stopping the reaction enumerations of bacteria were determined by the standard spread plate technique on nutrient agar merck south africa after appropriate dilutions and incubated at 37 c for 24 h the influence of water temperature and ph on the rate and degree of chlorine dioxide inactivation of each bacteria strain considered in this study were also assessed inactivation kinetic reactions as described above were conducted at different temperatures with the reaction water matrix at ph 8 05 maintained at 4 15 22 30 and 37 2 c and allowed to equilibrate with the surrounding temperature before initiating the reaction chlorine dioxide was applied at an initial dose of 2 0 mg l in each case based on preliminary trials at room temperature which yielded at least 2 log 99 inactivation credits of each bacteria such levels of reduction were considered appropriate to indicate possible significant effects of the operational parameters on inactivation to determine the effect of changes in water ph on the inactivation kinetics experiments were similarly carried out at 22 2 c by varying the ph in the range of 6 5 9 in relation to the ph conditions usually encountered in natural water it should be noted that all inactivation experiments for each bacterium were carried out independently and measurements made in triplicates 2 4 effect of bacterial density on the kinetics of clo2 disinfection the bacteria cultures of the studied organisms were grown for 18 24 h into the stationary phase in a lysogeny broth under agitation at 37 c cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 6000 x g washed twice with sterile pbs ph 8 05 and subsequently resuspended in a buffered 100 ml odf water to obtain the stock bacteria density at an approximate count of 1 2 108 cfu ml this was estimated from a predetermined data between optical densities od measured at 600 nm with a spectrophotometer and cell density cfu ml the stock cultures were serially diluted to obtain approximate cell densities of 107 106 and 105 cfu ml in 100 ml of the reaction matrix contained in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks each of the different densities of s aureus and p aeruginosa were treated with 2 5 mg l and 1 0 mg l of clo2 respectively which were expected to produce at least 2 0 log inactivation as obtained from the experimental results of section 2 3 portions of each sample were withdrawn prior to chlorine dioxide treatment as a control and processed simultaneously to determine and confirm the initial bacterial density in each case sampling and enumeration of bacteria were carried out as described above 2 5 mechanism of action of chlorine dioxide disinfection of bacteria experiments were designed to monitor the bactericidal mechanisms of chlorine dioxide in terms of the effect on the permeability of the outer cell membrane the cytoplasmic membrane and the morphology of the cells 2 5 1 cell outer membrane permeability the non polar permeability probe 1 n phenylnaphthylamine npn uptake assay as described previously 36 37 was used to determine the effect of clo2 on the permeability of the outer cell membrane of gram negative bacteria p aeruginosa in brief a 10 mm stock solution of npn was prepared in acetone a mid logarithmic phase od600 value of 0 5 0 02 bacterial cultures grown in 100 ml lb at 37 c were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min washed twice in hepes n 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine n 2 ethanesulphonic acid buffer 5 mm ph 7 4 and then suspended in 15 ml fresh portions of the same buffer to obtain a cell stock approximately 3 0 ml each of the stock samples were withdrawn into tubes and exposed to varying concentrations of clo2 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 mg l for 10 min and quenched effectively with sodium thiosulphate to prevent the residual clo2 from interfering with npn fluorescence negative control cell samples were identically processed except for the addition of clo2 whilst the treatment with edta 1 0 mm which is known to possess strong outer membrane permeability characteristic was utilized as a positive control npn was subsequently added up to 10 μm final concentration the changes in fluorescence as a function of time were monitored with a perkin elmer ls 55 fluorescence spectrophotometer slit width 5 0 nm excitation λ 350 nm and emission λ 420 nm up to a maximum where no further increases could be observed the maximum fluorescence values were expressed as npn uptake fobs fo f100 fo 100 where fobs is the observed npn fluorescence at a given concentration of clo2 fo is the background npn fluorescence of bacterial cell suspension in buffer but without clo2 and f100 is the fluorescence of npn upon treatment with 1 0 mm of edta triplicate measurements were made for each sample 38 2 5 2 disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane the effect of clo2 on the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane was studied by monitoring the release of cytoplasmic components such as nucleic acids which absorb uv light strongly at 260 nm overnight cultures as described above were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min and twice washed in autoclaved pbs 10 mm ph 7 4 pellets were resuspended in 10 ml portions of the buffer and treated with varying concentrations of clo2 0 5 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 mg l control samples were identically processed except for the clo2 treatment approximately 2 0 ml of the cell suspensions were sampled at 5 min intervals and centrifuged 6000 x g 2 min immediately to separate the bacterial cells from the supernatant the optical densities of the supernatants were then determined at 260 nm with a nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer thermo scientific it is to be noted that in this protocol clo2 was not quenched before centrifuging because the quenching agent sodium thiosulphate was observed to absorb at a very close wavelength 254 nm as the nucleic acids which might interfere with the measured absorbances chlorine dioxide solution however was not found to absorb at this wavelength results were expressed as

in absorbance that might be due to different cell densities in the assay tubes 2 5 3 transmission electron microscopy tem analysis the changes to the morphology of the bacterial cells due to the chlorine dioxide treatment was examined by tem 39 40 in this process suspensions of bacteria in pbs 10 mm ph 7 4 were treated with 4 0 mg l clo2 sufficient for yielding at least 4 0 log inactivation for 10 min in a batch reactor approximately 1 0 ml of the treated samples were pipetted into eppendorf tubes and pelleted by centrifuging at 5000 x g for 5 min at 25 c pelleted samples were fixed with a phosphate buffered ph 7 4 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution and kept overnight at 4 c the sample suspension was washed in 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 4 and suspended in 0 5 osmium tetroxide for post fixation samples were dehydrated sequentially with 30 50 75 and 100 acetone and infiltrated first with equal parts of resin and acetone for 4 h followed by a whole resin for 20 h the specimens were orientated in a mold of whole resin and polymerized in an oven for 8 h at 70 c thin sections of samples were prepared with ultra microtome leica em uc7 germany and stained with 2 uranyl acetate and subsequently with lead citrate the prepared grids were examined using jem 2100 jeol co japan and the changes in the cell wall thickness were analyzed with item e 23082007 software olympus soft imaging solutions gmbh germany 2 6 data analysis bacteria inactivation data were best fit by the cavg hom cah model 41 42 expressed as 3 log nt no kc n avg t m 4 cavg co cf where nt no is the survival ratio of the microorganism under consideration after inactivation k is the microbial inactivation rate constant co and cf are the initial and final disinfectant concentrations mg l respectively and t is the contact time of exposing the disinfectant to the microorganism m is a model parameter called the hom exponent whilst n is the coefficient of dilution model parameters were determined by minimising the error sum of square ess deviations between the observed and predicted log nt no of the inactivation data using microsoft excel solver microsoft corp 2016 the student t test based on p value at 95 confidence level was used to evaluate the statistical significance of data from independent measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation kinetics at different chlorine dioxide concentrations the log inactivation levels for chlorine dioxide disinfection of p aeruginosa and s aureus are summarised in fig 1 expectedly the inactivation credits achieved generally increased with an increase in the applied initial concentration of chlorine dioxide the inactivation curves at the various applied doses were typically nonlinear but rather characterized by a rapid initial exponential reduction of the bacterial population which was followed by a slow kinetic phase to produce a tailing moreover the corresponding levels of inactivation were predominantly a function of the applied dose when compared with the influence of the contact time this was evident in the observation that at any applied concentration of chlorine dioxide the differences in the level of log inactivation obtained at t 2 min and t 60 min were mostly statistically insignificant p 0 05 it thus suggests that the use of ct disinfectant concentration c x contact time t credits to estimate the efficiency of inactivation largely becomes unreliable meanwhile in comparing the susceptibilities of the bacterial strains a consideration of the level of log reduction of inactivated cells is vital at 1 0 mg l clo2 dose 2 0 log reduction of p aeruginosa was observed whilst 2 5 mg l dosage was rather required to achieve at least 2 0 log inactivation in the case of s aureus on the contrary when cells were exposed to 5 0 mg l approximately 5 log and 6 log reductions for p aeruginosa and s aureus respectively were obtained several interpretations for this phenomenon have been proposed and chiefly among this is the vitalist hypothesis of chemical disinfection 43 in this principle it is suggested that a strain of bacteria consists of subpopulations of different fractions dependent on the type of organism which intrinsically possess diverse susceptibilities to a disinfectant exposed at given time 44 from this assumption it could be presumed that the more susceptible fractions of p aeruginosa were rapidly inactivated at 1 0 mg l whilst higher concentrations of chlorine dioxide were required to effectively kill the relatively more resistant subpopulations similarly relatively higher doses were required to produce a significant change in the population of s aureus due to the presence of more resistant fractions the declining rate of inactivation which results in the slow kinetic phase is thus a direct consequence of the diversity of the bacterial population possessing different responses to the varying concentrations of the disinfectant however notably 0 5 mg l was virtually inactive to the strains of bacteria considered in this study for example notwithstanding the amount of contact time allowed for a reaction within 1 h less than 0 3 log inactivation was measured usually in drinking water it is recommended that the applied dose should not exceed 1 5 mg l 7 from our results such concentrations may not be adequate for water containing a high amount of bacteria population in table 1 a summary of the inactivation rate constants and the estimated model parameters from the cavg hom model eq 3 is presented these were computed by minimising the error sum of squares ess between the log nt no values from the observed experimental data and the predicted from the cavg hom using the solver function in microsoft excel version 2016 from the table a value of m 1 is an indication that the microbial survival plot at a given concentration shows a tailing effect whereas a shoulder is signified by m 1 42 an increase in the rate of inactivation is indicated by a higher k value whilst n shows the sensitivity of the concentration to the rate of inactivation 41 the model parameters further emphasize the non linear characteristic of chlorine dioxide inactivation of p aeruginosa s aureus as well as e coli 20 in water 3 2 effect of ph on chlorine dioxide disinfection of bacteria the variation of water ph on the kinetics of bacterial inactivation by chlorine dioxide is shown in fig 2 the plot depicts the inactivation rate constants of a pseudo first order kinetic reaction between chlorine dioxide and the bacteria cells at various water ph conditions where the model parameters m and n from eq 3 were assumed to be unity n set as 1 because only a single concentration was utilised 45 it must be emphasized that for all inactivation experiments the initial densities of bacteria were not affected by any of the ph conditions considered in the present study in determining the rate constants only the rapid initial phase which followed the first order kinetics was considered because the difference between the log inactivation data at the transition points and the end of the tailing phase of the kinetic curves supporting information s1 were largely found to be statistically insignificant p 0 05 the rate of bacteria inactivation essentially increased with increasing ph and the most effective inactivation measurements were recorded in the alkaline ph conditions under similar experimental conditions varying the ph from 6 5 to 8 5 resulted in approximately 4 fold and 7 fold increases in the inactivation rates of s aureus and p aeruginosa respectively these results profoundly indicate a substantial influence of water ph on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide disinfection the role of ph has considerably become a subject of contradiction among researchers it is widely regarded that unlike free chlorine the effectiveness of chlorine dioxide spans over a wide range of ph conditions 10 46 and essentially unaffected by changes in water ph conversely other researchers have reported of a significant influence of ph on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide inactivation of microbes 47 48 it has been suggested that the observed increased reactivity of chlorine dioxide under alkaline conditions may be due to the formation of more reactive transient species consisting of the oh ions chlorine dioxide and the substrate 49 the rapid reactions of chlorine dioxide with cysteine and glutathione under alkaline conditions which are essential components of several enzymatic activities in bacterial cells 50 have also been suggested to be responsible for these observations in our previous work 20 we indicated that the alkaline ph conditions accelerate the decay rate of chlorine dioxide 51 52 and the mechanism of the process enhance the rate of oxidation of microbial cells at this stage the chemistry explaining the significantly high inactivation efficiency in alkaline ph conditions is inconclusive the concerns in practice are that residual doses in drinking water distribution systems under such conditions are likely to decompose faster thus exposing the water to recontamination in the distribution system 51 combining chlorine dioxide with more stable disinfectants such as monochloramine or free chlorine is thus desired 53 3 3 the influence of temperature temperature is a vital physical parameter that impacts on the efficiency of chemical disinfectants the effect of temperature on the pseudo first order inactivation rate constants after exposing the bacteria strains to 2 0 mg l chlorine dioxide is shown in fig 3 the rate constants were determined from the rapid initial phase or the log linear region of the disinfection curves corresponding to a first order kinetic 54 a significant difference p 0 05 between the inactivation rate constants at the temperature range considered was observed for both p aeruginosa and s aureus particularly for s aureus raising the temperature from 4 c to 15 c resulted in 56 increase in the inactivation rate generally the rate of inactivation increased steadily with increasing temperature from 15 c to 37 c the dependence of the inactivation rates at the studied temperatures were further analyzed by the arrhenius equation 5 k a e e a r t where k is the inactivation rate constant ea is the activation energy a is the frequency factor t is the absolute temperature in kelvin and the universal gas constant r 8 314 j mol k the arrhenius parameters ea and a estimated from eq 5 for p aeruginosa were 7 73 kj mol and 12 3 l mg min respectively whilst in the case of s aureus ea was 13 26 kj mol and a determined as 2 73 102 l mg min with chemical disinfection often considered as akin to chemical reactions 43 it is presumed that the enhanced activity of a disinfectant with temperature is largely due to the increased effective collisions of the disinfectant s molecules with the bacterial cells which eventually initiate the oxidative processes leading to cell death 3 4 effect of initial density of bacteria the influence of the initial bacteria density on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide was also studied fig 4 illustrates the inactivation kinetics when the bacterial strains were exposed to concentrations sufficient to yield at least 2 log inactivation credits in general no significant difference p 0 05 between the inactivation rate constants was obtained at the different densities of bacteria for each of the studied organisms a further comparison of the results herein with section 3 2 where the initial cell density was maintained at 108 cfu ml tend to suggest that under similar experimental conditions the rate of inactivation and for that matter the log inactivation credits obtained for a target organism exposed to chlorine dioxide would be less impacted by the initial bacteria density in a similar study conducted in a batch reactor 55 it was demonstrated that the initial bacteria density of e coli grown to the stationary phase was a statistically significant factor in the inactivation rate by monochloramine but this was not the case for the cells in the exponential phase another related work involving monochloramine and ozone applied to e coli and bacillus subtilis cells and spores 56 it was observed that the influence of the initial density was only related to the reaction of monochloramine with stationary phase cells of e coli it was thus concluded that the effect of initial density on disinfection is dependent on the growth phase and type of target organism quorum sensing in bacterial cells is a cell cell communication mechanism employed by individual cells to assess the gene expression diffusion gradient and local densities in a multicellular like behavior 57 58 this phenomenon has been associated with the induction of resistance among high density cells towards antibiotics and antimicrobials 59 however in our present work the effect of this was not observed under the experimental conditions probably because chlorine dioxide as a strong oxidant targets multiple sites 60 61 within the cell thus making it unlikely for cells to develop resistance by specific gene expression mechanisms or rather the cells were exposed to relatively high disinfectant concentration 3 5 permeability of the outer cell membrane the potential of chlorine dioxide to compromise the integrity of the outer cell membrane and its contribution to the bactericidal mechanism was assessed by the npn uptake assay the outer cell membrane is a distinguishing feature of gram negative bacteria 62 and hence the npn assay was conducted only with p aeruginosa in table 2 the effect of chlorine dioxide on the npn uptake assay by p aeruginosa cells is illustrated exposing the cells to chlorine dioxide resulted in a substantial increase in the uptake of the chromogenic probe npn in a concentration dependent manner for instance the treatment of cells with 1 0 mg l 2 5 mg l and 5 0 mg l concentrations of chlorine dioxide yielded mean uptakes of approximately 17 47 and 83 respectively of the uptakes induced by 1 0 m edta which is a well known membrane permeabilizer the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of p aeruginosa is principally made of lipopolysaccharides and functions as an effective permeability barrier to external hydrophobic or lipophilic molecules including npn 63 however when the integrity of the outer membrane is impacted by external agents such as membrane permeabilizing compounds the npn molecules permeate into the phospholipid environment of the inner leaflet of the outer membrane to produce an enhanced fluorescence intensity whose magnitude is dependent on the quantity of molecules of the probe entering the cells on the contrary npn molecules in the external aqueous environment of cells tend to produce weak fluorescence intensity the present results in table 2 thus indicate that the exposure of cells to chlorine dioxide disrupted the intact external lipopolysaccharide membranes and enabled the entry of the chromogenic npn molecules 38 this resulted in the enhanced fluorescence intensity expressed as uptake increasing the concentration of the chlorine dioxide also led to a higher npn uptake which might indicate an increase in the number of bacterial cells whose outer membranes were altered an alteration of the membrane might thus correspond with an increase in cell inactivation or death 3 6 the release of 260 nm absorbing materials the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is a site for vital cellular activities such as respiration synthesis of lipids and cell wall constituents maintenance of the homeostatic conditions as well as the control of several metabolic processes of the cell 62 it is principally made of a semi permeable phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins and regulates the transfer of solutes and metabolites in and out of the cell compromised cytoplasmic membrane results in the discharge of critical intracellular cell components such as nucleic acids dna and rna which absorb uv light strongly at 260 nm into the surrounding matrix 64 in fig 5 the plots indicate the release of nuclear materials following the exposure of cell suspensions to varied concentrations of chlorine dioxide the absorbance curves illustrate the ratio of chlorine dioxide treated cells to the untreated cells used as a negative control and are generally characterized by a sharp increase within the initial 10 min of measurement and essentially becoming steady afterward at the 5 0 mg l nearly 1 8 and 1 6 fold increases in the 260 nm absorbing materials were observed for p aeruginosa and s aureus respectively at 40 min of contact the quantity of the intracellular nuclear materials released into the extracellular matrix was also observed to increase with the initial concentration of chlorine dioxide and this trend was evident in both organisms a strong correlation supporting information s2 between the maximum level of inactivation obtained for a given concentration and the maximum 260 nm absorbing materials released as determined by the absorbance measurements was also observed chlorine dioxide is a strong oxidant and it inactivates microbial cells by oxidation its reactions proceed by the abstraction of a single electron from the reactive organic substrates of the bacterial cells possible sites of initiating the oxidation reactions depend on the selective reactivity of chlorine dioxide towards organic functional groups or compounds for instance chlorine dioxide reacts slowly or is virtually unreactive with primary amines and unsaturated fatty acids 65 however the reactions with amino acids such as cysteine tyrosine and tryptophan have been found to be rapid 50 and are therefore considered as favorable reactive sites for initiating reactions with the cytoplasmic membrane chlorine dioxide has also been demonstrated to undergo extremely fast oxidation reactions with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh which is a key coenzyme in many biological redox reactions as well as the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate atp 66 linking these results would therefore suggest that after permeating through the outer membrane of a bacteria cell chlorine dioxide further targets the cytoplasmic membrane and oxidizes by redox reactions with more reactive reducing species in the membrane it is most unlikely that reactions with a specific target group of compounds or components of the cell might be responsible for the cell death instead the reactions with multiple targets within the cell might eventually accumulate to impair on vital metabolic processes and resulting in loss of activity or death 3 7 changes in cell morphology the effect of chlorine dioxide treatment on the morphology of bacterial cells was assessed by tem representative electron micrographs showing the morphologies of s aureus and p aeruginosa cells before and after treatment are displayed in fig 6 typical cocci shaped cells with well defined intact inner and outer membranes were observed before and after treatment for s aureus visible morphological damages to the cell structure by chlorine dioxide were not prominent however some apparent increase in the roughness and small indentations on the outer cell surfaces as indicated by arrows were seen for the treated p aeruginosa cells further analysis of the images also showed a significant increase p 0 05 in the thickness of the cell wall of p aeruginosa after the treatment with chlorine dioxide mean thickness before treatment was determined as 33 85 5 30 nm and after treatment was 55 43 6 58 nm on the other hand the thick peptidoglycan cell walls of gram positive s aureus might have enhanced the tolerance of the cell wall to visible damages that notwithstanding it is evident in these observations that chlorine dioxide does not oxidize or inactivate bacteria cells by inflicting gross morphological damages it is even more interesting to reconcile how it induces an increase in the permeability of both the outer cell and the cytoplasmic membranes without necessarily causing cell lysis however chlorine dioxide is a highly selective monomeric free radical 61 that has the potential of diffusing through the membranes and reacting with the more reactive moieties of the cell constituents such as glutathione tryptophan and cysteine the efflux of the vital cellular components may significantly contribute to the overall cell death 4 conclusions in this study the kinetics of chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant for the control of p aeruginosa and s aureus were investigated the results have shown that chlorine dioxide at 5 0 mg l is suitable for eliminating potential threats of p aeruginosa and s aureus in water however at the maximum dose 1 5 mg l recommended for drinking water a substantial number of bacteria population in a highly contaminated water could still survive the inactivation of chlorine dioxide chlorine dioxide is more efficient as a disinfectant at higher ph most especially in the alkaline conditions and its rate of disinfection is less impacted by the initial density of bacteria chlorine dioxide does not kill bacteria cells by lysing but rather diffuses through the outer and cytoplasmic membranes increase their permeability and cause the release of vital cell components and essentially

14478,this study evaluated the inactivation kinetics and the bactericidal mechanism of chlorine dioxide towards pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 on a laboratory scale with the view of determining the optimal operational conditions of its application as an alternative disinfectant in water treatment bacteria inactivation was conducted in batch reactors at varied disinfectant concentrations ph temperature and initial bacteria densities in buffered disinfectant demand free water the bactericidal mechanism in terms of the effect on the permeability of the outer and cytoplasmic cell membranes and the morphology of the cells were explored at the highest studied concentration 5 0 mg l at least 5 log reductions in bacterial population were observed for each strain of bacteria chlorine dioxide inactivation showed a stronger sensitivity to changes in water ph conditions with the inactivation rate at 8 5 being at least 4 fold of what pertained at 6 5 but efficiency was less impacted by changes in the initial bacteria density a rise in temperature from 4 c to 15 c resulted in approximately 56 increase in the inactivation rate of s aureus chlorine dioxide was found to increase the permeability of outer and cytoplasmic cell membranes and consequently resulting in the release of vital nuclear materials which strongly correlated with loss of cell activity or death however from tem micrographs significant morphological damages or cells lysis was not observed these results provide vital data on operational strategies to enhance efficient disinfection of water with chlorine dioxide whilst monitoring regulatory requirements on disinfection by products keywords chlorine dioxide pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus disinfection kinetics 1 introduction chlorine dioxide clo2 is a powerful oxidant with broad spectrum biocidal activity 1 it has thus found considerable application as a sanitizer in the food industry 2 3 decreasing biofouling in industrial cooling water systems 4 5 disinfection of potable and wastewater 6 7 and in the pulp industry as a bleaching agent for producing excellent strong and bright fibers 1 8 most especially in potable and wastewater disinfection it has proven to be an excellent alternative technology to conventional chlorination against the threats of potential waterborne pathogenic and infectious agents such as bacteria viruses and protozoa 9 11 besides the regular application as a disinfectant in water treatment recent reports have also indicated promising potentials for the oxidation and removal of pharmaceutical residues such as diclofenac 12 tetracyclines 13 and sulfamethoxazole 14 in wastewaters chlorine dioxide inactivates microbial threats by selective oxidation where a single electron is usually abstracted this results in the formation of chlorite clo2 and chlorate clo3 as the main by products with chlorite constituting approximately 70 15 of the total reaction by products 1 clo2 e clo2 2 2clo2 2oh clo2 clo3 h2o chlorites levels in drinking water are increasingly being regulated due to potential health concerns associated with them the who recently reaffirmed a maximum acceptable threshold for chlorite in drinking water as 0 7 mg l 16 the us epa also regulates the maximum contaminant level mcl for chlorite in drinking water at 1 0 mg l 17 consequently the maximum residual disinfectant levels mrdl for chlorine dioxide in drinking water is enforced at 0 8 mg l in the united states the associated challenge in the potable water treatment industry thus lies with satisfying the regulatory guidelines without compromising the adequacy of disinfection this is further exacerbated by the increasing reports of some bacterial strains developing resistance to antibiotics in water due to inadequate disinfection 18 19 in this regard designing and operating an efficient chlorine dioxide disinfection system for either potable water or wastewater and simultaneously controlling the formation of deleterious disinfection by products would require due consideration of suitable operational conditions to a target microorganism in a recent communication 20 we assessed the efficiency of chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant against escherichia coli under different operational conditions of water treatment in addition to a proposed bactericidal mechanism however it is well established that the intrinsic susceptibilities of organisms to disinfectants vary widely 21 22 and thus an appropriate determination of optimal operational conditions of a disinfectant would partly be dependent on the target organism a broader data regarding the disinfection of other bacterial species with chlorine dioxide thus becomes necessary pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram negative bacterium that is ubiquitous in the environment and able to adapt to several conditions it could also be found in water including swimming pools hot tubs and tap water 23 25 indeed the transmission via hospital tap water has been described as highly significant 26 there are even reports of p aeruginosa having been isolated from bottled water 25 it is often described as an opportunistic pathogen due to its association with life threatening ailments in burn and surgical patients and in immunocompromised patients in hospital environments it is also a common cause of infections in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis 27 staphylococcus aureus on the other hand is prevalent in diverse food products such as meat and milk 28 29 additionally it could as well be found in environmental water samples 30 31 the methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa strains have particularly gained considerable attention in recent times owing to the risks of transmitting potential infections from animals to humans 32 in previous related studies designed to monitor the efficiency of chlorine dioxide at controlling these strains of bacteria relatively high concentrations of the disinfectant were employed 33 34 such concentrations however may not be suitable for satisfying regulatory requirements when applied for disinfecting drinking water moreover the available data from a systematic study in literature involving the use of chlorine dioxide to inactivate p aeruginosa and s aureus is quite limited in the present work the kinetics of chlorine dioxide inactivation of p aeruginosa and s aureus were studied under varied conditions of oxidant concentration water ph temperature and initial bacterial density the bactericidal mechanism of chlorine dioxide on the bacteria strains was also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and preparation of suspension culture collection strains of p aeruginosa atcc 27853 and s aureus atcc 29213 were obtained from the microbiology discipline university of kwazulu natal westville bacterial cell suspensions were prepared for the inactivation studies by growing the stock cultures in 100 ml of lysogeny broth lb merck south africa contained in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask and incubated for 18 24 h at 37 c cells were then harvested by centrifuging at 6000 x g for 5 min at 4 c washed twice in phosphate buffered saline pbs 10 mm at ph 7 4 and pellets suspended in an oxidant demand free odf buffered water to an initial density of approximately 108 cfu ml 2 2 chlorine dioxide preparation and measurement stock solutions of chlorine dioxide were prepared as described previously 20 35 by oxidizing approximately 25 w v solutions of sodium chlorite naclo2 in a gas generating bottle with a dilute solution of sulphuric acid h2so4 2 m the generated gas was harvested through a stream of compressed air into a connecting chlorine scrubber system which contained a saturated solution of sodium chlorite 10 w v to scrub contaminants such as chlorine gas chlorine dioxide gas was collected in a connecting bottle of demand free deionized water the concentrations of the prepared stock solutions were analyzed by the iodometric method whilst the residual concentrations were determined by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method 35 2 3 bacteria inactivation kinetics each of the inactivation kinetic reactions of p aeruginosa and s aureus with chlorine dioxide were carried out in a 500 ml of sterile oxidant demand free odf deionized water buffered with phosphate buffered saline pbs in a glass batch reactor prior to each inactivation reactions glasswares were soaked in 10 mg l chlorine dioxide solution for 4 h and thoroughly rinsed with deionized water to remove all possible chlorine dioxide consuming species that might interfere with the applied dose during the reaction bacterial suspensions estimated to yield a final concentration of 108 cfu ml based on prior calibrations were added to the water in the reactor and allowed to equilibrate with the surrounding temperature under continuous stirring with a magnetic stirrer to ensure uniform mixing throughout the reaction period samples of bacterial suspensions from the reactor were withdrawn before the addition of the chlorine dioxide to determine the initial bacteria populations subsequently calculated desired concentrations of chlorine dioxide 0 5 1 0 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 mg l were added to initiate the reaction in the reactor five milliliters samples were withdrawn with 10 ml sterile syringes at predetermined time points into tubes containing excess 0 1 m sodium thiosulphate na2s2o3 solutions to immediately quench the residual chlorine dioxide and consequently stopping the reaction enumerations of bacteria were determined by the standard spread plate technique on nutrient agar merck south africa after appropriate dilutions and incubated at 37 c for 24 h the influence of water temperature and ph on the rate and degree of chlorine dioxide inactivation of each bacteria strain considered in this study were also assessed inactivation kinetic reactions as described above were conducted at different temperatures with the reaction water matrix at ph 8 05 maintained at 4 15 22 30 and 37 2 c and allowed to equilibrate with the surrounding temperature before initiating the reaction chlorine dioxide was applied at an initial dose of 2 0 mg l in each case based on preliminary trials at room temperature which yielded at least 2 log 99 inactivation credits of each bacteria such levels of reduction were considered appropriate to indicate possible significant effects of the operational parameters on inactivation to determine the effect of changes in water ph on the inactivation kinetics experiments were similarly carried out at 22 2 c by varying the ph in the range of 6 5 9 in relation to the ph conditions usually encountered in natural water it should be noted that all inactivation experiments for each bacterium were carried out independently and measurements made in triplicates 2 4 effect of bacterial density on the kinetics of clo2 disinfection the bacteria cultures of the studied organisms were grown for 18 24 h into the stationary phase in a lysogeny broth under agitation at 37 c cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 6000 x g washed twice with sterile pbs ph 8 05 and subsequently resuspended in a buffered 100 ml odf water to obtain the stock bacteria density at an approximate count of 1 2 108 cfu ml this was estimated from a predetermined data between optical densities od measured at 600 nm with a spectrophotometer and cell density cfu ml the stock cultures were serially diluted to obtain approximate cell densities of 107 106 and 105 cfu ml in 100 ml of the reaction matrix contained in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks each of the different densities of s aureus and p aeruginosa were treated with 2 5 mg l and 1 0 mg l of clo2 respectively which were expected to produce at least 2 0 log inactivation as obtained from the experimental results of section 2 3 portions of each sample were withdrawn prior to chlorine dioxide treatment as a control and processed simultaneously to determine and confirm the initial bacterial density in each case sampling and enumeration of bacteria were carried out as described above 2 5 mechanism of action of chlorine dioxide disinfection of bacteria experiments were designed to monitor the bactericidal mechanisms of chlorine dioxide in terms of the effect on the permeability of the outer cell membrane the cytoplasmic membrane and the morphology of the cells 2 5 1 cell outer membrane permeability the non polar permeability probe 1 n phenylnaphthylamine npn uptake assay as described previously 36 37 was used to determine the effect of clo2 on the permeability of the outer cell membrane of gram negative bacteria p aeruginosa in brief a 10 mm stock solution of npn was prepared in acetone a mid logarithmic phase od600 value of 0 5 0 02 bacterial cultures grown in 100 ml lb at 37 c were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min washed twice in hepes n 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine n 2 ethanesulphonic acid buffer 5 mm ph 7 4 and then suspended in 15 ml fresh portions of the same buffer to obtain a cell stock approximately 3 0 ml each of the stock samples were withdrawn into tubes and exposed to varying concentrations of clo2 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 mg l for 10 min and quenched effectively with sodium thiosulphate to prevent the residual clo2 from interfering with npn fluorescence negative control cell samples were identically processed except for the addition of clo2 whilst the treatment with edta 1 0 mm which is known to possess strong outer membrane permeability characteristic was utilized as a positive control npn was subsequently added up to 10 μm final concentration the changes in fluorescence as a function of time were monitored with a perkin elmer ls 55 fluorescence spectrophotometer slit width 5 0 nm excitation λ 350 nm and emission λ 420 nm up to a maximum where no further increases could be observed the maximum fluorescence values were expressed as npn uptake fobs fo f100 fo 100 where fobs is the observed npn fluorescence at a given concentration of clo2 fo is the background npn fluorescence of bacterial cell suspension in buffer but without clo2 and f100 is the fluorescence of npn upon treatment with 1 0 mm of edta triplicate measurements were made for each sample 38 2 5 2 disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane the effect of clo2 on the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane was studied by monitoring the release of cytoplasmic components such as nucleic acids which absorb uv light strongly at 260 nm overnight cultures as described above were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min and twice washed in autoclaved pbs 10 mm ph 7 4 pellets were resuspended in 10 ml portions of the buffer and treated with varying concentrations of clo2 0 5 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 mg l control samples were identically processed except for the clo2 treatment approximately 2 0 ml of the cell suspensions were sampled at 5 min intervals and centrifuged 6000 x g 2 min immediately to separate the bacterial cells from the supernatant the optical densities of the supernatants were then determined at 260 nm with a nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer thermo scientific it is to be noted that in this protocol clo2 was not quenched before centrifuging because the quenching agent sodium thiosulphate was observed to absorb at a very close wavelength 254 nm as the nucleic acids which might interfere with the measured absorbances chlorine dioxide solution however was not found to absorb at this wavelength results were expressed as a b s 260 n m r a t i o a b s o r b a n c e o f c h l o r i n e d i o x i d e t r e a t e d c e l l s a b s o r b a n c e o f b a s e l i n e u n t r e a t e d c e l l s to normalize the differences in absorbance that might be due to different cell densities in the assay tubes 2 5 3 transmission electron microscopy tem analysis the changes to the morphology of the bacterial cells due to the chlorine dioxide treatment was examined by tem 39 40 in this process suspensions of bacteria in pbs 10 mm ph 7 4 were treated with 4 0 mg l clo2 sufficient for yielding at least 4 0 log inactivation for 10 min in a batch reactor approximately 1 0 ml of the treated samples were pipetted into eppendorf tubes and pelleted by centrifuging at 5000 x g for 5 min at 25 c pelleted samples were fixed with a phosphate buffered ph 7 4 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution and kept overnight at 4 c the sample suspension was washed in 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 4 and suspended in 0 5 osmium tetroxide for post fixation samples were dehydrated sequentially with 30 50 75 and 100 acetone and infiltrated first with equal parts of resin and acetone for 4 h followed by a whole resin for 20 h the specimens were orientated in a mold of whole resin and polymerized in an oven for 8 h at 70 c thin sections of samples were prepared with ultra microtome leica em uc7 germany and stained with 2 uranyl acetate and subsequently with lead citrate the prepared grids were examined using jem 2100 jeol co japan and the changes in the cell wall thickness were analyzed with item e 23082007 software olympus soft imaging solutions gmbh germany 2 6 data analysis bacteria inactivation data were best fit by the cavg hom cah model 41 42 expressed as 3 log nt no kc n avg t m 4 cavg co cf where nt no is the survival ratio of the microorganism under consideration after inactivation k is the microbial inactivation rate constant co and cf are the initial and final disinfectant concentrations mg l respectively and t is the contact time of exposing the disinfectant to the microorganism m is a model parameter called the hom exponent whilst n is the coefficient of dilution model parameters were determined by minimising the error sum of square ess deviations between the observed and predicted log nt no of the inactivation data using microsoft excel solver microsoft corp 2016 the student t test based on p value at 95 confidence level was used to evaluate the statistical significance of data from independent measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation kinetics at different chlorine dioxide concentrations the log inactivation levels for chlorine dioxide disinfection of p aeruginosa and s aureus are summarised in fig 1 expectedly the inactivation credits achieved generally increased with an increase in the applied initial concentration of chlorine dioxide the inactivation curves at the various applied doses were typically nonlinear but rather characterized by a rapid initial exponential reduction of the bacterial population which was followed by a slow kinetic phase to produce a tailing moreover the corresponding levels of inactivation were predominantly a function of the applied dose when compared with the influence of the contact time this was evident in the observation that at any applied concentration of chlorine dioxide the differences in the level of log inactivation obtained at t 2 min and t 60 min were mostly statistically insignificant p 0 05 it thus suggests that the use of ct disinfectant concentration c x contact time t credits to estimate the efficiency of inactivation largely becomes unreliable meanwhile in comparing the susceptibilities of the bacterial strains a consideration of the level of log reduction of inactivated cells is vital at 1 0 mg l clo2 dose 2 0 log reduction of p aeruginosa was observed whilst 2 5 mg l dosage was rather required to achieve at least 2 0 log inactivation in the case of s aureus on the contrary when cells were exposed to 5 0 mg l approximately 5 log and 6 log reductions for p aeruginosa and s aureus respectively were obtained several interpretations for this phenomenon have been proposed and chiefly among this is the vitalist hypothesis of chemical disinfection 43 in this principle it is suggested that a strain of bacteria consists of subpopulations of different fractions dependent on the type of organism which intrinsically possess diverse susceptibilities to a disinfectant exposed at given time 44 from this assumption it could be presumed that the more susceptible fractions of p aeruginosa were rapidly inactivated at 1 0 mg l whilst higher concentrations of chlorine dioxide were required to effectively kill the relatively more resistant subpopulations similarly relatively higher doses were required to produce a significant change in the population of s aureus due to the presence of more resistant fractions the declining rate of inactivation which results in the slow kinetic phase is thus a direct consequence of the diversity of the bacterial population possessing different responses to the varying concentrations of the disinfectant however notably 0 5 mg l was virtually inactive to the strains of bacteria considered in this study for example notwithstanding the amount of contact time allowed for a reaction within 1 h less than 0 3 log inactivation was measured usually in drinking water it is recommended that the applied dose should not exceed 1 5 mg l 7 from our results such concentrations may not be adequate for water containing a high amount of bacteria population in table 1 a summary of the inactivation rate constants and the estimated model parameters from the cavg hom model eq 3 is presented these were computed by minimising the error sum of squares ess between the log nt no values from the observed experimental data and the predicted from the cavg hom using the solver function in microsoft excel version 2016 from the table a value of m 1 is an indication that the microbial survival plot at a given concentration shows a tailing effect whereas a shoulder is signified by m 1 42 an increase in the rate of inactivation is indicated by a higher k value whilst n shows the sensitivity of the concentration to the rate of inactivation 41 the model parameters further emphasize the non linear characteristic of chlorine dioxide inactivation of p aeruginosa s aureus as well as e coli 20 in water 3 2 effect of ph on chlorine dioxide disinfection of bacteria the variation of water ph on the kinetics of bacterial inactivation by chlorine dioxide is shown in fig 2 the plot depicts the inactivation rate constants of a pseudo first order kinetic reaction between chlorine dioxide and the bacteria cells at various water ph conditions where the model parameters m and n from eq 3 were assumed to be unity n set as 1 because only a single concentration was utilised 45 it must be emphasized that for all inactivation experiments the initial densities of bacteria were not affected by any of the ph conditions considered in the present study in determining the rate constants only the rapid initial phase which followed the first order kinetics was considered because the difference between the log inactivation data at the transition points and the end of the tailing phase of the kinetic curves supporting information s1 were largely found to be statistically insignificant p 0 05 the rate of bacteria inactivation essentially increased with increasing ph and the most effective inactivation measurements were recorded in the alkaline ph conditions under similar experimental conditions varying the ph from 6 5 to 8 5 resulted in approximately 4 fold and 7 fold increases in the inactivation rates of s aureus and p aeruginosa respectively these results profoundly indicate a substantial influence of water ph on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide disinfection the role of ph has considerably become a subject of contradiction among researchers it is widely regarded that unlike free chlorine the effectiveness of chlorine dioxide spans over a wide range of ph conditions 10 46 and essentially unaffected by changes in water ph conversely other researchers have reported of a significant influence of ph on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide inactivation of microbes 47 48 it has been suggested that the observed increased reactivity of chlorine dioxide under alkaline conditions may be due to the formation of more reactive transient species consisting of the oh ions chlorine dioxide and the substrate 49 the rapid reactions of chlorine dioxide with cysteine and glutathione under alkaline conditions which are essential components of several enzymatic activities in bacterial cells 50 have also been suggested to be responsible for these observations in our previous work 20 we indicated that the alkaline ph conditions accelerate the decay rate of chlorine dioxide 51 52 and the mechanism of the process enhance the rate of oxidation of microbial cells at this stage the chemistry explaining the significantly high inactivation efficiency in alkaline ph conditions is inconclusive the concerns in practice are that residual doses in drinking water distribution systems under such conditions are likely to decompose faster thus exposing the water to recontamination in the distribution system 51 combining chlorine dioxide with more stable disinfectants such as monochloramine or free chlorine is thus desired 53 3 3 the influence of temperature temperature is a vital physical parameter that impacts on the efficiency of chemical disinfectants the effect of temperature on the pseudo first order inactivation rate constants after exposing the bacteria strains to 2 0 mg l chlorine dioxide is shown in fig 3 the rate constants were determined from the rapid initial phase or the log linear region of the disinfection curves corresponding to a first order kinetic 54 a significant difference p 0 05 between the inactivation rate constants at the temperature range considered was observed for both p aeruginosa and s aureus particularly for s aureus raising the temperature from 4 c to 15 c resulted in 56 increase in the inactivation rate generally the rate of inactivation increased steadily with increasing temperature from 15 c to 37 c the dependence of the inactivation rates at the studied temperatures were further analyzed by the arrhenius equation 5 k a e e a r t where k is the inactivation rate constant ea is the activation energy a is the frequency factor t is the absolute temperature in kelvin and the universal gas constant r 8 314 j mol k the arrhenius parameters ea and a estimated from eq 5 for p aeruginosa were 7 73 kj mol and 12 3 l mg min respectively whilst in the case of s aureus ea was 13 26 kj mol and a determined as 2 73 102 l mg min with chemical disinfection often considered as akin to chemical reactions 43 it is presumed that the enhanced activity of a disinfectant with temperature is largely due to the increased effective collisions of the disinfectant s molecules with the bacterial cells which eventually initiate the oxidative processes leading to cell death 3 4 effect of initial density of bacteria the influence of the initial bacteria density on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide was also studied fig 4 illustrates the inactivation kinetics when the bacterial strains were exposed to concentrations sufficient to yield at least 2 log inactivation credits in general no significant difference p 0 05 between the inactivation rate constants was obtained at the different densities of bacteria for each of the studied organisms a further comparison of the results herein with section 3 2 where the initial cell density was maintained at 108 cfu ml tend to suggest that under similar experimental conditions the rate of inactivation and for that matter the log inactivation credits obtained for a target organism exposed to chlorine dioxide would be less impacted by the initial bacteria density in a similar study conducted in a batch reactor 55 it was demonstrated that the initial bacteria density of e coli grown to the stationary phase was a statistically significant factor in the inactivation rate by monochloramine but this was not the case for the cells in the exponential phase another related work involving monochloramine and ozone applied to e coli and bacillus subtilis cells and spores 56 it was observed that the influence of the initial density was only related to the reaction of monochloramine with stationary phase cells of e coli it was thus concluded that the effect of initial density on disinfection is dependent on the growth phase and type of target organism quorum sensing in bacterial cells is a cell cell communication mechanism employed by individual cells to assess the gene expression diffusion gradient and local densities in a multicellular like behavior 57 58 this phenomenon has been associated with the induction of resistance among high density cells towards antibiotics and antimicrobials 59 however in our present work the effect of this was not observed under the experimental conditions probably because chlorine dioxide as a strong oxidant targets multiple sites 60 61 within the cell thus making it unlikely for cells to develop resistance by specific gene expression mechanisms or rather the cells were exposed to relatively high disinfectant concentration 3 5 permeability of the outer cell membrane the potential of chlorine dioxide to compromise the integrity of the outer cell membrane and its contribution to the bactericidal mechanism was assessed by the npn uptake assay the outer cell membrane is a distinguishing feature of gram negative bacteria 62 and hence the npn assay was conducted only with p aeruginosa in table 2 the effect of chlorine dioxide on the npn uptake assay by p aeruginosa cells is illustrated exposing the cells to chlorine dioxide resulted in a substantial increase in the uptake of the chromogenic probe npn in a concentration dependent manner for instance the treatment of cells with 1 0 mg l 2 5 mg l and 5 0 mg l concentrations of chlorine dioxide yielded mean uptakes of approximately 17 47 and 83 respectively of the uptakes induced by 1 0 m edta which is a well known membrane permeabilizer the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of p aeruginosa is principally made of lipopolysaccharides and functions as an effective permeability barrier to external hydrophobic or lipophilic molecules including npn 63 however when the integrity of the outer membrane is impacted by external agents such as membrane permeabilizing compounds the npn molecules permeate into the phospholipid environment of the inner leaflet of the outer membrane to produce an enhanced fluorescence intensity whose magnitude is dependent on the quantity of molecules of the probe entering the cells on the contrary npn molecules in the external aqueous environment of cells tend to produce weak fluorescence intensity the present results in table 2 thus indicate that the exposure of cells to chlorine dioxide disrupted the intact external lipopolysaccharide membranes and enabled the entry of the chromogenic npn molecules 38 this resulted in the enhanced fluorescence intensity expressed as uptake increasing the concentration of the chlorine dioxide also led to a higher npn uptake which might indicate an increase in the number of bacterial cells whose outer membranes were altered an alteration of the membrane might thus correspond with an increase in cell inactivation or death 3 6 the release of 260 nm absorbing materials the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is a site for vital cellular activities such as respiration synthesis of lipids and cell wall constituents maintenance of the homeostatic conditions as well as the control of several metabolic processes of the cell 62 it is principally made of a semi permeable phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins and regulates the transfer of solutes and metabolites in and out of the cell compromised cytoplasmic membrane results in the discharge of critical intracellular cell components such as nucleic acids dna and rna which absorb uv light strongly at 260 nm into the surrounding matrix 64 in fig 5 the plots indicate the release of nuclear materials following the exposure of cell suspensions to varied concentrations of chlorine dioxide the absorbance curves illustrate the ratio of chlorine dioxide treated cells to the untreated cells used as a negative control and are generally characterized by a sharp increase within the initial 10 min of measurement and essentially becoming steady afterward at the 5 0 mg l nearly 1 8 and 1 6 fold increases in the 260 nm absorbing materials were observed for p aeruginosa and s aureus respectively at 40 min of contact the quantity of the intracellular nuclear materials released into the extracellular matrix was also observed to increase with the initial concentration of chlorine dioxide and this trend was evident in both organisms a strong correlation supporting information s2 between the maximum level of inactivation obtained for a given concentration and the maximum 260 nm absorbing materials released as determined by the absorbance measurements was also observed chlorine dioxide is a strong oxidant and it inactivates microbial cells by oxidation its reactions proceed by the abstraction of a single electron from the reactive organic substrates of the bacterial cells possible sites of initiating the oxidation reactions depend on the selective reactivity of chlorine dioxide towards organic functional groups or compounds for instance chlorine dioxide reacts slowly or is virtually unreactive with primary amines and unsaturated fatty acids 65 however the reactions with amino acids such as cysteine tyrosine and tryptophan have been found to be rapid 50 and are therefore considered as favorable reactive sites for initiating reactions with the cytoplasmic membrane chlorine dioxide has also been demonstrated to undergo extremely fast oxidation reactions with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh which is a key coenzyme in many biological redox reactions as well as the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate atp 66 linking these results would therefore suggest that after permeating through the outer membrane of a bacteria cell chlorine dioxide further targets the cytoplasmic membrane and oxidizes by redox reactions with more reactive reducing species in the membrane it is most unlikely that reactions with a specific target group of compounds or components of the cell might be responsible for the cell death instead the reactions with multiple targets within the cell might eventually accumulate to impair on vital metabolic processes and resulting in loss of activity or death 3 7 changes in cell morphology the effect of chlorine dioxide treatment on the morphology of bacterial cells was assessed by tem representative electron micrographs showing the morphologies of s aureus and p aeruginosa cells before and after treatment are displayed in fig 6 typical cocci shaped cells with well defined intact inner and outer membranes were observed before and after treatment for s aureus visible morphological damages to the cell structure by chlorine dioxide were not prominent however some apparent increase in the roughness and small indentations on the outer cell surfaces as indicated by arrows were seen for the treated p aeruginosa cells further analysis of the images also showed a significant increase p 0 05 in the thickness of the cell wall of p aeruginosa after the treatment with chlorine dioxide mean thickness before treatment was determined as 33 85 5 30 nm and after treatment was 55 43 6 58 nm on the other hand the thick peptidoglycan cell walls of gram positive s aureus might have enhanced the tolerance of the cell wall to visible damages that notwithstanding it is evident in these observations that chlorine dioxide does not oxidize or inactivate bacteria cells by inflicting gross morphological damages it is even more interesting to reconcile how it induces an increase in the permeability of both the outer cell and the cytoplasmic membranes without necessarily causing cell lysis however chlorine dioxide is a highly selective monomeric free radical 61 that has the potential of diffusing through the membranes and reacting with the more reactive moieties of the cell constituents such as glutathione tryptophan and cysteine the efflux of the vital cellular components may significantly contribute to the overall cell death 4 conclusions in this study the kinetics of chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant for the control of p aeruginosa and s aureus were investigated the results have shown that chlorine dioxide at 5 0 mg l is suitable for eliminating potential threats of p aeruginosa and s aureus in water however at the maximum dose 1 5 mg l recommended for drinking water a substantial number of bacteria population in a highly contaminated water could still survive the inactivation of chlorine dioxide chlorine dioxide is more efficient as a disinfectant at higher ph most especially in the alkaline conditions and its rate of disinfection is less impacted by the initial density of bacteria chlorine dioxide does not kill bacteria cells by lysing but rather diffuses through the outer and cytoplasmic membranes increase their permeability and cause the release of vital cell components and essentially

14479,membrane bioreactors mbr are now widely implemented in wastewater treatment plants due to their compact design and high effluent water quality however membrane biofouling has significant impact on mbr performance and energy cost quorum sensing inhibiting qsi compounds have the ability to disrupt bacterial communication pathways that lead to biofilm formation and biofouling in this study an anti biofouling membrane was developed by incorporating vanillin a known qsi molecule onto the surface of a commercial chlorinated polyethylene cpe microfiltration membrane by williamson ether synthesis reaction the cpe membrane was reacted with the vanillin in a solvent mixture containing potassium carbonate and n n dimethylformamide for vanillin incorporation the solvent mixture without vanillin was also used to create a control membrane to understand the qsi anti biofouling capabilities raman and ftir spectroscopy indicated that vanillin was retained on the modified membrane surface under cross flow condition and sodium hypochlorite cleaning the modified membrane had significantly less biofouling compared to the unmodified and control membranes tested using activated sludge collected from wastewater treatment plants the control membrane experienced up to a 52 reduction in live cells dead cells and polysaccharides in the fouling layer compared to unmodified membrane the incorporation of vanillin further decreased the amount of live cells dead cells and polysaccharides covering the surface by 82 77 and 51 respectively compared to the unmodified membrane this research showed that vanillin modified membranes have potential to improve the membrane anti biofouling capabilities and mbr performance keywords membrane bioreactors biofouling quorum sensing inhibitor vanillin surface modification 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs are now widely used in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants mbr technology integrates two processes activated sludge and low pressure membrane filtration into a single system that degrades organic matter and clarifies the effluent 1 a microfiltration or ultrafiltration membrane is typically used in the low pressure membrane filtration mbr removes the need of a secondary sedimentation basin which greatly decreases the space needed in a densely populated urban area mbr technology offers a stable effluent water quality shorter sludge retention times and a potential 30 50 smaller energy footprint than the conventional process 2 3 however mbr systems are subjected to membrane fouling from particulate deposition bacteria accumulation and biofilm formation on the membrane surface microbial community composition and cell density in activated sludge also influences membrane fouling 4 fouling reduces permeate flux and increases trans membrane pressure which leads to an elevated energy demand and operational costs for the unit 5 currently mbr fouling is mitigated using physical and chemical cleaning methods to remove particulate matter and bacterial biofilm on the membrane surface 5 yet even with repeated cleanings membrane biofouling is still inevitable due to the dense mixture of bacteria and suspended particles in activated sludge therefore it is imperative to find alternative methods to mitigate mbr biofouling past research found that bacteria in wastewater mbrs rely on cell to cell signaling systems known as quorum sensing qs to coordinate community behavior leading to biofilm formation 6 10 the qs pathway is a concentration dependent system where production of sensing molecules depends on the amount of bacteria present in the local environment blocking these bacterial communication pathways may offer a promising approach to control membrane biofouling without exerting external forces that often lead to bacterial resistance several natural or synthetic compounds have been found to impede qs functions and reduce bacterial biofilm formation 11 12 vanillin va a natural favoring agent was shown to inhibit a broad range of gram negative bacterial qs functions relevant to mbr biofouling 13 va is known to modify the signaling molecule in the cell culture to prevent it from binding to the appropriate transcription regulator so that biofilm formation is not activated 14 15 past studies showed that va dosed in the bulk fluid reduced biofilm production and mbr biofouling 11 13 however continuously dosing vanillin in the bulk fluid is not economical because a constant high dose is required to effectively block bacterial communication pathways modification of membrane surface with va could be a promising approach to combat biofilm formation at membrane surfaces instead of in the bulk fluid we recently reported that adsorption of va onto the surface of polyamide reverse osmosis ro membranes 16 can enhance the membrane s anti biofouling property 17 18 the additional va layer also did not impact membrane performance in respect to pure water permeate flux and salt rejection in a high pressure ro system subjected to high density of marine bacteria and nutrients biofilm production was suppressed on va modified membranes and the water flux was improved compared to the unmodified membrane 16 however va coated by physical adsorption was not stable on the membrane surface va was washed off after subjecting to cross flow for longer than 48 h the goal of this study was to develop an in situ anti biofouling membrane by chemically linking va to the surface of a microfiltration membrane to improve va s retention a williamson ether synthesis reaction was used to modify the membrane surface to maintain va s qs inhibition qsi activity raman and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy were used to verify va attachment and retention on the modified membrane surface the modified membrane performance was evaluated in a membrane biofouling monitoring system and compared with control and unmodified membranes confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm was used to examine biofilm formation on the fouled membrane samples biofilm coverage on membrane was quantified using comstat 2 software for comparisons between samples tested 2 experimental 2 1 membrane modification a commercially available and commonly used chlorinated polyethylene cpe microfiltration membrane kubota corporation osaka japan was adopted for surface

purification vanillin va 4 hydroxy 3 methosybenzaldehyde potassium carbonate pc and n n dimethylformamide dmf a williamson ether synthesis reaction 19 was adapted to bond va to the cpe membrane surface through the following anticipated steps fig 1 1 pc deprotonates va to produce an alkoxide ion 2 dmf slows down the reaction rate of the highly reactive alkoxide ion 3 alkoxide ion replaces the haloalkane bond on cpe to form an ether bond between va and cpe 20 in preparation for this reaction the cpe membrane was first cleaned with 80 ethanol and then rinsed with di water va pc dmf testing solution was prepared by adding va 0 22 mm final concentration and pc 1 1 mm final concentration to dmf the cpe membrane was soaked in the va pc dmf solution for various time periods to determine the best duration to complete the reaction to further understand changes in the membrane surface chemical structure during va incorporation and the new antifouling properties a second modification solution was prepared by mixing pc with dmf without va this pc dmf testing solution was used for cpe membrane modification following the same reaction procedure as described above the pc dmf modified membrane was used as va negative control for evaluating the membrane performance all membrane samples were rinsed by di water thoroughly after modification reaction to avoid chemical carry over and dried before further analysis 2 2 spectroscopy unmodified and modified membrane samples were analyzed using raman and ftir spectroscopy for raman in vivo microscopy renishaw wotton under edge uk analysis samples were placed directly under the diode laser at an excitation of 532 nm visible light range under 50 000 magnifications spectrums were collected using either 3 mw or 15 mw of laser power and 1 s exposure time from about ten random locations along the membrane surface the baseline was corrected for all spectrums using wire 3 4 software reinshaw wotton under edge uk for ftir r 4700 type a jasco corp tokyo japan analysis each membrane sample was examined at room temperature between 400 4000 cm 1 the signals were collected for 32 scans with a scan interval of 0 241 cm 1 and optical resolution of 1 cm 1 the target ether bond and other relevant peaks were determined by comparing the ftir and raman spectra of reference samples i e unmodified cpe membrane va dmf and pc in its natural state with va pc dmf and pc dmf modified cpe membrane samples spectral peaks were also identified and confirmed by comparing with literature reports 21 29 2 3 stability of va modified membrane va modified membrane stability was assessed under cross flow conditions without high pressure and recirculation of the return line fig s1a va pc dmf cpe modified membrane was framed in a membrane cassette holder centramate pe tff pall corp portsmouth uk the membrane surface dimensions 9 4 25 1 19 3 cm and the cross sectional area of the water path defined by the spacer and o ring was 0 01 m2 was exposed to di water with cross flow of 360 l m2 h for 24 h driven by a peristaltic pump masterflex cole parmer vernon hills usa after drying the modified membranes were analyzed using raman spectroscopy this test was repeated twice to confirm the reproducibility of the results raman spectra on membrane surfaces were compared before and after the flushing experiments to identify any loss of peaks va pc dmf cpe and pc dmf cpe modified membranes were also subjected to cleaning by sodium hypochlorite solution 30 31 free chlorine 8 ppm and ph 9 6 for 30 and 60 min afterwards membranes were rinsed using di water and dried for raman spectroscopy analysis a handheld photometer omega engineering stamford usa was used before and after cleaning tests to determine total chlorine

biofilm formation on the surface of modified and unmodified membranes was evaluated in the membrane cassette system in recirculation mode fig s1b for comparisons unmodified and modified both pc dmf cpe and va pc dmf cpe membranes were inserted in parallel membrane cassette holders dimensions 9 4 25 1 x 19 3 cm and the cross sectional area of the water path defined by the spacer and o ring was 0 01 m2 and were subjected to the same cross flow driven by the same peristalic pump to test the membrane anti fouling potential aerobic activated sludge was collected from the orange county sanitation district wastewater treatment facility fountain valley usa in september 2016 the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids vss were 7 6 g l and 6 1 g l respectively according to the plant s daily report activated sludge was added to the feed tank with no further purification the pump was set to a cross flow of 180 l m2 h for 48 h with no permeation following several previous work indicating cross flow can be an adequate representation of membrane surface fouling propensity 16 44 45 after the experimental period membrane samples were collected from the cassette for further analysis fouling studies were repeated using activated sludge sampled on a separate day to confirm the reproducibility of the results 2 5 cslm microscopy clsm zeiss lsm 700 carl zeiss oberkochen germany was used to characterize live cells dead cells and polysaccharides on membrane surfaces live cells were stained green with styo 9 and dead cells were stained red with propidium iodide following guidelines in the filmtracer live dead biofilm viability kit invitrogen carlsbad usa polysaccharides on a separate membrane coupon were stained using cona lectin concanavalin a conjugate invitrogen carlsbad usa 11 32 nine locations along the length of the coupon were examined to account for variability comstat 2 software was used to calculate biomass volume per membrane area μm3 μm2 and thickness μm from confocal data following past studies 33 34 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane modification raman spectroscopy results fig 2 a confirmed there were abundant haloalkane ccl bonds on the virgin cpe membrane surface with major peaks at 637 and 698 cm 1 35 in comparison these haloalkane bonds were removed on va pc dmf cpe membranes fig 2b additionally several new bonds on the va pc dmf cpe raman spectra fig 2b d were observed at 1180 1291 and 1497 cm 1 that correspond to pure va functional groups 21 36 these va specific peaks were not seen on the pc dmf cpe membrane fig 2c during the williamson ether reaction the hydroxyl group of va was deprotonated resulting in the alkoxide ion which then formed an ether bond with the cpe surface 19 consistent with this reaction an ether bond was identified at raman shift of 1098 cm 1 on va pc dmf cpe membrane fig 2b which did not correspond to any other reactant 37 under raman spectroscopy the loss of the hydroxyl group from va could not be well observed 21 38 ftir was used to confirm the reaction mechanism fig 3 ftir spectral data showed that the hydroxyl group of va between 3000 3600 cm 1 fig 3h was absent on va pc dmf cpe membrane surface fig 3d ftir spectroscopy also verified the formation of an ether bond at 1098 cm 1 on va pc dmf cpe membrane fig 3c 21 39 this result confirmed the replacement of oh with coc bond however ftir data revealed the c cl bond was reduced but still present on va pc dmf cpe membrane surface fig 3c spectral peaks associated with ch bond of chcl at 1265 and 2970 cm 1 fig 3c 3d were also present on va pc dmf cpe membrane surface 23 35 to further understand the change in the membrane s chemical structure in respect to the removal of ccl bonds the ftir spectra of va pc dmf cpe membrane fig 3c d was compared with pc dmf cpe membrane fig 3e f and the pure chemical reactants va fig 3g h and dmf fig 3i j ftir chlorine spectra peaks 1265 and 2970 cm 1 corresponding to the ch bond of chcl was identified on the pc dmf cpe membrane fig 3e 3 f however the ftir peak at 1265 cm 1 overlaps with the n ch3 bond of the amide in dmf fig 3i and c och3 peak in va fig 3g 21 40 the 2970 cm 1 peak overlaps with the methyl group of va fig 3h and c h stretch of dmf fig 3j 21 40 therefore it is difficult to assess the extent of va replacing the haloalkane bonds from these peaks it is possible chlorine was not completely replaced by va during the reaction this could be due to the kinetics and energy threshold needed to break the haloalkane bonds on the cpe surface it is also important to note that pc dmf testing solution altered the cpe membrane surface with spectral peaks representing pure dmf and new peaks not associated with any reactant which likely corresponding to nh c n c h and cc bonds 25 26 40 fig 3e f i j since the reaction was not run to completion ftir and raman were used to determine a suitable reaction time overall as the reaction between va pc dmf and cpe progressed the c cl bond decreased and the ether bond increased under ftir there were significant differences in ftir and raman spectral peaks associated with chlorine ether and vanillin bonds from 1 to 3 minute reaction times data not shown however the ftir and raman spectra revealed that there were no significant differences between 3 and 5 minute reaction times data not shown the surface of the membrane also changed from white to orange as the reaction time increased fig s2 based on the spectral data a 3 min reaction time was selected for the following experiments 3 2 modified membrane stability when the va pc dmf cpe membrane was tested under rapid 24 h cross flow flushing using neutral ph di water no significant change in spectral peaks under raman spectroscopy was observed on the membrane before and after experiments data not shown this data indicated that the modified membrane was stable under cross flow conditions and likely stable during water treatment process in addition stability tests using sodium hypochlorite 8 ppm free chlorine as a cleaning solution indicated that chemical structures of va pc dmf cpe membrane were stable no significant change was observed on membrane surfaces based on peaks revealed by raman spectroscopy data not shown after 1 h of sodium hypochlorite cleaning there was also no considerable change in ph of the cleaning solution ph 9 6 a decrease in free chlorine after the cleaning experiment was observed which indicated a possible reaction between the modified membrane and hypochlorite such as oxidation of the aldehyde functional group of vanillin to carboxylic acid 41 however such reaction could not be verified by raman spectroscopy alternatively chorine may become volatilized during the cleaning procedure since cleaning was performed in an open system it should be mentioned that the free chlorine concentration used in this study was lower than that applied in industrial cleaning 100 1000 ppm 30 31 the target ph was in range with industry guidelines 10 12 42 to remove organic foulants and biofilm therefore future studies should examine membrane surface stability under a large range and higher concentration of free chlorine 3 3 membrane biofilm production fig 4 illustrates the coverage of live bacteria dead bacteria and polysaccharides on the modified and unmodified cpe surfaces using image j volume viewer plugin the unmodified membrane had an uneven distribution of dead bacteria with live bacteria densely covering the membrane surface fig 4a the pc dmf cpe membrane experienced a reduction in live and dead bacteria on the surface compared to the unmodified membrane fig 4b the va pc dmf cpe membrane had live and dead bacteria sparsely covering the surface fig 4c the polysaccharide formation on the membrane surface followed a similar trend the unmodified membrane had the highest production of polysaccharides whereas the pc dmf cpe and va pc dmf cpe had much lower amounts of polysaccharides fig 4d f the comstat 2 results fig 5 compare the live cell dead cell and polysaccharide distribution on membrane surface between unmodified and modified cpe membranes subjected to activated sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant the results verified that both pc dmf cpe and va pc dmf cpe membranes had a significant reduction p 0 05 for all in live and dead cells biomass and biofilm thickness compared to the unmodified cpe membrane pc dmf cpe membrane had a 50 58 and 41 58 decrease in live cell biomass and thickness respectively compared to the unmodified cpe membrane fig 5a there was also a 52 02 and 47 57 reduction in dead cell biomass and thickness fig 5b this was consistent with past research indicating that dmf has anti microbial activity 43 the addition of va on the membrane surface further enhanced the anti biofilm potential of the modified membrane va pc dmf cpe membrane significantly decreased live cell biomass and thickness by 81 75 and 56 77 compared to the unmodified cpe membrane fig 5a va pc dmf cpe membranes experienced a 77 36 and 58 07 decrease in dead cell biomass and thickness on the membrane surface fig 5b both va pc dmf cpe and pc dmf cpe membranes experienced up to 50 89 significant reduction p 0 05 for all in polysaccharide coverage on the membrane surface compared to the unmodified cpe membrane fig 5c raman spectroscopy also indicated that va was still present on modified membranes after used in membrane biofouling experiments but slightly reduced overall the addition of va on the modified membrane surface led to a greater resistance towards bacterial colonization and biofilm production from activated sludge compared to dmf modified and unmodified cpe membranes the mechanism for biofilm reduction on va modified membranes is not entirely clear pure va inhibits the qs pathway by altering the qs molecule in solution so that qs cannot bind to the transcription regulator to activate biofilm formation 14 15 in our previous work on membrane desalination biofouling study we observed that free va in the bulk fluid caused a significant reduction in polysaccharide content on membrane surfaces but no significant change in the density of live cells in the biofilm 11 in the current study with va incorporated on the membrane surface va pc dmf cpe membrane had a significant reduction of polysaccharides as well as live and dead cell density the overall biofilm biomass significantly reduced in comparison with the unmodified membrane a similar but to a lesser extent reduction of biofilm biomass was also observed on the pc dmf cpe in the absence of va this result suggests that va and dmf have a synergetic effect for biofilm reduction which may be due to dmf s antimicrobial activities it is possible that anchoring va to the membrane surface by an ether bond altered the chemical structure of va and changed its qs inhibiting mechanism these changes are not yet understood and would be interesting to study in future work lastly one concern of membrane surface modification is the loss of water permeability specifically adding organic molecules to the membrane layer may have pore blocking effect although the pore blocking effect cannot be completely ruled out for va binding to cpe we had shown in our early study that coating of va on membrane surface had minor impact on pure water flux but significant improvement in water flux under biofouling conditions 16 since membrane biofouling is the main cause of water flux reduction 16 44 45 mitigation of biofouling on membrane surface by linking of va to the cpe membrane would likely result in improved water flux during wastewater treatment operation 4 conclusion this study showed that an ether bond was established between va and the surface of a cpe membrane va was retained and the ether bond was stable under filtration conditions and chemical cleaning under fouling conditions the va pc dmf cpe membrane inhibited live and dead bacteria and suppressed polysaccharide production compared to the unmodified cpe membrane this research showed that va pc dmf cpe membranes have the

membrane was used as va negative control for evaluating the membrane performance all membrane samples were rinsed by di water thoroughly after modification reaction to avoid chemical carry over and dried before further analysis 2 2 spectroscopy unmodified and modified membrane samples were analyzed using raman and ftir spectroscopy for raman in vivo microscopy renishaw wotton under edge uk analysis samples were placed directly under the diode laser at an excitation of 532 nm visible light range under 50 000 magnifications spectrums were collected using either 3 mw or 15 mw of laser power and 1 s exposure time from about ten random locations along the membrane surface the baseline was corrected for all spectrums using wire 3 4 software reinshaw wotton under edge uk for ftir r 4700 type a jasco corp tokyo japan analysis each membrane sample was examined at room temperature between 400 4000 cm 1 the signals were collected for 32 scans with a scan interval of 0 241 cm 1 and optical resolution of 1 cm 1 the target ether bond and other relevant peaks were determined by comparing the ftir and raman spectra of reference samples i e unmodified cpe membrane va dmf and pc in its natural state with va pc dmf and pc dmf modified cpe membrane samples spectral peaks were also identified and confirmed by comparing with literature reports 21 29 2 3 stability of va modified membrane va modified membrane stability was assessed under cross flow conditions without high pressure and recirculation of the return line fig s1a va pc dmf cpe modified membrane was framed in a membrane cassette holder centramate pe tff pall corp portsmouth uk the membrane surface dimensions 9 4 25 1 19 3 cm and the cross sectional area of the water path defined by the spacer and o ring was 0 01 m2 was exposed to di water with cross flow of 360 l m2 h for 24 h driven by a peristaltic pump masterflex cole parmer vernon hills usa after drying the modified membranes were analyzed using raman spectroscopy this test was repeated twice to confirm the reproducibility of the results raman spectra on membrane surfaces were compared before and after the flushing experiments to identify any loss of peaks va pc dmf cpe and pc dmf cpe modified membranes were also subjected to cleaning by sodium hypochlorite solution 30 31 free chlorine 8 ppm and ph 9 6 for 30 and 60 min afterwards membranes were rinsed using di water and dried for raman spectroscopy analysis a handheld photometer omega engineering stamford usa was used before and after cleaning tests to determine total chlorine and free chlorine concentrations ph values were measured using fisher scientific accumet ab15 basic and biobasic ph mv c meters fisher scientific pittsburgh usa 2 4 membrane anti biofouling potential biofilm formation on the surface of modified and unmodified membranes was evaluated in the membrane cassette system in recirculation mode fig s1b for comparisons unmodified and modified both pc dmf cpe and va pc dmf cpe membranes were inserted in parallel membrane cassette holders dimensions 9 4 25 1 x 19 3 cm and the cross sectional area of the water path defined by the spacer and o ring was 0 01 m2 and were subjected to the same cross flow driven by the same peristalic pump to test the membrane anti fouling potential aerobic activated sludge was collected from the orange county sanitation district wastewater treatment facility fountain valley usa in september 2016 the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids vss were 7 6 g l and 6 1 g l respectively according to the plant s daily report activated sludge was added to the feed tank with no further purification the pump was set to a cross flow of 180 l m2 h for 48 h with no permeation following several previous work indicating cross flow can be an adequate representation of membrane surface fouling propensity 16 44 45 after the experimental period membrane samples were collected from the cassette for further analysis fouling studies were repeated using activated sludge sampled on a separate day to confirm the reproducibility of the results 2 5 cslm microscopy clsm zeiss lsm 700 carl zeiss oberkochen germany was used to characterize live cells dead cells and polysaccharides on membrane surfaces live cells were stained green with styo 9 and dead cells were stained red with propidium iodide following guidelines in the filmtracer live dead biofilm viability kit invitrogen carlsbad usa polysaccharides on a separate membrane coupon were stained using cona lectin concanavalin a conjugate invitrogen carlsbad usa 11 32 nine locations along the length of the coupon were examined to account for variability comstat 2 software was used to calculate biomass volume per membrane area μm3 μm2 and thickness μm from confocal data following past studies 33 34 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane modification raman spectroscopy results fig 2 a confirmed there were abundant haloalkane ccl bonds on the virgin cpe membrane surface with major peaks at 637 and 698 cm 1 35 in comparison these haloalkane bonds were removed on va pc dmf cpe membranes fig 2b additionally several new bonds on the va pc dmf cpe raman spectra fig 2b d were observed at 1180 1291 and 1497 cm 1 that correspond to pure va functional groups 21 36 these va specific peaks were not seen on the pc dmf cpe membrane fig 2c during the williamson ether reaction the hydroxyl group of va was deprotonated resulting in the alkoxide ion which then formed an ether bond with the cpe surface 19 consistent with this reaction an ether bond was identified at raman shift of 1098 cm 1 on va pc dmf cpe membrane fig 2b which did not correspond to any other reactant 37 under raman spectroscopy the loss of the hydroxyl group from va could not be well observed 21 38 ftir was used to confirm the reaction mechanism fig 3 ftir spectral data showed that the hydroxyl group of va between 3000 3600 cm 1 fig 3h was absent on va pc dmf cpe membrane surface fig 3d ftir spectroscopy also verified the formation of an ether bond at 1098 cm 1 on va pc dmf cpe membrane fig 3c 21 39 this result confirmed the replacement of oh with coc bond however ftir data revealed the c cl bond was reduced but still present on va pc dmf cpe membrane surface fig 3c spectral peaks associated with ch bond of chcl at 1265 and 2970 cm 1 fig 3c 3d were also present on va pc dmf cpe membrane surface 23 35 to further understand the change in the membrane s chemical structure in respect to the removal of ccl bonds the ftir spectra of va pc dmf cpe membrane fig 3c d was compared with pc dmf cpe membrane fig 3e f and the pure chemical reactants va fig 3g h and dmf fig 3i j ftir chlorine spectra peaks 1265 and 2970 cm 1 corresponding to the ch bond of chcl was identified on the pc dmf cpe membrane fig 3e 3 f however the ftir peak at 1265 cm 1 overlaps with the n ch3 bond of the amide in dmf fig 3i and c och3 peak in va fig 3g 21 40 the 2970 cm 1 peak overlaps with the methyl group of va fig 3h and c h stretch of dmf fig 3j 21 40 therefore it is difficult to assess the extent of va replacing the haloalkane bonds from these peaks it is possible chlorine was not completely replaced by va during the reaction this could be due to the kinetics and energy threshold needed to break the haloalkane bonds on the cpe surface it is also important to note that pc dmf testing solution altered the cpe membrane surface with spectral peaks representing pure dmf and new peaks not associated with any reactant which likely corresponding to nh c n c h and cc bonds 25 26 40 fig 3e f i j since the reaction was not run to completion ftir and raman were used to determine a suitable reaction time overall as the reaction between va pc dmf and cpe progressed the c cl bond decreased and the ether bond increased under ftir there were significant differences in ftir and raman spectral peaks associated with chlorine ether and vanillin bonds from 1 to 3 minute reaction times data not shown however the ftir and raman spectra revealed that there were no significant differences between 3 and 5 minute reaction times data not shown the surface of the membrane also changed from white to orange as the reaction time increased fig s2 based on the spectral data a 3 min reaction time was selected for the following experiments 3 2 modified membrane stability when the va pc dmf cpe membrane was tested under rapid 24 h cross flow flushing using neutral ph di water no significant change in spectral peaks under raman spectroscopy was observed on the membrane before and after experiments data not shown this data indicated that the modified membrane was stable under cross flow conditions and likely stable during water treatment process in addition stability tests using sodium hypochlorite 8 ppm free chlorine as a cleaning solution indicated that chemical structures of va pc dmf cpe membrane were stable no significant change was observed on membrane surfaces based on peaks revealed by raman spectroscopy data not shown after 1 h of sodium hypochlorite cleaning there was also no considerable change in ph of the cleaning solution ph 9 6 a decrease in free chlorine after the cleaning experiment was observed which indicated a possible reaction between the modified membrane and hypochlorite such as oxidation of the aldehyde functional group of vanillin to carboxylic acid 41 however such reaction could not be verified by raman spectroscopy alternatively chorine may become volatilized during the cleaning procedure since cleaning was performed in an open system it should be mentioned that the free chlorine concentration used in this study was lower than that applied in industrial cleaning 100 1000 ppm 30 31 the target ph was in range with industry guidelines 10 12 42 to remove organic foulants and biofilm therefore future studies should examine membrane surface stability under a large range and higher concentration of free chlorine 3 3 membrane biofilm production fig 4 illustrates the coverage of live bacteria dead bacteria and polysaccharides on the modified and unmodified cpe surfaces using image j volume viewer plugin the unmodified membrane had an uneven distribution of dead bacteria with live bacteria densely covering the membrane surface fig 4a the pc dmf cpe membrane experienced a reduction in live and dead bacteria on the surface compared to the unmodified membrane fig 4b the va pc dmf cpe membrane had live and dead bacteria sparsely covering the surface fig 4c the polysaccharide formation on the membrane surface followed a similar trend the unmodified membrane had the highest production of polysaccharides whereas the pc dmf cpe and va pc dmf cpe had much lower amounts of polysaccharides fig 4d f the comstat 2 results fig 5 compare the live cell dead cell and polysaccharide distribution on membrane surface between unmodified and modified cpe membranes subjected to activated sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant the results verified that both pc dmf cpe and va pc dmf cpe membranes had a significant reduction p 0 05 for all in live and dead cells biomass and biofilm thickness compared to the unmodified cpe membrane pc dmf cpe membrane had a 50 58 and 41 58 decrease in live cell biomass and thickness respectively compared to the unmodified cpe membrane fig 5a there was also a 52 02 and 47 57 reduction in dead cell biomass and thickness fig 5b this was consistent with past research indicating that dmf has anti microbial activity 43 the addition of va on the membrane surface further enhanced the anti biofilm potential of the modified membrane va pc dmf cpe membrane significantly decreased live cell biomass and thickness by 81 75 and 56 77 compared to the unmodified cpe membrane fig 5a va pc dmf cpe membranes experienced a 77 36 and 58 07 decrease in dead cell biomass and thickness on the membrane surface fig 5b both va pc dmf cpe and pc dmf cpe membranes experienced up to 50 89 significant reduction p 0 05 for all in polysaccharide coverage on the membrane surface compared to the unmodified cpe membrane fig 5c raman spectroscopy also indicated that va was still present on modified membranes after used in membrane biofouling experiments but slightly reduced overall the addition of va on the modified membrane surface led to a greater resistance towards bacterial colonization and biofilm production from activated sludge compared to dmf modified and unmodified cpe membranes the mechanism for biofilm reduction on va modified membranes is not entirely clear pure va inhibits the qs pathway by altering the qs molecule in solution so that qs cannot bind to the transcription regulator to activate biofilm formation 14 15 in our previous work on membrane desalination biofouling study we observed that free va in the bulk fluid caused a significant reduction in polysaccharide content on membrane surfaces but no significant change in the density of live cells in the biofilm 11 in the current study with va incorporated on the membrane surface va pc dmf cpe membrane had a significant reduction of polysaccharides as well as live and dead cell density the overall biofilm biomass significantly reduced in comparison with the unmodified membrane a similar but to a lesser extent reduction of biofilm biomass was also observed on the pc dmf cpe in the absence of va this result suggests that va and dmf have a synergetic effect for biofilm reduction which may be due to dmf s antimicrobial activities it is possible that anchoring va to the membrane surface by an ether bond altered the chemical structure of va and changed its qs inhibiting mechanism these changes are not yet understood and would be interesting to study in future work lastly one concern of membrane surface modification is the loss of water permeability specifically adding organic molecules to the membrane layer may have pore blocking effect although the pore blocking effect cannot be completely ruled out for va binding to cpe we had shown in our early study that coating of va on membrane surface had minor impact on pure water flux but significant improvement in water flux under biofouling conditions 16 since membrane biofouling is the main cause of water flux reduction 16 44 45 mitigation of biofouling on membrane surface by linking of va to the cpe membrane would likely result in improved water flux during wastewater treatment operation 4 conclusion this study showed that an ether bond was established between va and the surface of a cpe membrane va was retained and the ether bond was stable under filtration conditions and chemical cleaning under fouling conditions the va pc dmf cpe membrane inhibited live and dead bacteria and suppressed polysaccharide production compared to the unmodified cpe membrane this research showed that va pc dmf cpe membranes have the potential to reduce membrane biofouling in wastewater treatment plants acknowledgement funding support for this research was partial provided by u s china clean energy research center for water energy
