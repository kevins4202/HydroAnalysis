18655,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are an effective barrier in the protection of human and environment health around the world although wwtps also are suggested to be selectors and or reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes args before entering the environment the dogma about wwtps as arg selectors presumes that biotreatment compartments e g activated sludge as are single densely populated ecosystems with elevated horizontal gene transfer however recent work has suggested wwtp biotreatment compartments may be different than previously believed relative to antibiotic resistance ar fate and other process factors such as bacterial separation and specific waste sources may be key to args released to the environment here we combined 16s rrna metagenomic sequencing and high throughput qpcr to characterise microbial communities and args across a wastewater network in spain that includes both community i e non clinical urban and hospital sources contrary to expectations args found in downstream receiving waters were not dominated by as biosolids ras but more resembled raw wastewater sources in fact args and microbial communities in liquid phase wwtp effluents and ras were significantly different bray curtis dissimilarity index 0 66 0 11 with a consequential fraction of influent args and organisms passing directly through the wwtp with limited association with ras instead args and organisms in the ras may be more defined by biosolids separation and biophysical traits such as flocculation rather than arg carriage this explains why ras has significantly lower arg richness 47 4 args than liquid phase effluents 104 5 args and downstream water column 135 4 args and river sediments 120 5 args tukey s test p 0 001 these data suggest ras and liquid phase wwtp effluents may reflect two parallel ecosystems with potentially limited arg exchange as such arg mitigation in wwtps should more focus on removing bacterial hosts from the liquid phase ar source reduction and possibly disinfection to reduce arg releases to the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater networks wastewater treatment plants antibiotic resistance spatial ecology microbiomes resistomes 1 introduction antibiotics historically have been among the most effective classes of therapeutic drugs used in the treatment of infectious bacterial disease however successful treatment has been compromised by increasing antibiotic tolerance or resistance ar in bacteria the ability of microbes to resist some antibiotics is natural but ar evolution and spread has accelerated in recent years due to widespread use of antibiotics in medicine agriculture and aquaculture knapp et al 2010 in terms of spread domestic wastewater releases are a key link between human gut and environmental microorganisms influencing the distribution and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes arg across aquatic compartments and microbial communities this has implications to human health owing to possible horizontal gene transfer hgt between environmental bacteria and human pathogens impacting the potential evolution and selection of new ar phenotypes wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered as possible selectors and reservoirs of args since wwtps have abundant microbial communities and receive human associated microorganisms from hospital and community non clinical urban sources bouki et al 2013 yang et al 2013 guo et al 2017 karkman et al 2018 however dogma about arg fate in wwtps has presumed that biotreatment compartments e g activated sludge as are single ecosystems with elevated hgt which recent work suggests may not be correct in fact wastewater networks are comprised of a series of different ecosystems including each wwtp unit operation although few studies have considered multiple ecosystems when assessing the fate of args in wastewater networks li et al 2015 the spatial ecology of wastewater networks is more diverse than many realise comprised of at least four distinct different evolutionary ecosystems that might impact arg fate and spread examples include the gut and faeces of the original individual the sewer line that carries wastewater to the wwtp each unit operation within the wwtp and different receiving water compartments e g water column and sediments each of these ecosystems has different antibiotic chemical exposures microbial cell densities and diversity levels of mixing and meta habitat conditions all of which potentially influence resident args their hosts and hgt within the overall network here we characterised microbiomes and resistomes across an urban wastewater network in spain this network includes community wastes non clinical sources wastes from two hospitals wastewater treatment in an as wwtp and final discharge into a river studying a network with two hospitals is important because antibiotic use is more intensive in hospital settings especially last resort antibiotics selecting for ar bacteria arb over susceptible counterparts stalder et al 2014 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 escudero onate et al 2017 rowe et al 2017 szekeres et al 2017 previous studies show hospital associated wastewaters can contain high levels of resistance to specific antibiotics jakobsen et al 2008 yang et al 2009 fuentefria et al 2011 korzeniewska et al 2013 hocquet et al 2016 although relative masses and volumes often are low compared with community sources li et al 2015 hocquet et al 2016 despite this evidence exists that hospital and community resistomes differ and might contribute differently to downstream environmental resistomes jakobsen et al 2008 rita et al 2013 picão et al 2013 korzeniewska et al 2013 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 as such we looked holistically at the spatial distribution bacterial associations and diversity of args across an entire wastewater network by comparing microbiomes and resistomes among compartments the goal was to clarify which ecosystems and in process mechanisms most strongly impact args found in downstream receiving waters to develop better informed wwtp mitigation solutions for reducing ar releases to the natural environment 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and sampling sampling was performed in summer 2015 across the wastewater network with minimal industrial and agricultural contributions for a city in northwest spain with an estimated population of 95 800 inhabitants summer sampling was selected to assess the worst case scenario in terms of dilution of wwtp effluents in receiving waters the sampling network is shown as fig 1 samples were collected from the sewage effluent from two main hospitals hp a and hp b community sewage only cm and from the influent inf liquid effluent eff and recycled activated sludge ras of the municipal wwtp as well as water column and sediments 100 m upstream ru and sru and downstream rd and srd of the wwtp discharge point this wwtp was designed to treat 184 000 population equivalents which equates to an average daily flow of 54 560 m3 the receiving river has a width depth w d ratio of 4 31 and a channel slope of 0 008 m m the flow rate during the sampling was estimated at 0 2 0 3 m3 s which was about half the wwtp flowrate during the sampling period 0 4 0 5 m3 s such dilution is common in southern europe in the summer keller et al 2014 therefore this network provides data relevant to any location with limited wastewater dilution which recent work has found to be important 7 the city s two main hospitals with approximately 1300 beds contribute less than 2 of volumetric flow to the wwtp no wastewater treatment is performed at the hospitals the community sewage was collected before a pumping station in a neighbourhood sewer system of 18 830 habitants sampling was performed when no rainfall had occurred within three days all sampling included triplicate grab samples per day n 3 per location collected between 9 00 and 11 00 a m on week days over three consecutive work weeks 2 l except for river sediment samples which were collected at the end of the sample campaign at varied locations n 6 approximately 100 m downstream and upstream of the wwtp discharge point from river samples surface water 5 l from the top 0 25 m of the water surface while sediment 500 g was collected from the top 5 cm layer using a gravity corer samples were collected in sterile polystyrene bottles transported to the laboratory on ice in coolers within 5 h and temporarily stored at 4 c before further analysis samples were measured in situ using hand held probes mettler toledo fg3 fivego and jenway model 350 ph meter to characterise wastewater conditions temperature ph dissolved oxygen and conductivity tables s 1 2 2 dna extraction dna was extracted from vacuum filtered biosolids collected using sterile 0 22 μm membrane disc filters millipore billerica ma usa or by pelleting via centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 30 min extraction was performed using the fast dna spin kit for soils mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer s instructions dna was stored at 20 c prior to subsequent analysis it was not possible to perform the ht qpcr for args in samples from the river upstream the wwtp due to low dna concentration 2 3 16s rrna gene sequencing and processing to assess microbial community composition and diversity pcr amplification of the v4

quantified using a qubit dsdna hs assay kit invitrogen on a qubit 2 0 fluorometer and pooled in equimolar amounts before further purified using a pippin prep system life technologies following the manufacturer s protocol subsequent sequencing was performed using an ion torrent personal genome machine pgm system life technology at newcastle university sequences were processed in uparse qiime pipeline pylro et al 2014 2016 the fastq files exported from the ion pgm system were analysed following the recommendations of the brazilian microbiome project bmpos pylro et al 2016 briefly the operational taxonomic unit otu table was built using the uparse pipeline stalder et al 2014 in which reads were truncated at 100 bp and quality filtered using a maximum expected error of 0 5 filtered reads were de replicated and singletons removed the sequences were clustered into otus at 97 similarity cut off checked for chimeras and representative sequences were obtained for each microbial phylotype stalder et al 2014 taxonomic classification used qiime caporaso et al 2010 based on the uclust method against the greengenes 13 8 database szekeres et al 2017 with a confidence threshold of

assignments were imported and merged into phyloseq objects mcmurdie and holmes 2013 all samples were rarefied to ensure the same number of reads per sample i e 8704 which corresponds to the sample with the fewest number of sequences resulting in 6434 otus α diversity indexes richness simpson and shannon pairwise anova of diversity measures between sampling sites non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination and local contributions to β diversity all were calculated using the r package microbiomeseq ssekagiri et al 2017 good coverage was calculated using the goods function of qsrutils package ranked abundance distribution curves and cluster dendrograms of community composition dissimilarity bray curtis average neighbour clustering were calculated with the r package vegan leclercq and wang 2016 r package deseq2 was used to identify significant differences in taxonomic normalized genes at the order level love et al 2014 2 5 biomarker signature analysis lefse to determine bacterial taxa with significantly different abundance among sampling sites biomarker analysis was performed using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method segata et al 2011 in conjunction with an otu normalized relative abundance matrix the lefse method uses the kruskal wallis test to identify significant differences and performs an lda to evaluate the effect of taxa group size a threshold score of 2 and a significant α of 0 05 were used to detect differences 2 6 evidence of different wastewater network microbial communities in receiving river microbial communities sourcetracker a bayesian approach for estimating proportions of a community containing mixed sources knights et al 2011 was used to estimate the relative contributions of microbial communities from different sources across the wastewater network to downstream sinks leclercq et al 2016 gou et al 2018 to perform this analysis 16s rrna sequence data were grouped in cluster dendrograms of community composition dissimilarity bray curtis average neighbour clustering based on otu distributions for characteristic sources sources included raw wastewater e g community and hospital wastes and wwtp influent n 12 ras n 3 and the river upstream n 3 to check homogeneity of this source classification we used leave one out source class prediction for bayesian models to ensure that all identified sources looked the same the sinks included the liquid effluent from the wwtp the downstream water column and downstream river sediments otus present in only one sample were removed prior to the analysis sourcetracker uses gibb s sampling markov chain monte carlo algorithm to estimate the source proportions and allocates unexplained otus in the sinks as from an unknown source sourcetracker analysis was carried out at a depth of 8 704 with 100 iterations default 10 re starts default and used the auto tuning functionality 2 7 integrons total bacteria and coliform quantification class 1 2 and 3 integron gene cassettes were quantified using quantitative pcr qpcr tables s 2 taqman qpcr reactions were conducted using ssoadvanced universal probes supermix biorad employing the following thermocycle program i 3 min of initial denaturation at 95 c and 40 cycles of ii 5 s denaturation at 95 c and iii 30 s annealing extension at 60 c in addition qpcr also was used to quantify total eubacteria and coliforms using a sybr green based method assay see tables s 2 sybr green reactions were conducted using ssoadvanced universal sybr green supermix biorad employing the following thermocycle program i 2 min of initial denaturation at 98 c and 40 cycles of ii 5 s denaturation at 98 c and iii 5 s annealing extension at 60 c total bacteria or 55 c total coliforms all assays were done in triplicate using the biorad cfx c1000 system biorad hercules ca usa in order to avoid inhibitor effects dna samples were diluted to a working solution of 5 ng ul and an internal control dna always was used in sybr green reactions standard curves for each set of primers were constructed using plasmid clones of the target sequences of between 103 and 108 copy numbers which were used in triplicate and in parallel with each qpcr run 2 8 args via high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr to evaluate the abundance of args in samples high throughput qpcr ht qpcr of args was performed using the smartchip real time pcr wafergen inc usa as described previously wang et al 2014 a total of 296 primer sets tables s 3 were used including 294 validated primer sets targeting 285 args conferring resistance to major classes of antibiotics eight transposases and one 16s rrna gene ht qpcr data were pre processed for each primer set and amplification efficiencies outside an acceptable range 90 110 were discarded amplification was confirmed with at least two positive replicates 2 9 ht qpcr and qpcr statistical analysis data were processed using the r environment version 3 4 3 http www r project org while relative copy number of arg transposase genes and integrase genes were calculated and transformed to absolute copy numbers by normalizing to 16s rrna gene copy numbers for each sample based on the ribosomal rna database rrndb the average number of 16s rrna encoding genes per bacteria genome hereinafter referred as genome is estimated as 4 1 klappenbach et al 2001 16s rrna encoding gene quantities were divided by this value to estimate the number of genomes and the normalized copy numbers of arg or transposases per genome were calculated statistical analyses and data manipulation were performed using the r environment with a significant cutoff of α 0 05 normality was studied by the shapiro wilk test whereas homoscedaticity of the variance was assessed using the levene s test when previous conditions were met one way analysis of variance anova was performed to assess statistically significant differences and if applicable subsequent tukey post hoc test for pairwise comparisons were performed between sampling site pairs when datasets failed to meet normality requirements non parametric statistical analysis were applied for all comparisons thus a krustall wallis test was performed to assess statistically significant differences and if applicable subsequent a games howell post hoc test for pairwise comparison between sampling sites were performed 2 10 correlation analysis between arg subtypes and bacterial communities a mantel test and procrustes analysis were performed to analyse the relationships between args and bacterial communities the mantel test was based on bray curtis dissimilarity matrices of the normalized args and otus data using vegan packages in r the threshold for significance was p 0 05 to perform the procrustes analysis normalized args and otus data were used for non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis oksanen 2015 the two resulting nmds were compared using the procrustes function and significance tested using 999 permutations 2 11 co occurrence between arg subtypes and microbial taxa a correlation matrix was developed by calculating all possible pairwise spearman s rank correlations among 139 bacterial orders 149 args subtypes 5 transposases and 3 integrases present in samples from the study n 27 a correlation between two items was considered statistically robust if the spearman s correlation coefficient ρ was 0 8 and the p value was 0 01 junker and schreiber 2008 to reduce the chances of obtaining false positive results p values were adjusted with a multiple testing correction using the benjamini hochberg method 1995 the robust pairwise correlations of arg subtypes formed co occurrence networks network analyses were performed in r and was visualized and explored to identify its topological properties i e clustering coefficient shortest average path length and modularity in gephi bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 microbial communities across the wastewater network bacterial abundances expressed as a proportion of 16s rrna gene copy number per ng of metagenomic dna varied by one order of magnitude among samples 1 14 107 to 1 34 108 copies per ng dna tables s 4 suggesting bacterial cells were a relatively constant proportion of the total biomass β diversity analysis was used to compare sample diversity among sites for this analysis the dataset was re sampled to obtain the same number of reads per sample which was the sample with the fewest number of sequences resulting in 6434 otus in the analysis the trend of rarefaction curves suggests sufficient representation of the microbial communities figure s 1 good s coverage estimate showed high values all above 93 table 1 indicating our selection of 8704 reads provided a reasonable representation of the sampled communities tables s 4 rarefaction curves for otus showed different bacterial community diversities across sampling sites which were confirmed when evaluating α diversity metrics including richness shannon and simpson indices figure s 1 tables s 4 these indices indicate that raw wastewater associated samples have significantly lower diversity compared with upstream river samples both water column and sediment wwtp liquid effluent and downstream river samples both water column and sediment p value 0 05 therefore bacterial diversity was greater in non wastewater samples presumably due to more rare taxa which is supported by rank abundance distributions figure s 2 additionally the bray curtis dissimilarity dendrogram shows the community structure follows a pattern closely defined by wastewater treatment steps figure s 3 containing three main clusters cut off 0 72 the first one cluster contains river samples upstream of the wwtp water column and sediment the second cluster contains samples associated with raw sewage community and hospital sewage and wwtp influent while the third cluster contains the ras wwtp effluent and the downstream river water and sediment samples distances among different microbial community structures β diversity were visualized in a nmds plot fig 2 where one can see that wwtp effluents and microbial communities in the river downstream appear related although relationships are subtle for example wwtp effluent resembles the downstream water column whereas downstream river sediments more closely align with the ras the composition of bacterial communities also differ among sites at the phylum level figure s 4 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are generally prevalent at all sites conversely firmicutes dominate both community and hospital wastewaters but are lower in the wwtp influent ras and the upstream river chloroflexi and planctomycetes are particularly evident in river sediments upstream and downstream and also in the ras clear differences exist between liquid phase wastewater e g raw sources and wwtp effluents and ras associated samples in fact the ras microbial composition is very different from other samples except the downstream river sediments 3 2 biomarker signature analysis in water sanitation systems characterising microbial communities in each compartment of a wastewater network in terms of diversity evenness and taxonomic composition is key to identifying linkages among compartments and microbial contributions from outside sources we used lefse to identify taxa that were differentially present with each compartment versus taxa that might be present in one compartment but potentially transferred from other compartments lefse analysis showed community wastewater was best characterised by the orders clostridiales and erysipelotrichales fig 3 in contrast hospital wastewater was better characterised by the presence of lactobacilliales and enterobacteriales while pseudomonadales and flavobacteriales tend to reflect wwtp influent ras was defined by spingobacteriales caldilineales and actinomycetales fig 3 as such each compartment has a selected characteristic orders to help delineate the relative influence of different source communities on downstream sink communities 3 3 effect of wastewater network microbial communities on microbial communities in the receiving river sourcetracker analysis was performed to explore the fate of each source including raw wastewater i e hospital community and wwtp influent ras and upstream river water fig 4 tables s 5 each source was quite distinct based on their bray curtis dissimilarity index figure s 3 showing the leave one out source class prediction provided a reasonable reflection of sources fig 4 tables s 5 this allows us to proportionate source influences in sinks for example sequences in the liquid wwtp effluent microbial community were mainly a mixture of raw wastewater 42 0 41 and ras bacteria 33 0 34 similarly the downstream water column was a combination of raw wastewater bacteria 30 0 5 and ras 49 0 71 in contrast downstream sediment sequences were different being dominated by ras 51 0 54 and upstream river sediment bacteria 16 0 59 showing less influence of raw sewage 0 4 downstream sediments were dominated by ras bacteria whereas the water column was more influenced by wwtp influent bacteria finally upstream communities water column and sediment were largely substituted downstream by bacteria from the wwtp fig 4 tables s 5 the venn diagram figure s 5 confirms that raw wwtp influent and ras have very different otu compositions and that wwtp effluent is a combination of both including bacterial species from the wwtp influent that do not appear to establish themselves in ras the figure s 6 summarises relative abundances of effluent taxa associated with the influent figure s 6b ras figure s 6c and persistent taxa from both figure s 6a statistically significant differential abundances in microbial taxa order level exist between wwtp influent and ras figure s 7 which are especially evident when one compares the wwtp effluents with influents figure s 7b and ras figure s 7c respectively in summary ras contributes significantly to the presence of acidimicrobiales actinomycetales caulobacteriales cytophagales myxococcales phos hd20 rhizobiales saprospirales sphingobacteriales and spingomonadales conversely wwtp influent more contributes to the presence of aeromonadales bacterioidales campilobacteriales clostridiales desulfovibrionales enterobacteriales and neisseriales on a network level significantly higher relative abundances of enterobacteriales were found in hospital wastewaters wwtp influent and liquid phase wwtp effluents compared with the ras a conclusion supported by qpcr data on targeted coliform bacteria figure s 8 both raw hospital and community wastewaters have significantly higher relative coliform levels than the ras implying coliforms less readily colonise the ras see figure s 6b this has been suggested before which is explained by the fact that such organisms tend not to intrinsically flocculate huang et al 2018 in contrast coliform levels in liquid wwtp effluent are proportionally higher than in ras this is further evidence that a sub community of enterobacteriales passes directly through the wwtp into the downstream water column 3 4 richness and relative abundance of args and mges in wastewater networks and receiving rivers a total of 255 args and eight transposase genes were quantified by ht qpcr and three integrase genes were quantified by qpcr across all sites detected args encode resistance to eight classes of antibiotics with aminoglycosides β lactam multidrug efflux pumps tetracycline and mlsb resistance being the most frequently encountered types fig 5 some observations are possible first liquid phase wwtp effluents significantly contributed to the number of detected args in the river with 122 args found in downstream sediments significantly greater than the 80 args found in upstream sediments p value 0 01 additionally the highest number of args were found in the hospital wastewaters both hp a and hp b mean 169 8 this was higher than community wastewater n 146 11 and significantly higher than args in the wwtp influent n 124 21 p value 0 01 tables s 6 the lowest number of args were found in the ras which contains only 47 4 args much less than 104 5 args in the wwtp effluent see fig 5 absolute arg concentrations detected in all samples were high ranging from 6 16 108 wwtp effluent to 8 63 1010 ras copies per ml or gram figure s 9 the same was seen for transposon genes with concentrations ranging from 1 01 107 wwtp effluent to 1 16 109 ras copies per gram or ml and integrase genes ranging from 7 37 106 wwtp effluent to 2 17 109 ras copies per gram or ml after ras the downstream river sediments had the highest concentration of args 5 40 1010 copies per gram transposon genes 8 75 108 copies per gram and integrase genes 1 10 109 copies per gram these were significantly higher p value 0 01 than found in the upstream sediments 6 35 109 copies of args per g 7 12 107 copies of transposases per g and 5 96 108 copies of integrases per g the highest arg abundances were found in hospital wastewaters hp a as 3 12 1010 and hp b as 2 23 1010 copies of arg per ml these levels are greater than associated 16s rrna concentrations suggesting that hospital bacteria may carry multiple args per genome more than from community wastewaters args conferring resistance to aminoglycosides were dominant in all samples increasing in relative abundance from the wwtp influent 0 383 0 042 args genome to ras 0 536 0 365 args genome the same pattern is true for genes conferring resistance to fca sulphonamides and vancomycin although only one gene was detected in the latter two cases figure s 10 args conferring resistance to β lactam antibiotics were the second most abundant type per genome in raw wastewater sources hospital and community ranging from 2 649 0 349 args genome in hospital wastes hp a and hp b to 0 199 0 044 args genome in community wastes by contrast multidrug efflux pumps were the second most common mechanism ranging from 0 273 0 122 args genome in wwtp effluents to only 0 037 0 001 args genome in upstream sediments less abundant gene classes were for fca ranging from 0 177 0 027 args genome in hospital wastes hp a and hp b to 0 009 0 008 args genome in the wwtp effluent finally vancomycin resistance genes were 0 037 0 006 args genome in hospital wastes hp a and hp b but were less than 0 001 args genome in wwtp influent although the wwtp itself significantly reduces the concentrations of most arg groups between influent and effluent tables s 7 actual arg richness and the number of resistance genes per genome did not change significantly between the wwtp influent and effluent relative to river sediment resistomes a significant increase in arg concentrations were seen in all groups upstream and downstream of the wwtp except for fca and vancomycin the richness of args conferring resistance to aminoglycosides β lactams mlsb and tetracycline all increased significantly p 0 01 tables s 8 further the average number of args per genome in downstream sediments also increased significantly for aminoglycosides β lactams mlsb multidrug efflux systems tetracyclines and also the number of transposase and integrase genes per genome overall args transposase and integrase genes per genome tables s 9 were highest in the hospital wastewaters for example 13 9 args per genome were detected in hospital wastewaters which is much higher than community wastewater 1 6 args genome ras 1 0 args genome wwtp liquid effluent 0 8 args genome upstream river sediments 0 1 args genome downstream river sediments 1 4 args genome and the downstream water column 0 6 args genome in this network hospital wastewater was only 1 65 1 84 of the total flow volume to the wwtp however based on mass balances assuming 9 39 log of genomes per ml in hospital wastes and 9 28 log of genomes per ml in community wastes hospital wastes contribute from 15 8 to 17 3 of args to the wwtp finally a venn diagram overlaying args present in hospital versus community sources and the receiving waters show 15 unique args are attributable to hospitals whereas only six args are attributable to community wastes figure s 11 using two dimensional hierarchical clustering in conjunction with an arg heatmap of relative abundances figure s 12 arg co occurrence patterns were delineated across network compartments sample types split into general clusters with hospital wastewater samples clustering together in terms of args whereas community wastewater more clusters with wwtp influent and effluent and the downstream water column in contrast args in upstream river sediments and the ras cluster very different from all other samples clustering suggests args found in the ras minimally relate to wwtp influents and downstream water column samples 3 5 relationships between bacterial communities and args the mantel test showed that bacterial community compositions were significantly correlated with args compositions according to the bray curtis dissimilarity index r 0 338 p 0 003 procrustes analysis further supports significant correlations between prevalent args and bacterial composition 16s rrna gene otus data bray curtis dissimilarity index sum of squares m12 0 344 r 0 810 p 0 001 999 permutations figure s 13 these results confirm resistomes generally link with microbial communities here the wwtp influent liquid effluent and downstream water column resistomes were similar whereas ras was very different 3 6 co occurrence patterns among args subtypes co correlation networks are well suited to detecting general patterns in highly populated taxonomic groups co occurrence patterns between args and microbial taxa order level were investigated using a network analysis approach figure s 14 we hypothesized that non random co occurrence patterns between args and microbial taxa would suggest possible host information of args if the args and co existing microbial taxa display strong and significantly positive correlations spearman s r2 0 8 p 0 01 in data here the co correlation network consisted of 203 nodes arg subtypes and 1593 edges with an average degree or node connectivity of 15 695 the average network distance between all pairs of nodes average path length was 2 771 edges with a network diameter of 8 edges as shown in figure s 14 network analysis produces two independent groups the first group figure s 14a includes all args transposase genes and integrase genes and associates with only 13 taxa in contrast the second group contains taxa only and no amr related elements figure s 14b both groups can be visualized as independent networks see fig 6 with the first group as probable arg hosts with characteristic bacteria from wastewater sources community hospital and wwtp influent including enterobacteriales pseudomonadales and clostridiales figure s 6a the second group which does not correlate with args transposase genes or integrase genes figure s 15 is primarily composed of ras enriched taxa figure s 6a such as actinomycetales and spingomonadales this is further corroboration that the ras microbial community does not strongly associate with args in wwtp effluents 4 discussion this study elucidated the spatial ecology of args within a southern european wastewater network that includes both hospital and community wastewater sources the wastewater network was in spain sampled during worst case scenario conditions when wwtp effluent dilution rates in the river were very low a common scenario in drier climates data show this wastewater network can be divided into three microbial source communities raw wastewater ras and the river upstream which differentially explain where how and why args spread across the larger network baquero et al 2008 these communities relate to three evolutionary ecosystems with different habitat and selection factors the first ecosystem and its microbial community are the raw wastewater sources hospital community and wwtp influent hospital and community wastewaters are microbiologically closer to raw waste sources faecal matter whereas microbial communities change as the wastewater flows down the sewer line this change is characterised by a shift from obligate anaerobes presumably from source faeces to facultative anaerobes shanks et al 2013 bengtsson palme et al 2015 the second ecosystem is the core wwtp biological treatment community i e ras which despite continuous inputs of wastewater has its own unique microbial composition that significantly differs from the wastewater sources and the liquid phase wwtp effluent the ras community has high arg abundances but very low arg richness and does not resemble wastewater sources in terms of args or bacterial composition based on this and other data we suspect args found in ras are largely coincidental because the ras community is primarily being selected by wwtp operating conditions such as biosolids settling within the secondary clarifier this conclusion is consistent with cai et al 2014 and huang et al 2018 who showed microbial communities in activated sludge were less affected by the wwtp influent bacteria suggesting large fractions of wwtp influent bacteria disappear or decrease significantly in the ras compared with the influent tang et al 2016 in total these data suggest that free living microorganisms which do not aggregate in flocs or do not readily settle in the clarifier appear to pass through the wwtp it further suggests ras and the liquid phase and their microorganisms may represent two ecosystems which is key to explaining arg fate within and beyond the biotreatment compartment most studies on ar studies presume wwtps especially ras are a place of active arg exchange e g ma et al 2011 burch et al 2013 which data here suggest may not be the case the third ecosystem and its microbial community associated with the upstream river water column and sediment which clusters away from the other groups this community clearly changes upon reception of the wwtp effluents becoming a combination of microorganisms from the raw wastewater ras and upstream community in the downstream water column and sediments although wastewater treatment reduces the bacterial load by several orders of magnitude large volumes of treated wastewater inputs increase the abundance and richness of args in the river sediment downstream compared to upstream of wwtp discharges these results are consistent with those of other studies pruden et al 2012 marti et al 2013 karkman et al 2016 brown et al 2019 overall findings here are consistent with munck et al 2015 who showed the core resistome of biological wastewater treatment units is different from other parts of urban water ecosystems and not necessarily a hot spot for gene transfer specifically we show human waste associated args often pass directly through wwtps without inclusion into the ras therefore although biological treatment units and ras are important to carbon and nitrogen removal other factors are more important to the fate of args within the same wwtps data suggest the type and performance of biosolids separation units may be key to downstream resistomes the non floc phase has greater arg richness and bacteria with more args genome suggesting that removing unsettlable biosolids may be more critical for reducing arg releases to the environment if this is true greater emphasis is needed in understanding and improving biosolids separation in wwtps implicitly membrane bioreactors may be better from removing args which reports have suggested lea et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 5 conclusions this study shows that understanding the spatial ecology of a wastewater network is critical to explaining what impacts args released from wwtps specifically ras and the associated liquid phase in biotreatment compartments appear to be two parallel ecosystems as such arg fate and releases from a wwtp may be more associated with bacterial biophysical traits such as tendencies towards flocculation and settling it also shows that source wastewater args may be more important to wwtp effluents than believed albeit in subtle ways as an example greater arg richness and higher levels of args genome prevail in hospital sources might disproportionately influence args entering the wwtp and in turn organisms passing through the wwtp in liquid effluents to the receiving water this problem may be particularly acute in southern europe in the summer or anywhere else where receiving water dilution levels are low taken together this work shows less studied factors such as the spatial ecology of whole networks and the local ecology of unit operations may be critical to improving arg mitigation by wwtps based the network studied future focus should be on ar source reduction improving biosolids separation and possibly disinfection to reduce arg releases in

18655,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are an effective barrier in the protection of human and environment health around the world although wwtps also are suggested to be selectors and or reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes args before entering the environment the dogma about wwtps as arg selectors presumes that biotreatment compartments e g activated sludge as are single densely populated ecosystems with elevated horizontal gene transfer however recent work has suggested wwtp biotreatment compartments may be different than previously believed relative to antibiotic resistance ar fate and other process factors such as bacterial separation and specific waste sources may be key to args released to the environment here we combined 16s rrna metagenomic sequencing and high throughput qpcr to characterise microbial communities and args across a wastewater network in spain that includes both community i e non clinical urban and hospital sources contrary to expectations args found in downstream receiving waters were not dominated by as biosolids ras but more resembled raw wastewater sources in fact args and microbial communities in liquid phase wwtp effluents and ras were significantly different bray curtis dissimilarity index 0 66 0 11 with a consequential fraction of influent args and organisms passing directly through the wwtp with limited association with ras instead args and organisms in the ras may be more defined by biosolids separation and biophysical traits such as flocculation rather than arg carriage this explains why ras has significantly lower arg richness 47 4 args than liquid phase effluents 104 5 args and downstream water column 135 4 args and river sediments 120 5 args tukey s test p 0 001 these data suggest ras and liquid phase wwtp effluents may reflect two parallel ecosystems with potentially limited arg exchange as such arg mitigation in wwtps should more focus on removing bacterial hosts from the liquid phase ar source reduction and possibly disinfection to reduce arg releases to the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater networks wastewater treatment plants antibiotic resistance spatial ecology microbiomes resistomes 1 introduction antibiotics historically have been among the most effective classes of therapeutic drugs used in the treatment of infectious bacterial disease however successful treatment has been compromised by increasing antibiotic tolerance or resistance ar in bacteria the ability of microbes to resist some antibiotics is natural but ar evolution and spread has accelerated in recent years due to widespread use of antibiotics in medicine agriculture and aquaculture knapp et al 2010 in terms of spread domestic wastewater releases are a key link between human gut and environmental microorganisms influencing the distribution and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes arg across aquatic compartments and microbial communities this has implications to human health owing to possible horizontal gene transfer hgt between environmental bacteria and human pathogens impacting the potential evolution and selection of new ar phenotypes wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered as possible selectors and reservoirs of args since wwtps have abundant microbial communities and receive human associated microorganisms from hospital and community non clinical urban sources bouki et al 2013 yang et al 2013 guo et al 2017 karkman et al 2018 however dogma about arg fate in wwtps has presumed that biotreatment compartments e g activated sludge as are single ecosystems with elevated hgt which recent work suggests may not be correct in fact wastewater networks are comprised of a series of different ecosystems including each wwtp unit operation although few studies have considered multiple ecosystems when assessing the fate of args in wastewater networks li et al 2015 the spatial ecology of wastewater networks is more diverse than many realise comprised of at least four distinct different evolutionary ecosystems that might impact arg fate and spread examples include the gut and faeces of the original individual the sewer line that carries wastewater to the wwtp each unit operation within the wwtp and different receiving water compartments e g water column and sediments each of these ecosystems has different antibiotic chemical exposures microbial cell densities and diversity levels of mixing and meta habitat conditions all of which potentially influence resident args their hosts and hgt within the overall network here we characterised microbiomes and resistomes across an urban wastewater network in spain this network includes community wastes non clinical sources wastes from two hospitals wastewater treatment in an as wwtp and final discharge into a river studying a network with two hospitals is important because antibiotic use is more intensive in hospital settings especially last resort antibiotics selecting for ar bacteria arb over susceptible counterparts stalder et al 2014 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 escudero onate et al 2017 rowe et al 2017 szekeres et al 2017 previous studies show hospital associated wastewaters can contain high levels of resistance to specific antibiotics jakobsen et al 2008 yang et al 2009 fuentefria et al 2011 korzeniewska et al 2013 hocquet et al 2016 although relative masses and volumes often are low compared with community sources li et al 2015 hocquet et al 2016 despite this evidence exists that hospital and community resistomes differ and might contribute differently to downstream environmental resistomes jakobsen et al 2008 rita et al 2013 picão et al 2013 korzeniewska et al 2013 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 as such we looked holistically at the spatial distribution bacterial associations and diversity of args across an entire wastewater network by comparing microbiomes and resistomes among compartments the goal was to clarify which ecosystems and in process mechanisms most strongly impact args found in downstream receiving waters to develop better informed wwtp mitigation solutions for reducing ar releases to the natural environment 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and sampling sampling was performed in summer 2015 across the wastewater network with minimal industrial and agricultural contributions for a city in northwest spain with an estimated population of 95 800 inhabitants summer sampling was selected to assess the worst case scenario in terms of dilution of wwtp effluents in receiving waters the sampling network is shown as fig 1 samples were collected from the sewage effluent from two main hospitals hp a and hp b community sewage only cm and from the influent inf liquid effluent eff and recycled activated sludge ras of the municipal wwtp as well as water column and sediments 100 m upstream ru and sru and downstream rd and srd of the wwtp discharge point this wwtp was designed to treat 184 000 population equivalents which equates to an average daily flow of 54 560 m3 the receiving river has a width depth w d ratio of 4 31 and a channel slope of 0 008 m m the flow rate during the sampling was estimated at 0 2 0 3 m3 s which was about half the wwtp flowrate during the sampling period 0 4 0 5 m3 s such dilution is common in southern europe in the summer keller et al 2014 therefore this network provides data relevant to any location with limited wastewater dilution which recent work has found to be important 7 the city s two main hospitals with approximately 1300 beds contribute less than 2 of volumetric flow to the wwtp no wastewater treatment is performed at the hospitals the community sewage was collected before a pumping station in a neighbourhood sewer system of 18 830 habitants sampling was performed when no rainfall had occurred within three days all sampling included triplicate grab samples per day n 3 per location collected between 9 00 and 11 00 a m on week days over three consecutive work weeks 2 l except for river sediment samples which were collected at the end of the sample campaign at varied locations n 6 approximately 100 m downstream and upstream of the wwtp discharge point from river samples surface water 5 l from the top 0 25 m of the water surface while sediment 500 g was collected from the top 5 cm layer using a gravity corer samples were collected in sterile polystyrene bottles transported to the laboratory on ice in coolers within 5 h and temporarily stored at 4 c before further analysis samples were measured in situ using hand held probes

vacuum filtered biosolids collected using sterile 0 22 μm membrane disc filters millipore billerica ma usa or by pelleting via centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 30 min extraction was performed using the fast dna spin kit for soils mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer s instructions dna was stored at 20 c prior to subsequent analysis it was not possible to perform the ht qpcr for args in samples from the river upstream the wwtp due to low dna concentration 2 3 16s rrna gene sequencing and processing to assess microbial community composition and diversity pcr amplification of the v4

quantified using a qubit dsdna hs assay kit invitrogen on a qubit 2 0 fluorometer and pooled in equimolar amounts before further purified using a pippin prep system life technologies following the manufacturer s protocol subsequent sequencing was performed using an ion torrent personal genome machine pgm system life technology at newcastle university sequences were processed in uparse qiime pipeline pylro et al 2014 2016 the fastq files exported from the ion pgm system were analysed following the recommendations of the brazilian microbiome project bmpos pylro et al 2016 briefly the operational taxonomic unit otu table was built using the uparse pipeline stalder et al 2014 in which reads were truncated at 100 bp and quality filtered using a maximum expected error of 0 5 filtered reads were de replicated and singletons removed the sequences were clustered into otus at 97 similarity cut off checked for chimeras and representative sequences were obtained for each microbial phylotype stalder et al 2014 taxonomic classification used qiime caporaso et al 2010 based on the uclust method against the greengenes 13 8 database szekeres et al 2017 with a confidence threshold of

assignments were imported and merged into phyloseq objects mcmurdie and holmes 2013 all samples were rarefied to ensure the same number of reads per sample i e 8704 which corresponds to the sample with the fewest number of sequences resulting in 6434 otus α diversity indexes richness simpson and shannon pairwise anova of diversity measures between sampling sites non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination and local contributions to β diversity all were calculated using the r package microbiomeseq ssekagiri et al 2017 good coverage was calculated using the goods function of qsrutils package ranked abundance distribution curves and cluster dendrograms of community composition dissimilarity bray curtis average neighbour clustering were calculated with the r package vegan leclercq and wang 2016 r package deseq2 was used to identify significant differences in taxonomic normalized genes at the order level love et al 2014 2 5 biomarker signature analysis lefse to determine bacterial taxa with significantly different abundance among sampling sites biomarker analysis was performed using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method segata et al 2011 in conjunction with an otu normalized relative abundance matrix the lefse method uses the kruskal wallis test to identify significant differences and performs an lda to evaluate the effect of taxa group size a threshold score of 2 and a significant α of 0 05 were used to detect differences 2 6 evidence of different wastewater network microbial communities in receiving river microbial communities sourcetracker a bayesian approach for estimating proportions of a community containing mixed sources knights et al 2011 was used to estimate the relative contributions of microbial communities from different sources across the wastewater network to downstream sinks leclercq et al 2016 gou et al 2018 to perform this analysis 16s rrna sequence data were grouped in cluster dendrograms of community composition dissimilarity bray curtis average neighbour clustering based on otu distributions for characteristic sources sources included raw wastewater e g community and hospital wastes and wwtp influent n 12 ras n 3 and the river upstream n 3 to check homogeneity of this source classification we used leave one out source class prediction for bayesian models to ensure that all identified sources looked the same the sinks included the liquid effluent from the wwtp the downstream water column and downstream river sediments otus present in only one sample were removed prior to the analysis sourcetracker uses gibb s sampling markov chain monte carlo algorithm to estimate the source proportions and allocates unexplained otus in the sinks as from an unknown source sourcetracker analysis was carried out at a depth of 8 704 with 100 iterations default 10 re starts default and used the auto tuning functionality 2 7 integrons total bacteria and coliform quantification class 1 2 and 3 integron gene cassettes were quantified using quantitative pcr qpcr tables s 2 taqman qpcr reactions were conducted using ssoadvanced universal probes supermix biorad employing the following thermocycle program i 3 min of initial denaturation at 95 c and 40 cycles of ii 5 s denaturation at 95 c and iii 30 s annealing extension at 60 c in addition qpcr also was used to quantify total eubacteria and coliforms using a sybr green based method assay see tables s 2 sybr green reactions were conducted using ssoadvanced universal sybr green supermix biorad employing the following thermocycle program i 2 min of initial denaturation at 98 c and 40 cycles of ii 5 s denaturation at 98 c and iii 5 s annealing extension at 60 c total bacteria or 55 c total coliforms all assays were done in triplicate using the biorad cfx c1000 system biorad hercules ca usa in order to avoid inhibitor effects dna samples were diluted to a working solution of 5 ng ul and an internal control dna always was used in sybr green reactions standard curves for each set of primers were constructed using plasmid clones of the target sequences of between 103 and 108 copy numbers which were used in triplicate and in parallel with each qpcr run 2 8 args via high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr to evaluate the abundance of args in samples high throughput qpcr ht qpcr of args was performed using the smartchip real time pcr wafergen inc usa as described previously wang et al 2014 a total of 296 primer sets tables s 3 were used including 294 validated primer sets targeting 285 args conferring resistance to major classes of antibiotics eight transposases and one 16s rrna gene ht qpcr data were pre processed for each primer set and amplification efficiencies outside an acceptable range 90 110 were discarded amplification was confirmed with at least two positive replicates 2 9 ht qpcr and qpcr statistical analysis data were processed using the r environment version 3 4 3 http www r project org while relative copy number of arg transposase genes and integrase genes were calculated and transformed to absolute copy numbers by normalizing to 16s rrna gene copy numbers for each sample based on the ribosomal rna database rrndb the average number of 16s rrna encoding genes per bacteria genome hereinafter referred as genome is estimated as 4 1 klappenbach et al 2001 16s rrna encoding gene quantities were divided by this value to estimate the number of genomes and the normalized copy numbers of arg or transposases per genome were calculated statistical analyses and data manipulation were performed using the r environment with a significant cutoff of α 0 05 normality was studied by the shapiro wilk test whereas homoscedaticity of the variance was assessed using the levene s test when previous conditions were met one way analysis of variance anova was performed to assess statistically significant differences and if applicable subsequent tukey post hoc test for pairwise comparisons were performed between sampling site pairs when datasets failed to meet normality requirements non parametric statistical analysis were applied for all comparisons thus a krustall wallis test was performed to assess statistically significant differences and if applicable subsequent a games howell post hoc test for pairwise comparison between sampling sites were performed 2 10 correlation analysis between arg subtypes and bacterial communities a mantel test and procrustes analysis were performed to analyse the relationships between args and bacterial communities the mantel test was based on bray curtis dissimilarity matrices of the normalized args and otus data using vegan packages in r the threshold for significance was p 0 05 to perform the procrustes analysis normalized args and otus data were used for non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis oksanen 2015 the two resulting nmds were compared using the procrustes function and significance tested using 999 permutations 2 11 co occurrence between arg subtypes and microbial taxa a correlation matrix was developed by calculating all possible pairwise spearman s rank correlations among 139 bacterial orders 149 args subtypes 5 transposases and 3 integrases present in samples from the study n 27 a correlation between two items was considered statistically robust if the spearman s correlation coefficient ρ was 0 8 and the p value was 0 01 junker and schreiber 2008 to reduce the chances of obtaining false positive results p values were adjusted with a multiple testing correction using the benjamini hochberg method 1995 the robust pairwise correlations of arg subtypes formed co occurrence networks network analyses were performed in r and was visualized and explored to identify its topological properties i e clustering coefficient shortest average path length and modularity in gephi bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 microbial communities across the wastewater network bacterial abundances expressed as a proportion of 16s rrna gene copy number per ng of metagenomic dna varied by one order of magnitude among samples 1 14 107 to 1 34 108 copies per ng dna tables s 4 suggesting bacterial cells were a relatively constant proportion of the total biomass β diversity analysis was used to compare sample diversity among sites for this analysis the dataset was re sampled to obtain the same number of reads per sample which was the sample with the fewest number of sequences resulting in 6434 otus in the analysis the trend of rarefaction curves suggests sufficient representation of the microbial communities figure s 1 good s coverage estimate showed high values all above 93 table 1 indicating our selection of 8704 reads provided a reasonable representation of the sampled communities tables s 4 rarefaction curves for otus showed different bacterial community diversities across sampling sites which were confirmed when evaluating α diversity metrics including richness shannon and simpson indices figure s 1 tables s 4 these indices indicate that raw wastewater associated samples have significantly lower diversity compared with upstream river samples both water column and sediment wwtp liquid effluent and downstream river samples both water column and sediment p value 0 05 therefore bacterial diversity was greater in non wastewater samples presumably due to more rare taxa which is supported by rank abundance distributions figure s 2 additionally the bray curtis dissimilarity dendrogram shows the community structure follows a pattern closely defined by wastewater treatment steps figure s 3 containing three main clusters cut off 0 72 the first one cluster contains river samples upstream of the wwtp water column and sediment the second cluster contains samples associated with raw sewage community and hospital sewage and wwtp influent while the third cluster contains the ras wwtp effluent and the downstream river water and sediment samples distances among different microbial community structures β diversity were visualized in a nmds plot fig 2 where one can see that wwtp effluents and microbial communities in the river downstream appear related although relationships are subtle for example wwtp effluent resembles the downstream water column whereas downstream river sediments more closely align with the ras the composition of bacterial communities also differ among sites at the phylum level figure s 4 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are generally prevalent at all sites conversely firmicutes dominate both community and hospital wastewaters but are lower in the wwtp influent ras and the upstream river chloroflexi and planctomycetes are particularly evident in river sediments upstream and downstream and also in the ras clear differences exist between liquid phase wastewater e g raw sources and wwtp effluents and ras associated samples in fact the ras microbial composition is very different from other samples except the downstream river sediments 3 2 biomarker signature analysis in water sanitation systems characterising microbial communities in each compartment of a wastewater network in terms of diversity evenness and taxonomic composition is key to identifying linkages among compartments and microbial contributions from outside sources we used lefse to identify taxa that were differentially present with each compartment versus taxa that might be present in one compartment but potentially transferred from other compartments lefse analysis showed community wastewater was best characterised by the orders clostridiales and erysipelotrichales fig 3 in contrast hospital wastewater was better characterised by the presence of lactobacilliales and enterobacteriales while pseudomonadales and flavobacteriales tend to reflect wwtp influent ras was defined by spingobacteriales caldilineales and actinomycetales fig 3 as such each compartment has a selected characteristic orders to help delineate the relative influence of different source communities on downstream sink communities 3 3 effect of wastewater network microbial communities on microbial communities in the receiving river sourcetracker analysis was performed to explore the fate of each source including raw wastewater i e hospital community and wwtp influent ras and upstream river water fig 4 tables s 5 each source was quite distinct based on their bray curtis dissimilarity index figure s 3 showing the leave one out source class prediction provided a reasonable reflection of sources fig 4 tables s 5 this allows us to proportionate source influences in sinks for example sequences in the liquid wwtp effluent microbial community were mainly a mixture of raw wastewater 42 0 41 and ras bacteria 33 0 34 similarly the downstream water column was a combination of raw wastewater bacteria 30 0 5 and ras 49 0 71 in contrast downstream sediment sequences were different being dominated by ras 51 0 54 and upstream river sediment bacteria 16 0 59 showing less influence of raw sewage 0 4 downstream sediments were dominated by ras bacteria whereas the water column was more influenced by wwtp influent bacteria finally upstream communities water column and sediment were largely substituted downstream by bacteria from the wwtp fig 4 tables s 5 the venn diagram figure s 5 confirms that raw wwtp influent and ras have very different otu compositions and that wwtp effluent is a combination of both including bacterial species from the wwtp influent that do not appear to establish themselves in ras the figure s 6 summarises relative abundances of effluent taxa associated with the influent figure s 6b ras figure s 6c and persistent taxa from both figure s 6a statistically significant differential abundances in microbial taxa order level exist between wwtp influent and ras figure s 7 which are especially evident when one compares the wwtp effluents with influents figure s 7b and ras figure s 7c respectively in summary ras contributes significantly to the presence of acidimicrobiales actinomycetales caulobacteriales cytophagales myxococcales phos hd20 rhizobiales saprospirales sphingobacteriales and spingomonadales conversely wwtp influent more contributes to the presence of aeromonadales bacterioidales campilobacteriales clostridiales desulfovibrionales enterobacteriales and neisseriales on a network level significantly higher relative abundances of enterobacteriales were found in hospital wastewaters wwtp influent and liquid phase wwtp effluents compared with the ras a conclusion supported by qpcr data on targeted coliform bacteria figure s 8 both raw hospital and community wastewaters have significantly higher relative coliform levels than the ras implying coliforms less readily colonise the ras see figure s 6b this has been suggested before which is explained by the fact that such organisms tend not to intrinsically flocculate huang et al 2018 in contrast coliform levels in liquid wwtp effluent are proportionally higher than in ras this is further evidence that a sub community of enterobacteriales passes directly through the wwtp into the downstream water column 3 4 richness and relative abundance of args and mges in wastewater networks and receiving rivers a total of 255 args and eight transposase genes were quantified by ht qpcr and three integrase genes were quantified by qpcr across all sites detected args encode resistance to eight classes of antibiotics with aminoglycosides β lactam multidrug efflux pumps tetracycline and mlsb resistance being the most frequently encountered types fig 5 some observations are possible first liquid phase wwtp effluents significantly contributed to the number of detected args in the river with 122 args found in downstream sediments significantly greater than the 80 args found in upstream sediments p value 0 01 additionally the highest number of args were found in the hospital wastewaters both hp a and hp b mean 169 8 this was higher than community wastewater n 146 11 and significantly higher than args in the wwtp influent n 124 21 p value 0 01 tables s 6 the lowest number of args were found in the ras which contains only 47 4 args much less than 104 5 args in the wwtp effluent see fig 5 absolute arg concentrations detected in all samples were high ranging from 6 16 108 wwtp effluent to 8 63 1010 ras copies per ml or gram figure s 9 the same was seen for transposon genes with concentrations ranging from 1 01 107 wwtp effluent to 1 16 109 ras copies per gram or ml and integrase genes ranging from 7 37 106 wwtp effluent to 2 17 109 ras copies per gram or ml after ras the downstream river sediments had the highest concentration of args 5 40 1010 copies per gram transposon genes 8 75 108 copies per gram and integrase genes 1 10 109 copies per gram these were significantly higher p value 0 01 than found in the upstream sediments 6 35 109 copies of args per g 7 12 107 copies of transposases per g and 5 96 108 copies of integrases per g the highest arg abundances were found in hospital wastewaters hp a as 3 12 1010 and hp b as 2 23 1010 copies of arg per ml these levels are greater than associated 16s rrna concentrations suggesting that hospital bacteria may carry multiple args per genome more than from community wastewaters args conferring resistance to aminoglycosides were dominant in all samples increasing in relative abundance from the wwtp influent 0 383 0 042 args genome to ras 0 536 0 365 args genome the same pattern is true for genes conferring resistance to fca sulphonamides and vancomycin although only one gene was detected in the latter two cases figure s 10 args conferring resistance to β lactam antibiotics were the second most abundant type per genome in raw wastewater sources hospital and community ranging from 2 649 0 349 args genome in hospital wastes hp a and hp b to 0 199 0 044 args genome in community wastes by contrast multidrug efflux pumps were the second most common mechanism ranging from 0 273 0 122 args genome in wwtp effluents to only 0 037 0 001 args genome in upstream sediments less abundant gene classes were for fca ranging from 0 177 0 027 args genome in hospital wastes hp a and hp b to 0 009 0 008 args genome in the wwtp effluent finally vancomycin resistance genes were 0 037 0 006 args genome in hospital wastes hp a and hp b but were less than 0 001 args genome in wwtp influent although the wwtp itself significantly reduces the concentrations of most arg groups between influent and effluent tables s 7 actual arg richness and the number of resistance genes per genome did not change significantly between the wwtp influent and effluent relative to river sediment resistomes a significant increase in arg concentrations were seen in all groups upstream and downstream of the wwtp except for fca and vancomycin the richness of args conferring resistance to aminoglycosides β lactams mlsb and tetracycline all increased significantly p 0 01 tables s 8 further the average number of args per genome in downstream sediments also increased significantly for aminoglycosides β lactams mlsb multidrug efflux systems tetracyclines and also the number of transposase and integrase genes per genome overall args transposase and integrase genes per genome tables s 9 were highest in the hospital wastewaters for example 13 9 args per genome were detected in hospital wastewaters which is much higher than community wastewater 1 6 args genome ras 1 0 args genome wwtp liquid effluent 0 8 args genome upstream river sediments 0 1 args genome downstream river sediments 1 4 args genome and the downstream water column 0 6 args genome in this network hospital wastewater was only 1 65 1 84 of the total flow volume to the wwtp however based on mass balances assuming 9 39 log of genomes per ml in hospital wastes and 9 28 log of genomes per ml in community wastes hospital wastes contribute from 15 8 to 17 3 of args to the wwtp finally a venn diagram overlaying args present in hospital versus community sources and the receiving waters show 15 unique args are attributable to hospitals whereas only six args are attributable to community wastes figure s 11 using two dimensional hierarchical clustering in conjunction with an arg heatmap of relative abundances figure s 12 arg co occurrence patterns were delineated across network compartments sample types split into general clusters with hospital wastewater samples clustering together in terms of args whereas community wastewater more clusters with wwtp influent and effluent and the downstream water column in contrast args in upstream river sediments and the ras cluster very different from all other samples clustering suggests args found in the ras minimally relate to wwtp influents and downstream water column samples 3 5 relationships between bacterial communities and args the mantel test showed that bacterial community compositions were significantly correlated with args compositions according to the bray curtis dissimilarity index r 0 338 p 0 003 procrustes analysis further supports significant correlations between prevalent args and bacterial composition 16s rrna gene otus data bray curtis dissimilarity index sum of squares m12 0 344 r 0 810 p 0 001 999 permutations figure s 13 these results confirm resistomes generally link with microbial communities here the wwtp influent liquid effluent and downstream water column resistomes were similar whereas ras was very different 3 6 co occurrence patterns among args subtypes co correlation networks are well suited to detecting general patterns in highly populated taxonomic groups co occurrence patterns between args and microbial taxa order level were investigated using a network analysis approach figure s 14 we hypothesized that non random co occurrence patterns between args and microbial taxa would suggest possible host information of args if the args and co existing microbial taxa display strong and significantly positive correlations spearman s r2 0 8 p 0 01 in data here the co correlation network consisted of 203 nodes arg subtypes and 1593 edges with an average degree or node connectivity of 15 695 the average network distance between all pairs of nodes average path length was 2 771 edges with a network diameter of 8 edges as shown in figure s 14 network analysis produces two independent groups the first group figure s 14a includes all args transposase genes and integrase genes and associates with only 13 taxa in contrast the second group contains taxa only and no amr related elements figure s 14b both groups can be visualized as independent networks see fig 6 with the first group as probable arg hosts with characteristic bacteria from wastewater sources community hospital and wwtp influent including enterobacteriales pseudomonadales and clostridiales figure s 6a the second group which does not correlate with args transposase genes or integrase genes figure s 15 is primarily composed of ras enriched taxa figure s 6a such as actinomycetales and spingomonadales this is further corroboration that the ras microbial community does not strongly associate with args in wwtp effluents 4 discussion this study elucidated the spatial ecology of args within a southern european wastewater network that includes both hospital and community wastewater sources the wastewater network was in spain sampled during worst case scenario conditions when wwtp effluent dilution rates in the river were very low a common scenario in drier climates data show this wastewater network can be divided into three microbial source communities raw wastewater ras and the river upstream which differentially explain where how and why args spread across the larger network baquero et al 2008 these communities relate to three evolutionary ecosystems with different habitat and selection factors the first ecosystem and its microbial community are the raw wastewater sources hospital community and wwtp influent hospital and community wastewaters are microbiologically closer to raw waste sources faecal matter whereas microbial communities change as the wastewater flows down the sewer line this change is characterised by a shift from obligate anaerobes presumably from source faeces to facultative anaerobes shanks et al 2013 bengtsson palme et al 2015 the second ecosystem is the core wwtp biological treatment community i e ras which despite continuous inputs of wastewater has its own unique microbial composition that significantly differs from the wastewater sources and the liquid phase wwtp effluent the ras community has high arg abundances but very low arg richness and does not resemble wastewater sources in terms of args or bacterial composition based on this and other data we suspect args found in ras are largely coincidental because the ras community is primarily being selected by wwtp operating conditions such as biosolids settling within the secondary clarifier this conclusion is consistent with cai et al 2014 and huang et al 2018 who showed microbial communities in activated sludge were less affected by the wwtp influent bacteria suggesting large fractions of wwtp influent bacteria disappear or decrease significantly in the ras compared with the influent tang et al 2016 in total these data suggest that free living microorganisms which do not aggregate in flocs or do not readily settle in the clarifier appear to pass through the wwtp it further suggests ras and the liquid phase and their microorganisms may represent two ecosystems which is key to explaining arg fate within and beyond the biotreatment compartment most studies on ar studies presume wwtps especially ras are a place of active arg exchange e g ma et al 2011 burch et al 2013 which data here suggest may not be the case the third ecosystem and its microbial community associated with the upstream river water column and sediment which clusters away from the other groups this community clearly changes upon reception of the wwtp effluents becoming a combination of microorganisms from the raw wastewater ras and upstream community in the downstream water column and sediments although wastewater treatment reduces the bacterial load by several orders of magnitude large volumes of treated wastewater inputs increase the abundance and richness of args in the river sediment downstream compared to upstream of wwtp discharges these results are consistent with those of other studies pruden et al 2012 marti et al 2013 karkman et al 2016 brown et al 2019 overall findings here are consistent with munck et al 2015 who showed the core resistome of biological wastewater treatment units is different from other parts of urban water ecosystems and not necessarily a hot spot for gene transfer specifically we show human waste associated args often pass directly through wwtps without inclusion into the ras therefore although biological treatment units and ras are important to carbon and nitrogen removal other factors are more important to the fate of args within the same wwtps data suggest the type and performance of biosolids separation units may be key to downstream resistomes the non floc phase has greater arg richness and bacteria with more args genome suggesting that removing unsettlable biosolids may be more critical for reducing arg releases to the environment if this is true greater emphasis is needed in understanding and improving biosolids separation in wwtps implicitly membrane bioreactors may be better from removing args which reports have suggested lea et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 5 conclusions this study shows that understanding the spatial ecology of a wastewater network is critical to explaining what impacts args released from wwtps specifically ras and the associated liquid phase in biotreatment compartments appear to be two parallel ecosystems as such arg fate and releases from a wwtp may be more associated with bacterial biophysical traits such as tendencies towards flocculation and settling it also shows that source wastewater args may be more important to wwtp effluents than believed albeit in subtle ways as an example greater arg richness and higher levels of args genome prevail in hospital sources might disproportionately influence args entering the wwtp and in turn organisms passing through the wwtp in liquid effluents to the receiving water this problem may be particularly acute in southern europe in the summer or anywhere else where receiving water dilution levels are low taken together this work shows less studied factors such as the spatial ecology of whole networks and the local ecology of unit operations may be critical to improving arg mitigation by wwtps based the network studied future focus should be on ar source reduction improving biosolids separation and possibly disinfection to reduce arg releases in

18656,practical application of metallurgical microbial electrolysis cells mecs requires efficient removal of metals and organics in larger reactors a 40 l cylindrical single chamber mec fed acetate was used to achieve high removals of w vi and mo vi in the presence of both metals there were nearly complete removals of w 97 98 mo 98 99 and acetate 95 96 along with a low level of hydrogen production 0 0037 0 0039 l l d at a hydraulic residence time hrt of 2 d influent ratios of w mo acetate of 0 5 1 0 24 mm the final concentrations of these conditions were sufficient to meet national wastewater discharge standards in the controls with individual metals or acetate lower contaminant removals were obtained w 2 4 mo 3 5 acetate 36 39 metals removal in all cases was primarily due to the biocathodes rather than the bioanodes the presence of metals decreased microbial diversity on the anodes and increased diversity on the cathodes based on analysis at the phylum class and genus levels as a function of hrt and influent concentration this study demonstrated the feasibility of larger scale single chamber mecs for efficient treatment of w and mo moving metallurgical mecs closer to commercialization for wastewater treatment of these two metals graphical abstract image 1 keywords scaled microbial electrolysis cell simultaneous removal of acetate w vi and mo vi bacterial community bioanode and biocathode 1 introduction microbial electrolysis cells mecs have been intensively studied for achieving energy neutral organic wastewater treatment and accomplishing hydrogen production using a small applied voltage relative to that needed for splitting water logan et al 2015 jain and he 2018 while scaled mecs for synthetic or practical urban wastewater treatment are still on going luo et al 2017 rossi et al 2019 the concept of microbial electro metallurgy or metals removals working under the overall principles of mecs or microbial fuel cells has recently attracted a great deal of attention due to its multiple merits of recovery of metals wastewater treatment of organic matter and small energy consumption or net energy production abourached et al 2014 wang and ren 2014 nancharaiah et al 2016 dominguez benetton et al 2018 the most common configuration for metal removal mecs consists of two chambers and a separator where organics are oxidized by microbial anodes and metal ions are reduced to solid metals on abiotic cathodes many tests have been conducted using only one metal huang et al 2013a jiang et al 2014 dominguez benetton et al 2018 but many wastewaters often contain two or more metals thus there have been other two chamber mec studies examining removals of two metals for example v v and cr vi cu ii and cd ii cu ii and co ii w vi and mo vi three metals such as cr vi cd ii and cu ii cu ii ni ii and fe ii and sn ii cu ii and fe ii and four metals cu pb cd and zn but all tests used small reactors 14 250 ml modin et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 2015 luo et al 2014 wu et al 2016 song et al 2019 the use of two chambers and an ion exchange membrane increases capital costs and limits practical applications for scale up and commercialization abourached et al 2014 kadier et al 2016 rossi et al 2019 enzmann et al 2019 single chamber configurations are therefore more attractive due to typically lower internal resistances simpler architectures and therefore more cost effective operation for simultaneous treatment of organics and metals abourached et al 2014 wu et al 2018 however single chamber reactors have only been examined for metals removal that have small liquid volumes 12 28 ml in tests using acetate and a single metal in solution zn cd or cu it has been suggested that practical applications of mecs for metals removals will require demonstrations in reactors of 10 l or more enzmann et al 2019 the two transition metals tungsten w and molybdenum mo are often concomitantly present in the leaching liquor of many spent industrial products and ore dressing wastewaters along with volatile fatty acids lasheen et al 2015 chemical electrochemical or biological processes conventionally used for treating this wastewater involve the use of reducing agents high energy consumption or generation of large volumes of chemical sludge although abiotic removal of w and mo has been demonstrated in smaller two chamber mecs huang et al 2017 2018a wang et al 2017 2018 2019a 2019b simultaneous organics treatment has not previously been examined in single chamber systems or at larger scales compact reactors are also needed for efficient treatment using mecs to minimize the potential for clogging rossi et al 2019 packing a high amount of electrode area per volume can be accomplished by using thin electrodes such as graphite felt and providing conductivity for larger electrodes using stainless steel mesh current collectors huang et al 2010 guo et al 2017 tubular or cylindrical mecs have been explored for hydrogen production in mecs at larger working volumes of 0 5 4 l gil carrera et al 2013 guo et al 2017 feng et al 2018 but not for metals removals at these larger scales larger scale cylindrical shaped single chamber mecs 40 l were investigated for treatment of mixed organic w vi and mo vi under different hydraulic residence times hrts and influent strengths mutual benefits of acetate and mixed w vi and mo vi for their efficient removals were for the first time observed with the effluent accomplishing the national wastewater discharge standard addressing the feasibility of the scaled single chamber mecs for treatment of mixed acetate w vi and mo vi the roles of the bioanodes and the biocathodes in w vi and mo vi reduction were clarified based on the observation by a scanning electron microscope sem equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds the precipitant analysis by x ray photo electron spectroscopy xps and the clarification of compositions of bacterial communities developed on the anodes and the cathodes under different hrts and influent strengths 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction the cylindrical single chamber reactors 34 cm inner diameter 45 cm high were made of polyvinyl chloride pvc and constructed with concentric electrodes fig 1 graphite felt 1 cm thick sanye beijing china was used for both electrodes with the inner cathode 18 cm in diameter and 40 cm high and the outer anode 22 cm in diameter and 40 cm high producing a working liquid volume of 38 l with no separator between the electrodes the specific surface areas were 18 m2 m3 for the anode and 22 m2 m3 for the cathode based on the area specific calculation based on the cylindrical geometry as 2r 1 where r is the electrode radius logan et al 2015 stainless steel mesh type 304 ss mcmaster carr oh used as both the current collector and to support the felt electrodes was extended outside the chambers for connecting the electrodes to a power source leici shanghai china rossi et al 2019 song et al 2019 grooves were made on the bottom of the reactors to hold the edges of the stainless steel mesh producing a distance of 1 0 cm between the edges of the electrodes before installation the felt was pretreated as previously described huang et al 2010 2013b reference electrodes ag agcl electrode 195 mv versus standard hydrogen electrode she were inserted around the top section of the reactor and close to either the anode or the cathode to obtain cathode and anode potentials individually with all potentials reported here versus she a small resistor of 10 ω was installed in the circuit to measure current based on the voltage drop across the resistor using an automatic data acquisition system piso 813 hongge co taiwan the reactors were airtight and were equipped with sampling ports reactors were wrapped with aluminum foil to exclude light to avoid the growth of algae the reactors were initially operated at fed batch mode at room temperature 22 3 c after which the reactors was shifted to continuous flow operation 2 2 inoculation and operation the mecs were inoculated with 500 ml of suspended bacteria from a 250 ml cylindrical single chamber mec at a food to microorganisms ratio of 0 87 0 13 g cod g ss d and an equivalent volume of a nutrient solution containing trace elements huang et al 2010 the reactors were then acclimated in fed batch operation to a synthetic wastewater composed of w vi 0 5 mm mo vi 1 0 mm and acetate 24 mm with a cod of 1 5 g l the acclimation of the reactors was considered complete after two additional fed batch cycles based on reproducible electrode potentials over the cycle 3 4 days for continuous flow tests different concentrations of w vi mo vi and acetate were used at ratios mm mm of 0 5 1 0 24 0 5 1 0 12 0 3 0 6 12 0 2 0 4 12 or 0 1 0 2 12 in a medium with additional trace elements huang et al 2010 concentrations in actual wastewaters can vary of large ranges of 0 05 10 mm for total metals and 5 8 30 mm for total volatile organics lasheen et al 2015 the influent ph was set to 3 0 and the solution conductivity to 3 0 ms cm which are typical for acidic wastewaters containing organics w vi and mo vi lasheen et al 2015 huang et al 2018a all reagents used were of analytical grade and the solutions were prepared in distilled water after continuous sparging with ultra pure nitrogen gas the solutions were pumped bt100 2j lange china into the mecs under closed circuit conditions ccc at flow rates to produce hrts of 12 h 52 8 ml min 24 h 26 4 ml min or 48 h 13 2 ml min three controls were operated operation of the reactors under open circuit conditions occs to examine metals and acetate removal in the absence of current using only acetate or only metals to examine removals of these components along and a smaller cylindrical single chamber mecs 250 ml with 44 cm2 anode and 19 cm2 cathode with specific surface areas of 57 m2 m3 for the anode and 133 m2 m3 for the cathode at a ratio of w mo acetate of 0 5 1 0 24 mm and an hrt of 2 d to study the impact of reactor size on performance 2 3 measurements and analyses the influent and effluent concentrations of w vi and mo vi were determined as described previously wang et al 2017 acetate was measured based on soluble chemical oxygen demands cods calibrated with acetate using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1100 removals were based on dividing the measured removals by the influent concentrations hydrogen produced in the headspaces of the mecs was collected using a gas collecting bag and periodically analyzed using a gas chromatograph gc7900 tianmei shanghai hydrogen production l l d was calculated on total hydrogen recovered normalized to the reactor working volume and operational time d an external voltage of 0 5 v was used during the entire operation period all electrode potentials were collected using a data acquisition piso 813 hongge co taiwan the influent and effluent phs were measured using a ph probe and meter phs 3c leici shanghai the influent and effluent solution conductivities were determined with a conductivity probe and meter dds 307 leici shanghai electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was conducted using a potentiostat vsp biologic as previously described zhang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 and modified in si after a 30 d continuous operation the anodes and the cathodes were sampled in the middle of the electrodes biofilm morphology and precipitates on the cathodes and the anodes were examined using a sem nova nanosem450 fei company usa equipped with an eds x max 20 mm2 50 mm2 oxford instruments uk prior to observation the electrodes were collected and treated as previously described huang et al 2012 the valences of products on the cathodes and the anodes were confirmed using xps kratos axis ultra dld 2 4 bacterial community analysis samples were collected from the anodes and the cathodes of the mecs at the end of experiments following different set conditions of hrts or influent concentrations five pieces of graphite felt 1 1 1 cm3 were removed from multiple locations in the middle of the electrodes and mixed together for analysis samples were then treated and analyzed as described in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hrt efficient removal of w vi 97 98 mo vi 98 99 and acetate 95 96 fig 2 a and b with simultaneous hydrogen production rate 0 0037 0 0039 l l d fig 2b were achieved using an hrt of 2 d and influent concentrations of w mo acetate of 0 5 1 0 24 mm these removals were much higher than those in the controls with circuit current in the presence of metals and absence of acetate w 2 4 mo 3 5 fig 2a and in the absence of metals with only acetate cod removal of 36 39 along with slightly lower hydrogen production rates 0 0030 0 0031 l l d fig 2b there were increases in ph and conductivity consistent with circuit current and acetate consumption with the largest changes in ph and solution conductivities occurring in the presence of acetate and both metals fig 2c in all cases there was relatively higher circuit currents and lower cathode potentials in the presence of acetate and both metals fig 2d these results demonstrate the mutual benefits of having acetate and both w and mo metals present for their removal in an mec the percentage of cod removal has been reported to be unaffected by the cod strength using domestic wastewaters that do not contain high concentrations of metals he et al 2016 the key reason for a change in cod removal in the experiments here is therefore the presence of multiple electron acceptors eg w vi and mo vi which as reviewed by he et al 2015 can largely contribute to system performance collectively these results demonstrate the close correlation between the acetate and the metals as well as the more feasibility of the scaled mecs for treating mixed acetate w vi and mo vi rather than the standalone acetate or the metals the final effluent concentrations w 2 3 mg l mo 1 2 mg l cod 45 53 mg l were below national wastewater discharge limits for china gb18918 2002 and gb21 1627 2008 implying that treatment using this mec would produce effluents suitable to discharge into the environment the specific metabolism of the microorganisms towards the removal of w vi mo vi and acetate from solution with simultaneous hydrogen production in the scaled mecs was further evidenced by the absence of any by products in the headspace absence of methane and in the effluent absence of any other organics and negligible biomass the extent and rates of removals of metals and cod in the 40 l mec fig 2 was very similar to that in the smaller 250 ml reactor at an hrt of 2 d fig s1 demonstrating that using a larger mec did not impact metals and acetate removals hydrogen production rates 0 0079 0 0082 l l d in the small reactors however were about 2 times as large as that in the 40 l mec likely reflecting increased recoveries of hydrogen in the smaller reactors consistent with other mec reports showing reduced hydrogen gas recoveries with larger reactor sizes kadier et al 2016 logan et al 2015 a lower hydrogen production in the 40 l mec thus shows the compromise of the enlarged volume of reactor a shorter hrt of 1 d fig 3 rather than 2 d fig 2 reduced metals and acetate removals w 88 1 mo 94 1 cod 73 1 fig 3a and b but slightly increased hydrogen production rates 0 0046 0 0001 l l d fig 3b this greater hydrogen rate may be related to the higher current density 0 61 0 00 a m3 fig 3d since circuit current has been shown to be positively correlated with hydrogen production and negatively correlated with hrt in mecs lu and ren 2016 kadier et al 2016 the general trends in effluent ph conductivity and electrode potentials fig 3c and d were similar to those observed with the 2 d hrt fig 2 less metals removal consumed less protons for oxometallate precipitates resulting in lower effluent phs and higher effluent conductivities fig 3c than those at 2 d fig 2c 3 2 combined effect of influent strength and hrt lower in the acetate concentration to 12 mm versus 24 mm with the same hrt 1 d and metal concentrations w mo 0 5 1 0 resulted in less metal removals and hydrogen production figs s2a and b but favored cod removal fig s2b fig 3 consistent with the effluent ph and conductivity fig s2c and circuit current fig s2d in parallel a shorter hrt 0 5 d at a same strength influent w mo acetate 0 5 1 0 12 mm decreased metal and cod removal and favored for hydrogen production fig s2 these results illustrated the combined importance of organic strength and hrt for system performance using a lower concentration of metals w 0 1 0 3 mm mo 0 2 0 6 mm at a 1 d hrt with the lower concentration of acetate 12 mm produced higher metal removals fig s3a however the lowest influent metals w 0 1 mm mo 0 2 mm resulted in the lowest cod removal and hydrogen production fig s3b consistent with the effluent phs and solution conductivities fig s3c as well as the circuit currents fig s3d collectively these results illustrate the importance of appropriate ratios of metals and acetate in the influent for efficient system performance 3 3 continuous operation over 30 days at an hrt of 2 d operation of the 40 l mec at a 2 d hrt showed that removal of metals w 94 96 mo 95 99 and cod 95 96 circuit current and electrode potential were stable over 30 days of operation figs s4a and c the lower effluent conductivity was due to the change in effluent ph fig s4b eis spectra were fitted to equivalent circuits fig s5 to identify the changes in the components of the internal resistances for the electrodes at the start of the tests and after 30 days fig 4 and table s1 there was only a small change in the ohmic resistances of the cathodes 23 ω 28 ω and anodes 24 ω 36 ω consistent with relatively small changes in solution conductivities however the charge transfer resistance nearly doubled for both electrodes cathode from 56 ω to 105 ω anode from 77 ω to 142 ω suggesting a decay in electrode performance over time these changes in resistance did not appear to impact overall reactor performance over the 30 d period there were slight changes in the diffusion resistance that did not show any consistent change for both electrodes cathode from 83 ω to 73 ω anode from 52 ω to 66 ω these results imply that changes in the electrochemical resistances did not substantially impact overall performance but these changes do not readily reflect changes that could also be occurring in the microbial communities 3 4 morphological observation of electrodes and analysis of metal precipitates cathodes and anodes were examined using sem at the end of the continuous 30 day operation both the cathodes fig 5 a and the anodes fig 5c were populated with bacteria and with noticeable precipitates on these bacterial surfaces relatively thick biofilms that developed on the anodes fig 5c were in contrast to the sparsely populated biofilms covering the cathodes fig 5a the sparser biofilms on the cathodes could have been caused by disruption and dislodging biofilm due to the evolution of hydrogen gas from the electrodes however sparsely populated biofilms have frequently been observed on cathodes with other terminal electron acceptors such as nitrate oxygen or chlorophenols acceptors even in the absence of hydrogen evolution huang et al 2012 2013b logan et al 2019 xie et al 2011 analysis of the biofilm precipitates indicated reduction of w vi and mo vi on bacterial cells on the anode although to a lesser extent than that observed on the cathodes the greater reduction of w vi and mo vi on the cathodes was ascribed to the cathodic reductive environment in agreement with the extensive literature on reduction of many other heavy metals on the cathodes of bioelectrochemical systems nancharaiah et al 2016 dominguez benetton et al 2018 the observed reduction of w vi and mo vi on the anodes is similarly supported by previous studies showing both anodic cr vi reduction by ochrobactrum sp yc211 in dual chamber microbial fuel cells chen et al 2016 and the anodic fe iii reduction by predominant sphaerochaeta thermosinus arcobacter and hydrogenophage in the anodic bacterial communities of single chamber microbial fuel cells liu et al 2018 facultative anaerobic shewanella sp well known for their electrochemical activities in bioelectrochemical systems logan et al 2019 have also been shown to use selenite as the sole electron acceptor for respiration under anaerobic conditions lee et al 2007 similar to cr vi reduction by many bacterial strains bachate et al 2013 banerjee et al 2019 thacker and madamwar 2005 soluble and membrane associated enzymes on the cellular surfaces of these bacteria have been proven to mediate the reduction of these metals thacker and madamwar 2005 barrera diaza et al 2012 considering the fact of many bacteria such as raoultella ornithinolytica mo1 raoultella planticola mo1 pseudomonas sp dry2 enterobacter sp dr y13 or acinetobacter calcoaceticus are capable of reducing mo vi shukor et al 2009 2010a 2010b saeed et al 2019 and sulfitobacter dubius na4 as v 4 and sb5 for w vi reduction coimbra et al 2017 the occurrence of w vi and mo vi reduction on the bioanodes of the single chamber mecs was not surprising using eds to examine the composition of the precipitates stronger w and mo signals were detected on the biocathodes fig 5b than on the bioanodes fig 5d with the amounts of w and mo on the biocathodes 4 8 w and 4 2 mo times of those on the bioanodes table s2 this again implies that most metals were reduced on the cathodes biofilms formed can help to facilitate hydrogen production from the cathodes in mecs rozendal et al 2008 geelhoed and stams 2011 in the presence of electron acceptors of w vi and mo vi in the electrolyte here some of the in situ generated hydrogen on the biocathodes could be used for the reduction of w vi and mo vi wang et al 2017 2018 2019a 2019b similar to other electron acceptors including nitrate other metals and carbon dioxide hou et al 2018 kadier et al 2016 nancharaiah et al 2016 xie et al 2011 this reduction would explain the greater amounts of reduced precipitants on the biocathodes fig 6 a and c than observed on the bioanodes fig 6b and d xps analysis of the cathodes indicated the presence of both w v and w vi fig 6a compared to only w vi on the anodes fig 6b this suggests that there was primarily w vi adsorption and precipitation on the anodes while there was reduction of w on the cathode in parallel more mo vi mo v and mo iv were simultaneously observed on the cathodes fig 6c than on the anodes fig 6d demonstrating greater mo vi reduction on the cathodes these higher xps signals of reduced metals on the cathodes fig 6a and c than on the anodes fig 6b and d were consistent with the eds results showing greater metal concentrations on the electrodes fig 5b and d table s2 the occurrence of some mo vi reduction on the anodes implies mo vi might compete with the anodes to accept electrons directly from the exoelectrogens similar to many bacteria known to be capable of direct mo vi reduction shukor et al 2009 2010a 2010b lim et al 2012 othman et al 2013 and mixed culture for cd ii or zn ii removal in single chamber microbial fuel cells abourached et al 2014 in the case of biocathodes electron transfer from electrotrophs to metal ions is not well established nancharaiah et al 2016 very recently rowe et al 2018 demonstrated that shewanella oneidensis mr 1 on a cathode acquired energy for oxygen reduction this respiratory process has important implications for understanding the biocathodes for w vi and mo vi reduction in the present system and the cellular conversion of the cathodic electrons to the electrotrophs despite that direct proofs for such mechanism is still needed 3 5 changes in bacterial communities from 10 generated libraries a total of 469 826 high quality 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained with an average length of 440 nucleotides table s3 these sequences were assigned into 4400 otus with a distance limit of 0 03 though the rarefaction curves did not exhibit a plateau fig s6 the good s coverage estimators indicate that the sizes of libraries were sufficient to cover the bacterial communities table s3 compared to the controls in the absence of metals the presence of w vi and mo vi consistently decreased the diversity of the microbial communities on the anodes and increased the diversity on the cathodes as shown in the shannon indices from 3 18 to 1 23 anode and 1 03 to 2 63 cathode fig s7 and table s3 considering the more critical role of the cathode than the anode in system performance he et al 2015 this increased diversity on the biocathodes may have substantially contributed to the enhanced system performance for metals removals figs 2 and 3 however the decreased diversity of the biofilms on the anodes cannot exclude their potential critical roles in system performance since the bacterial ability to conduct current may not be the only or main reason for the predominance of high electrochemically active bacteria logan et al 2019 this result was very similar to the responses of the microbial communities on the anodes and the cathodes of single chamber microbial fuel cells to fe iii where the externally added fe iii shaped community structures of the electrode biofilms resulting in the decreased anode and the increased cathode diversities of the microbial communities compared to the controls in the absence of fe iii liu et al 2018 analysis of the bacterial communities based on a weighted fast unifrac principle coordinates analysis indicated some general similarity in the communities acclimated to the different hrts and concentrations of chemicals fig 7 a the bioanodes and the biocathodes in the absence of metals grouped in different quadrants the presence of metals however led to the more random dispersal of the anode than the cathode bacterial communities particularly at shorter hrts of 0 5 d or 1 d and regardless of the influent strength a long hrt 2 d and a high strength influent w mo acetate 0 5 1 0 24 mm led to a clustering of the different genus on both the anodes and the cathodes a dendrogram constructed on the basis of community phylogenetic lineages further supported differences in these bacterial communities based on an absence of any close alignments of the communities at different hrts and various strength influents fig 7b these findings illustrate that the compositions of the bacterial communities on the anodes and the cathodes were different from each other and that a longer hrt 2 d with a higher strength influent w mo acetate 0 5 1 0 24 decreased the differences of the communities as they showed less dispersal the bacterial communities consisted of 5 phyla with the majority of sequences 34 2 97 1 belonging to proteobacteria fig 8 a which are frequently observed in bioelectrochemical systems lesnik and liu 2014 logan et al 2019 the presence of metals stimulated the relative abundance of proteobacteria on the anodes 63 5 91 8 and decreased them on the cathodes 78 6 88 3 compared to those communities observed in the absence of metals anode 34 2 cathode 92 7 similarly a low strength influent favored the abundance of proteobacteria anode 91 8 cathode 88 3 compared to those at a high strength influent anode 63 5 cathode 84 6 a longer hrt of 2 d might have compensated for the higher strength influent resulting in predominance of proteobacteria 97 1 on the cathodes and proteobacteria 82 7 and firmicutes 12 6 on the anodes the other actinobacteria and bacteroidetes apparently decreased in the presence of metals and slightly changed with hrt and influent strength two classes gamma and alpha within proteobacteria were predominantly observed from all communities in addition to the minor betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria fig 8b genus level analysis demonstrates a long hrt benefited an increased abundance of pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas and diminished enterobacter and desulfovibrio on both electrodes fig 8c similarly a high strength influent shifted the genera to bacillus 4 3 and rhodococcus 0 8 on the cathodes and paenibacillus 4 1 brevundimonas 3 5 staphylococcis 2 5 and rhodococcus 1 8 on the anodes in addition enterobacter sp stenotrophomonas brevundimonas and unclassfied on the cathodes and enterobacter sp and shewanella on the anodes largely increased in response to the high strength influent in the controls the absence of metals led to the predominant pseudomonas 83 7 on the cathodes and the prevalent stenotrophomonas 13 0 paenibacillus 25 0 clostridium sensu stricto 12 and rhodococcus 16 9 on the anodes collectively these results demonstrated the influence of hrt and influent strength on the anodic and cathodic genera which changed along with the system performance figs 2 and 3 fig s2 4 many bacteria including raoultella ornithinolytica raoultella planticola saeed et al 2019 bacillus amyloliquefaciens maarof et al 2018 pseudomonas shukor et al 2010a enterobacter shukor et al 2009 klebsiella lim et al 2012 acinetobacter shukor et al 2010b bacillus sp othman et al 2013 and desulfovibrio desulfuricans tucker et al 1997 reportedly reduce mo vi to mo blue in conventional biological processes the observation of many of these genera in the 40 l mecs thus implies their potential contribution to mo vi reduction in these reactors for tungsten several w vi tolerant strains including sulfitobacter dubius na4 as v 4 and sb5 reportedly grow and accumulate tungsten in the presence of a high w vi 1 0 mm coimbra et al 2017 isolates with w vi and mo vi tolerant and electrochemically active characteristics from this system might enable to directly associate changes in biochemical metabolism and gene expression with the w vi and mo vi reduction in the future investigation at this time however it is only possible to infer the activities based on rdna identification cytochrome profiling of pure cultures is helpful to examine whether differential expression of redox enzymes at the feeding of different influent strengths and various hrts is a contributing factor to affect system performances studies on these genera rather than studies confined to the model strains of geobacter and shewanella and some other isolates from single metal removed bioelectrochemical systems huang et al 2018a 2018b 2018c tao et al 2017 shen et al 2017 hou et al 2018 will help us understand the roles of these genera in the bacterial community for complete and simultaneous removals of acetate w vi and mo vi in this system the different diversities of the microbial communities on the anodes and the cathodes in response to w vi and mo vi might be related with the different behaviors of w vi and mo vi on the anodes and the cathodes direct reduction of w vi and mo vi competed with electron transfer to the anodes and thus internally consumed electrons from exoelectrogens and negatively affected system performance in terms of circuit current conversely w vi and mo vi at the biocathodes could be used as terminal electron acceptors and thus may have benefited more diversified bacterial communities he et al 2015 although tungstate or molybdate are key elements of coenzymes and play key roles as enzyme activators in many bacteria hartmann et al 2015 saeed et al 2019 the roles of w vi and mo vi in the activities of bioanodes and the biocathodes in single chamber mecs particularly at the molecular level are largely unclear a better understanding of the chemistry and biological transport in these systems will require the use of pure cultures to study gene expression the present study has illustrated the mutual benefits of acetate and mixed tungsten and molybdenum for their efficient removal in 40 l mecs achieving nearly complete removals of w 97 98 mo 98 99 and acetate 95 96 compared to lower contaminant removals w 2 4 mo 3 5 acetate 36 39 in the controls with individual metals or acetate an electron balance based on the working volume of 38 l showed that the total electrons required for reduction of w vi and mo vi 0 11 mol and hydrogen evolution 0 03 mol and those from the oxidation of acetate 6 93 7 00 mol were appreciably higher than the controls with individual metals 0 003 0 005 mol hydrogen 0 02 mol or acetate 2 63 2 85 mol the ratio of electrons extracted from acetate and used for both w and mo reduction and hydrogen evolution was thus around 50 apparently lower than 114 in the controls with individual acetate or metals this implies a better balance between acetate oxidation and mixed w and mo reduction and the more favorable result overall with using metals as more of the acetate was used when both metals were present compared to individual metals or only electrons used for hydrogen production this highlights the critical advantages of the mixed w mo and acetate over the individual components for efficient removal of these species in mecs changing the general recognition on more efficient biological treatment efficiency for single rather than multiple contaminants in wastewaters lim et al 2012 lasheen et al 2015 overall the presence of acetate improved w and mo removal by 25 49 times and the presence of w and mo together enhanced acetate removal by 2 5 2 7 times based on these encouraging results this suggests that mecs could be superior to conventional biological processes for w and mo removal from wastewater compared to previous studies using small liquid volumes 12 28 ml in single chamber mecs for the removal of a single metals zn cd or cu abourached et al 2014 wu et al 2018 the present study suggests the feasibility of larger scale single chamber mecs for efficient treatment of w and mo moving metallurgical mecs closer to commercialization for wastewater treatment of these two concomitant metals practical implementation will depend on the long term operation of these reactors and other characteristics of the wastewaters as well as the cost of the system relative to conventional treatment processes at this point in time it is likely that this technology is not yet ready for commercial applications as even larger scale studies would be required for evaluating the process prior to commercial and full scale applications 4 conclusions simultaneous removal of acetate and w and mo was achieved in a 40 l cylindrical single chamber mec with the effluent levels meeting national wastewater discharge standards for both metals and organics the combination of acetate and the metals of w vi and mo vi together had improved removals compared to acetate or metals alone hrt and influent strength influenced the compositions of bacterial communities on the anodes and the cathodes and may have contributed to system performance under different conditions conflicts of interest there are no conflicts to declare acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge financial

18656,practical application of metallurgical microbial electrolysis cells mecs requires efficient removal of metals and organics in larger reactors a 40 l cylindrical single chamber mec fed acetate was used to achieve high removals of w vi and mo vi in the presence of both metals there were nearly complete removals of w 97 98 mo 98 99 and acetate 95 96 along with a low level of hydrogen production 0 0037 0 0039 l l d at a hydraulic residence time hrt of 2 d influent ratios of w mo acetate of 0 5 1 0 24 mm the final concentrations of these conditions were sufficient to meet national wastewater discharge standards in the controls with individual metals or acetate lower contaminant removals were obtained w 2 4 mo 3 5 acetate 36 39 metals removal in all cases was primarily due to the biocathodes rather than the bioanodes the presence of metals decreased microbial diversity on the anodes and increased diversity on the cathodes based on analysis at the phylum class and genus levels as a function of hrt and influent concentration this study demonstrated the feasibility of larger scale single chamber mecs for efficient treatment of w and mo moving metallurgical mecs closer to commercialization for wastewater treatment of these two metals graphical abstract image 1 keywords scaled microbial electrolysis cell simultaneous removal of acetate w vi and mo vi bacterial community bioanode and biocathode 1 introduction microbial electrolysis cells mecs have been intensively studied for achieving energy neutral organic wastewater treatment and accomplishing hydrogen production using a small applied voltage relative to that needed for splitting water logan et al 2015 jain and he 2018 while scaled mecs for synthetic or practical urban wastewater treatment are still on going luo et al 2017 rossi et al 2019 the concept of microbial electro metallurgy or metals removals working under the overall principles of mecs or microbial fuel cells has recently attracted a great deal of attention due to its multiple merits of recovery of metals wastewater treatment of organic matter and small energy consumption or net energy production abourached et al 2014 wang and ren 2014 nancharaiah et al 2016 dominguez benetton et al 2018 the most common configuration for metal removal mecs consists of two chambers and a separator where organics are oxidized by microbial anodes and metal ions are reduced to solid metals on abiotic cathodes many tests have been conducted using only one metal huang et al 2013a jiang et al 2014 dominguez benetton et al 2018 but many wastewaters often contain two or more metals thus there have been other two chamber mec studies examining removals of two metals for example v v and cr vi cu ii and cd ii cu ii and co ii w vi and mo vi three metals such as cr vi cd ii and cu ii cu ii ni ii and fe ii and sn ii cu ii and fe ii and four metals cu pb cd and zn but all tests used small reactors 14 250 ml modin et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 2015 luo et al 2014 wu et al 2016 song et al 2019 the use of two chambers and an ion exchange membrane increases capital costs and limits practical applications for scale up and commercialization abourached et al 2014 kadier et al 2016 rossi et al 2019 enzmann et al 2019 single chamber configurations are therefore more attractive due to typically lower internal resistances simpler architectures and therefore more cost effective operation for simultaneous treatment of organics and metals abourached et al 2014 wu et al 2018 however single chamber reactors have only been examined for metals removal that have small liquid volumes 12 28 ml in tests using acetate and a single metal in solution zn cd or cu it has been suggested that practical applications of mecs for metals removals will require demonstrations in reactors of 10 l or more enzmann et al 2019 the two transition metals tungsten w and molybdenum mo are often concomitantly present in the leaching liquor of many spent industrial products and ore dressing wastewaters along with volatile fatty acids lasheen et al 2015 chemical electrochemical or biological processes conventionally used for treating this wastewater involve the use of reducing agents high energy consumption or generation of large volumes of chemical sludge although abiotic removal of w and mo has been demonstrated in smaller two chamber mecs huang et al 2017 2018a wang et al 2017 2018 2019a 2019b simultaneous organics treatment has not previously been examined in single chamber systems or at larger scales compact reactors are also needed for efficient treatment using mecs to minimize the potential for clogging rossi et al 2019 packing a high amount of electrode area per volume can be accomplished by using thin electrodes such as graphite felt and providing conductivity for larger electrodes using stainless steel mesh current collectors huang et al 2010 guo et al 2017 tubular or cylindrical mecs have been explored for hydrogen production in mecs at larger working volumes of 0 5 4 l gil carrera et al 2013 guo et al 2017 feng et al 2018 but not for metals removals at these larger scales larger scale cylindrical shaped single chamber mecs 40 l were investigated for treatment of mixed organic w vi and mo vi under different hydraulic residence times hrts and influent strengths mutual benefits of acetate and mixed w vi and mo vi for their efficient removals were for the first time observed with the effluent accomplishing the national wastewater discharge standard addressing the feasibility of the scaled single chamber mecs for treatment of mixed acetate w vi and mo vi the roles of the bioanodes and the biocathodes in w vi and mo vi reduction were clarified based on the observation by a scanning electron microscope sem equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds the precipitant analysis by x ray photo electron spectroscopy xps and the clarification of compositions of bacterial communities developed on the anodes and the cathodes under different hrts and influent strengths 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction the cylindrical single chamber reactors 34 cm inner diameter 45 cm high were made of polyvinyl chloride pvc and constructed with concentric electrodes fig 1 graphite felt 1 cm thick sanye beijing china was used for both electrodes with the inner cathode 18 cm in diameter and 40 cm high and the outer anode 22 cm in diameter and 40 cm high producing a working liquid volume of 38 l with no separator between the electrodes the specific surface areas were 18 m2 m3 for the anode and 22 m2 m3 for the cathode based on the area specific calculation based on the cylindrical geometry as 2r 1 where r is the electrode radius logan et al 2015 stainless steel mesh type 304 ss mcmaster carr oh used as both the current collector and to support the felt electrodes was extended outside the chambers for connecting the electrodes to a power source leici shanghai china rossi et al 2019 song et al 2019 grooves were made on the bottom of the reactors to hold the edges of the stainless steel mesh producing a distance of 1 0 cm between the edges of the electrodes before installation the felt was pretreated as previously described huang et al 2010 2013b reference electrodes ag agcl electrode 195 mv versus standard hydrogen electrode she were inserted around the top section of the reactor and close to either the anode or the cathode to obtain cathode and anode potentials individually with all potentials reported here versus she a small resistor of 10 ω was installed in the circuit to measure current based on the voltage drop across the resistor using an automatic data acquisition system piso 813 hongge co taiwan the reactors were airtight and were equipped with sampling ports reactors were wrapped with aluminum foil to exclude light to avoid the growth of algae the reactors were initially operated at fed batch mode at room temperature 22 3 c after which the reactors was shifted to continuous flow operation 2 2 inoculation and operation the mecs were inoculated with 500 ml of suspended bacteria from a 250 ml cylindrical single chamber mec at a food to microorganisms ratio of 0 87 0 13 g cod g ss d and an equivalent volume of a nutrient solution containing trace elements huang et al 2010 the reactors were then acclimated in fed batch operation to a synthetic wastewater composed of w vi 0 5 mm mo vi 1 0 mm and acetate 24 mm with a cod of 1 5 g l the acclimation of the reactors was considered complete after two additional fed batch cycles based on reproducible electrode potentials over the cycle 3 4 days for continuous flow tests different concentrations of w vi mo vi and acetate were used at ratios mm mm of 0 5 1 0 24 0 5 1 0 12 0 3 0 6 12 0 2 0 4 12 or 0 1 0 2 12 in a medium with additional trace elements huang et al 2010 concentrations in actual wastewaters can vary of large ranges of 0 05 10 mm for total metals and 5 8 30 mm for total volatile organics lasheen et al 2015 the influent ph was set to 3 0 and the solution conductivity to 3 0 ms cm which are typical for acidic wastewaters containing organics w vi and mo vi lasheen et al 2015 huang et al 2018a all reagents used were of analytical grade and the solutions were prepared in distilled water after continuous sparging with ultra pure nitrogen gas the solutions were pumped bt100 2j lange china into the mecs under closed circuit conditions ccc at flow rates to produce hrts of 12 h 52 8 ml min 24 h 26 4 ml min or 48 h 13 2 ml min three controls were operated operation of the reactors under open circuit conditions occs to examine metals and acetate removal in the absence of current using only acetate or only metals to examine removals of these components along and a smaller cylindrical single chamber mecs 250 ml with 44 cm2 anode and 19 cm2 cathode with specific surface areas of 57 m2 m3 for the anode and 133 m2 m3 for the cathode at a ratio of w mo acetate of 0 5 1 0 24 mm and an hrt of 2 d to study the impact of reactor size on performance 2 3 measurements and analyses the influent and effluent concentrations of w vi and mo vi were determined as described previously wang et al 2017 acetate was measured based on soluble chemical oxygen demands cods calibrated with acetate using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1100 removals were based on dividing the measured removals by the influent concentrations hydrogen produced in the headspaces of the mecs was collected using a gas collecting bag and periodically analyzed using a gas chromatograph gc7900 tianmei shanghai hydrogen production l l d was calculated on total hydrogen recovered normalized to the reactor working volume and operational time d an external voltage of 0 5 v was used during the entire operation period all electrode potentials were collected using a data acquisition piso 813 hongge co taiwan the influent and effluent phs were measured using a ph probe and meter phs 3c leici shanghai the influent and effluent solution conductivities were determined with a conductivity probe and meter dds 307 leici shanghai electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was conducted using a potentiostat vsp biologic as previously described zhang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 and modified in si after a 30 d continuous operation the anodes and the cathodes were sampled in the middle of the electrodes biofilm morphology and precipitates on the cathodes and the anodes were examined using a sem nova nanosem450 fei company usa equipped with an eds x max 20 mm2 50 mm2 oxford instruments uk prior to observation the electrodes were collected and treated as previously described huang et al 2012 the valences of products on the cathodes and the anodes were confirmed using xps kratos axis ultra dld 2 4 bacterial community analysis samples were collected from the anodes and the cathodes of the mecs at the end of experiments following different set conditions of hrts or influent concentrations five pieces of graphite felt 1 1 1 cm3 were removed from multiple locations in the middle of the electrodes and mixed together for analysis samples were then treated and analyzed as described in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hrt efficient removal of w vi 97 98 mo vi 98 99 and acetate 95 96 fig 2 a and b with simultaneous hydrogen production rate 0 0037 0 0039 l l d fig 2b were achieved using an hrt of 2 d and influent concentrations of w mo acetate of 0 5 1 0 24 mm these removals were much higher than those in the controls with circuit current in the presence of metals and absence of acetate w 2 4 mo 3 5 fig 2a and in the absence of metals with only acetate cod removal of 36 39 along with slightly lower hydrogen production rates 0 0030 0 0031 l l d fig 2b there were increases in ph and conductivity consistent with circuit current and acetate consumption with the largest changes in ph and solution conductivities occurring in the presence of acetate and both metals fig 2c in all cases there was relatively higher circuit currents and lower cathode potentials in the presence of acetate and both metals fig 2d these results demonstrate the mutual benefits of having acetate and both w and mo metals present for their removal in an mec the percentage of cod removal has been reported to be unaffected by the cod strength using domestic wastewaters that do not contain high concentrations of metals he et al 2016 the key reason for a change in cod removal in the experiments here is therefore the presence of multiple electron acceptors eg w vi and mo vi which as reviewed by he et al 2015 can largely contribute to system performance collectively these results demonstrate the close correlation between the acetate and the metals as well as the more feasibility of the scaled mecs for treating mixed acetate w vi and mo vi rather than the standalone acetate or the metals the final effluent concentrations w 2 3 mg l mo 1 2 mg l cod 45 53 mg l were below national wastewater discharge limits for china gb18918 2002 and gb21 1627 2008 implying that treatment using this mec would produce effluents suitable to discharge into the environment the specific metabolism of the microorganisms towards the removal of w vi mo vi and acetate from solution with simultaneous hydrogen production in the scaled mecs was further evidenced by the absence of any by products in the headspace absence of methane and in the effluent absence of any other organics and negligible biomass the extent and rates of removals of metals and cod in the 40 l mec fig 2 was very similar to that in the smaller 250 ml reactor at an hrt of 2 d fig s1 demonstrating that using a larger mec did not impact metals and acetate removals hydrogen production rates 0 0079 0 0082 l l d in the small reactors however were about 2 times as large as that in the 40 l mec likely reflecting increased recoveries of hydrogen in the smaller reactors consistent with other mec reports showing reduced hydrogen gas recoveries with larger reactor sizes kadier et al 2016 logan et al 2015 a lower hydrogen production in the 40 l mec thus shows the compromise of the enlarged volume of reactor a shorter hrt of 1 d fig 3 rather than 2 d fig 2 reduced metals and acetate removals w 88 1 mo 94 1 cod 73 1 fig 3a and b but slightly increased hydrogen production rates 0 0046 0 0001 l l d fig 3b this greater hydrogen rate may be related to the higher current density 0 61 0 00 a m3 fig 3d since circuit current has been shown to be positively correlated with hydrogen production and negatively correlated with hrt in mecs lu and ren 2016 kadier et al 2016 the general trends in effluent ph conductivity and electrode potentials fig 3c and d were similar to those observed with the 2 d hrt fig 2 less metals removal consumed less protons for oxometallate precipitates resulting in lower effluent phs and higher effluent conductivities fig 3c than those at 2 d fig 2c 3 2 combined effect of influent strength and hrt lower in the acetate concentration to 12 mm versus 24 mm with the same hrt 1 d and metal concentrations w mo 0 5 1 0 resulted in less metal removals and hydrogen production figs s2a and b but favored cod removal fig s2b fig 3 consistent with the effluent ph and conductivity fig s2c and circuit current fig s2d in parallel a shorter hrt 0 5 d at a same strength influent w mo acetate 0 5 1 0 12 mm decreased metal and cod removal and favored for hydrogen production fig s2 these results illustrated the combined importance of organic strength and hrt for system performance using a lower concentration of metals w 0 1 0 3 mm mo 0 2 0 6 mm at a 1 d hrt with the lower concentration of acetate 12 mm produced higher metal removals fig s3a however the lowest influent metals w 0 1 mm mo 0 2 mm resulted in the lowest cod removal and hydrogen production fig s3b consistent with the effluent phs and solution conductivities fig s3c as well as the circuit currents fig s3d collectively these results illustrate the importance of appropriate ratios of metals and acetate in the influent for efficient system performance 3 3 continuous operation over 30 days at an hrt of 2 d operation of the 40 l mec at a 2 d hrt showed that removal of metals w 94 96 mo 95 99 and cod 95 96 circuit current and electrode potential were stable over 30 days of operation figs s4a and c the lower effluent conductivity was due to the change in effluent ph fig s4b eis spectra were fitted to equivalent circuits fig s5 to identify the changes in the components of the internal resistances for the electrodes at the start of the tests and after 30 days fig 4 and table s1 there was only a small change in the ohmic resistances of the cathodes 23 ω 28 ω and anodes 24 ω 36 ω consistent with relatively small changes in solution conductivities however the charge transfer resistance nearly doubled for both electrodes cathode from 56 ω to 105 ω anode from 77 ω to 142 ω suggesting a decay in electrode performance over time these changes in resistance did not appear to impact overall reactor performance over the 30 d period there were slight changes in the diffusion resistance that did not show any consistent change for both electrodes cathode from 83 ω to 73 ω anode from 52 ω to 66 ω these results imply that changes in the electrochemical resistances did not substantially impact overall performance but these changes do not readily reflect changes that could also be occurring in the microbial communities 3 4 morphological observation of electrodes and analysis of metal precipitates cathodes and anodes were examined using sem at the end of the continuous 30 day operation both the cathodes fig 5 a and the anodes fig 5c were populated with bacteria and with noticeable precipitates on these bacterial surfaces relatively thick biofilms that developed on the anodes fig 5c were in contrast to the sparsely populated biofilms covering the cathodes fig 5a the sparser biofilms on the cathodes could have been caused by disruption and dislodging biofilm due to the evolution of hydrogen gas from the electrodes however sparsely populated biofilms have frequently been observed on cathodes with other terminal electron acceptors such as nitrate oxygen or chlorophenols acceptors even in the absence of hydrogen evolution huang et al 2012 2013b logan et al 2019 xie et al 2011 analysis of the biofilm precipitates indicated reduction of w vi and mo vi on bacterial cells on the anode although to a lesser extent than that observed on the cathodes the greater reduction of w vi and mo vi on the cathodes was ascribed to the cathodic reductive environment in agreement with the extensive literature on reduction of many other heavy metals on the cathodes of bioelectrochemical systems nancharaiah et al 2016 dominguez benetton et al 2018 the observed reduction of w vi and mo vi on the anodes is similarly supported by previous studies showing both anodic cr vi reduction by ochrobactrum sp yc211 in dual chamber microbial fuel cells chen et al 2016 and the anodic fe iii reduction by predominant sphaerochaeta thermosinus arcobacter and hydrogenophage in the anodic bacterial communities of single chamber microbial fuel cells liu et al 2018 facultative anaerobic shewanella sp well known for their electrochemical activities in bioelectrochemical systems logan et al 2019 have also been shown to use selenite as the sole electron acceptor for respiration under anaerobic conditions lee et al 2007 similar to cr vi reduction by many bacterial strains bachate et al 2013 banerjee et al 2019 thacker and madamwar 2005 soluble and membrane associated enzymes on the cellular surfaces of these bacteria have been proven to mediate the reduction of these metals thacker and madamwar 2005 barrera diaza et al 2012 considering the fact of many bacteria such as raoultella ornithinolytica mo1 raoultella planticola mo1 pseudomonas sp dry2 enterobacter sp dr y13 or acinetobacter calcoaceticus are capable of reducing mo vi shukor et al 2009 2010a 2010b saeed et al 2019 and sulfitobacter dubius na4 as v 4 and sb5 for w vi reduction coimbra et al 2017 the occurrence of w vi and mo vi reduction on the bioanodes of the single chamber mecs was not surprising using eds to examine the composition of the precipitates stronger w and mo signals were detected on the biocathodes fig 5b than on the bioanodes fig 5d with the amounts of w and mo on the biocathodes 4 8 w and 4 2 mo times of those on the bioanodes table s2 this again implies that most metals were reduced on the cathodes biofilms formed can help to facilitate hydrogen production from the cathodes in mecs rozendal et al 2008 geelhoed and stams 2011 in the presence of electron acceptors of w vi and mo vi in the electrolyte here some of the in situ generated hydrogen on the biocathodes could be used for the reduction of w vi and mo vi wang et al 2017 2018 2019a 2019b similar to other electron acceptors including nitrate other metals and carbon dioxide hou et al 2018 kadier et al 2016 nancharaiah et al 2016 xie et al 2011 this reduction would explain the greater amounts of reduced precipitants on the biocathodes fig 6 a and c than observed on the bioanodes fig 6b and d xps analysis of the cathodes indicated the presence of both w v and w vi fig 6a compared to only w vi on the anodes fig 6b this suggests that there was primarily w vi adsorption and precipitation on the anodes while there was reduction of w on the cathode in parallel more mo vi mo v and mo iv were simultaneously observed on the cathodes fig 6c than on the anodes fig 6d demonstrating greater mo vi reduction on the cathodes these higher xps signals of reduced metals on the cathodes fig 6a and c than on the anodes fig 6b and d were consistent with the eds results showing greater metal concentrations on the electrodes fig 5b and d table s2 the occurrence of some mo vi reduction on the anodes implies mo vi might compete with the anodes to accept electrons directly from the exoelectrogens similar to many bacteria known to be capable of direct mo vi reduction shukor et al 2009 2010a 2010b lim et al 2012 othman et al 2013 and mixed culture for cd ii or zn ii removal in single chamber microbial fuel cells abourached et al 2014 in the case of biocathodes electron transfer from electrotrophs to metal ions is not well established nancharaiah et al 2016 very recently rowe et al 2018 demonstrated that shewanella oneidensis mr 1 on a cathode acquired energy for oxygen reduction this respiratory process has important implications for understanding the biocathodes for w vi and mo vi reduction in the present system and the cellular conversion of the cathodic electrons to the electrotrophs despite that direct proofs for such mechanism is still needed 3 5 changes in bacterial communities from 10 generated libraries a total of 469 826 high quality 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained with an average length of 440 nucleotides table s3 these sequences were assigned into 4400 otus with a distance limit of 0 03 though the rarefaction curves did not exhibit a plateau fig s6 the good s coverage estimators indicate that the sizes of libraries were sufficient to cover the bacterial communities table s3 compared to the controls in the absence of metals the presence of w vi and mo vi consistently decreased the diversity of the microbial communities on the anodes and increased the diversity on the cathodes as shown in the shannon indices from 3 18 to 1 23 anode and 1 03 to 2 63 cathode fig s7 and table s3 considering the more critical role of the cathode than the anode in system performance he et al 2015 this increased diversity on the biocathodes may have substantially contributed to the enhanced system performance for metals removals figs 2 and 3 however the decreased diversity of the biofilms on the anodes cannot exclude their potential critical roles in system performance since the bacterial ability to conduct current may not be the only or main reason for the predominance of high electrochemically active bacteria logan et al 2019 this result was very similar to the responses of the microbial communities on the anodes and the cathodes of single chamber microbial fuel cells to fe iii where the externally added fe iii shaped community structures of the electrode biofilms resulting in the decreased anode and the increased cathode diversities of the microbial communities compared to the controls in the absence of fe iii liu et al 2018 analysis of the bacterial communities based on a weighted fast unifrac principle coordinates analysis indicated some general similarity in the communities acclimated to the different hrts and concentrations of chemicals fig 7 a the bioanodes and the biocathodes in the absence of metals grouped in different quadrants the presence of metals however led to the more random dispersal of the anode than the cathode bacterial communities particularly at shorter hrts of 0 5 d or 1 d and regardless of the influent strength a long hrt 2 d and a high strength influent w mo acetate 0 5 1 0 24 mm led to a clustering of the different genus on both the anodes and the cathodes a dendrogram constructed on the basis of community phylogenetic lineages further supported differences in these bacterial communities based on an absence of any close alignments of the communities at different hrts and various strength influents fig 7b these findings illustrate that the compositions of the bacterial communities on the anodes and the cathodes were different from each other and that a longer hrt 2 d with a higher strength influent w mo acetate 0 5 1 0 24 decreased the differences of the communities as they showed less dispersal the bacterial communities consisted of 5 phyla with the majority of sequences 34 2 97 1 belonging to proteobacteria fig 8 a which are frequently observed in bioelectrochemical systems lesnik and liu 2014 logan et al 2019 the presence of metals stimulated the relative abundance of proteobacteria on the anodes 63 5 91 8 and decreased them on the cathodes 78 6 88 3 compared to those communities observed in the absence of metals anode 34 2 cathode 92 7 similarly a low strength influent favored the abundance of proteobacteria anode 91 8 cathode 88 3 compared to those at a high strength influent anode 63 5 cathode 84 6 a longer hrt of 2 d might have compensated for the higher strength influent resulting in predominance of proteobacteria 97 1 on the cathodes and proteobacteria 82 7 and firmicutes 12 6 on the anodes the other actinobacteria and bacteroidetes apparently decreased in the presence of metals and slightly changed with hrt and influent strength two classes gamma and alpha within proteobacteria were predominantly observed from all communities in addition to the minor betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria fig 8b genus level analysis demonstrates a long hrt benefited an increased abundance of pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas and diminished enterobacter and desulfovibrio on both electrodes fig 8c similarly a high strength influent shifted the genera to bacillus 4 3 and rhodococcus 0 8 on the cathodes and paenibacillus 4 1 brevundimonas 3 5 staphylococcis 2 5 and rhodococcus 1 8 on the anodes in addition enterobacter sp stenotrophomonas brevundimonas and unclassfied on the cathodes and enterobacter sp and shewanella on the anodes largely increased in response to the high strength influent in the controls the absence of metals led to the predominant pseudomonas 83 7 on the cathodes and the prevalent stenotrophomonas 13 0 paenibacillus 25 0 clostridium sensu stricto 12 and rhodococcus 16 9 on the anodes collectively these results demonstrated the influence of hrt and influent strength on the anodic and cathodic genera which changed along with the system performance figs 2 and 3 fig s2 4 many bacteria including raoultella ornithinolytica raoultella planticola saeed et al 2019 bacillus amyloliquefaciens maarof et al 2018 pseudomonas shukor et al 2010a enterobacter shukor et al 2009 klebsiella lim et al 2012 acinetobacter shukor et al 2010b bacillus sp othman et al 2013 and desulfovibrio desulfuricans tucker et al 1997 reportedly reduce mo vi to mo blue in conventional biological processes the observation of many of these genera in the 40 l mecs thus implies their potential contribution to mo vi reduction in these reactors for tungsten several w vi tolerant strains including sulfitobacter dubius na4 as v 4 and sb5 reportedly grow and accumulate tungsten in the presence of a high w vi 1 0 mm coimbra et al 2017 isolates with w vi and mo vi tolerant and electrochemically active characteristics from this system might enable to directly associate changes in biochemical metabolism and gene expression with the w vi and mo vi reduction in the future investigation at this time however it is only possible to infer the activities based on rdna identification cytochrome profiling of pure cultures is helpful to examine whether differential expression of redox enzymes at the feeding of different influent strengths and various hrts is a contributing factor to affect system performances studies on these genera rather than studies confined to the model strains of geobacter and shewanella and some other isolates from single metal removed bioelectrochemical systems huang et al 2018a 2018b 2018c tao et al 2017 shen et al 2017 hou et al 2018 will help us understand the roles of these genera in the bacterial community for complete and simultaneous removals of acetate w vi and mo vi in this system the different diversities of the microbial communities on the anodes and the cathodes in response to w vi and mo vi might be related with the different behaviors of w vi and mo vi on the anodes and the cathodes direct reduction of w vi and mo vi competed with electron transfer to the anodes and thus internally consumed electrons from exoelectrogens and negatively affected system performance in terms of circuit current conversely w vi and mo vi at the biocathodes could be used as terminal electron acceptors and thus may have benefited more diversified bacterial communities he et al 2015 although tungstate or molybdate are key elements of coenzymes and play key roles as enzyme activators in many bacteria hartmann et al 2015 saeed et al 2019 the roles of w vi and mo vi in the activities of bioanodes and the biocathodes in single chamber mecs particularly at the molecular level are largely unclear a better understanding of the chemistry and biological transport in these systems will require the use of pure cultures to study gene expression the present study has illustrated the mutual benefits of acetate and mixed tungsten and molybdenum for their efficient removal in 40 l mecs achieving nearly complete removals of w 97 98 mo 98 99 and acetate 95 96 compared to lower contaminant removals w 2 4 mo 3 5 acetate 36 39 in the controls with individual metals or acetate an electron balance based on the working volume of 38 l showed that the total electrons required for reduction of w vi and mo vi 0 11 mol and hydrogen evolution 0 03 mol and those from the oxidation of acetate 6 93 7 00 mol were appreciably higher than the controls with individual metals 0 003 0 005 mol hydrogen 0 02 mol or acetate 2 63 2 85 mol the ratio of electrons extracted from acetate and used for both w and mo reduction and hydrogen evolution was thus around 50 apparently lower than 114 in the controls with individual acetate or metals this implies a better balance between acetate oxidation and mixed w and mo reduction and the more favorable result overall with using metals as more of the acetate was used when both metals were present compared to individual metals or only electrons used for hydrogen production this highlights the critical advantages of the mixed w mo and acetate over the individual components for efficient removal of these species in mecs changing the general recognition on more efficient biological treatment efficiency for single rather than multiple contaminants in wastewaters lim et al 2012 lasheen et al 2015 overall the presence of acetate improved w and mo removal by 25 49 times and the presence of w and mo together enhanced acetate removal by 2 5 2 7 times based on these encouraging results this suggests that mecs could be superior to conventional biological processes for w and mo removal from wastewater compared to previous studies using small liquid volumes 12 28 ml in single chamber mecs for the removal of a single metals zn cd or cu abourached et al 2014 wu et al 2018 the present study suggests the feasibility of larger scale single chamber mecs for efficient treatment of w and mo moving metallurgical mecs closer to commercialization for wastewater treatment of these two concomitant metals practical implementation will depend on the long term operation of these reactors and other characteristics of the wastewaters as well as the cost of the system relative to conventional treatment processes at this point in time it is likely that this technology is not yet ready for commercial applications as even larger scale studies would be required for evaluating the process prior to commercial and full scale applications 4 conclusions simultaneous removal of acetate and w and mo was achieved in a 40 l cylindrical single chamber mec with the effluent levels meeting national wastewater discharge standards for both metals and organics the combination of acetate and the metals of w vi and mo vi together had improved removals compared to acetate or metals alone hrt and influent strength influenced the compositions of bacterial communities on the anodes and the cathodes and may have contributed to system performance under different conditions conflicts of interest there are no conflicts to declare acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge financial

18657,the global energy crisis and water pollution drive the researchers to develop highly effective and less energy intensive water purification technologies in this study a highly active wo3 tio2 sio2 nanocomposite was synthesized and used for photocatalytic degradation of persistent organic pollutants under simulated solar light the optimum wo3 tio2 sio2 prepared with 2 wt wo3 loading and calcination at 800 c exhibited higher photocatalytic activity as the rate constant k 1 for phenanthrene degradation was 7 1 times of that for the commercial tio2 p25 the extremely large specific surface area 400 m2 g of wo3 tio2 sio2 afforded it with enlarged pollutants adsorption performance and abundant active surface sites the heterojunction of anatase with sio2 as well as loading of wo3 decreased the band gap energy e g of tio2 which extended the utilization spectrum of tio2 to visible region formation of ti o si band indicated the excess charges can cause brønsted acidity due to the absorption of protons to compensate the charges moreover the migration of photo excited electrons from the conduction band of anatase to wo3 and holes in the opposite direction restrained the electron hole recombination the photocatalytic degradation mechanism and pathway for phenanthrene degradation were proposed based on experimental analysis and density functional theory dft calculation and the toxicities of the degradation intermediates were evaluated by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis wo3 tio2 sio2 also showed good separation settling performance and high stability our work is expected to offer new insight into the photocatalytic mechanism for wo3 tio2 and sio2 based heterojunctions and rational design and synthesis of highly efficient photocatalysts for environmental application graphical abstract image 1 keywords photocatalysis wo3 tio2 sio2 solar light phenanthrene toxicity 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a group of persistent organic pollutants pops that derive from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels industrial production oil release and natural sources yu et al 2018 the chronic exposure to pahs at even low concentration can cause long lasting damage such as infertility cancer and neurotoxicity to human beings qiao et al 2014a the toxicity of pahs can be amplified by their bioaccumulation in tissue of human bodies due to their high hydrophobicity yu et al 2018 16 pahs have been listed as priority pollutants by u s environmental protection agency epa due to their high toxicity fu et al 2018 pahs are frequently detected in the surface water in china previous researchers studied the occurrence source and fate of pahs in haihe river system in china qiao et al 2014a b and found that the wastewater treatment plants wwtps could not effectively remove pahs therefore the wwtps effluents contribute to ca 68 5 89 4 of total pahs in receiving rivers qiao et al 2014a the pahs concentration in several studied river water is in the range of 0 16 1 20 μg l in dissolved phase and 1 56 79 38 μg g in particulate phase qiao et al 2014b therefore removal of pahs from water phase is still a current focus in the environmental research area phenanthrene is one of the most detected pahs in water environments with relatively high concentration and it is persistent and hard to degrade due to its very stable three ring structure zeng s group conducted a survey for pahs in 42 freshwaters throughout china where the phenanthrene is shown as one of the most abundant parent pahs yao et al 2017 a nationwide study of pahs in drinking water also revealed that the phenanthrene is the most abundant individual pahs in tap water and which contributed to 33 of the total 16 usepa listed priority pahs moreover the 3 ring pahs e g phenanthrene are more difficult to remove than other pahs in drinking water treatment process zhang et al 2019 various methods have been applied to remove pahs and other organic contaminants from waters such as adsorption biodegradation chemical oxidation etc for example yu et al 2018 applied a novel citric acid chelated fe ii activated persulfate percarbonate system to remove phenanthrene in aqueous phase the chelated complex increased fe ii solubility and the system could produce large amount of so4 and oh to achieved high phenanthrene removal efficiency at optimal persulfate percarbonate ratio however the inherent limitations of either low efficiency or high energy chemical consumption prevent their applications kou et al 2009 the photocatalytic degradation of contaminants by using solar light is a green and sustainable technology which has attracted great attention in recent years liu et al 2017 tio2 is the most applied photocatalyst due to its low cost nontoxicity high activity under uv but low visible light utilization inhibits its application under natural solar light cai et al 2018 riboni et al 2013 the coupling of wo3 and tio2 can retard the electron hole pairs recombination and shift the light absorption to visible light region which shows promising potential for photocatalytic degradation of contaminants riboni et al 2013 zerjav et al 2017 moreover the surface acidity that caused by wo3 loading has been recently found to enhance the pollutants adsorption and promote oh production rimoldi et al 2019 loading tio2 on silica aerogel can improve the surface area and stability of tio2 which provides the material with more accessible sites for pollutants adsorption and photocatalytic reaction sun et al 2013 therefore the incorporation of wo3 in tio2 sio2 heterojunction is a strategy to obtain ideal photocatalyst however to the best of our knowledge only few studies have studied the wo3 tio2 sio2 composite as photocatalyst but the contribution and mechanisms of the extended visible light activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 is not well investigated bao et al 2003 lin et al 2017 shi et al 2016 for example lin et al 2017 studied the wo3 tio2 sio2 as photocatalyst to remove acetaminophen under uv vis illumination the removal efficiency under various ph and catalyst dosage was well studied but the generation of radicals was not measured and the contribution of wo3 on the promoted visible light activity was not evaluated in addition from the aspect of application in water treatment engineering it is important to systematically evaluating the reusability of the material and the separation performance of the materials to this end a wo3 deposited tio2 sio2 nanocomposite wo3 tio2 sio2 was synthesized by adopting the silica aerogel as support to significantly increase the surface area and stability of the photocatalyst the enhanced solar light photocatalytic activity and underlying mechanisms of this material were comprehensively investigated and explained via the photodegradation experiments on phenanthrene a most abundant and resistant pah additionally the ecotoxicity of the phenanthrene and its degradation intermediates were evaluated to assess the environmental risks of the treated wastewater moreover the recovery property stability and recyclability of the new developed material were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials silica aerogel enova aerogel ic 3100 with particle size of 2 40 μm surface area of 600 800 m3 g and pore diameter at ca 20 nm was acquired from aerogel

reagent corporation shanghai china phenanthrene was obtained from alfa aesar ma usa all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and used as received 2 2 photocatalysts preparation the wo3 tio2 sio2 was synthesized via sol gel method using silica aerogel as support followed by calcination scheme 1 briefly 1 17 g of silica aerogel was dispersed in 100 ml of methanol and magnetically stirred for 10 min then 5 ml of tbot and predetermined amount of wcl6 were added afterwards a mixture of deionized di water 0 26 ml and hno3 0 035 ml was added dropwise to start the hydrolysis and then kept stirring for another 2 h in this step the formed ti oh 4 and w oh 6 were deposited on the hydroxyl groups abundant silica surface following the hydrolysis the solvents was vented at 265 c and the samples were washed by methanol and dried at 80 c for 4 h the resulting composites were then calcined at 800 c with open air for 3 h to convert the ti oh 4 and w oh 6 to well crystalized tio2 and wo3 nanoparticles in selected experiments the wcl6 with predetermined mass was added to achieve different tungsten to tio2 sio2 weight ratios 0 1 2 and 3 wt at the optimum tungsten ratio calcination at temperatures of 400 600 and 800 c evaluated moreover neat tio2 was prepared with the same procedures but without adding silica aerogel and tungsten and neat tio2 sio2 was synthesized without w loading details on material characterizations are presented in test s1 of the supplementary data sd 2 3 photocatalytic performance tests fig s1 in the sd depicts the experimental setup which included a photo reactor 250 ml with cooling system and a 300 w xenon ozone free short arc lamp pls sxe 300 beijing perfect light co ltd with an am1 5 filter the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene was performed according to the previous described procedures cai et al 2017a and in controlled conditions phenanthrene concentration 500 μg l photocatalyst dosage 0 5 g l ph 7 0 0 2 temperature 25 0 2 c and solar intensity 100 mw cm2 the visible light photocatalytic activity of catalysts was evaluated by applying a uv cut off filter to remove uv irradiation 420 nm fig s2 the contributions of various active species i e singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide o2 hydroxyl oh and holes h to photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene were evaluated by applying selective radical scavengers specifically ao at 700 mg l was used for quenching h ipa at 600 mg l for oh and bq at 80 mg l for o2 cai et al 2017b cavalcante et al 2016 nan3 at 200 mg l was used for 1o2 and oh quenching which is the most commonly applied scavenger for 1o2 k 7 8 108 m 1s 1 and oh k 1 4 1010 m 1s 1 during photocatalysis reaction chen et al 2015 and thus the role of 1o2 can be explored in addition the presence of oh and o2 radicals in the reaction was recorded by electronic paramagnetic resonance epr bruker a300 germany the oh and o2 were captured by dmpo in deionized water and methanol respectively phenanthrene concentration was analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system with uv detector 1260 series agilent usa cai et al 2017a the degradation intermediates and products were extracted

text s2 of the sd the ecotoxicity of phenanthrene and its degradation intermediates were assessed by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar method by applying the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t 2 4 reusability and stability evaluation the methods on settling property reusability and long term stability evaluation of the photocatalysts are shown in text s3 of the sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimum synthesis conditions of wo3 tio2 sio2 the photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 prepared with different wo3 loadings 0 3 wt with a fixed calcination temperature of 800 c and calcination temperatures 400 600 and 800 c with a fixed wo3 loading of 2 wt were evaluated in terms of the phenanthrene degradation under simulated solar light the first order kinetic model was used to interpret the phenanthrene degradation kinetic data fu et al 2018 1 ln c 0 c t k 1 t where c 0 and c t are the phenanthrene concentrations μg l at initial and time t min and k 1 is the first order rate constant min 1 fig 1 shows the photocatalytic activity of various materials for phenanthrene degradation adsorption of phenanthrene without light was relatively low 5 for the tested materials the first order kinetic model could well interpret the experimental data r 2 0 9 table s1 obviously increasing the wo3 loadings from 0 to 1 and 2 wt increased the rate constant k 1 from 0 0110 to 0 0132 and 0 176 min 1 respectively fig 1a and table s1 however further increasing wo3 loading to 3 wt decreased the k 1 to 0 0147 min 1 consequently the optimum wo3 loading was 2 wt and the wo3 ratio is of crucial importance for the photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 the incorporation of wo3 can affect the photocatalytic activity of tio2 in the following aspects 1 the involvement of wo3 in tio2 can induce the reduction of e g of the catalysts which extends the light absorbance to longer wavelengths thus gains higher photocatalytic activity under solar light shen et al 2016 2 the wo3 presents as a charge separation center in the wo3 tio2 heterojunction and promotes the photocatalytic activity however excessive wo3 can form an amorphous layer on tio2 surface which behaves as charge carrier recombination centers to diminish the photo excited electrons holes 3 the wo3 amorphous layer can cover the active surface of tio2 and hinder its light absorbance thereby reducing the photocatalytic activity zerjav et al 2017 increasing the calcination temperature from 400 to 600 and 800 c increased the k 1 value from 0 0034 to 0 0077 and 0 0173 min 1 respectively fig 1b and table s1 the better activity of the wo3 tio2 sio2 synthesized at higher calcination temperature mainly results from the formation of anatase type tio2 which exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity than amorphous tio2 tio2 nanoparticles in the composite materials generally has three forms including amorphous tio2 anatase and rutile and phase transformation occurs at different temperatures pure tio2 prepared via the sol gel method usually presents in an amorphous phase and the calcination i e 400 c leads to the formation of anatase which has high photocatalytic activity further increasing the calcination temperature to 800 c will transform anatase to rutile which behaves lower activity than anatase cai et al 2017a for the tio2 phase in the composite the introducing of other components will increase the necessary temperature for the crystallization of anatase and subsequent transformation to rutile phase anderson and bard 1997 in the as prepared wo3 tio2 sio2 at relatively high calcination temperature the sio2 support also can stabilize the anatase through the ti o si interface the tio2 atoms at the interface are substituted into the tetrahedral sio2 lattice to form tetrahedral ti sites the interaction between the tetrahedral ti sites and octahedral ti species in the anatase is considered to prevent the transformation to rutile anderson and bard 1997 thus the wo3 tio2 sio2 calcined at 800 c achieved better anatase crystallization therefore wo3 tio2 sio2 with wo3 weight ratio of 2 wt and calcined at 800 c was used as the optimum photocatalyst 3 2 material characterizations the commercial sio2 synthesized tio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 prepared under optimum condition were characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem fig 2 evidently the sio2 aerogel made by interconnected sio2 networks showed no evident lattice fringes fig 2a indicating that the sio2 was composed of amorphous silica particles the tio2 synthesized by the so gel method was observed as agglomerated particles with the diameter of 20 40 nm fig 2b fig 2c describes the morphology of wo3 tio2 sio2 before photocatalytic reaction it is evident that the tio2 nanoparticles were well crystallized with random crystallographic orientations and dispersed on the sio2 aerogel surface the space of lattice fringe of 0 34 nm is attributed to the facet of anatase 101 indicating the formation of anatase cai et al 2015 the particle size of loaded tio2 was decreased to ca 5 15 nm compared with the neat tio2 according to liu et al s research the optimal crystallite size of tio2 is 10 nm for photocatalytic reaction liu et al 2008 therefore the decreased tio2 particle size in wo3 tio2 sio2 composite would play an important role in promoting the photocatalytic activity no significant difference in the morphology of wo3 tio2 sio2 after photocatalytic reaction can be observed fig 2d the energy dispersive x ray spectra eds reveal that the main elements of wo3 tio2 sio2 were si ti o and w fig 2e indicating that w was successfully deposited on tio2 sio2 there are no wo3 particles observed in tem images due to the relatively small crystalline size of wo3 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps survey spectra indicates w ti si and o are the main elements of wo3 tio2 sio2 fig 3 a with a weight ratio of 1 5 23 8 33 10 and 41 6 respectively two major characteristic peaks of ti 2p at 459 0 and 464 8 ev for neat tio2 are assigned to the core levels of ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 respectively fig 3b for wo3 tio2 sio2 the two ti 2p characteristic peaks shifted to the higher energy level indicating that the loading of wo3 and sio2 interfered with the energy level of tio2 due to the mixed crystal structure of sio2 tio2 and wo3 shen et al 2016 the spectrum of w 4f of the wo3 tio2 sio2 in fig 3c shows that the characteristic peaks at 36 2 ev and 38 2 ev correspond to the core levels of w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 respectively li et al 2018b the binding energy value of the si 2p is centered at 103 7 ev fig 3d which is the characteristic of the si o bonding of sio2 in the x ray diffraction xrd patterns fig 4 the sio2 aerogel was amorphous with no obvious diffraction peaks however for neat tio2 the calcination process at 800 c completely converted tio2 into rutile phase jcpds 21 1276 the heterojunction of tio2 sio2 inhibited the conversion of tio2 from anatase to rutile which is revealed by all the diffraction peaks assigned to anatase jcpds 21 1272 in tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 cai et al 2017a previous studies reported that the existence of sio2 inhibited the crystallization of tio2 at low temperature while retarded conversion of tio2 from anatase to rutile at the high temperature feng et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 in our study the domination of anatase crystallite phase in tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 indicated that the new materials maintained high photocatalytic activity when compared with the pure tio2 due to the coating of anatase no diffraction peaks of wo3 can be found in the wo3 tio2 sio2 pattern due to low content 2 wt and small crystalline size of wo3 zerjav et al 2017 the measured brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of wo3 tio2 sio2 was 429 m2 g as shown in fig 4b which was lower than that of sio2 aerogel 700 m2 g the decreased surface area is because the attached tio2 and wo3 blocked pores of the sio2 aerogels and the aerogel structure partially destroyed during calcination at 800 c however the surface area of our prepared material was still much higher than that of previously reported wo3 tio2 shen et al 2016 the large surface area provided by sio2 aerogel support is favorable for efficient degradation of organics 1 the large surface area and hydroxyl groups on silica favor adsorption of organics onto the surface of catalysts 2 the loading of tio2 on the surface of sio2 aerogel greatly enlarged its availability for the photocatalytic reaction 3 the transparent sio2 aerogel can scatter light to tio2 without absorb its energy hendrix et al 2015 in the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra fig 4c the broad absorption peaks at 3420 and 1633 cm 1 were assigned to the stretching vibrations of surface hydroxyl groups o h and the bending vibrations of sorbed water molecule h o h respectively cai et al 2017a zhang et al 2016 it is worth noting that the extra hydroxyl groups on the surface of catalysts provided acid sites which are beneficial for catalytic properties hendrix et al 2015 in addition the coordination number for ti atoms is 6 in crystalline titania ti o6 and for si atoms in sio2 is 4 therefore the introducing of ti atoms on sio2 to form tetrahedral structure will produce negative two charges per ti atom and the excess charges can cause brønsted acidity due to the absorption of protons to compensate the charges hendrix et al 2015 the enhanced acidity of wo3 tio2 sio2 also favored the photocatalytic activity the low frequency absorption in the region of 500 700 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of ti o ti yang et al 2013 the ftir spectra of pure sio2 tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 showed a similar shape the absorption peak at ca 1080 and 460 cm 1 correspond to si o si bending vibration and stretching vibration respectively zhang et al 2016 the peak at 958 cm 1 for tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 was due to the si o ti vibration zhang et al 2016 which demonstrates the interaction between si and ti atoms and confirms the formation of tio2 sio2 heterojunction fig 4d presents the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs of various materials and the e g values were calculated according to the kubelka munk method feng et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 the measured e g for tio2 was 3 1 ev with a light absorbance edge of 398 nm however a slightly broadened e g 3 2 ev was obtained for tio2 sio2 introducing of wo3 into tio2 sio2 decreased the e g to 3 0 ev xrd analysis indicated the tio2 synthesized in this study was primary rutile which had lower e g 3 1 ev than anatase 3 2 ev in addition the photocatalytic activity of rutile is much lower than that of anatase due to its shorter lifetime of photoexcited electron hole pairs zhang et al 2014 the synthesized tio2 sio2 demonstrated an increased e g compared with tio2 rutile indicating relatively low visible light utilization efficiency of tio2 sio2 composite three aspects can be responsible for the enlarged bandgap 1 the anatase with larger e g is presented in tio2 sio2 2 the decreased crystal size of anatase induced the quantum size effect leading to a larger e g of tio2 the tem images revealed that the particle size of tio2 on the sio2 surface was 9 nm 3 the difference in energy levels of the energy bands from tio2 and energy bands from sio2 on the interface lin et al 2017 wo3 tio2 sio2 exhibited the lower e g 3 0 ev and higher absorbance in the visible light region which is supposed to exhibit higher photocatalytic activity under visible irradiation the wo3 has a e g of 2 74 ev and behaves wide range of light absorbance sotelo vazquez et al 2017 therefore the involvement of wo3 into tio2 sio2 decreases the e g of wo3 tio2 sio2 and incrementally shifted the absorption edge toward higher wavelength this shift was even sufficient to trigger the electron hole separation of the wo3 tio2 sio2 by visible light 400 nm therefore a broader range of wavelengths can be absorbed and utilized by the wo3 tio2 sio2 the decreasing of e g via wo3 tio2 heterojunction had been observed by other authors li et al 2018b zerjav et al 2017 where the adsorption edge of wo3 loaded tio2 shifted toward higher wavelength and even reached the visible light region fig 4e shows the transient photocurrent responses of wo3 tio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 electrodes under intermittent light illumination the photocurrent response is reversible as the illumination was turned off and on the photocurrent density for wo3 and tio2 are relatively low which can be attributed to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes the photocurrent density of wo3 tio2 sio2 reached the highest value 1 2 μa cm2 under simulated solar irradiation when compared with individual wo3 and tio2 which can be due to the heterojunction of wo3 and tio2 that resulting in the efficient separation of electron hole pairs liu et al 2016 the separation efficiency of photo generated charge and carriers charge transfer resistance were investigated by analyzing the electrochemical impedance spectra eis fig 4f shows that the arc radius on eis nyquist plot of wo3 tio2 sio2 is smaller than that of wo3 and tio2 indicating that the separation efficiency and transfer rate of photogenerated electrons and holes are promoted for wo3 tio2 sio2 this result is in agreement with the photocurrent analysis 3 3 photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene fig 5 compares the adsorption performance and photocatalytic activity for degrading phenanthrene by various nanomaterials including neat tio2 tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 prepared in this study and a commercial tio2 p25 phenanthrene removal through adsorption in dark by all the materials was 5 generally adsorption of phenanthrene on photocatalyst is primarily due to π π interactions and hydrophobic effects zhao et al 2016 the prepared materials are rather hydrophilic due to their surface oh groups and inorganic skeletons thus they are not favorable for phenanthrene adsorption however the larger surface area of the wo3 tio2 sio2 provides a high probability for the collision and adsorption between phenanthrene molecules and the material surface thus promoting the occurrence of photocatalytic reactions of phenanthrene on the catalyst upon light irradiation the photocatalytic activity of various materials for phenanthrene degradation were fitted by first order kinetic parameters k 1 and compared in fig 5 and table s2 phenanthrene is relatively persistent and the direct photodegradation of phenanthrene under simulated solar light was negligible within 3 h tio2 is a well known uv active photocatalyst but with low visible light activity therefore the neat rutile tio2 prepared in this study showed the lowest photocatalytic activity k 1 0 0013 min 1 followed by the commercial tio2 p25 k 1 0 0024 min 1 evidently the tio2 sio2 heterojunction obtained much enhanced activity k 1 0 0109 min 1 wo3 tio2 sio2 had high k 1 value of 0 0171 min 1 which was 1 6 times of tio2 sio2 7 1 times of tio2 p25 and 13 2 times of tio2 rutile in addition wo3 tio2 sio2 showed high phenanthrene removal efficiency 95 0 at 3 h the low photocatalytic activity of the tio2 in this study can be due to the relatively low visible light activity the solar light only contains 5 uv and recombination of photo excited electron hole pairs zhao et al 2016 the deposition of tio2 on the surface of sio2 aerogel formed heterojunction structure which facilitated the separation of photo excited electron hole pairs lin et al 2017 thus promoted the photocatalytic activity of the materials the xrd analysis fig 4a also showed that the heterojunction kept highly active anatase tio2 under calcination at 800 c however the photocatalytic activity of tio2 sio2 was restrained due to their increased band gap which was derived from the difference in the energy levels of energy bands from tio2 and sio2 zhong et al 2012 the incorporation of wo3 to tio2 sio2 was capable to facilitate the charge transfer between the wo3 on tio2 and then inhibited the electron hole recombination in addition wo3 extended the light absorbance to longer wavelength leading to high utilization efficiency of solar light section 3 4 presents more detailed mechanisms on the enhanced photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 table 1 compares the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene with various literature reported photocatalysts under simulated solar light based on the first order rate constants k 1 and mass normalized k 1 for phenanthrene degradation the wo3 tio2 sio2 prepared in present study showed outstanding performances among various reported photocatalysts zhao s group developed a series of highly active metal or noble metal deposited titanate titania nanotubes and the pt 0 tnts and co tnts calcined at 600 c achieved 68 and 98 of phenanthrene removal in 10 h under simulated solar irradiation cai et al 2017a zhao et al 2016 fu et al 2018 reported the go tio2 sr oh 2 srco3 composite achieved 87 of phenanthrene removal after 6 h k 1 0 35 h 1 and mass normalized k 1 of 7 l g h with catalyst dosage of 0 05 g l we conducted a comparison study with wo3 tio2 sio2 dosage of 0 05 g l and which gives a comparable k 1 0 42 h 1 the relative low mass normalized k 1 2 06 l g h at high photocatalyst dosage is probably due to the rate limiting parameter of incident light intensity mukhopadhyay et al 2016 obtained only 52 of phenanthrene removal k 1 0 21 h 1 in 1 5 h by using zno tio2 au dosage of 2 0 g l to summarize the solar light facilitated photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene by these published works only demonstrated 4 41 of the phenanthrene degradation rate k 1 when compared with the result by using wo3 tio2 sio2 in this study 3 4 mechanisms of enhanced photocatalytic activity the uv vis drs spectra analysis in section 3 2 showed that the e g of wo3 tio2 sio2 was decreased by wo3 which is supposed to promote the visible light utilization efficiency herein the visible light activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 was further verified by comparing the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene with tio2 sio2 under visible light and solar light fig 6 and table s3 under visible light the k 1 value was 0 0021 and 0 0047 min 1 in the presence of tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 respectively indicating that the incorporation of wo3 increased the visible light activity of tio2 sio2 by 135 correspondingly when the photocatalytic activity of tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 was compared under solar irradiation the k 1 for phenanthrene degradation was only increased by 57 in terms of the removal efficiency the visible light is attributed to 33 8 and 58 8 of phenanthrene degradation for tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 respectively it is obvious incorporation of wo3 greatly enhanced visible light response the photogenerated h and reactive oxygen species ros e g oh o2 and h2o2 are mainly responsible for the photocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants cavalcante et al 2016 to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the photocatalysis process the contribution of photogenerated h and ros to phenanthrene degradation were evaluated by adding various scavengers the participation of photogenerated h in the photocatalysis reaction was assessed by using ao as h scavenger zhang et al 2013 ipa was used as a oh scavenger because of its high reaction rate constant with oxidants 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 and relatively low reactivity with reductants 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 teel and watts 2002 nan3 was applied to capture both oh rate constant 1 0 1010 m 1 s 1 and 1o2 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 fu et al 2018 the bq was used to detect the o2 radical owning to its ability to trap o2 with a high rate constant 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 cavalcante et al 2016 fig 7 a and b shows that the presence of ao resulted in a dramatic reduction of phenanthrene degradation and the rate constant was decreased by 42 2 compared with that without scavenger shown in table s4 it indicated that the photogenerated h played an important role in the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene by wo3 tio2 sio2 the photogenerated h can directly react with surface sorbed phenanthrene or convert h2o or surface oh to oh for indirect phenanthrene degradation processes the presence of ipa caused a dramatic decrease in the phenanthrene degradation efficiency by 50 9 suggesting that oh also played a key role however similar inhibitive effect of nan3 and ipa indicated that 1o2 played a negligible role in phenanthrene degradation the addition of bq caused a remarkable reduction of the phenanthrene degradation rate about 71 7 indicating that o2 radical played the most important role in the wo3 tio2 sio2 facilitated photodegradation of phenanthrene it has been widely reported that the o2 can not only directly break down organic pollutants but also further convert to oh ho2 and h2o2 to attack organic pollutants fu et al 2018 the epr technique was applied to further identify the presence of o2 and oh radicals in the wo3 tio2 sio2 reaction system under solar light the six characteristic peaks of dmpo o2 adducts and four characteristic peaks of dmpo oh are observed in fig 7c and d however no significant peaks appeared in dark there results directly confirm the production of o2 and oh in the photocatalysis process fig 8 depicts the key mechanisms for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 and the eqs 2 15 present the photocatalytic reactions during phenanthrene degradation the wo3 tio2 sio2 aerogel has large surface area which provides more sites for phenanthrene adsorption and availability of surface loaded photocatalysts tio2 wo3 under solar irradiation both tio2 and wo3 can generate e on the conduction band cb and the remaining part is valence band vb h eqs 2 3 the production of ros e g oh o2 and h2o2 are limited due to the low visible light activity of pristine tio2 moreover the photo excited electron hole pairs are prone to recombination cai et al 2017a zerjav et al 2017 the heterojunction of wo3 with e g 2 74 ev and tio2 narrows the e g of wo3 tio2 sio2 heterojunction and shifts the light absorption edge to the visible light region ma et al 2015 sotelo vazquez et al 2017 it is known that the energy level of the cb minimum e cb of tio2 and wo3 are 0 40 and 0 13 v vs nhe respectively huang et al 2013 shen et al 2016 the e g of tio2 and wo3 are 3 2 ev and 2 74 ev respectively thus the vb maxima of tio2 and wo3 are calculated as 2 80 and 2 87 v vs nhe respectively therefore for the combination of wo3 and tio2 in the composite material it is type ii heterojunction due to the staggered band levels of the two semiconductors where the interfacial charge transfer between them is facilitated the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers are promoted by the internal field and the recombination of electron hole pairs is reduced wang et al 2014 specifically for the wo3 tio2 sio2 the lower lying vb and cb of wo3 lead to transfer the photo excited electrons from cb of tio2 to wo3 and holes from the lower lying vb of wo3 to tio2 thus trapping the electrons or holes to retard their recombination eqs 4 5 riboni et al 2013 the photocurrent and eis analysis have revealed that the wo3 tio2 sio2 could more efficiently separate the photogenerated electron hole pairs and transfer the charge carrier faster than individual tio2 or wo3 as shown in fig 4e and f the electrons on cb of tio2 surface can react with molecular oxygen forming superoxide radicals o2 e0 o2 o2 0 13 ev vs nhe eq 6 driessen and grassian 1998 the majority of electrons that accumulated on the wo3 may react with molecular oxygen via the process in eq 7 in view of the similar standard reduction potential 0 13 ev of o2 h2o2 and the cb of wo3 the holes on vb of wo3 have relatively high reduction potential which can oxidize water molecules and surface oh into ros e g oh and h2o2 eqs 8 13 however the holes that migrate to the vb of tio2 owns lower reduction potential and become less likely to react with oh to form oh e 0 oh oh 2 40 ev vs nhe li et al 2018b these ros are partially responsible for degradation of phenanthrene eq 14 meanwhile the holes that accumulate on the surface of tio2 can directly attack phenanthrene to produce the excited phenanthrene cation radical phenanthrene and undergo further degradation via eq 15 kou et al 2009 or directly react with the surface sorbed phenanthrene therefore the wo3 tio2 sio2 efficiently improve the photoinduced charge transfer and separation and facilitate photocatalytic activity 2 tio2 hv tio2 e ti h ti 3 wo3 hv wo3 e w h w 4 wo3 e ti wo3 e ti electron

presents the proposed phenanthrene degradation pathway based on intermediates products identification oh and o2 were confirmed to be the primary ros in this system fig 8 fukui index f 0 indicates the active sites on phenanthrene molecule and these two radicals prefer to attack the sites with high f 0 values phenanthrene is a nonpolar compound with symmetrical structure and fukui index distribution is also axisymmetrical c7 and c8 sites with the highest fukui index f 0 0 103 are the most reactive sites which can accept radicals to form hydroxylated products phenanthrene a b including 9 phenanthrenol product a and 9 10 phenanthrenediol product b 9 10 phenanthrenedione product c was further formed through one electron oxidation of product b further radical attack on 9 10 phenanthrenedione lead to two pathways 1 ring opening to produce 1 1 biphenyl 2 2 dicarboxaldehyde product d and 2 ring restructuring to form products e and f product d is an important intermediate widely reported in phenanthrene degradation systems kou et al 2009 liu et al 2016 woo et al 2009 yu et al 2018 and phthalic acid product g was formed after bond breaking of product d further oxidation resulted in formation of small organic compounds e g cyclohexanols alkanoic acids maleic acids and alcohols and mineralization table s5 shows the real time abundance of the major intermediates along with their retention time rt and comprehensive toxicity products a c d and g are the most abundant intermediates along with the degradation of phenanthrene the major intermediates were accumulated in the first 20 min then decreased rapidly after reacting for 15 h no significant signals of phenanthrene and intermediates were observed the total organic carbon toc of the solution decreased from 0 47 mg l to 0 05 mg l detection limit of the toc analyzer after reacting for 20 h indicating that major part of the organics was mineralized within 20 h the acute toxicity developmental toxicity and bioaccumulation factor of phenanthrene and its degradation intermediates products were evaluated by using toxicity estimation software t e s t based on quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction as shown in fig 10 the ld50 of fathead minnow the concentration of chemical that causes 50 of fathead minnow to die after 96 h is 0 7 mg l for phenanthrene which can be categorized as very toxic however the hydroxylated products product a b and c are still very toxic especially for the di hydroxylated product b the toxicity is even higher than phenanthrene which is due to the higher toxicity of phenols than the non hydroxylated counterpart fallahtafti et al 2012 for the further oxidation intermediates the acute toxicity was greatly decreased due to the breaking of benzene ring but the ld50 is still considered as harmful even for the less toxic product i the 48 h tetrahymena pyriformis igc50 concentration of the tested chemical mg l that causes 50 growth inhibition to tetrahymena pyriformis after 48 h of products a b and c are 5 0 5 0 and 3 8 mg l respectively which are lower than phenanthrene 13 5 mg l indicating the higher growth inhibition effects of the hydroxylated intermediates the further oxidation of the hydroxylated intermediates derived the intermediates with lower igc50 indicating the higher degree oxidation of intermediates are required to eliminate their acute toxicity and growth inhibition effects figs 10c and d shows that the developmental toxicity of all intermediates was higher than phenanthrene while the bioaccumulation factor of degradation intermediates was decreased which is due to the lower lipophilicity of the hydroxylated intermediates the real time comprehensive toxicities of the major degradation intermediates were estimated by considering both acute toxicity and their concentration at various degradation durations as shown in table s5 although some degradation intermediates are more toxic than phenanthrene their accumulated amount is much lower than the degraded phenanthrene thus their comprehensive toxicity in the system is decreasing throughout the degradation process the overall toxicity estimation in this study reveal that the degradation of phenanthrene is accompanied by the formation of toxic intermediates therefore higher extent of oxidation or mineralization is required to guarantee the water safety after treatment many published works only focused on the degradation of parent pahs but neglected the elimination of intermediates during the photocatalysis process which can be misleading due to the toxicity of degradation intermediates and their persistent presence in the aqueous phase 3 6 reusability reusability is a critical parameter of photocatalysts for their cost effective application in environmental application based on the kinetic tests wo3 tio2 sio2 was much more effective than the commercial tio2 p25 and neat rutile in photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene the 3 h phenanthrene removal was 94 9 versus 33 1 therefore wo3 tio2 sio2 was further tested for its recovery performance or catalytic lifetime under solar light the separation performance of wo3 tio2 sio2 was evaluated by monitoring the gravitational sedimentation under still condition fig s3 shows that wo3 tio2 sio2 had much higher settleability than commercial tio2 p25 particles in aqueous phase for instance after gravitational sedimentation for 1 h 95 8 of wo3 tio2 sio2 was settled compared to only 1 5 for the commercial nano sized ca 20 30 nm tio2 p25 the good sedimentation performance was attributed to the large particle size of the sio2 aerogel as support and the high density of sio2 after calcination ρ water the excellent settling performance greatly eases recovery and reusing of the spent wo3 tio2 sio2 fig 11 presents phenanthrene photodegradation kinetics over five reuse cycles in the presence and absence of light the 3 h phenanthrene degradation showed no obvious drop after the first run both in the presence fig 11a and absence fig 11b of light and the phenanthrene removal efficiency was remained nearly identical even after five consecutive runs 91 3 and 94 0 of phenanthrene still could be removed even after five runs for light irradiated and dark immersed materials respectively table s6 specifically for the consecutive runs upon light irradiation the phenanthrene removal efficiency was only dropped from 96 9 to 91 3 after five runs the observation indicates that the photodegradation process can fully regenerate the catalyst granting it long lasting photocatalytic activity in addition the wo3 leaching in aqueous phase at neutral ph was below the detection limit 0 05 mg l of tungsten by icp oes analysis indicating high physicochemical stability of the catalyst moreover the tem characterization of wo3 tio2 sio2 before or after 5 consecutive photocatalytic reusing cycles reveal that the structure of the wo3 tio2 sio2 does not change significantly fig 2c and d the darker area presented in fig 2d is probably due to the aggregation of reused materials additionally eds spectra of wo3 tio2 sio2 materials before and after photocatalytic reaction showed similar tungsten percentage 1 5 which further confirms that no significant tungsten leaching occurred during the photocatalytic reaction similarly the 5 consecutive reusing cycles does not change the xrd patterns of wo3 tio2 sio2 as shown in fig s4 indicating the high stability of the anatase crystal structure for wo3 tio2 sio2 the specific surface area of the materials only decreased 4 after reusing after 5 consecutive photocatalytic cycles which may be due to the blocking of some pores by small particles and contaminants the above characterizations of reused materials demonstrated that the structure and properties of wo3 tio2 sio2 materials are relative stable it owns the potential for long term application with high photocatalytic activity the leaching of elements or dissolving of photocatalysts can decrease the photocatalytic activity of materials during the long term operation fig 11b presents the long term stability of the wo3 tio2 sio2 by testing its photocatalytic activity after soaking in aqueous phase for different duration as shown in table s6 the 3 h phenanthrene removal efficiency was decreased from 95 9 to 94 0 after soaking for 28 d the leached tungsten in the aqueous phase after 28 d soaking was not detectable by icp oes analysis there results further confirmed the high stability of the wo3 tio2 sio2 material which promised the excellent reusing performance of the material in water treatment application 4 conclusions a new class of wo3 tio2 sio2 aerogel photocatalyst was synthesized via facile sol gel and calcination the prepared photocatalyst exhibited 7 times higher photocatalytic activity for phenanthrene degradation than commercial tio2 p25 under simulated solar light the material characterizations showed that the tio2 and wo3 were well dispersed on the highly porous sio2 aerogel and retained large surface area 400 m2 g the large surface area of material facilitated adsorption of organic pollutants and the loading of tio2 wo3 nanoparticles provided abundant photocatalytic active sites for oxidizing organic pollutants the deposition of wo3 narrowed the e g of wo3 tio2 sio2 and facilitated the charge separation thus promoted the visible light absorption and thus enhanced the photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 o2 and oh were identified to play the key roles in the photocatalysis process the 9 phenanthrenol 9 10 phenanthrenediol and 9 10 phenanthrenedione were found as the primary intermediates during the phenanthrene degradation and the degradation pathway of phenanthrene was proposed based on identified intermediates and dft calculation the qsar analysis revealed that some degradation intermediates still remained high toxicity so longer reaction time was required to mineralize these toxic intermediates the wo3 tio2 sio2 was amenable to efficient separation from aqueous phase through gravity sedimentation and kept high photocatalytic activity even after several reuse cycles considering the strong ros i e oh produced by wo3 tio2 sio2 through photocatalysis the developed photocatalyst can be applied to other pahs or alkylated phenanthrene overall wo3 tio2 sio2 represents a significant step forward in development of novel photocatalysts for water treatment application and the new material appears promising for cost

18657,the global energy crisis and water pollution drive the researchers to develop highly effective and less energy intensive water purification technologies in this study a highly active wo3 tio2 sio2 nanocomposite was synthesized and used for photocatalytic degradation of persistent organic pollutants under simulated solar light the optimum wo3 tio2 sio2 prepared with 2 wt wo3 loading and calcination at 800 c exhibited higher photocatalytic activity as the rate constant k 1 for phenanthrene degradation was 7 1 times of that for the commercial tio2 p25 the extremely large specific surface area 400 m2 g of wo3 tio2 sio2 afforded it with enlarged pollutants adsorption performance and abundant active surface sites the heterojunction of anatase with sio2 as well as loading of wo3 decreased the band gap energy e g of tio2 which extended the utilization spectrum of tio2 to visible region formation of ti o si band indicated the excess charges can cause brønsted acidity due to the absorption of protons to compensate the charges moreover the migration of photo excited electrons from the conduction band of anatase to wo3 and holes in the opposite direction restrained the electron hole recombination the photocatalytic degradation mechanism and pathway for phenanthrene degradation were proposed based on experimental analysis and density functional theory dft calculation and the toxicities of the degradation intermediates were evaluated by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis wo3 tio2 sio2 also showed good separation settling performance and high stability our work is expected to offer new insight into the photocatalytic mechanism for wo3 tio2 and sio2 based heterojunctions and rational design and synthesis of highly efficient photocatalysts for environmental application graphical abstract image 1 keywords photocatalysis wo3 tio2 sio2 solar light phenanthrene toxicity 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a group of persistent organic pollutants pops that derive from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels industrial production oil release and natural sources yu et al 2018 the chronic exposure to pahs at even low concentration can cause long lasting damage such as infertility cancer and neurotoxicity to human beings qiao et al 2014a the toxicity of pahs can be amplified by their bioaccumulation in tissue of human bodies due to their high hydrophobicity yu et al 2018 16 pahs have been listed as priority pollutants by u s environmental protection agency epa due to their high toxicity fu et al 2018 pahs are frequently detected in the surface water in china previous researchers studied the occurrence source and fate of pahs in haihe river system in china qiao et al 2014a b and found that the wastewater treatment plants wwtps could not effectively remove pahs therefore the wwtps effluents contribute to ca 68 5 89 4 of total pahs in receiving rivers qiao et al 2014a the pahs concentration in several studied river water is in the range of 0 16 1 20 μg l in dissolved phase and 1 56 79 38 μg g in particulate phase qiao et al 2014b therefore removal of pahs from water phase is still a current focus in the environmental research area phenanthrene is one of the most detected pahs in water environments with relatively high concentration and it is persistent and hard to degrade due to its very stable three ring structure zeng s group conducted a survey for pahs in 42 freshwaters throughout china where the phenanthrene is shown as one of the most abundant parent pahs yao et al 2017 a nationwide study of pahs in drinking water also revealed that the phenanthrene is the most abundant individual pahs in tap water and which contributed to 33 of the total 16 usepa listed priority pahs moreover the 3 ring pahs e g phenanthrene are more difficult to remove than other pahs in drinking water treatment process zhang et al 2019 various methods have been applied to remove pahs and other organic contaminants from waters such as adsorption biodegradation chemical oxidation etc for example yu et al 2018 applied a novel citric acid chelated fe ii activated persulfate percarbonate system to remove phenanthrene in aqueous phase the chelated complex increased fe ii solubility and the system could produce large amount of so4 and oh to achieved high phenanthrene removal efficiency at optimal persulfate percarbonate ratio however the inherent limitations of either low efficiency or high energy chemical consumption prevent their applications kou et al 2009 the photocatalytic degradation of contaminants by using solar light is a green and sustainable technology which has attracted great attention in recent years liu et al 2017 tio2 is the most applied photocatalyst due to its low cost nontoxicity high activity under uv but low visible light utilization inhibits its application under natural solar light cai et al 2018 riboni et al 2013 the coupling of wo3 and tio2 can retard the electron hole pairs recombination and shift the light absorption to visible light region which shows promising potential for photocatalytic degradation of contaminants riboni et al 2013 zerjav et al 2017 moreover the surface acidity that caused by wo3 loading has been recently found to enhance the pollutants adsorption and promote oh production rimoldi et al 2019 loading tio2 on silica aerogel can improve the surface area and stability of tio2 which provides the material with more accessible sites for pollutants adsorption and photocatalytic reaction sun et al 2013 therefore the incorporation of wo3 in tio2 sio2 heterojunction is a strategy to obtain ideal photocatalyst however to the best of our knowledge only few studies have studied the wo3 tio2 sio2 composite as photocatalyst but the contribution and mechanisms of the extended visible light activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 is not well investigated bao et al 2003 lin et al 2017 shi et al 2016 for example lin et al 2017 studied the wo3 tio2 sio2 as photocatalyst to remove acetaminophen under uv vis illumination the removal efficiency under various ph and catalyst dosage was well studied but the generation of radicals was not measured and the contribution of wo3 on the promoted visible light activity was not evaluated in addition from the aspect of application in water treatment engineering it is important to systematically evaluating the reusability of the material and the separation performance of the materials to this end a wo3 deposited tio2 sio2 nanocomposite wo3 tio2 sio2 was synthesized by adopting the silica aerogel as support to significantly increase the surface area and stability of the photocatalyst the enhanced solar light photocatalytic activity and underlying mechanisms of this material were comprehensively investigated and explained via the photodegradation experiments on phenanthrene a most abundant and resistant pah additionally the ecotoxicity of the phenanthrene and its degradation intermediates were evaluated to assess the environmental risks of the treated wastewater moreover the recovery property stability and recyclability of the new developed material were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials silica aerogel enova aerogel ic 3100 with particle size of 2 40 μm surface area of 600 800 m3 g and pore diameter at ca 20 nm was acquired from aerogel

reagent corporation shanghai china phenanthrene was obtained from alfa aesar ma usa all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and used as received 2 2 photocatalysts preparation the wo3 tio2 sio2 was synthesized via sol gel method using silica aerogel as support followed by calcination scheme 1 briefly 1 17 g of silica aerogel was dispersed in 100 ml of methanol and magnetically stirred for 10 min then 5 ml of tbot and predetermined amount of wcl6 were added afterwards a mixture of deionized di water 0 26 ml and hno3 0 035 ml was added dropwise to start the hydrolysis and then kept stirring for another 2 h in this step the formed ti oh 4 and w oh 6 were deposited on the hydroxyl groups abundant silica surface following the hydrolysis the solvents was vented at 265 c and the samples were washed by methanol and dried at 80 c for 4 h the resulting composites were then calcined at 800 c with open air for 3 h to convert the ti oh 4 and w oh 6 to well crystalized tio2 and wo3 nanoparticles in selected experiments the wcl6 with predetermined mass was added to achieve different tungsten to tio2 sio2 weight ratios 0 1 2 and 3 wt at the optimum tungsten ratio calcination at temperatures of 400 600 and 800 c evaluated moreover neat tio2 was prepared with the same procedures but without adding silica aerogel and tungsten and neat tio2 sio2 was synthesized without w loading details on material characterizations are presented in test s1 of the supplementary data sd 2 3 photocatalytic performance tests fig s1 in the sd depicts the experimental setup which included a photo reactor 250 ml with cooling system and a 300 w xenon ozone free short arc lamp pls sxe 300 beijing perfect light co ltd with an am1 5 filter the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene was performed according to the previous described procedures cai et al 2017a and in controlled conditions phenanthrene concentration 500 μg l photocatalyst dosage 0 5 g l ph 7 0 0 2 temperature 25 0 2 c and solar intensity 100 mw cm2 the visible light photocatalytic activity of catalysts was evaluated by applying a uv cut off filter to remove uv irradiation 420 nm fig s2 the contributions of various active species i e singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide o2 hydroxyl oh and holes h to photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene were evaluated by applying selective radical scavengers specifically ao at 700 mg l was used for quenching h ipa at 600 mg l for oh and bq at 80 mg l for o2 cai et al 2017b cavalcante et al 2016 nan3 at 200 mg l was used for 1o2 and oh quenching which is the most commonly applied scavenger for 1o2 k 7 8 108 m 1s 1 and oh k 1 4 1010 m 1s 1 during photocatalysis reaction chen et al 2015 and thus the role of 1o2 can be explored in addition the presence of oh and o2 radicals in the reaction was recorded by electronic paramagnetic resonance epr bruker a300 germany the oh and o2 were captured by dmpo in deionized water and methanol respectively phenanthrene concentration was analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system with uv detector 1260 series agilent usa cai et al 2017a the degradation intermediates and products were extracted

text s2 of the sd the ecotoxicity of phenanthrene and its degradation intermediates were assessed by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar method by applying the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t 2 4 reusability and stability evaluation the methods on settling property reusability and long term stability evaluation of the photocatalysts are shown in text s3 of the sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimum synthesis conditions of wo3 tio2 sio2 the photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 prepared with different wo3 loadings 0 3 wt with a fixed calcination temperature of 800 c and calcination temperatures 400 600 and 800 c with a fixed wo3 loading of 2 wt were evaluated in terms of the phenanthrene degradation under simulated solar light the first order kinetic model was used to interpret the phenanthrene degradation kinetic data fu et al 2018 1 ln c 0 c t k 1 t where c 0 and c t are the phenanthrene concentrations μg l at initial and time t min and k 1 is the first order rate constant min 1 fig 1 shows the photocatalytic activity of various materials for phenanthrene degradation adsorption of phenanthrene without light was relatively low 5 for the tested materials the first order kinetic model could well interpret the experimental data r 2 0 9 table s1 obviously increasing the wo3 loadings from 0 to 1 and 2 wt increased the rate constant k 1 from 0 0110 to 0 0132 and 0 176 min 1 respectively fig 1a and table s1 however further increasing wo3 loading to 3 wt decreased the k 1 to 0 0147 min 1 consequently the optimum wo3 loading was 2 wt and the wo3 ratio is of crucial importance for the photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 the incorporation of wo3 can affect the photocatalytic activity of tio2 in the following aspects 1 the involvement of wo3 in tio2 can induce the reduction of e g of the catalysts which extends the light absorbance to longer wavelengths thus gains higher photocatalytic activity under solar light shen et al 2016 2 the wo3 presents as a charge separation center in the wo3 tio2 heterojunction and promotes the photocatalytic activity however excessive wo3 can form an amorphous layer on tio2 surface which behaves as charge carrier recombination centers to diminish the photo excited electrons holes 3 the wo3 amorphous layer can cover the active surface of tio2 and hinder its light absorbance thereby reducing the photocatalytic activity zerjav et al 2017 increasing the calcination temperature from 400 to 600 and 800 c increased the k 1 value from 0 0034 to 0 0077 and 0 0173 min 1 respectively fig 1b and table s1 the better activity of the wo3 tio2 sio2 synthesized at higher calcination temperature mainly results from the formation of anatase type tio2 which exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity than amorphous tio2 tio2 nanoparticles in the composite materials generally has three forms including amorphous tio2 anatase and rutile and phase transformation occurs at different temperatures pure tio2 prepared via the sol gel method usually presents in an amorphous phase and the calcination i e 400 c leads to the formation of anatase which has high photocatalytic activity further increasing the calcination temperature to 800 c will transform anatase to rutile which behaves lower activity than anatase cai et al 2017a for the tio2 phase in the composite the introducing of other components will increase the necessary temperature for the crystallization of anatase and subsequent transformation to rutile phase anderson and bard 1997 in the as prepared wo3 tio2 sio2 at relatively high calcination temperature the sio2 support also can stabilize the anatase through the ti o si interface the tio2 atoms at the interface are substituted into the tetrahedral sio2 lattice to form tetrahedral ti sites the interaction between the tetrahedral ti sites and octahedral ti species in the anatase is considered to prevent the transformation to rutile anderson and bard 1997 thus the wo3 tio2 sio2 calcined at 800 c achieved better anatase crystallization therefore wo3 tio2 sio2 with wo3 weight ratio of 2 wt and calcined at 800 c was used as the optimum photocatalyst 3 2 material characterizations the commercial sio2 synthesized tio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 prepared under optimum condition were characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem fig 2 evidently the sio2 aerogel made by interconnected sio2 networks showed no evident lattice fringes fig 2a indicating that the sio2 was composed of amorphous silica particles the tio2 synthesized by the so gel method was observed as agglomerated particles with the diameter of 20 40 nm fig 2b fig 2c describes the morphology of wo3 tio2 sio2 before photocatalytic reaction it is evident that the tio2 nanoparticles were well crystallized with random crystallographic orientations and dispersed on the sio2 aerogel surface the space of lattice fringe of 0 34 nm is attributed to the facet of anatase 101 indicating the formation of anatase cai et al 2015 the particle size of loaded tio2 was decreased to ca 5 15 nm compared with the neat tio2 according to liu et al s research the optimal crystallite size of tio2 is 10 nm for photocatalytic reaction liu et al 2008 therefore the decreased tio2 particle size in wo3 tio2 sio2 composite would play an important role in promoting the photocatalytic activity no significant difference in the morphology of wo3 tio2 sio2 after photocatalytic reaction can be observed fig 2d the energy dispersive x ray spectra eds reveal that the main elements of wo3 tio2 sio2 were si ti o and w fig 2e indicating that w was successfully deposited on tio2 sio2 there are no wo3 particles observed in tem images due to the relatively small crystalline size of wo3 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps survey spectra indicates w ti si and o are the main elements of wo3 tio2 sio2 fig 3 a with a weight ratio of 1 5 23 8 33 10 and 41 6 respectively two major characteristic peaks of ti 2p at 459 0 and 464 8 ev for neat tio2 are assigned to the core levels of ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 respectively fig 3b for wo3 tio2 sio2 the two ti 2p characteristic peaks shifted to the higher energy level indicating that the loading of wo3 and sio2 interfered with the energy level of tio2 due to the mixed crystal structure of sio2 tio2 and wo3 shen et al 2016 the spectrum of w 4f of the wo3 tio2 sio2 in fig 3c shows that the characteristic peaks at 36 2 ev and 38 2 ev correspond to the core levels of w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 respectively li et al 2018b the binding energy value of the si 2p is centered at 103 7 ev fig 3d which is the characteristic of the si o bonding of sio2 in the x ray diffraction xrd patterns fig 4 the sio2 aerogel was amorphous with no obvious diffraction peaks however for neat tio2 the calcination process at 800 c completely converted tio2 into rutile phase jcpds 21 1276 the heterojunction of tio2 sio2 inhibited the conversion of tio2 from anatase to rutile which is revealed by all the diffraction peaks assigned to anatase jcpds 21 1272 in tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 cai et al 2017a previous studies reported that the existence of sio2 inhibited the crystallization of tio2 at low temperature while retarded conversion of tio2 from anatase to rutile at the high temperature feng et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 in our study the domination of anatase crystallite phase in tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 indicated that the new materials maintained high photocatalytic activity when compared with the pure tio2 due to the coating of anatase no diffraction peaks of wo3 can be found in the wo3 tio2 sio2 pattern due to low content 2 wt and small crystalline size of wo3 zerjav et al 2017 the measured brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of wo3 tio2 sio2 was 429 m2 g as shown in fig 4b which was lower than that of sio2 aerogel 700 m2 g the decreased surface area is because the attached tio2 and wo3 blocked pores of the sio2 aerogels and the aerogel structure partially destroyed during calcination at 800 c however the surface area of our prepared material was still much higher than that of previously reported wo3 tio2 shen et al 2016 the large surface area provided by sio2 aerogel support is favorable for efficient degradation of organics 1 the large surface area and hydroxyl groups on silica favor adsorption of organics onto the surface of catalysts 2 the loading of tio2 on the surface of sio2 aerogel greatly enlarged its availability for the photocatalytic reaction 3 the transparent sio2 aerogel can scatter light to tio2 without absorb its energy hendrix et al 2015 in the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra fig 4c the broad absorption peaks at 3420 and 1633 cm 1 were assigned to the stretching vibrations of surface hydroxyl groups o h and the bending vibrations of sorbed water molecule h o h respectively cai et al 2017a zhang et al 2016 it is worth noting that the extra hydroxyl groups on the surface of catalysts provided acid sites which are beneficial for catalytic properties hendrix et al 2015 in addition the coordination number for ti atoms is 6 in crystalline titania ti o6 and for si atoms in sio2 is 4 therefore the introducing of ti atoms on sio2 to form tetrahedral structure will produce negative two charges per ti atom and the excess charges can cause brønsted acidity due to the absorption of protons to compensate the charges hendrix et al 2015 the enhanced acidity of wo3 tio2 sio2 also favored the photocatalytic activity the low frequency absorption in the region of 500 700 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of ti o ti yang et al 2013 the ftir spectra of pure sio2 tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 showed a similar shape the absorption peak at ca 1080 and 460 cm 1 correspond to si o si bending vibration and stretching vibration respectively zhang et al 2016 the peak at 958 cm 1 for tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 was due to the si o ti vibration zhang et al 2016 which demonstrates the interaction between si and ti atoms and confirms the formation of tio2 sio2 heterojunction fig 4d presents the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs of various materials and the e g values were calculated according to the kubelka munk method feng et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 the measured e g for tio2 was 3 1 ev with a light absorbance edge of 398 nm however a slightly broadened e g 3 2 ev was obtained for tio2 sio2 introducing of wo3 into tio2 sio2 decreased the e g to 3 0 ev xrd analysis indicated the tio2 synthesized in this study was primary rutile which had lower e g 3 1 ev than anatase 3 2 ev in addition the photocatalytic activity of rutile is much lower than that of anatase due to its shorter lifetime of photoexcited electron hole pairs zhang et al 2014 the synthesized tio2 sio2 demonstrated an increased e g compared with tio2 rutile indicating relatively low visible light utilization efficiency of tio2 sio2 composite three aspects can be responsible for the enlarged bandgap 1 the anatase with larger e g is presented in tio2 sio2 2 the decreased crystal size of anatase induced the quantum size effect leading to a larger e g of tio2 the tem images revealed that the particle size of tio2 on the sio2 surface was 9 nm 3 the difference in energy levels of the energy bands from tio2 and energy bands from sio2 on the interface lin et al 2017 wo3 tio2 sio2 exhibited the lower e g 3 0 ev and higher absorbance in the visible light region which is supposed to exhibit higher photocatalytic activity under visible irradiation the wo3 has a e g of 2 74 ev and behaves wide range of light absorbance sotelo vazquez et al 2017 therefore the involvement of wo3 into tio2 sio2 decreases the e g of wo3 tio2 sio2 and incrementally shifted the absorption edge toward higher wavelength this shift was even sufficient to trigger the electron hole separation of the wo3 tio2 sio2 by visible light 400 nm therefore a broader range of wavelengths can be absorbed and utilized by the wo3 tio2 sio2 the decreasing of e g via wo3 tio2 heterojunction had been observed by other authors li et al 2018b zerjav et al 2017 where the adsorption edge of wo3 loaded tio2 shifted toward higher wavelength and even reached the visible light region fig 4e shows the transient photocurrent responses of wo3 tio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 electrodes under intermittent light illumination the photocurrent response is reversible as the illumination was turned off and on the photocurrent density for wo3 and tio2 are relatively low which can be attributed to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes the photocurrent density of wo3 tio2 sio2 reached the highest value 1 2 μa cm2 under simulated solar irradiation when compared with individual wo3 and tio2 which can be due to the heterojunction of wo3 and tio2 that resulting in the efficient separation of electron hole pairs liu et al 2016 the separation efficiency of photo generated charge and carriers charge transfer resistance were investigated by analyzing the electrochemical impedance spectra eis fig 4f shows that the arc radius on eis nyquist plot of wo3 tio2 sio2 is smaller than that of wo3 and tio2 indicating that the separation efficiency and transfer rate of photogenerated electrons and holes are promoted for wo3 tio2 sio2 this result is in agreement with the photocurrent analysis 3 3 photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene fig 5 compares the adsorption performance and photocatalytic activity for degrading phenanthrene by various nanomaterials including neat tio2 tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 prepared in this study and a commercial tio2 p25 phenanthrene removal through adsorption in dark by all the materials was 5 generally adsorption of phenanthrene on photocatalyst is primarily due to π π interactions and hydrophobic effects zhao et al 2016 the prepared materials are rather hydrophilic due to their surface oh groups and inorganic skeletons thus they are not favorable for phenanthrene adsorption however the larger surface area of the wo3 tio2 sio2 provides a high probability for the collision and adsorption between phenanthrene molecules and the material surface thus promoting the occurrence of photocatalytic reactions of phenanthrene on the catalyst upon light irradiation the photocatalytic activity of various materials for phenanthrene degradation were fitted by first order kinetic parameters k 1 and compared in fig 5 and table s2 phenanthrene is relatively persistent and the direct photodegradation of phenanthrene under simulated solar light was negligible within 3 h tio2 is a well known uv active photocatalyst but with low visible light activity therefore the neat rutile tio2 prepared in this study showed the lowest photocatalytic activity k 1 0 0013 min 1 followed by the commercial tio2 p25 k 1 0 0024 min 1 evidently the tio2 sio2 heterojunction obtained much enhanced activity k 1 0 0109 min 1 wo3 tio2 sio2 had high k 1 value of 0 0171 min 1 which was 1 6 times of tio2 sio2 7 1 times of tio2 p25 and 13 2 times of tio2 rutile in addition wo3 tio2 sio2 showed high phenanthrene removal efficiency 95 0 at 3 h the low photocatalytic activity of the tio2 in this study can be due to the relatively low visible light activity the solar light only contains 5 uv and recombination of photo excited electron hole pairs zhao et al 2016 the deposition of tio2 on the surface of sio2 aerogel formed heterojunction structure which facilitated the separation of photo excited electron hole pairs lin et al 2017 thus promoted the photocatalytic activity of the materials the xrd analysis fig 4a also showed that the heterojunction kept highly active anatase tio2 under calcination at 800 c however the photocatalytic activity of tio2 sio2 was restrained due to their increased band gap which was derived from the difference in the energy levels of energy bands from tio2 and sio2 zhong et al 2012 the incorporation of wo3 to tio2 sio2 was capable to facilitate the charge transfer between the wo3 on tio2 and then inhibited the electron hole recombination in addition wo3 extended the light absorbance to longer wavelength leading to high utilization efficiency of solar light section 3 4 presents more detailed mechanisms on the enhanced photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 table 1 compares the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene with various literature reported photocatalysts under simulated solar light based on the first order rate constants k 1 and mass normalized k 1 for phenanthrene degradation the wo3 tio2 sio2 prepared in present study showed outstanding performances among various reported photocatalysts zhao s group developed a series of highly active metal or noble metal deposited titanate titania nanotubes and the pt 0 tnts and co tnts calcined at 600 c achieved 68 and 98 of phenanthrene removal in 10 h under simulated solar irradiation cai et al 2017a zhao et al 2016 fu et al 2018 reported the go tio2 sr oh 2 srco3 composite achieved 87 of phenanthrene removal after 6 h k 1 0 35 h 1 and mass normalized k 1 of 7 l g h with catalyst dosage of 0 05 g l we conducted a comparison study with wo3 tio2 sio2 dosage of 0 05 g l and which gives a comparable k 1 0 42 h 1 the relative low mass normalized k 1 2 06 l g h at high photocatalyst dosage is probably due to the rate limiting parameter of incident light intensity mukhopadhyay et al 2016 obtained only 52 of phenanthrene removal k 1 0 21 h 1 in 1 5 h by using zno tio2 au dosage of 2 0 g l to summarize the solar light facilitated photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene by these published works only demonstrated 4 41 of the phenanthrene degradation rate k 1 when compared with the result by using wo3 tio2 sio2 in this study 3 4 mechanisms of enhanced photocatalytic activity the uv vis drs spectra analysis in section 3 2 showed that the e g of wo3 tio2 sio2 was decreased by wo3 which is supposed to promote the visible light utilization efficiency herein the visible light activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 was further verified by comparing the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene with tio2 sio2 under visible light and solar light fig 6 and table s3 under visible light the k 1 value was 0 0021 and 0 0047 min 1 in the presence of tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 respectively indicating that the incorporation of wo3 increased the visible light activity of tio2 sio2 by 135 correspondingly when the photocatalytic activity of tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 was compared under solar irradiation the k 1 for phenanthrene degradation was only increased by 57 in terms of the removal efficiency the visible light is attributed to 33 8 and 58 8 of phenanthrene degradation for tio2 sio2 and wo3 tio2 sio2 respectively it is obvious incorporation of wo3 greatly enhanced visible light response the photogenerated h and reactive oxygen species ros e g oh o2 and h2o2 are mainly responsible for the photocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants cavalcante et al 2016 to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the photocatalysis process the contribution of photogenerated h and ros to phenanthrene degradation were evaluated by adding various scavengers the participation of photogenerated h in the photocatalysis reaction was assessed by using ao as h scavenger zhang et al 2013 ipa was used as a oh scavenger because of its high reaction rate constant with oxidants 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 and relatively low reactivity with reductants 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 teel and watts 2002 nan3 was applied to capture both oh rate constant 1 0 1010 m 1 s 1 and 1o2 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 fu et al 2018 the bq was used to detect the o2 radical owning to its ability to trap o2 with a high rate constant 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 cavalcante et al 2016 fig 7 a and b shows that the presence of ao resulted in a dramatic reduction of phenanthrene degradation and the rate constant was decreased by 42 2 compared with that without scavenger shown in table s4 it indicated that the photogenerated h played an important role in the photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene by wo3 tio2 sio2 the photogenerated h can directly react with surface sorbed phenanthrene or convert h2o or surface oh to oh for indirect phenanthrene degradation processes the presence of ipa caused a dramatic decrease in the phenanthrene degradation efficiency by 50 9 suggesting that oh also played a key role however similar inhibitive effect of nan3 and ipa indicated that 1o2 played a negligible role in phenanthrene degradation the addition of bq caused a remarkable reduction of the phenanthrene degradation rate about 71 7 indicating that o2 radical played the most important role in the wo3 tio2 sio2 facilitated photodegradation of phenanthrene it has been widely reported that the o2 can not only directly break down organic pollutants but also further convert to oh ho2 and h2o2 to attack organic pollutants fu et al 2018 the epr technique was applied to further identify the presence of o2 and oh radicals in the wo3 tio2 sio2 reaction system under solar light the six characteristic peaks of dmpo o2 adducts and four characteristic peaks of dmpo oh are observed in fig 7c and d however no significant peaks appeared in dark there results directly confirm the production of o2 and oh in the photocatalysis process fig 8 depicts the key mechanisms for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 and the eqs 2 15 present the photocatalytic reactions during phenanthrene degradation the wo3 tio2 sio2 aerogel has large surface area which provides more sites for phenanthrene adsorption and availability of surface loaded photocatalysts tio2 wo3 under solar irradiation both tio2 and wo3 can generate e on the conduction band cb and the remaining part is valence band vb h eqs 2 3 the production of ros e g oh o2 and h2o2 are limited due to the low visible light activity of pristine tio2 moreover the photo excited electron hole pairs are prone to recombination cai et al 2017a zerjav et al 2017 the heterojunction of wo3 with e g 2 74 ev and tio2 narrows the e g of wo3 tio2 sio2 heterojunction and shifts the light absorption edge to the visible light region ma et al 2015 sotelo vazquez et al 2017 it is known that the energy level of the cb minimum e cb of tio2 and wo3 are 0 40 and 0 13 v vs nhe respectively huang et al 2013 shen et al 2016 the e g of tio2 and wo3 are 3 2 ev and 2 74 ev respectively thus the vb maxima of tio2 and wo3 are calculated as 2 80 and 2 87 v vs nhe respectively therefore for the combination of wo3 and tio2 in the composite material it is type ii heterojunction due to the staggered band levels of the two semiconductors where the interfacial charge transfer between them is facilitated the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers are promoted by the internal field and the recombination of electron hole pairs is reduced wang et al 2014 specifically for the wo3 tio2 sio2 the lower lying vb and cb of wo3 lead to transfer the photo excited electrons from cb of tio2 to wo3 and holes from the lower lying vb of wo3 to tio2 thus trapping the electrons or holes to retard their recombination eqs 4 5 riboni et al 2013 the photocurrent and eis analysis have revealed that the wo3 tio2 sio2 could more efficiently separate the photogenerated electron hole pairs and transfer the charge carrier faster than individual tio2 or wo3 as shown in fig 4e and f the electrons on cb of tio2 surface can react with molecular oxygen forming superoxide radicals o2 e0 o2 o2 0 13 ev vs nhe eq 6 driessen and grassian 1998 the majority of electrons that accumulated on the wo3 may react with molecular oxygen via the process in eq 7 in view of the similar standard reduction potential 0 13 ev of o2 h2o2 and the cb of wo3 the holes on vb of wo3 have relatively high reduction potential which can oxidize water molecules and surface oh into ros e g oh and h2o2 eqs 8 13 however the holes that migrate to the vb of tio2 owns lower reduction potential and become less likely to react with oh to form oh e 0 oh oh 2 40 ev vs nhe li et al 2018b these ros are partially responsible for degradation of phenanthrene eq 14 meanwhile the holes that accumulate on the surface of tio2 can directly attack phenanthrene to produce the excited phenanthrene cation radical phenanthrene and undergo further degradation via eq 15 kou et al 2009 or directly react with the surface sorbed phenanthrene therefore the wo3 tio2 sio2 efficiently improve the photoinduced charge transfer and separation and facilitate photocatalytic activity 2 tio2 hv tio2 e ti h ti 3 wo3 hv wo3 e w h w 4 wo3 e ti wo3 e ti electron

presents the proposed phenanthrene degradation pathway based on intermediates products identification oh and o2 were confirmed to be the primary ros in this system fig 8 fukui index f 0 indicates the active sites on phenanthrene molecule and these two radicals prefer to attack the sites with high f 0 values phenanthrene is a nonpolar compound with symmetrical structure and fukui index distribution is also axisymmetrical c7 and c8 sites with the highest fukui index f 0 0 103 are the most reactive sites which can accept radicals to form hydroxylated products phenanthrene a b including 9 phenanthrenol product a and 9 10 phenanthrenediol product b 9 10 phenanthrenedione product c was further formed through one electron oxidation of product b further radical attack on 9 10 phenanthrenedione lead to two pathways 1 ring opening to produce 1 1 biphenyl 2 2 dicarboxaldehyde product d and 2 ring restructuring to form products e and f product d is an important intermediate widely reported in phenanthrene degradation systems kou et al 2009 liu et al 2016 woo et al 2009 yu et al 2018 and phthalic acid product g was formed after bond breaking of product d further oxidation resulted in formation of small organic compounds e g cyclohexanols alkanoic acids maleic acids and alcohols and mineralization table s5 shows the real time abundance of the major intermediates along with their retention time rt and comprehensive toxicity products a c d and g are the most abundant intermediates along with the degradation of phenanthrene the major intermediates were accumulated in the first 20 min then decreased rapidly after reacting for 15 h no significant signals of phenanthrene and intermediates were observed the total organic carbon toc of the solution decreased from 0 47 mg l to 0 05 mg l detection limit of the toc analyzer after reacting for 20 h indicating that major part of the organics was mineralized within 20 h the acute toxicity developmental toxicity and bioaccumulation factor of phenanthrene and its degradation intermediates products were evaluated by using toxicity estimation software t e s t based on quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction as shown in fig 10 the ld50 of fathead minnow the concentration of chemical that causes 50 of fathead minnow to die after 96 h is 0 7 mg l for phenanthrene which can be categorized as very toxic however the hydroxylated products product a b and c are still very toxic especially for the di hydroxylated product b the toxicity is even higher than phenanthrene which is due to the higher toxicity of phenols than the non hydroxylated counterpart fallahtafti et al 2012 for the further oxidation intermediates the acute toxicity was greatly decreased due to the breaking of benzene ring but the ld50 is still considered as harmful even for the less toxic product i the 48 h tetrahymena pyriformis igc50 concentration of the tested chemical mg l that causes 50 growth inhibition to tetrahymena pyriformis after 48 h of products a b and c are 5 0 5 0 and 3 8 mg l respectively which are lower than phenanthrene 13 5 mg l indicating the higher growth inhibition effects of the hydroxylated intermediates the further oxidation of the hydroxylated intermediates derived the intermediates with lower igc50 indicating the higher degree oxidation of intermediates are required to eliminate their acute toxicity and growth inhibition effects figs 10c and d shows that the developmental toxicity of all intermediates was higher than phenanthrene while the bioaccumulation factor of degradation intermediates was decreased which is due to the lower lipophilicity of the hydroxylated intermediates the real time comprehensive toxicities of the major degradation intermediates were estimated by considering both acute toxicity and their concentration at various degradation durations as shown in table s5 although some degradation intermediates are more toxic than phenanthrene their accumulated amount is much lower than the degraded phenanthrene thus their comprehensive toxicity in the system is decreasing throughout the degradation process the overall toxicity estimation in this study reveal that the degradation of phenanthrene is accompanied by the formation of toxic intermediates therefore higher extent of oxidation or mineralization is required to guarantee the water safety after treatment many published works only focused on the degradation of parent pahs but neglected the elimination of intermediates during the photocatalysis process which can be misleading due to the toxicity of degradation intermediates and their persistent presence in the aqueous phase 3 6 reusability reusability is a critical parameter of photocatalysts for their cost effective application in environmental application based on the kinetic tests wo3 tio2 sio2 was much more effective than the commercial tio2 p25 and neat rutile in photocatalytic degradation of phenanthrene the 3 h phenanthrene removal was 94 9 versus 33 1 therefore wo3 tio2 sio2 was further tested for its recovery performance or catalytic lifetime under solar light the separation performance of wo3 tio2 sio2 was evaluated by monitoring the gravitational sedimentation under still condition fig s3 shows that wo3 tio2 sio2 had much higher settleability than commercial tio2 p25 particles in aqueous phase for instance after gravitational sedimentation for 1 h 95 8 of wo3 tio2 sio2 was settled compared to only 1 5 for the commercial nano sized ca 20 30 nm tio2 p25 the good sedimentation performance was attributed to the large particle size of the sio2 aerogel as support and the high density of sio2 after calcination ρ water the excellent settling performance greatly eases recovery and reusing of the spent wo3 tio2 sio2 fig 11 presents phenanthrene photodegradation kinetics over five reuse cycles in the presence and absence of light the 3 h phenanthrene degradation showed no obvious drop after the first run both in the presence fig 11a and absence fig 11b of light and the phenanthrene removal efficiency was remained nearly identical even after five consecutive runs 91 3 and 94 0 of phenanthrene still could be removed even after five runs for light irradiated and dark immersed materials respectively table s6 specifically for the consecutive runs upon light irradiation the phenanthrene removal efficiency was only dropped from 96 9 to 91 3 after five runs the observation indicates that the photodegradation process can fully regenerate the catalyst granting it long lasting photocatalytic activity in addition the wo3 leaching in aqueous phase at neutral ph was below the detection limit 0 05 mg l of tungsten by icp oes analysis indicating high physicochemical stability of the catalyst moreover the tem characterization of wo3 tio2 sio2 before or after 5 consecutive photocatalytic reusing cycles reveal that the structure of the wo3 tio2 sio2 does not change significantly fig 2c and d the darker area presented in fig 2d is probably due to the aggregation of reused materials additionally eds spectra of wo3 tio2 sio2 materials before and after photocatalytic reaction showed similar tungsten percentage 1 5 which further confirms that no significant tungsten leaching occurred during the photocatalytic reaction similarly the 5 consecutive reusing cycles does not change the xrd patterns of wo3 tio2 sio2 as shown in fig s4 indicating the high stability of the anatase crystal structure for wo3 tio2 sio2 the specific surface area of the materials only decreased 4 after reusing after 5 consecutive photocatalytic cycles which may be due to the blocking of some pores by small particles and contaminants the above characterizations of reused materials demonstrated that the structure and properties of wo3 tio2 sio2 materials are relative stable it owns the potential for long term application with high photocatalytic activity the leaching of elements or dissolving of photocatalysts can decrease the photocatalytic activity of materials during the long term operation fig 11b presents the long term stability of the wo3 tio2 sio2 by testing its photocatalytic activity after soaking in aqueous phase for different duration as shown in table s6 the 3 h phenanthrene removal efficiency was decreased from 95 9 to 94 0 after soaking for 28 d the leached tungsten in the aqueous phase after 28 d soaking was not detectable by icp oes analysis there results further confirmed the high stability of the wo3 tio2 sio2 material which promised the excellent reusing performance of the material in water treatment application 4 conclusions a new class of wo3 tio2 sio2 aerogel photocatalyst was synthesized via facile sol gel and calcination the prepared photocatalyst exhibited 7 times higher photocatalytic activity for phenanthrene degradation than commercial tio2 p25 under simulated solar light the material characterizations showed that the tio2 and wo3 were well dispersed on the highly porous sio2 aerogel and retained large surface area 400 m2 g the large surface area of material facilitated adsorption of organic pollutants and the loading of tio2 wo3 nanoparticles provided abundant photocatalytic active sites for oxidizing organic pollutants the deposition of wo3 narrowed the e g of wo3 tio2 sio2 and facilitated the charge separation thus promoted the visible light absorption and thus enhanced the photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 sio2 o2 and oh were identified to play the key roles in the photocatalysis process the 9 phenanthrenol 9 10 phenanthrenediol and 9 10 phenanthrenedione were found as the primary intermediates during the phenanthrene degradation and the degradation pathway of phenanthrene was proposed based on identified intermediates and dft calculation the qsar analysis revealed that some degradation intermediates still remained high toxicity so longer reaction time was required to mineralize these toxic intermediates the wo3 tio2 sio2 was amenable to efficient separation from aqueous phase through gravity sedimentation and kept high photocatalytic activity even after several reuse cycles considering the strong ros i e oh produced by wo3 tio2 sio2 through photocatalysis the developed photocatalyst can be applied to other pahs or alkylated phenanthrene overall wo3 tio2 sio2 represents a significant step forward in development of novel photocatalysts for water treatment application and the new material appears promising for cost

detection concentration of peroxymonosulfate pms was determined by a spectrophotometric method based on n n diethyl phenylenediamine dpd oxidation fukushima and tatsumi 2005 ph was measured in a basic 20 phmeter of crison equipped with a 50 11t electrode conductivity in a crison 524 device and turbidity in a 2100 is hach apparatus 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary experiments before proceeding with the pms radiation experiments some control runs were carried out to ascertain the extent of the direct bzf oxidation by peroxymonosulfate the influence of radiation nature and the role played by the irradiated area fig 1 a shows the capability of pms to directly oxidize bezafibrate as a function of ph as seen from this figure an increase of ph from 3 to 7 leads to a higher oxidation extent suggesting an enhanced reactivity of the anionic form of bezafibrate thus the pka value for bzf is 3 6 fent et al 2006 sustaining the previous hypothesis however when ph was further raised to 9 the process was partially inhibited likely due to the second dissociation of pms leading to the less reactive so5 2 pka 9 5 additionally at high ph pms can self decompose to oxygen and sulfate through a non radical route liu et al 2015 the process is supposed to follow second order kinetics a first approach to the second order rate constant kdirect can be attempted by adjusting experimental pms concentration to a mathematical time dependent expression and solving by euler s method 1 c bzf t 1 c bzf t k direct c pms t c bzf t δ t where ci t refers to concentration of species i at time t and δt is the time increment used in the numerical method approximated values of 0 08 0 01 0 29 0 03 and 0 16 0 02 m 1 s 1 for kdirect where obtained when initial ph values were adjusted to 5 7 and 9 respectively at ph 3 bzf elimination was completely inhibited next uncontrolled ph runs were conducted in the presence of radiation of different nature fig 1b shows the influence of the wavelength applied when bzf was oxidized after addition of pms as observed from this figure as the radiation is more energetic lower wavelength the efficacy of the system pms radiation increases in terms of bezafibrate abatement matafonova and batoev 2018 hence after 1 h of treatment bzf conversion values of 0 20 60 and 97 were found in the systems pms pms storelight pms windowsglass and pms daylight respectively when 2 10 4 m of pms initial concentration was used at the conditions applied in this series bezafibrate is not directly oxidized nor photolyzed accordingly the significant enhancement of the process in the presence of peroxymonosulfate is undoubtedly due to pms disproportionation because of the presence of uv radiation wacławek et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 having in mind the low radiation absorption coefficient of pms at λ 280 nm ao and liu 2017 shown in fig 2 it is suggested that the disproportionation quantum yield must be significant finally the process was tested to check the influence of area radiation exposure fig 1c reveals a significant role played by the irradiated area as expected the higher the exposure area the higher the bzf elimination rate given the results obtained in this section next experiments were conducted in the presence of pms and daylight 3 2 influence of operation variables 3 2 1 initial bezafibrate concentration the influence of initial bezafibrate concentration was assessed in the interval 3 10 6 to 3 10 5 m fig 3 a shows the results obtained as inferred from this figure initial bzf concentration influence reveals a kinetic behavior different from the traditional first order commonly applied to advanced oxidation processes a rough analysis of the reaction rate at time zero confirms that the higher the initial parent compound concentration the higher the reaction rate a simple pseudo first order kinetics does not explain the bzf concentration profile monitored accordingly a more complicated mechanism must proceed the actual mechanism of the bzf pms daylight system is complex including the radiation transfer equation sulfate and or hydroxyl radical generation propagation and termination of radicals formation of organic radicals generation of peroxides competition reactions by generated intermediates etc in this study a simple kinetic expression was proposed to evaluate the influence of the variables studied hence the following assumptions have been accounted for firstly bezafibrate is only removed by reactive oxygen species ros generated after pms disproportionation by daylight accordingly pms photolysis is modelled by the expression doll and frimmel 2003 2 d c p m s d t ϕ λ p m s ε λ p m s c p m s i ε λ i c i i λ 0 1 exp 2 303 l i ε λ i c i where ϕ λ i ϕ i λ d λ is the quantum yield of the species i ε λ i ε i λ d λ the extinction coefficient of the compound i i λ 0 ε i λ d λ the incident photon flux by the liquid in the reaction and l the effective optical path in the reactor the low pms and bzf and likely intermediates extinction coefficients leads to the inequality 2 303 l σ ε i c i 0 02 at wavelength up to 285 nm the extinction coefficient for bzf and pms is minimal as shown in fig 2 no ph influence was observed in the interval of the irradiated wavelengths λ 300 nm as a consequence assuming that light is only absorbed by pms eq 2 can be transformed by expansion in taylor series to 3 d c p m s d t 2 303 l ϕ λ p m s ε λ p m s i λ 0 c p m s ros formation should be proportional to pms depletion 4 d c r o s d t 2 303 l ϕ λ r o s ε λ p m s i λ 0 c p m s if steady state conditions apply to ros bezafibrate removal can be expressed by 5 d c b z f d t k b z f 2 303 l ϕ λ r o s ε λ p m s i λ 0 c p m s r r o s c b z f n where kbzf is an empirical rate constant accounting for bezafibrate abatement regardless of the actual mechanism taking place σrros stands for all the reactions consuming reactive oxygenated species and n is the empirical reaction order regarding bezafibrate oxidation given the number of potential bzf oxidation pathways stoichiometric coefficients unknown rate constants selectivity etc the term σrros is difficult to be evaluated obviously the number and concentration of intermediates should be proportional to the amount of bzf oxidized in this sense scavenging of ros has been incorporated to the model by the following expression 6 r r o s α c b z f 0 c b z f m where α is the proportionality constant the sub index 0 refers to initial conditions and m is an adjustable reaction order concerning the oxidation of intermediates after substitution in 5 7 d c b z f d t k r a d b z f 2 303 l ϕ λ r o s ε λ p m s i λ 0 c p m s α c b z f 0 c b z f m c b z f n finally 8 d c b z f d t k o b s e r v e d c p m s c b z f n c b z f 0 c b z f m with 9 k o b s e r v e d k r a d b z f 2 303 l ϕ λ r o s ε λ p m s i λ 0 α as a rule of thumb the evolution of pms concentration seems to follow an exponential curve from 0 to 30 min however its decomposition rate significantly slowed down from 30 min until the end of the 120 min time experiments it is suggested that a fraction of ros initially formed are scavenged by pms itself however as the concentration of byproducts increases radicals are mainly consumed by intermediates so pms only transforms due to photolysis experimental pms concentration was fitted to an exponential expression of the type 10 c p m s c p m s 0 k 1 exp τ t where k and τ are adjustable parameters to fit pms experimental concentration profiles after pms evolution fitting eq 8 was numerically solved by euler s method obviously eq 8 is a pseudoempirical model lacking of fundamental chemistry basis however the role played by a model is the simulation of experimental data and it is just a tool to predict the behavior of the system under a range of operating variable values optimization of kobserved m and n allowed for the acceptable simulation of bzf evolution profiles at different initial concentrations of the pharmaceutical values of n 0 4 m 0 25 and kobserved 2 5 0 3 10 3 m 0 15 min 1 were obtained after the optimization process when daylight was applied fig 3 shows a good simulation dashed lines of bezafibrate evolution considering that the process is not first order in this reagent 3 2 2 initial pms concentration the influence of pms was evaluated in the interval 40 400 μm fig 4 shows the results obtained this figure reveals a positive effect of the oxidant concentration within the range of concentrations studied the initial scavenging of radicals by pms seems to be inevitable to form the less reactive so5 radical eqs 11 and 12 rivas et al 2012 therefore an excessive amount of pms could lead to experience certain inhibition of the process in terms of bezafibrate removal rate however under the conditions investigated in this work this negative effect has not been experienced 11 h s o 5 s o 5 2 h o s o 5 h 2 o h o 12 h s o 5 s o 5 2 s o 4 s o 5 h s o 4 s o 4 2 pms conversion showed again an exponential increase in the first 30 min of reaction regardless of the initial concentration used as previously shown in fig 1b results suggest that there is a fixed fraction of pms scavenging radicals within the first half an hour of the reaction independently of the initial pms concentration used once more eq 8 was applied to this experimental series by keeping the values of kobserved m and n previously obtained as observed from fig 4 dashed lines the model was also capable of acceptably simulating the influence of pms initial concentration on bezafibrate abatement confirming the validity of the model 3 2 3 ph influence fig 5 shows the different curves obtained in experiments conducted under ph controlled conditions in the range 3 10 ph did not exert a significant influence in the range 3 8 however pms abatement increased as the ph was raised from ph 8 to ph 10 analogously bezafibrate removal rate was also increased when ph was controlled under alkaline conditions fig 5 inset shows the evolution of the kobserved as a function of ph as seen in the ph range 3 8 kobserved barely varies nevertheless at ph 9 a slight increase was experienced this trend corroborated at ph 10 under the latter operating conditions kobserved underwent a 6 fold increase if compared to values found at acidic or circumneutral ph these results are in agreement with those reported by guan and co workers guan et al 2011 these authors reported an improved efficacy of the system pms uvc when treating an aqueous solution of benzoic acid after raising the ph from 8 to 12 the enhancement of the oxidizing capacity is associated to an increase of the molar absorptivity of pms as this species is dissociated pka 9 5 from fig 2 it can be appreciated that the molar extinction coefficient of the dissociated species so5 is ten times higher than the non dissociated hso5 for example at 254 nm the values were 12 4 and 121 1 m 1 cm 1 respectively 3 2 4 presence of ros reactive oxygenated species scavengers the influence of the reactive species involved in the process of bezafibrate oxidation by photolytic activation of pms was assessed by the application of diverse radical scavengers the use of linear α hydrogen alcohols has been proved to reliably test the influence of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals the second order rate constant for the reaction of ho increases from methanol meoh ethanol etoh to 2 propanol 2proh 9 7 108 1 2 2 8 109 and 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the reactivity of these alcohols with so4 although less is still considered high 3 2 106 1 6 7 7 107 and 6 107 m 1 s 1 respectively for meoh etoh and 2proh in the case of tert butyl alcohol tba the second order rate constant for so4 is circa 1000 times lower to that of ho 3 8 7 6 108 versus 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2015 for that reason the inhibition effect observed with tba is commonly compared to linear alcohols to tentatively asses the relative importance of ho and so4 in sulfate based aops thus linear alcohols are supposed to suppress the effect of both radicals whereas tba is only capable of remove the effect of ho efficiently furthermore regardless of the values of the rate constant it is important to take into account the concentration of the scavenger it must be in high concentration to avoid competition with the target compound bzf i e for ho 13 k s c a v e n g e r h o c s c a v e n g e r k b z f h o c b z f the influence of these alcohols in the degradation of bzf by solar assisted pms oxidation was tested at different ph values 3 5 7 9 and fig 6 depicts the results the rate constant of bzf and hydroxyl radicals is around 8 109 m 1 s 1 razavi et al 2009 therefore under the experimental conditions 5 mm alcohol and 2 76 μm bzf all alcohols can be considered scavengers of ho route specifically as an example the calculated kobserved values at ph 3 indicated a 63 8 and 72 5 reduction if compared to the non scavenged run for tba and etoh respectively at ph 7 fig 6 left down the inhibition of the process by linear alcohols was enhanced if compared to ph 3 and 5 generally accompanied by a higher pms decomposition rate the scavenging effect followed the order proh etoh meoh which agrees with the decreasing order of their rate constant values with ho and so4 neta et al 1988 as ph increased from 3 to 9 a higher consumption of pms was registered probably due to the formation of active organic radicals rivas et al 2012 the role played by so4 versus ho loses importance if compared to hydroxyl radical as ph is raised actually at ph 9 the presence of tba did not affect the bzf removal profile if compared to the blank according to the literature p benzoquinone pbzq has been used to check the role played by superoxide radical second order rate constant of pbzq and the pair ho2 o2 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2018 addition of pbzq significantly affected the process almost a 93 decrease in kobserved was found at ph 3 if compared to the studies in absence of scavengers although benzoquinone is used as a ho2 o2 scavenger the reaction rate constant with ho is even higher 6 6 109 m 1 s 1 nien schuchmann et al 1998 furthermore pbzq also reacts with sulfate radicals 108 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 therefore pbzq should be capable to quench the three radicals nevertheless this was not the case a parallel scavenging effect does likely proceed a plausible explanation could be an important role played by hydroperoxyl radicals however this is not likely to occur since the reactivity of this kind of radicals with bzf is lower than the corresponding ho and so4 radicals competition by light seems to be a more reasonable explanation hence benzoquinone absorbs light from uvc to the visible region of the spectrum i e ε 300nm 30 m2 mol 1 von sonntag et al 2004 in this case light competition should lead to a lower pms conversion nevertheless pms abatement extent is higher when pbzq is present accordingly inefficient pms decomposition by pbzq is hypothesized in this sense zhou and co workers zhou et al 2015 proposed a non radical mechanism of pms reaction with benzoquinone to generate 1o2 through a dioxirane intermediate apparently 1o2 would not contribute to bezafibrate oxidation so the presence of pbzq involves a negative effect in this particular case previous results were confirmed at ph 5 fig 6 top right where the inefficient pms decomposition by pbzq was more evident 3 3 intermediates identification and toxicity in this work 11 initial intermediates were identified when treating bezafibrate with the system pms daylight as summarized in table 3 in addition fig 7 shows the proposed reaction mechanism in which six potential routes of bezafibrate attack are proposed the first one is the addition of ho to one of the aromatic rings leading to c6 also attack to the cl group results in the dechlorinated species c11 removal of the acidic group to generate c9 would also sustain the early detection of formic acid in the process the registered peak area can be considered proportional to concentration in all the intermediates in similar extent therefore the formation of c7 from c9 seems to be the preferential route at the sight of fig 8 b attack to the amine group would break the bezafibrate structure to give c3 and c8 c1 structure would be the result of ring opening while the unusual c5 can be explained by cyclization after hydrogen abstraction by ho some of the intermediates detected have also been reported previously hence razavi and co workers razavi et al 2009 proposed a four route bezafibrate oxidation identifying compounds c2 c4 c5 c6 c7 and c11 these authors propose a scheme to account for the cyclization product c5 the evolution of some carboxylic acids and intermediates was also monitored muconic acid was detected evidencing the opening of the aromatic ring muconic acid likely leads to formation of fumaric acid and further accumulation of formic acid at the end of the process 120 min roughly 26 of the maximum stoichiometric amount of free chlorides was detected in the water bulk results not shown toxicity of first intermediates was theoretically evaluated by using test a toxicity estimation software tool developed to estimate the toxicity of chemicals using quantitative structure activity relationships qsars methodologies martin and national 2016 four different parameters were evaluated namely fat minnow lc50 96 h daphnia magna lc50 48 h tetrahymena pyriformis igc50 48 h and oral rat ld50 fig 8a illustrates the relative toxicity of the intermediates if compared to bezafibrate toxicity as observed most of intermediates show a lower toxicity than the parent compound nevertheless intermediates c4 c6 and c9 seems to be more toxic than bezafibrate as a rule of thumb substances keeping the chloro substituent present a higher negative effect in terms of toxicity especially when the structure of the molecule has not been significantly modified if compared to bezafibrate chemical structure in any case under the conditions investigated only c10 seems to accumulate in the water bulk the rest of intermediates show a decreasing concentration trend as the reaction progresses see fig 8b the experiment conducted to identify the intermediates was carried out with an initial bzf concentration of 10 mg l 1 accordingly it is expected that at lower bzf doses most of intermediates are completely removed after 120 min of treatment 3 4 a case of study removal of bezafibrate in a simulated secondary effluent in order to prove the feasibility of solar photolytic pms technology a series of experiments of bzf oxidation in a matrix simulating the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant after the biological oxidation step was conducted fig 9 a shows the evolution of the normalized bzf concentration during the treatment with pms photolysis using the three radiation filters from the results bzf removal was less efficient in the synthetic urban wastewater suww matrix if compared to ultrapure water actually under the conditions tested bzf initial concentration 250 μg l 1 pms 400 μm the most energetic radiation i e daylight almost 85 elimination of the target pollutant was achieved in 2 h it was necessary to raise the initial pms concentration to 800 μm to achieve a complete degradation of bzf also the uvc content in the radiation source played an important role in the suww pms photolysis with windowglass radiation achieved only 20 bzf removal and storelight was completely inefficient taking in mind the positive effectiveness in ultrapure water the competition of substances in suww either organic or inorganic and bzf for the generated radicals diminished the efficacy of the process only the daylight radiation was capable of triggering the generation of enough oxidizing radicals to perform bzf degradation moreover the kinetics of the process in suww matrix is completely different to what appreciated in ultrapure water in presence of suww bzf follows a zero order kinetics at initial pms dose of 400 μm that may indicate that the amount of free radicals available for bzf oxidation is limiting the process higher initial pms concentration led to exponential decay in order to compare ultrapure up and suww matrices the initial rate constant for the observed bzf depletion rbzf 0 during the different systems used are presented in fig 9b the rbzf 0 in up water was obtained from experimental results obtained in fig 1b as it can be appreciated rbzf 0 in suww matrix was over 2 orders of magnitude inferior to what registered in up even though the molar ratio pms bzf in those experiments was higher to up tests these results reveal the importance of considering the competitors present in real water matrix in order to select the pms initial dose in the design of real treatment applications 4 conclusions the combination of pms and solar radiation results in effective removal of organic contaminants as shown in the case of bezafibrate and the intermediate products solar radiation which contains some small portion of uv radiation demonstrates to be effective in the activation of pms for the oxidation of aqueous micropollutants i e bezafibrate the uv proportion in the irradiation source seems to be limiting in the process with a higher effectiveness of uvc uvb uva components experimental data obtained in this study reveal a reaction order different from 1 regarding bezafibrate oxidation and close to 1 in the case of pms degradation the use of scavengers suggests the presence of radicals the role played by ho being prevailing that of so4 with the increase in ph in the alkaline range eleven transformation products were detected at the beginning of the bezafibrate oxidation by pms and solar light stoichiometric amounts of free chloride determined after roughly 30 min of reaction suggests the dechlorination route of bezafibrate removal as the main pathway in experiments using wastewater matrix it is necessary to increase the ratio oxidant pollutant to achieve degradation rates similar to those obtained in ultrapure water declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no

18658,this work investigates the potential of the combination of peroxymonosulfate pms and simulated solar radiation λ 300 nm to remove bezafibrate from aqueous solution different solar light filters

course of the test the reduced iron ii was photometrically analyzed by complexation with 1 10 phenanthroline tamura et al 1974 experiments were carried out by adding the required amount of pms dissolved in 10 ml of water to 500 ml of aqueous bezafibrate solution the range of pms concentration in this study was within the range 8 10 4 4 10 5 m in order to maintain experimental analytical

starting the initial control sample was extracted and irradiation of the solution began by switching on the solar simulator after pms addition at different predetermined time intervals samples were

detection concentration of peroxymonosulfate pms was determined by a spectrophotometric method based on n n diethyl phenylenediamine dpd oxidation fukushima and tatsumi 2005 ph was measured in a basic 20 phmeter of crison equipped with a 50 11t electrode conductivity in a crison 524 device and turbidity in a 2100 is hach apparatus 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary experiments before proceeding with the pms radiation experiments some control runs were carried out to ascertain the extent of the direct bzf oxidation by peroxymonosulfate the influence of radiation nature and the role played by the irradiated area fig 1 a shows the capability of pms to directly oxidize bezafibrate as a function of ph as seen from this figure an increase of ph from 3 to 7 leads to a higher oxidation extent suggesting an enhanced reactivity of the anionic form of bezafibrate thus the pka value for bzf is 3 6 fent et al 2006 sustaining the previous hypothesis however when ph was further raised to 9 the process was partially inhibited likely due to the second dissociation of pms leading to the less reactive so5 2 pka 9 5 additionally at high ph pms can self decompose to oxygen and sulfate through a non radical route liu et al 2015 the process is supposed to follow second order kinetics a first approach to the second order rate constant kdirect can be attempted by adjusting experimental pms concentration to a mathematical time dependent expression and solving by euler s method 1 c bzf t 1 c bzf t k direct c pms t c bzf t δ t where ci t refers to concentration of species i at time t and δt is the time increment used in the numerical method approximated values of 0 08 0 01 0 29 0 03 and 0 16 0 02 m 1 s 1 for kdirect where obtained when initial ph values were adjusted to 5 7 and 9 respectively at ph 3 bzf elimination was completely inhibited next uncontrolled ph runs were conducted in the presence of radiation of different nature fig 1b shows the influence of the wavelength applied when bzf was oxidized after addition of pms as observed from this figure as the radiation is more energetic lower wavelength the efficacy of the system pms radiation increases in terms of bezafibrate abatement matafonova and batoev 2018 hence after 1 h of treatment bzf conversion values of 0 20 60 and 97 were found in the systems pms pms storelight pms windowsglass and pms daylight respectively when 2 10 4 m of pms initial concentration was used at the conditions applied in this series bezafibrate is not directly oxidized nor photolyzed accordingly the significant enhancement of the process in the presence of peroxymonosulfate is undoubtedly due to pms disproportionation because of the presence of uv radiation wacławek et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 having in mind the low radiation absorption coefficient of pms at λ 280 nm ao and liu 2017 shown in fig 2 it is suggested that the disproportionation quantum yield must be significant finally the process was tested to check the influence of area radiation exposure fig 1c reveals a significant role played by the irradiated area as expected the higher the exposure area the higher the bzf elimination rate given the results obtained in this section next experiments were conducted in the presence of pms and daylight 3 2 influence of operation variables 3 2 1 initial bezafibrate concentration the influence of initial bezafibrate concentration was assessed in the interval 3 10 6 to 3 10 5 m fig 3 a shows the results obtained as inferred from this figure initial bzf concentration influence reveals a kinetic behavior different from the traditional first order commonly applied to advanced oxidation processes a rough analysis of the reaction rate at time zero confirms that the higher the initial parent compound concentration the higher the reaction rate a simple pseudo first order kinetics does not explain the bzf concentration profile monitored accordingly a more complicated mechanism must proceed the actual mechanism of the bzf pms daylight system is complex including the radiation transfer equation sulfate and or hydroxyl radical generation propagation and termination of radicals formation of organic radicals generation of peroxides competition reactions by generated intermediates etc in this study a simple kinetic expression was proposed to evaluate the influence of the variables studied hence the following assumptions have been accounted for firstly bezafibrate is only removed by reactive oxygen species ros generated after pms disproportionation by daylight accordingly pms photolysis is modelled by the expression doll and frimmel 2003 2 d c p m s d t ϕ λ p m s ε λ p m s c p m s i ε λ i c i i λ 0 1 exp 2 303 l i ε λ i c i where ϕ λ i ϕ i λ d λ is the quantum yield of the species i ε λ i ε i λ d λ the extinction coefficient of the compound i i λ 0 ε i λ d λ the incident photon flux by the liquid in the reaction and l the effective optical path in the reactor the low pms and bzf and likely intermediates extinction coefficients leads to the inequality 2 303 l σ ε i c i 0 02 at wavelength up to 285 nm the extinction coefficient for bzf and pms is minimal as shown in fig 2 no ph influence was observed in the interval of the irradiated wavelengths λ 300 nm as a consequence assuming that light is only absorbed by pms eq 2 can be transformed by expansion in taylor series to 3 d c p m s d t 2 303 l ϕ λ p m s ε λ p m s i λ 0 c p m s ros formation should be proportional to pms depletion 4 d c r o s d t 2 303 l ϕ λ r o s ε λ p m s i λ 0 c p m s if steady state conditions apply to ros bezafibrate removal can be expressed by 5 d c b z f d t k b z f 2 303 l ϕ λ r o s ε λ p m s i λ 0 c p m s r r o s c b z f n where kbzf is an empirical rate constant accounting for bezafibrate abatement regardless of the actual mechanism taking place σrros stands for all the reactions consuming reactive oxygenated species and n is the empirical reaction order regarding bezafibrate oxidation given the number of potential bzf oxidation pathways stoichiometric coefficients unknown rate constants selectivity etc the term σrros is difficult to be evaluated obviously the number and concentration of intermediates should be proportional to the amount of bzf oxidized in this sense scavenging of ros has been incorporated to the model by the following expression 6 r r o s α c b z f 0 c b z f m where α is the proportionality constant the sub index 0 refers to initial conditions and m is an adjustable reaction order concerning the oxidation of intermediates after substitution in 5 7 d c b z f d t k r a d b z f 2 303 l ϕ λ r o s ε λ p m s i λ 0 c p m s α c b z f 0 c b z f m c b z f n finally 8 d c b z f d t k o b s e r v e d c p m s c b z f n c b z f 0 c b z f m with 9 k o b s e r v e d k r a d b z f 2 303 l ϕ λ r o s ε λ p m s i λ 0 α as a rule of thumb the evolution of pms concentration seems to follow an exponential curve from 0 to 30 min however its decomposition rate significantly slowed down from 30 min until the end of the 120 min time experiments it is suggested that a fraction of ros initially formed are scavenged by pms itself however as the concentration of byproducts increases radicals are mainly consumed by intermediates so pms only transforms due to photolysis experimental pms concentration was fitted to an exponential expression of the type 10 c p m s c p m s 0 k 1 exp τ t where k and τ are adjustable parameters to fit pms experimental concentration profiles after pms evolution fitting eq 8 was numerically solved by euler s method obviously eq 8 is a pseudoempirical model lacking of fundamental chemistry basis however the role played by a model is the simulation of experimental data and it is just a tool to predict the behavior of the system under a range of operating variable values optimization of kobserved m and n allowed for the acceptable simulation of bzf evolution profiles at different initial concentrations of the pharmaceutical values of n 0 4 m 0 25 and kobserved 2 5 0 3 10 3 m 0 15 min 1 were obtained after the optimization process when daylight was applied fig 3 shows a good simulation dashed lines of bezafibrate evolution considering that the process is not first order in this reagent 3 2 2 initial pms concentration the influence of pms was evaluated in the interval 40 400 μm fig 4 shows the results obtained this figure reveals a positive effect of the oxidant concentration within the range of concentrations studied the initial scavenging of radicals by pms seems to be inevitable to form the less reactive so5 radical eqs 11 and 12 rivas et al 2012 therefore an excessive amount of pms could lead to experience certain inhibition of the process in terms of bezafibrate removal rate however under the conditions investigated in this work this negative effect has not been experienced 11 h s o 5 s o 5 2 h o s o 5 h 2 o h o 12 h s o 5 s o 5 2 s o 4 s o 5 h s o 4 s o 4 2 pms conversion showed again an exponential increase in the first 30 min of reaction regardless of the initial concentration used as previously shown in fig 1b results suggest that there is a fixed fraction of pms scavenging radicals within the first half an hour of the reaction independently of the initial pms concentration used once more eq 8 was applied to this experimental series by keeping the values of kobserved m and n previously obtained as observed from fig 4 dashed lines the model was also capable of acceptably simulating the influence of pms initial concentration on bezafibrate abatement confirming the validity of the model 3 2 3 ph influence fig 5 shows the different curves obtained in experiments conducted under ph controlled conditions in the range 3 10 ph did not exert a significant influence in the range 3 8 however pms abatement increased as the ph was raised from ph 8 to ph 10 analogously bezafibrate removal rate was also increased when ph was controlled under alkaline conditions fig 5 inset shows the evolution of the kobserved as a function of ph as seen in the ph range 3 8 kobserved barely varies nevertheless at ph 9 a slight increase was experienced this trend corroborated at ph 10 under the latter operating conditions kobserved underwent a 6 fold increase if compared to values found at acidic or circumneutral ph these results are in agreement with those reported by guan and co workers guan et al 2011 these authors reported an improved efficacy of the system pms uvc when treating an aqueous solution of benzoic acid after raising the ph from 8 to 12 the enhancement of the oxidizing capacity is associated to an increase of the molar absorptivity of pms as this species is dissociated pka 9 5 from fig 2 it can be appreciated that the molar extinction coefficient of the dissociated species so5 is ten times higher than the non dissociated hso5 for example at 254 nm the values were 12 4 and 121 1 m 1 cm 1 respectively 3 2 4 presence of ros reactive oxygenated species scavengers the influence of the reactive species involved in the process of bezafibrate oxidation by photolytic activation of pms was assessed by the application of diverse radical scavengers the use of linear α hydrogen alcohols has been proved to reliably test the influence of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals the second order rate constant for the reaction of ho increases from methanol meoh ethanol etoh to 2 propanol 2proh 9 7 108 1 2 2 8 109 and 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the reactivity of these alcohols with so4 although less is still considered high 3 2 106 1 6 7 7 107 and 6 107 m 1 s 1 respectively for meoh etoh and 2proh in the case of tert butyl alcohol tba the second order rate constant for so4 is circa 1000 times lower to that of ho 3 8 7 6 108 versus 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2015 for that reason the inhibition effect observed with tba is commonly compared to linear alcohols to tentatively asses the relative importance of ho and so4 in sulfate based aops thus linear alcohols are supposed to suppress the effect of both radicals whereas tba is only capable of remove the effect of ho efficiently furthermore regardless of the values of the rate constant it is important to take into account the concentration of the scavenger it must be in high concentration to avoid competition with the target compound bzf i e for ho 13 k s c a v e n g e r h o c s c a v e n g e r k b z f h o c b z f the influence of these alcohols in the degradation of bzf by solar assisted pms oxidation was tested at different ph values 3 5 7 9 and fig 6 depicts the results the rate constant of bzf and hydroxyl radicals is around 8 109 m 1 s 1 razavi et al 2009 therefore under the experimental conditions 5 mm alcohol and 2 76 μm bzf all alcohols can be considered scavengers of ho route specifically as an example the calculated kobserved values at ph 3 indicated a 63 8 and 72 5 reduction if compared to the non scavenged run for tba and etoh respectively at ph 7 fig 6 left down the inhibition of the process by linear alcohols was enhanced if compared to ph 3 and 5 generally accompanied by a higher pms decomposition rate the scavenging effect followed the order proh etoh meoh which agrees with the decreasing order of their rate constant values with ho and so4 neta et al 1988 as ph increased from 3 to 9 a higher consumption of pms was registered probably due to the formation of active organic radicals rivas et al 2012 the role played by so4 versus ho loses importance if compared to hydroxyl radical as ph is raised actually at ph 9 the presence of tba did not affect the bzf removal profile if compared to the blank according to the literature p benzoquinone pbzq has been used to check the role played by superoxide radical second order rate constant of pbzq and the pair ho2 o2 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2018 addition of pbzq significantly affected the process almost a 93 decrease in kobserved was found at ph 3 if compared to the studies in absence of scavengers although benzoquinone is used as a ho2 o2 scavenger the reaction rate constant with ho is even higher 6 6 109 m 1 s 1 nien schuchmann et al 1998 furthermore pbzq also reacts with sulfate radicals 108 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 therefore pbzq should be capable to quench the three radicals nevertheless this was not the case a parallel scavenging effect does likely proceed a plausible explanation could be an important role played by hydroperoxyl radicals however this is not likely to occur since the reactivity of this kind of radicals with bzf is lower than the corresponding ho and so4 radicals competition by light seems to be a more reasonable explanation hence benzoquinone absorbs light from uvc to the visible region of the spectrum i e ε 300nm 30 m2 mol 1 von sonntag et al 2004 in this case light competition should lead to a lower pms conversion nevertheless pms abatement extent is higher when pbzq is present accordingly inefficient pms decomposition by pbzq is hypothesized in this sense zhou and co workers zhou et al 2015 proposed a non radical mechanism of pms reaction with benzoquinone to generate 1o2 through a dioxirane intermediate apparently 1o2 would not contribute to bezafibrate oxidation so the presence of pbzq involves a negative effect in this particular case previous results were confirmed at ph 5 fig 6 top right where the inefficient pms decomposition by pbzq was more evident 3 3 intermediates identification and toxicity in this work 11 initial intermediates were identified when treating bezafibrate with the system pms daylight as summarized in table 3 in addition fig 7 shows the proposed reaction mechanism in which six potential routes of bezafibrate attack are proposed the first one is the addition of ho to one of the aromatic rings leading to c6 also attack to the cl group results in the dechlorinated species c11 removal of the acidic group to generate c9 would also sustain the early detection of formic acid in the process the registered peak area can be considered proportional to concentration in all the intermediates in similar extent therefore the formation of c7 from c9 seems to be the preferential route at the sight of fig 8 b attack to the amine group would break the bezafibrate structure to give c3 and c8 c1 structure would be the result of ring opening while the unusual c5 can be explained by cyclization after hydrogen abstraction by ho some of the intermediates detected have also been reported previously hence razavi and co workers razavi et al 2009 proposed a four route bezafibrate oxidation identifying compounds c2 c4 c5 c6 c7 and c11 these authors propose a scheme to account for the cyclization product c5 the evolution of some carboxylic acids and intermediates was also monitored muconic acid was detected evidencing the opening of the aromatic ring muconic acid likely leads to formation of fumaric acid and further accumulation of formic acid at the end of the process 120 min roughly 26 of the maximum stoichiometric amount of free chlorides was detected in the water bulk results not shown toxicity of first intermediates was theoretically evaluated by using test a toxicity estimation software tool developed to estimate the toxicity of chemicals using quantitative structure activity relationships qsars methodologies martin and national 2016 four different parameters were evaluated namely fat minnow lc50 96 h daphnia magna lc50 48 h tetrahymena pyriformis igc50 48 h and oral rat ld50 fig 8a illustrates the relative toxicity of the intermediates if compared to bezafibrate toxicity as observed most of intermediates show a lower toxicity than the parent compound nevertheless intermediates c4 c6 and c9 seems to be more toxic than bezafibrate as a rule of thumb substances keeping the chloro substituent present a higher negative effect in terms of toxicity especially when the structure of the molecule has not been significantly modified if compared to bezafibrate chemical structure in any case under the conditions investigated only c10 seems to accumulate in the water bulk the rest of intermediates show a decreasing concentration trend as the reaction progresses see fig 8b the experiment conducted to identify the intermediates was carried out with an initial bzf concentration of 10 mg l 1 accordingly it is expected that at lower bzf doses most of intermediates are completely removed after 120 min of treatment 3 4 a case of study removal of bezafibrate in a simulated secondary effluent in order to prove the feasibility of solar photolytic pms technology a series of experiments of bzf oxidation in a matrix simulating the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant after the biological oxidation step was conducted fig 9 a shows the evolution of the normalized bzf concentration during the treatment with pms photolysis using the three radiation filters from the results bzf removal was less efficient in the synthetic urban wastewater suww matrix if compared to ultrapure water actually under the conditions tested bzf initial concentration 250 μg l 1 pms 400 μm the most energetic radiation i e daylight almost 85 elimination of the target pollutant was achieved in 2 h it was necessary to raise the initial pms concentration to 800 μm to achieve a complete degradation of bzf also the uvc content in the radiation source played an important role in the suww pms photolysis with windowglass radiation achieved only 20 bzf removal and storelight was completely inefficient taking in mind the positive effectiveness in ultrapure water the competition of substances in suww either organic or inorganic and bzf for the generated radicals diminished the efficacy of the process only the daylight radiation was capable of triggering the generation of enough oxidizing radicals to perform bzf degradation moreover the kinetics of the process in suww matrix is completely different to what appreciated in ultrapure water in presence of suww bzf follows a zero order kinetics at initial pms dose of 400 μm that may indicate that the amount of free radicals available for bzf oxidation is limiting the process higher initial pms concentration led to exponential decay in order to compare ultrapure up and suww matrices the initial rate constant for the observed bzf depletion rbzf 0 during the different systems used are presented in fig 9b the rbzf 0 in up water was obtained from experimental results obtained in fig 1b as it can be appreciated rbzf 0 in suww matrix was over 2 orders of magnitude inferior to what registered in up even though the molar ratio pms bzf in those experiments was higher to up tests these results reveal the importance of considering the competitors present in real water matrix in order to select the pms initial dose in the design of real treatment applications 4 conclusions the combination of pms and solar radiation results in effective removal of organic contaminants as shown in the case of bezafibrate and the intermediate products solar radiation which contains some small portion of uv radiation demonstrates to be effective in the activation of pms for the oxidation of aqueous micropollutants i e bezafibrate the uv proportion in the irradiation source seems to be limiting in the process with a higher effectiveness of uvc uvb uva components experimental data obtained in this study reveal a reaction order different from 1 regarding bezafibrate oxidation and close to 1 in the case of pms degradation the use of scavengers suggests the presence of radicals the role played by ho being prevailing that of so4 with the increase in ph in the alkaline range eleven transformation products were detected at the beginning of the bezafibrate oxidation by pms and solar light stoichiometric amounts of free chloride determined after roughly 30 min of reaction suggests the dechlorination route of bezafibrate removal as the main pathway in experiments using wastewater matrix it is necessary to increase the ratio oxidant pollutant to achieve degradation rates similar to those obtained in ultrapure water declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no

18659,the performance of conventional drinking water treatment plants wtps can be improved using quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra a qmra study on cryptosporidium using actual pathogen density was conducted to examine the performance of jalaliyeh wtp in tehran iran the infection risk and the burden of disease attributed to the parasite presence in finished water were estimated incorporating physical and chemical log reduction values lrvs using stochastic modeling and disinfection profiling the risk and burden of disease were compared with health based targets i e one case

estimated risk 111 cases per 104 people per year and the burden of disease 11 7 dalys per 106 people per year both exceeded the targets to control the excess risk three qmra based disinfection scenarios were examined including 1 employing chlorine dioxide clo2 instead of chlorine 2 ozonation with a concentration of 0 75 mg l ct 22 5 min mg l and 3 uv irradiation with a dose of 10 mj cm2 the lrv of parasite may be increased to 3 0 5 1 and 4 9 log by employing clo2 ozonation and uv irradiation respectively the use of ozone or uv as alternative disinfectants could enhance the disinfection efficacy and provide sufficient additional treatment against the excess risk of parasite qmra could make it easier applying appropriate improvement to conventional wtps in order to increase the system

introduction the multiple barrier concept is an important principle for ensuring safe drinking water production it involves a series of measures and barriers from the source through to consumer to protect water quality betancourt and rose 2004a to ensure that the produced water is safe for consumption the drinking water treatment plants wtps need to be monitored for the reduction performance of microbial contaminants that pose threat to public health geldreich 1996 among microbial contaminants protozoan parasites are considered an important public health problem due to their widespread occurrence and their resistance to treatment and disinfection processes teunis and havelaar 2002 the protection of drinking water resources and applying multiple barrier concept against protozoan parasites are of major concerns for water utilities worldwide karanis et al 2007 in many countries several guidelines have been developed for monitoring the presence of protozoan parasites in drinking water supply systems the mandatory monitoring of protozoan parasites from source to tap water and the implementation of risk assessment approaches are some tasks have been highlighted in these guidelines and are performed regularly in many developed countries for the production of safe drinking water smeets et al 2009 according to long term second enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2eswtr the water supply systems serving more than 100 000 people should be monitored for the presence of protozoan parasites and other microbial agents u s epa 2006 if monitoring results confirm the mean density of protozoan parasites in source samples exceeds 10 cysts or oocysts per liter the corresponding drinking water treatment system needs to be monitored in terms of its performance for the removal of the parasites u s epa 2006 the performance of a conventional treatment system to minimize the concerns for the probable presence of protozoan parasites in finished water can be assessed using risk assessment techniques regli et al 1991 moreover according to guidelines the amount of water treatment should be provided to the extent that the risk of infection for the consumer is less than one case per 10 000 people per year who 2011 in iran there are no mandatory requirements for monitoring of protozoan parasites in drinking water supply systems indeed the performance of most of wtps in iran is strongly dependent to the disinfection process which relies on chlorine and its derivate compounds moreover the drinking water supply systems in iran have not yet adopted well to the recently presented risk assessment approaches in world health organization guideline who 2011 therefore there is a critical need for the application of risk assessment approaches to quantify the performance of drinking water systems these approaches can be applied to examine and control the risk of protozoan parasites presence in drinking water which seems to be a concern in most developing countries among the protozoan parasites cryptosporidium is a main pathogen with world wide distribution cryptosporidium has been categorized as a reference pathogen for the assessment of drinking water quality medema et al 2009 moreover this parasite has been considered as the primary target for effective disinfection of protozoa in drinking water systems korich et al 1990 for a raw water with a mean cryptosporidium density between 0 075 and fewer than 1 0 oocysts l the treatment system must be able to provide 3 log 99 9 of reduction u s epa 2006 today in many countries and especially in iran the chlorination is a common practice to reduce the risk of pathogenic infectious agents but chlorine has a low efficacy for inactivation of cryptosporidium oocysts corona vasquez et al 2002 driedger et al 2000 2001 moreover it may pose a chemical threat to human health due to the production of disinfection by products dbps therefore finding appropriate alternatives to chlorine to control the probable excess risk of cryptosporidium and also to reduce the treatment systems dependency to chlorine are of great importance while these important targets are somewhat ambitious in many countries they may be achieved using the implementation of quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra technique in tehran the capital of iran the prevalence of cryptosporidium has been well documented in human stools dalimi et al 2014 calves stools ranjbar bahadori et al 2011 horse stools mirian et al 2010 rats stools fares et al 2012 soil of public places tavalla et al 2014 and

knowledge none of these investigations have yet examined the health effects due to the exposure to this parasite via treated surface drinking water cryptosporidium has numerous species and subtypes identified by molecular means xiao and fayer 2008 many of them have been recognized as infectious agents to the human population robinson et al 2008 among cryptosporidium species cryptosporidium parvum subtypes iid and iida15g1 and cryptosporidium hominis subtype id ida20 were the most predominant species of cryptosporidium identified in karaj river mahmoudi et al 2015 a river which supplies a considerable portion of drinking water of tehran through jalaliyeh wtp using gene sequence analysis these subtypes have been identified in humans samples in tehran taghipour et al 2011 thus karaj river seems to be a source of infectious subtypes of cryptosporidium which may even be transferred to finished drinking water therefore monitoring the change of parasite density from river to the point of water use the estimation of its log reduction value lrv within the treatment system and the quantification of attributed health risk are of a great importance in this paper a qmra approach was applied to assess the performance of jalaliyeh wtp in tehran the system s performance to reduce the infection risk attributed to cryptosporidium parasite was assessed the aims of the study were 1 to determine the treatment lrvs for the parasite by monitoring its actual density and applying stochastic modeling 2 to estimate the infection risk and the burden of disease attributed to the presence of parasite in finished water and 3 to examine the performance of different disinfection scenarios using ozone uv irradiation and chlorine dioxide clo2 to control the excess risk of parasite the health based targets i e one case of infection per 10 000 people per year and 10 6 dalys per person per year who 2011 were used as a basis for judgment of the system performance 2 material and methods 2 1 jalaliyeh water treatment plant jalaliyeh wtp is served by bilaghan intake point on karaj river with nominal and maximum capacities of 2 7 and 3 m3 s respectively fig 1 the pre treatment process at bilaghan involves grit removal using sedimentation basins and pre chlorination with pure gas chlorine after pre treatment water is transferred by gravity to the treatment plant through two lines of 1 m diameter steel pipes with a length of 40 km the treatment plant involves six clarifloculators cf with a total capacity of 1600 cubic meters ferric chloride as a coagulant and lime as a coagulant aid are the main chemicals in this clarification process the filtration system involves forty units of sand filter aquazur n with a capacity of 240 270 m3 hr after post disinfection with pure gas chlorine clear water is collected in a clearwell with a capacity of 3000 m3 and then is transferred by gravity or by pumping to the reservoirs on distribution system in this study as presented in fig 1 the wtp was divided into three zones of treatment and three segments of disinfection 2 2 sampling and pathogen detection water samples were taken at six distinct points a b c d e and f of the treatment system as illustrated in fig 1 the samples were taken monthly for a period of 15 months and all of them were analyzed for temperature residual chlorine ph and turbidity cryptosporidium parasite was only measured at a c d and f sampling points fig 1 cryptosporidium was analyzed using method 1623 1 u s epa 2012 the volumes of collected samples were 50 l for raw water samples 50 100 l for outlet of cf units and 1000 l for finished water samples the samples were directly passed through the idexx filtration cartridges the measurement procedure for the parasite involves washing the filter cartridge by phosphate buffered saline pbs and concentrating the elution using polysulphone membrane the produced concentrate was further concentrated by centrifugation and exposed to the immunomagnetic separation ims procedure using flat sided leighton tube containing buffers and cryptosporidium ims beads the sample was incubated and rocked using magnetic particle concentrators after the aspiration of supernatant the remaining liquid was acidified to dissociate bead oocyst complexes acidified suspension was then transferred to the wells of microscope slide after drying and fixing the sample fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc conjugated monoclonal antibodies mab were added to slide wells the slide was incubated and washed with pbs solution for any remaining fitc mab it then dried mounted and covered by applying coverslips subsequent examination was then performed under epifluorescence optics for further details of the procedure for pathogen detection in this study the reader is referred to the previous work of the authors hadi et al 2016 the epa method 1623 1 has been developed only to count the oo cysts of protozoan parasites and the species of the parasites cannot be determined by this method however the qmra technique in this study assumes that all of the oocysts probably present in the exposure are infectious to humans even though the laboratory method of detection employed did not identify species of the parasite the recovery efficiency of detection method was also determined by placing a known number of oocysts 100 2 1 from a suspension of oocysts provided by easy seed biotechnology frontiers australia in distilled water milliq millipore submitted to the same analytical procedure the paired dataset on the initial known number of oocysts and the number of oocysts recovered were used to model the recovery efficiency using beta distribution estimation of this distribution parameters by means of the paired beta model is explained in detail by teunis et al 1999 2009 the estimated average for recovery of parasite was 37 2 7 68 2 3 modeling the parasite density in source water in this study the source water dataset was included fifteen samples with a minimum and a maximum of 2 and 10 oocysts 50l respectively assuming that the distribution of parasite in each sample is random the numbers of parasite in a particular sample n with mean concentration μ and sample volume v is poisson distributed fisher et al 1922 1 f n μ v e μ v μ v n n if n samples with different sizes of v1 to vn are taken at different times of the year then μ itself may vary with time and assumed to be described by gamma distribution with parameters r and λ under this assumption the probability of finding n1 to nn organisms in samples can be described by negative binomial distribution el shaarawi et al 1981 2 g n λ r v γ r n n γ r λ r v n λ v r n 2 4 modeling the parasite removal fraction in treatment zones according to this idea that any single parasite has a certain probability of passing a treatment process some models based on binomial probability of passage has been reported by teunis et al 1999 if the probability of the parasite passage does not depend on its density the process as a binomial process can be described by assuming two types of paired and unpaired models for the samples with paired samples any pair of samples from inlet and outlet of each zone are taken simultaneously but for unpaired samples the samples are not taken simultaneously teunis et al 2009 in a real water treatment system the samples taken before and after a treatment zone are almost always unpaired i e they are not exactly the same water sampled because of a time delay in the treatment zone in this study therefore the unpaired model was used to estimate the removal fraction of the parasite in each zone of treatment in a given volume v of inlet water sample for each treatment zone the number of parasites can be described by negative binomial distribution as presented in eq 2 teunis et al 1999 in any unpaired sample from the outlet of the treatment zone with a volume of w the distribution of parasite is again poisson distributed with parameter πμw where π is the probability of the parasite passage leading to a mean density of πμ in outlet sample similarly assuming πμ is also follows a gamma distribution with parameters λ π and r the distribution of the number of parasite in an outlet sample will be teunis et al 1999 3 h k π λ r w γ r k k γ r λ r π w k λ π w r k if π itself varies between samples according to a beta distribution this leads to teunis et al 1999 4 h k λ r α β w w λ k r k k α β α k β f 1 2 k r α k α β k w λ where α β is the pochhammer symbol and 2f1 is a hypergeometric function a log likelihood function can be calculated by using two eqs 2 and 4 for the input and output samples and all parameters λ r α and β can be estimated by numerical optimization teunis et al 1999 2 5 modeling of parasite density in finished water when all of the analyzed samples are not detectable in the case of finished water samples for outlet of a zone schijven et al 2011 assumed that a gamma distribution with parameters r 0 01 and λ 1 vi 0 01 could provide an estimate of the parasite density in outlet where vi is the sum of all the samples taken from zone outlet this distribution can be regarded as a maximum estimate of the density in this study cryptosporidium density in all outlet samples of filtration zone were not detectable thus a maximum estimate of the parasite density was made based on schijven et al 2011 assumption moreover in this study all oocysts were assumed to be viable and infectious 2 6 modeling the inactivation of parasite the inactivation lrv for cryptosporidium was calculated according to usepa disinfection profiling and benchmarking guidance manual u s epa 1999 chlorine is used as a disinfectant in three different segments in jalaliyeh wtp 1 gas chlorination at bilaghan intake 2 hypochlorination at the inlet of the treatment plant and 3 gas chlorination after filtration units in order to maintain sufficient residual chlorine in distribution system to profile the disinfection process the ct residual disinfectant c mg l multiplied by the contact time t min and the inactivation rate of the parasite were calculated in order to model the inactivation rate available ct and required ct were calculated for each disinfection segment u s epa 2003 in this study the role of chlorine and other disinfectants including ozone clo2 and uv as alternatives for chlorine in the inactivation of cryptosporidium were examined incorporating the models illustrated in fig 2 into qmra simulation in a study by corona vasquez et al 2002 chlorine was used as a single disinfectant to inactivate cryptosporidium oocysts in a temperature range of 4 30 c the averaged ct values to provide 2 log of inactivation at 4 10 20 and 30 c were 23260 10366 5153 and 1500 mg min l respectively as presented in fig 2a an exponential model with r2 0 98 was used to estimate the required ct from temperature to meet 2 log of inactivation for the parasite using chlorine the average temperature values in the studied wtp measured to be 11 89 0 86 and 14 59 0 74 c for the inlet and outlet water samples respectively fig 2 b c and d represent the models used for clo2 ozone and uv respectively to estimate the required ct for the inactivation of parasite these models are based on the experimental data reported by epa which are available in nova scotia water treatment standard snook 2003 after the estimation of required ct ctreq the available ct ctavl and then the total log of inactivation tloginac were determined as follows 1 measuring temperature ph and concentration of residual chlorine before and after each disinfection segment at the peak of hourly flow 2 estimation of the theoretical detention time dt in all units of each segment the contact time in the water transfer line was estimated using open channel calculations by taking into account a height difference of 124 m between bilaghan intake and jalaliyeh wtp the manning coefficient of 0 01 for steel pipes with a length of 40 km and diameter of 1 m and the flow of 2 54 0 05 m3 s the r code for calculation is available as supplementary material 3 calculation the adjusted dt dtadj using baffling

inactivation ratio in different disinfection scenarios were estimated according to the procedure presented in table 1 as presented for each disinfection scenario the amount of inactivation lrv lrvinact was determined by estimating the amount of ctavl in different segments of disinfection then the total inactivation lrv provided by each disinfectant was estimated as follows clo2 using the equation presented in fig 2b the required ct to provide 3 log of inactivation was calculated based on the actual temperature of each water sample then for assumed residual clo2 of 0 1 0 12 0 15 0 2 0

determined logseg1 clo2 was summed with the lrvs for other segments to obtain the total inactivation lrv for clo2 scenario tloginact clo2 ozone using the equation presented in fig 2c the required ct to provide 3 log of inactivation was calculated based on the actual temperature of each water sample then assuming doses of 0 2 0 3 0 5 0 75 and 1 mg l for ozone and a contact time of 30 min the available ct and the inactivation lrv for ozone logseg1 ozone were determined logseg1 ozone was summed with other inactivation lrvs to obtain the total inactivation lrv for ozone scenario tloginact ozone uv for different assumed uv doses of 1 5 2 1 3 0 5 2 7 7 and 11 mj cm2 the inactivation lrv logseg2 uv was estimated using the equation presented in fig 2d the logseg2 uv then was summed with the inactivation lrvs for other segments to obtain the total inactivation lrv for uv scenario tloginact uv the treatment lrv lrvtreat was the same for all scenarios because no changes were made for the treatment units performance in the system lrvtreat or rlog was determined by summing up the estimated lrvs in different zones of treatment the total parasite removal ratio prr then calculated by multiplying the decimals by minus power of lrvs for disinfection segments and treatment zones 2 7 exposure estimation and risk characterization the magnitude of exposure was estimated by incorporating variables including pathogen density in source csource cysts l the recovery of pathogen rec physical lrvs for treatment zones from i 1 to i n zones rlog inactivation lrvs for disinfection segments tloginact and water ingestion rate ir l day the cold tap drinking water per capita consumption for different age categories less than 2 2 to 6 6 to 16 and older than 16 years old was estimated based on data in karyab et al 2013 the ir variable was incorporated in the qmra model using lognormal distribution with the parameters summarized in table 2 the dose of pathogen ingestion by a consumer was calculated by incorporation of ir csource recovery rec and prr in the following equation 11 d o s e i r c s o u r c e 1 re c 10 t l o g i n a c t i 1 n 10 r l o g i the daily infection risk was determined using a 1f1 hypergeometric dose response model based on dose response data of cryptosporidum parvum teunis et al 2002 and cryptosporidium hominis chappell et al 2006 as follows 12 p inf p e r s o n d a y 1 f 1 1 α α β d o s e where 1f1 is the confluent hypergeometric function the risks of infection and illness per year for an individual were estimated as follows 13 p inf p e r s o n y e a r 1 i 1 365 1 p inf p e r s o n d a y i 14 p i l l p e r s o n y e a r p inf p e r s o n y e a r s i where i is the proportion of individuals who develop symptomatic illness after infection in a human challenge study conducted by okhuysen et al 1999 to examine the infectivity of three cryptosporidium parvum isolates for healthy adults i as illness attack rate for these isolates was reported to be between 52 and 86 assuming a most likely value of 70 in our study a pert distribution for i with parameters values of imin 0 52 imax 0 86 and imode 0 70 was assumed to model the uncertainty around i the proportion of the population susceptible to cryptosporidiosis infection s was assumed to be unity as a deterministic value health canada 2012 the health burden hb for gastroenteritis from infection with cryptosporidium in drinking water in terms of daly per case was calculated as follows 15 hb daly case lyl yld where lyl is the life years lost lyl due to premature mortality and yld is years lost due to disability yld for people living with the health condition or its consequences lyl and yld were calculated as follows 16 y l d i 1 n o f d i s w 17 l y l i 1 n o f l e a d s w where of is outcome fraction 0 1 di is duration of illness years sw is severity weight of outcome 0 1 n is the number of outcomes le is life expectancy years and ad is age at death years the health outcomes of cryptosporidium vary in severity from mild to severe diarrhea and potentially death in this study the lyl and yld for cryptosporidiosis were calculated based on the mortality and morbidity outcome fractions of 0 00001 and 0 99999 respectively havelaar and melse 2003 the severity of morbidity and mortality due to cryptosporidiosis were considered to be 0 067 and 1 respectively howard et al 2006 the mean duration of illness was considered to be 0 01918 year 7 2 days havelaar and melse 2003 thus the estimated yld for gastroenteritis resulting from the mild diarrhea was 1 286 dalys 1000 cases 1 286 10 3 daly case because of data absence to estimate lyl in tehran the amount of years lost due to the death of patients with gastroenteritis le ad was considered 13 2 years havelaar and melse 2003 razzolini et al 2016 the lyl for death outcome and hb were then estimated to be 0 132 dalys 1000 cases 1 32 10 4 daly case and 1 418 dalys 1000 cases 1 418 10 3 daly case respectively using the estimated hb and the risk of illness per year pill person year the disease burden db in dalys per person per year was estimated as follows who 2011 18 d b d a l y p e r s o n y e a r p i l l p e r s o

respectively fig 3 shows the consequent steps used for the estimation of infection risk and burden of disease the risk assessment modeling was implemented using qmraspot schijven et al 2011 r version 3 3 1 r core team 2015 was also used for the calculation of hydraulic contact time see section 2 6 fitting the lognormal distribution to water consumption data table 2 and producing descriptive statistics tables 3 and 4 and plots fig 7 2 8 variability and uncertainty in qmra model typically uncertainties in a qmra are due to natural variation aleatory uncertainty and lack of knowledge epistemic uncertainty the quantity of each component of the exposure assessment may vary both spatially and temporally leading to variability in the estimated risk who 2016 the variables including the pathogen concentration in source and in finished drinking waters the estimated lrvs for parasite in treatment zones the rate of water intake or exposure volume and dose response model parameters are some sources of variability in the qmra model in this study this kind of inherent variability or aleatory uncertainty in the variables was described by statistical distributions the parameters of these statistical distributions themselves can be hierarchically represented by other distributions for example in the qmraspot schijven et al 2011 tool which was used in this study the exact beta poisson dose response model is applied using pairs of different α and β parameters to reflect the variability and uncertainty of infectivity for cryptosporidium pathogen these parameters are included in the code of qmraspot as monte carlo samples of the dose response parameters schijven et al 2011 briefly a joint distribution of dose response models for cryptosporidum parvum teunis et al 2002 and cryptosporidium hominis chappell et al 2006 was used to estimate the parameters α β then the exact beta poisson dose response model using the hypergeometric function 1f1 was applied with pairs of different α and β values in this study to incorporate the variability of each variable and the uncertainty of the parameters the stochastic simulation was conducted using qmraspot schijven et al 2011 2 9 qmra scenarios analysis since cryptosporidium oocysts are resistant to chlorine disinfectant who 2011 in this study three additional disinfectants uv clo2 and ozone were also assumed be used to reduce the probable excess risk of the parasite in the system current status of existing treatment system and the system status for alternative scenarios to control the excess risk of parasite are presented in fig 4 in the first scenario fig 4b the gas chlorine disinfection process at intake pre chlorination step was assumed to be replaced by a clo2 disinfection process to provide a sufficient residual clo2 at the inlet of plant in the second scenario fig 4c an ozonation process was assumed to be used as pre treatment step followed by gas chlorination but by half the rate of current gas chlorine injection dose in the third scenario fig 4d an ultraviolet irradiation uv process was assumed to be used after the filtration system and the gas chlorine injection was reduced by half at the intake point 3 results 3 1 parasite density variation in the number of cryptosporidium oocysts from river to tap water is shown in table 3 the maximum and mean densities of oocysts in source water samples were 0 216 and 0 064 oocysts l respectively as summarized in table 3 density of parasite has been decreased from 0 064 oocysts l in source water to 0 010 oocysts l in the inlet of wtp after passing water through the pre treatment process and experiencing a 40 km transmission line during the pre treatment and transmission of water around 0 73 log reduction for the parasite was provided which may be due to pre sedimentation or oocysts entrapment in pipe wall biofilms dumètre et al 2012 during the treatment process in cf units coagulation flocculation and sedimentation the density of parasite was decreased by one eighteenth 0 0036 oocysts l of the source density and around 0 38 log reduction was provided by cf units the density of cryptosporidium in finished water was decreased to 0 00018 oocysts l 1 2 log reduction 3 2 inactivation of parasite table 4 represents the descriptive statistics of the estimated parameters in disinfection segments the estimated contact time for chlorine in water transmission line was 2 30 0 01 h and the corresponding ctavl for the first segment of disinfection was estimated to be 93 15 15 59 min mg l the retention time in the second segment of disinfection which included cf and filtration units was 0 91 0 02 h in this segment the estimated values for ctavl and ctreq to provide 2 log of inactivation were 45 77 2 62 and 8404 534 5 min mg l respectively in the third segment gas chlorine is added to water before entering into the clearwell a 3000 m3 pool as the last stop of water before distribution the retention time of water in pool was estimated to be 0 23 0 005 h the available and required cts to provide 2 log of inactivation for cryptosporidium in third segment were 12 63 0 75 and 7635 601 min mg l respectively as presented in table 4 comparison of ctavl and ctreq for 2 log inactivation of cryptosporidium confirms the inadequacy of the residual chlorine for the inactivation of the parasite in the first segment of disinfection only around one percent rinac 0 01 0 002 of ctreq is provided by residual chlorine in this segment thus chlorine alone could not inactivate the parasite sufficiently and therefore a greater level of inactivation is required to be provided in subsequent disinfection segments or treatment zones similarly the second segment of disinfection was only able to provide a low level of inactivation ratio 0 55 of ctreq the third segment of disinfection also provided only 0 16 rinac 0 0016 0 020 of ctreq according to table 4 as presented in table 4 the disinfection process using chlorine only provided a total lrvinact of 0 034 0 006 for the parasite 3 3 infection risk and burden of disease the estimated infection risk and burden of disease attributed to cryptosporidium in finished water for different age groups under current wtp practices fig 4a are summarized in table 5 as presented the estimated number of infection cases and dalys for 2 2 6 6 16 and 16 years age groups were 60 44 140 and 200 cases per 10 000 people per year and 6 4 10 6 4 7 10 6 1 5 10 5 and 2 1 10 5 dalys per person per year respectively the estimated mean and percentiles 97 5th and 2 5th for the infection risk and burden of disease using other different scenarios of disinfection clo2 ozone and uv are also illustrated in fig 7 3 4 disinfection scenarios for risk control in this study the performance of clo2 ozone and uv as alternative disinfectants to control the excess risk of parasite were examined in different qmra based scenarios as presented in fig 4 in addition to assess the performance of current status of existing treatment system with pre chlorination rate of c mg l fig 4a three other alternative disinfectants including clo2 without pre chlorination fig 4b ozone with pre chlorination rate of c 2 mg l fig 4c and uv with pre chlorination rate of c 2 mg l fig 4d were also examined assuming a same lrvtreat for all qmra based scenarios the relationships for the infection risk versus residual clo2 concentration doses of ozone and uv were illustrated in fig 5 using these relationships the required concentration of residual clo2 and required doses for ozone and uv to reduce the excess risk to the target were estimated the estimated values of available lrvs for different qmra based scenarios were compared with the required one as presented in fig 6 as shown when chlorine is used as the only disinfectant in the system it provides only 0 03 log of reduction considering a lrvtreat of 2 31 for physical treatment units a total lrv of 2 34 lower than the required one 3 log for the current status of existing treatment system was provided see fig 4a providing a value of 0 7 additional lrv clo2 increased the total lrv by 3 01 just equal to the required one ozone and uv with lrvinact of 2 75 and 2 62 increased the total lrv to 5 06 and 4 93 log respectively which are 1 68 and 1 64 fold higher than the amount of required lrv 4 discussion 4 1 infection risk and burden of disease as presented in table 5 the mean of estimated infection risk 111 cases per 104 people per year and the burden of disease 11 7 dalys per 106 people per year both exceeded the targets based on fig 7 cl comparison the mean for the estimated infection risk 2 03 log10 95 ci 2 91 1 48 with the target i e one infection case per 10 000 people or 4 in log10 scale suggests the target is exceeded for all age groups based on means of 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles by 12 to 327 fold similarly the estimated burden of disease log10 95 ci 5 93 4 42 for all age groups was greater by 1 15 37 75 fold relative to who proposed target of 10 6 daly per person per year which is still a less strict value since all oocysts detected or estimated in this study were assumed to be viable and infectious for the human the infection risk and burden of disease both were estimated for a worse case condition for water supply system using qmra moreover it was assumed all age groups ingest only cold tap water thus the effect of water boiling before usage was not considered which could maximize the estimated risk based on an epidemiological study kolahi et al 2008 the incidence of acute diarrhea among 6 12 13 24 25 36 37 48 and 49 60 years age groups in tehran were estimated to be 20 4 15 4 8 8 6 5 and 4 1 respectively according to these estimations a greater incidence for acute diarrhea is expected to be observed for lower categories of age groups for example in a study by al shamiri et al 2010 the rate of diarrheal infection by cryptosporidium spp found to be highest among the preschool age group of 2 6 years in yemen sato et al 2013 also indicated children are more susceptible to protozoal infections approximately 3 to 4 fold higher than that for the total population as presented in table 5 see fig 7 estimated infection risk and the burden of disease for age groups 2 and 2 6 years were lower than those for 6 16 and 16 years age groups while the rate of diarrheic diseases among children is expected to be epidemiologically more than that for adults this inconsistency in findings in comparison to the epidemiological studies may be due to several reasons first drinking water ingestion is not the only route of exposure to the parasite moreover applying a same dose response model same severity and probability factors for health outcomes same illness to infection ratio iill inf parameter and also a same susceptibility fraction factor s for all categories of age while the rate of water intake is lower for children than that for adults observing a lower level of risk for children may be inevitable in another word in this study the only individual based factor which affected the infection risk is the water intake rate ir thus applying age specific values for iill inf s severity and probability for health outcomes for different categories of age may provide more consistent results moreover hand to mouth transfer of oocysts after touching contaminated materials soils surfaces waters foods and even human or animal faces which may be experienced with more probability by children in public parks dado et al 2012 primary schools lee and greig 2010 and day care centers enserink et al 2015 is another important route of exposure among children mattioli et al 2015 show children ingest a significantly greater amount of microbial contaminants each day from hand to mouth transmission pathway than from drinking water this may be another reason why the drinking water pathway estimated in this study has a lower risk for children as opposed to adults although the estimated risk values for age groups in this study are not consistent with epidemiological expectations the averaged risk values for age groups is nearly consistent with the approximated prevalence of cryptosporidium diarrheal infection in tehran keshavarz et al 2008 reported that the prevalence of confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis infection among 12 years children with diarrhea symptom is 2 4 in tehran considering 20 4 kolahi et al 2008 for diarrhea prevalence in children using rule of thumb out of 10 000 healthy children 50 children are expected to be infected with cryptosporidium in tehran according to table 5 and fig 7 cl the averaged value of pill person year for 2 16 years age group is 0 0056 per person per year this means out of 10 000 healthy children 56 95 ci 6 179 children are expected to be ill by consumption of the produced drinking water of the studied wtp this value is 1 12 fold 95 ci 0 12 3 58 higher than aforementioned 50 cases of illness based on the epidemiological studies however this 50 cases of illness may not all be infected through the ingestion of drinking water and certainly the parasite may be transmitted through other routs of exposure therefore since in this study the oocysts density in finished water was estimated using statistical assumptions and moreover the oocysts were all assumed to be viable and infectious for the human and also it was assumed all age groups ingest only cold tap water these estimated 56 cases of illness per year seems to be overestimated due to the uncertainties of our assumptions in addition to variables such as the probability of exposure to pathogens which seems to be grater among children the inclusion of immunity information in the risk assessment model may also be effective to reduce the uncertainties in the estimations research by teunis et al 2002 indicated that a protective effect against infection can be resulted from prior infection with cryptosporidium parvum however the duration of this protective effect is short lived less than one year and to develop a protective immunity repeated exposures to the parasite is needed therefore incorporation of information including the proportion of population with prior infection in risk assessment analysis may improves the risk model certainty however in this study to control the excess risk of cryptosporidium in drinking water three theoretical qmra based scenarios for the disinfection system were examined which will be discussed in following section 4 2 disinfection scenarios for the excess risk control based on lt2eswtr u s epa 1998 a wtp must be able to provide at least a lrv of 3 log 99 9 for cryptosporidium pathogen accordingly the canadian standard health canada 2012 also requires a minimum of 3 lrv for cryptosporidium in drinking water treatment systems whether or not filtration technology is in place the required amount of parasite lrv in a water treatment system is dependent on the magnitude of parasite density in influent of system for example in netherlands the density of cryptosporidium in the country s raw water resources is considerable between 1 2 and 128 oocysts per liter smeets et al 2009 and the required lrv for this parasite supposed to be around 5 log however as presented in table 3 for jalaliyah wtp in tehran cryptosporidium density in raw water source is only between 0 05 and 0 21 oocysts per liter thus it seems providing 3 log of reduction which is a minimum based on lt2eswtr u s epa 1998 may be sufficient to meet the expected health based target as presented in fig 6 physicochemical treatment can provide 2 31 log of the required lrv and the remaining 0 69 log should be provided by disinfection process the chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant in water treatment plants in iran and many other countries it is reported to be the primary disinfectant in 72 and as the secondary disinfectant in 22 of drinking water treatment facilities moghadam and dore 2012 however chlorine as an oxidant can produce some of potentially harmful by products such as trihalomethanes thms the requirements to control the formation of thms in drinking water have forced most of water utilities to seek for alternatives for chlorine moreover despite widespread use of chlorine as a disinfectant in water treatment systems cryptosporidium is resistant to chlorine u s epa 2001 as presented in table 4 disinfection segments in jalaliyeh wtp did not play a significant role in the inactivation of cryptosporidium using chlorine the total inactivation lrv by disinfection using chlorine was only 0 034 0 006 log this low level of efficacy confirms the resistance of cryptosporidium to chlorine in the studied water supply system moreover much commonly used bleach solutions have little effect on this parasite at the concentration levels normally used in water treatment u s epa 2001 therefore it is necessary in a conventional water treatment system to examine the performance of alternative disinfectants including ozone uv or clo2 in relation to inactivation of this parasite in following sections the qmra model will quantify directly the effect of change in alternative disinfectants dose on the treatment performance in terms of health effects 4 2 1 disinfection with clo2 clo2 has very high water solubility and can be applied in a wide range of ph between 5 and 10 au 2004 however inorganic compounds including chlorite clo2 and chlorate clo3 are the by products of clo2 korn et al 2002 according to fig 5a if clo2 is injected at intake point of jalaliyeh wtp see fig 4b in such a way that the residual clo2 is 4 5 mg l in transfer line the parasite s lrv is expected to be increased from 2 3 to 3 log see fig 6 then the logarithm of attributed infection risk will be decreased from 2 03 to a level of 2 76 95 ci 3 71 2 21 still greater than the allowed target 4 see fig 7 clo2 generally around 70 of clo2 injected into water is prone to be converted into clo2 and the maximum permissible level of clo2 in drinking water is recommended to be 1 mg l in order to meet this level in the treated water the injection dose for clo2 should not exceed 1 4 mg l hua and reckhow 2007 thus in our system clo2 can not only decrease the risk by the target but also it is impossible to maintain its residual concentration between 4 and 5 mg l in the transfer line practically this level for the residual clo2 may results in the formation of dbps which are the potential health threatening by products of clo2 therefore the use of clo2 instead of chlorine gas in the case of this treatment system may not be recommended moreover as presented in fig 5a the intercept of the qmra based risk decay exponential function which is expected to be close to the maximum of estimated risk 0 020 person year is 0 012 person year this inconsistency may be as another reason for the undesirability of clo2 scenario in other worlds the relationship presented in fig 2b to model the inactivation of cryptosporidium with clo2 could not provide a realistic information for the parasite inactivation therefore other relationships rather than the exponential model presented in fig 2b may be needed to model the effect of clo2 on the cryptosporidium inactivation in qmra 4 2 2 disinfection with ozone in moderate climatic conditions the ozonation process could provide around 99 inactivation for protozoan parasites at a relatively low dosage between 0 3 mg l to 1 and a short exposure contact time betancourt and rose 2004b ozone can be used as the primary or sole disinfectant and also as an oxidant for the control of odor color and to reduce the iron and manganese content of drinking water gottschalk et al 2009 pre ozonation is used to remove natural organic matters from surface water to control the formation of disinfection by products chiang et al 2009 as a strong oxidant ozone can be used as a substitute for chlorine at the beginning and middle of the treatment process in comparison with chlorine and clo2 ozone appears to form much smaller amounts of dbps chowdhury et al 2009 however ozone also has some limitations to be used as a substitute for chlorine it is unstable in water and by reaction with natural organic matters noms can produce biodegradable oxygenated by products and enhance the rate of biological regrowth in transfer line or distribution system to prevent the regrowth of biological agents algae and bacteria following the ozonation process a secondary disinfection process such as gas chlorination need to be applied to provide sufficient residual chlorine in the system glaze 1987 this is especially important in the case of jalaliyeh water supply system where water is transferring to wtp using a long distance 40 km transfer line which may provide enough time to regrowth of bacteria and algae if ozone is injected at the intake point enough residual chlorine must be provided to prevent bacteria and algae regrowth in water transmission line although the use of ozone followed by chlorine on its own may lead to the formation of bromate thms haloacetic acids haas and many other unregulated byproducts krasner et al 2006 the amount of dbps formation due to the combinations of ozone and chlorine still is lower than that for the case of chlorine usage alone chowdhury et al 2009 according to fig 5b the ozonation process with a dose of 0 75 mg l contact time of 30 min ct 22 5 followed by gas chlorination with a residual chlorine of 0 35 mg l at the inlet of wtp can provide an additional lrv of 2 75 for cryptosporidium see fig 6 considering 2 31 log of lrvtreat the total lrv for ozonation scenario will be 5 1 log in this scenario in logarithm scale the mean of infection risk for all age categories will be 4 74 95 ci 5 67 4 27 significantly lower i e 20 cases of infection per 1000 000 people per year than health based target of 4 the estimated mean of burden of disease 7 72 95 ci 8 69 7 21 was also significantly lower than the target of 6 as presented in fig 7 ozone fig 5b shows the exponential relationship between ozone dose and the estimated infection risk as presented the intercept of risk decay exponential function is 0 020 person year consistently equal to the maximum of the estimated risk 0 020 person year for the system thus because this base level of risk for ozone scenario is consistent with the estimated maximum excess risk for the system the results of this scenario seems to be about the real situation of the treatment system and suggest the implementation of ozonation as a practical alternative disinfection process for this water treatment system 4 2 3 disinfection with uv uv is a physical process with no dependency to the use of chemical additions this process has been proven to be highly effective in the inactivation of protozoan parasites with a relatively short contact times moreover no disinfection by products have been identified for uv process wolfe 1990 low doses of uv 1 9 mj cm2 have been proven to inactivate about 2 3 log of cryptosporidium oocysts craik et al 2001 despite the advantages of uv system some disadvantages are also realized including design and scale up issues the difficulty in measuring the dose of uv in practice interference of turbidity on uv absorbance and no lasting residual disinfection effect wolfe 1990 in this study uv process was assumed to be located after filtration units thus there will not be a concern about the effects of turbidity theoretically in our study based on figs 5c and 4d the application of a uv system with a low dose around 10 mj cm2 could provide 2 6 log of inactivation for cryptosporidium oocysts fig 6 then as presented in fig 7 uv the mean of infection risk will be 4 61 95 ci 5 60 4 03 i e 28 cases of infection per 1000 000 people per year significantly lower than the target of 10 4 person year the burden of disease was also estimated to be significantly lower than the target in this scenario of disinfection in this study the employment of a uv system with a dose of 10 mj cm2 can reduce the excess risk by the target of 10 4 person year but as presented in fig 5c the base level of risk in uv scenario 0 007 person year is about 2 85 fold lower than the maximum for the mean of estimated risk 0 020 person year for water supply system in other words the base level of risk in uv scenario is not consistent with the estimated maximum observed excess risk for the system therefore although the uv scenario can decrease the excess risk to a level lower than target but more consistent results may be obtained if applying a locally derived relationship instead of the equation in fig 2d in the qmra model 4 3 recommendations not only for current studied wtp but also for other conventional wtps where there is a concern regarding the presence of cryptosporidium in the finished water the excess risk attributed to this parasite can be quantified using the qmra approach presented in this study as presented in this study for the studied wtp the health based target was exceeded for water consumers by 60 to 200 fold therefore applying some control measures in order to minimize the excess risk is necessary although chlorine is the last treatment line of defense against microbial contaminants in most of conventional wtps especially in iran it is a weak disinfectant against cryptosporidium therefore even though the concern about the presence of this parasite is serious in the studied wtp but chlorine does not provide sufficient protection and the employment of ozone or uv as alternative disinfectants for the effective inactivation is recommended moreover application of these alternatives could be a remedy against the formation of different health threatening disinfection by products as another drawback for chlorine monitoring of waterborne protozoan parasites especially cryptosporidium in inlet and outlet water for the studied treatment system is recommended to be conducted routinely at least once per month this routine nature of monitoring will decrease the uncertainties in the results for the parasite measurement moreover by routine monitoring the unexpected extreme events such as heavy rains or floods and also equipment failures in treatment system which may dominate the average risk can be included in the qmra model some sources of uncertainty in the estimation of burden of disease for protozoan parasites are related to parameters including illness to infection ratio iill inf susceptibility fraction factor s severity weight of outcomes sw number of outcomes n and age at death ad some of these parameters may be obtained by referring to epidemiological recorded information for different age groups thus incorporating these age specific parameters in a qmra model may bring the qmra findings closer to the epidemiological observations and may reduce uncertainties in the estimation in the case of current studied system theoretically both ozonation and uv processes can be effective alternatives to reduce the excess risk of cryptosporidium however to select the best process the advantages and limitations of each process should be considered and its actual performance for the parasite inactivation and the reduction of excess risk should be determined moreover employment of an efficient detection method for protozoan parasites to differentiate infective parasite viable oocytes from non infective forms can increase the reliability of risk assessment results epa 1623 1 method is a standard method for quantification of protozoan parasites but as a limitation in the measurement of parasite when this method applies for finished water it requires to pass a high volume 1000 l of water through a filter cartridge this such use not only will increase the duration of sampling time but also can decrease the decompression and then washing capabilities of the foams inside the sampling filter cartridges significantly this may reduce the recovery of method moreover in this study the density of cryptosporidium in finished water was estimated based on statistical assumptions which could increase the uncertainty in results from a policy perspective expressing the adversely health effects of drinking water pathogens in terms of daly s will allow to compare the disease burden attributed to microbial hazards in drinking water to the burdens from other routes of exposure therefore similar qmra studies need to be conducted for other waterborne pathogens then the estimated overall burden of disease attributed to microbial contaminants in drinking water will help the policy maker to implement promotion strategies for drinking water supply system however the qmra tool may not stand alone and to be implemented effectively this tool requires more institutional supports 5 conclusions to ensure that a conventional water treatment system works properly different parameters including ph temperature residual chlorine and cryptosporidium density as a reference pathogen were monitored and the system performance was examined the estimated lrvs for the parasite found to be 2 31 and 0 034 log provided by physico chemical treatment and disinfection processes respectively the applied qmra approach demonstrated that the health based target of 10 4 for the infection risk of cryptosporidium in produced drinking water would be exceeded since chlorine did not meet the 3 log lrv qmra emphasized an urgent need for employment of additional treatments to control this excess risk modification of disinfection system using the employment of alternative disinfectants including clo2 uv and ozone may be needed to control the excess risk of cryptosporidium parasite however to model the inactivation effect of these disinfectants in a qmra scenario the relationships which describe their inactivation performance must be selected cautiously in this study such relationships were presented for ozone clo2 and uv the relationship for ozone provided more consistent results in comparison with the results obtained for clo2 and uv to improve the performance of a conventional water treatment system and to provide a safe water for the public to drink it can be highlighted that a new approach is needed instead of being strongly dependent on chlorine or its derivatives qmra as a risk based approach is such new approach can provide a better understanding of the whole conventional wtp declaration of interests the authors declare that they

18659,the performance of conventional drinking water treatment plants wtps can be improved using quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra a qmra study on cryptosporidium using actual pathogen density was conducted to examine the performance of jalaliyeh wtp in tehran iran the infection risk and the burden of disease attributed to the parasite presence in finished water were estimated incorporating physical and chemical log reduction values lrvs using stochastic modeling and disinfection profiling the risk and burden of disease were compared with health based targets i e one case of infection per 10 000 people or 10 6 dalys per person per year the parasite s lrvs were 2 31 and 0 034 log provided by physico chemical treatment and disinfection processes respectively the mean of estimated risk 111 cases per 104 people per year and the burden of disease 11 7 dalys per 106 people per year both exceeded the targets to control the excess risk three qmra based disinfection scenarios were examined including 1 employing chlorine dioxide clo2 instead of chlorine 2 ozonation with a concentration of 0 75 mg l ct 22 5 min mg l and 3 uv irradiation with a dose of 10 mj cm2 the lrv of parasite may be increased to 3 0 5 1 and 4 9 log by employing clo2 ozonation and uv irradiation respectively the use of ozone or uv as alternative disinfectants could enhance the disinfection efficacy and provide sufficient additional treatment against the excess risk of parasite qmra could make it easier applying appropriate improvement to conventional wtps in order to increase the system performance in terms of health based measures graphical abstract image 1 keywords burden of disease cryptosporidium infection risk quantitative microbial risk assessment water treatment plant 1 introduction the multiple barrier concept is an important principle for ensuring safe drinking water production it involves a series of measures and barriers from the source through to consumer to protect water quality betancourt and rose 2004a to ensure that the produced water is safe for consumption the drinking water treatment plants wtps need to be monitored for the reduction performance of microbial contaminants that pose threat to public health geldreich 1996 among microbial contaminants protozoan parasites are considered an important public health problem due to their widespread occurrence and their resistance to treatment and disinfection processes teunis and havelaar 2002 the protection of drinking water resources and applying multiple barrier concept against protozoan parasites are of major concerns for water utilities worldwide karanis et al 2007 in many countries several guidelines have been developed for monitoring the presence of protozoan parasites in drinking water supply systems the mandatory monitoring of protozoan parasites from source to tap water and the implementation of risk assessment approaches are some tasks have been highlighted in these guidelines and are performed regularly in many developed countries for the production of safe drinking water smeets et al 2009 according to long term second enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2eswtr the water supply systems serving more than 100 000 people should be monitored for the presence of protozoan parasites and other microbial agents u s epa 2006 if monitoring results confirm the mean density of protozoan parasites in source samples exceeds 10 cysts or oocysts per liter the corresponding drinking water treatment system needs to be monitored in terms of its performance for the removal of the parasites u s epa 2006 the performance of a conventional treatment system to minimize the concerns for the probable presence of protozoan parasites in finished water can be assessed using risk assessment techniques regli et al 1991 moreover according to guidelines the amount of water treatment should be provided to the extent that the risk of infection for the consumer is less than one case per 10 000 people per year who 2011 in iran there are no mandatory requirements for monitoring of protozoan parasites in drinking water supply systems indeed the performance of most of wtps in iran is strongly dependent to the disinfection process which relies on chlorine and its derivate compounds moreover the drinking water supply systems in iran have not yet adopted well to the recently presented risk assessment approaches in world health organization guideline who 2011 therefore there is a critical need for the application of risk assessment approaches to quantify the performance of drinking water systems these approaches can be applied to examine and control the risk of protozoan parasites presence in drinking water which seems to be a concern in most developing countries among the protozoan parasites cryptosporidium is a main pathogen with world wide distribution cryptosporidium has been categorized as a reference pathogen for the assessment of drinking water quality medema et al 2009 moreover this parasite has been considered as the primary target for effective disinfection of protozoa in drinking water systems korich et al 1990 for a raw water with a mean cryptosporidium density between 0 075 and fewer than 1 0 oocysts l the treatment system must be able to provide 3 log 99 9 of reduction u s epa 2006 today in many countries and especially in iran the chlorination is a common practice to reduce the risk of pathogenic infectious agents but chlorine has a low efficacy for inactivation of cryptosporidium oocysts corona vasquez et al 2002 driedger et al 2000 2001 moreover it may pose a chemical threat to human health due to the production of disinfection by products dbps therefore finding appropriate alternatives to chlorine to control the probable excess risk of cryptosporidium and also to reduce the treatment systems dependency to chlorine are of great importance while these important targets are somewhat ambitious in many countries they may be achieved using the implementation of quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra technique in tehran the capital of iran the prevalence of cryptosporidium has been well documented in human stools dalimi et al 2014 calves stools ranjbar bahadori et al 2011 horse stools mirian et al 2010 rats stools fares et al 2012 soil of public places tavalla et al 2014 and vegetable farms ranjbar bahadori et al 2013 but few investigations have been conducted on the occurrence of cryptosporidium in surface waters hadi et al 2016 mahmoudi et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge none of these investigations have yet examined the health effects due to the exposure to this parasite via treated surface drinking water cryptosporidium has numerous species and subtypes identified by molecular means xiao and fayer 2008 many of them have been recognized as infectious agents to the human population robinson et al 2008 among cryptosporidium species cryptosporidium parvum subtypes iid and iida15g1 and cryptosporidium hominis subtype id ida20 were the most predominant species of cryptosporidium identified in karaj river mahmoudi et al 2015 a river which supplies a considerable portion of drinking water of tehran through jalaliyeh wtp using gene sequence analysis these subtypes have been identified in humans samples in tehran taghipour et al 2011 thus karaj river seems to be a source of infectious subtypes of cryptosporidium which may even be transferred to finished drinking water therefore monitoring the change of parasite density from river to the point of water use the estimation of its log reduction value lrv within the treatment system and the quantification of attributed health risk are of a great importance in this paper a qmra approach was applied to assess the performance of jalaliyeh wtp in tehran the system s performance to reduce the infection risk attributed to cryptosporidium parasite was assessed the aims of the study were 1 to determine the treatment lrvs for the parasite by monitoring its actual density and applying stochastic modeling 2 to estimate the infection risk and the burden of disease attributed to the presence of parasite in finished water and 3 to examine the performance of different disinfection scenarios using ozone uv irradiation and chlorine dioxide clo2 to control the excess risk of parasite the health based targets i e one case of infection per 10 000 people per year and 10 6 dalys per person per year who 2011 were used as a basis for judgment of the system performance 2 material and methods 2 1 jalaliyeh water treatment plant jalaliyeh wtp is served by bilaghan intake point on karaj river with nominal and maximum capacities of 2 7 and 3 m3 s respectively fig 1 the pre treatment process at bilaghan involves grit removal using sedimentation basins and pre chlorination with pure gas chlorine after pre treatment water is transferred by gravity to the treatment plant through two lines of 1 m diameter steel pipes with a length of 40 km the treatment plant involves six clarifloculators cf with a total capacity of 1600 cubic meters ferric chloride as a coagulant and lime as a coagulant aid are the main chemicals in this clarification process the filtration system involves forty units of sand filter aquazur n with a capacity of 240 270 m3 hr after post disinfection with pure gas chlorine clear water is collected in a clearwell with a capacity of 3000 m3 and then is transferred by gravity or by pumping to the reservoirs on distribution system in this study as presented in fig 1 the wtp was divided into three zones of treatment and three segments of disinfection 2 2 sampling and pathogen detection water samples were taken at six distinct points a b c d e and f of the treatment system as illustrated in fig 1 the samples were taken monthly for a period of 15 months and all of them were analyzed for temperature residual chlorine ph and turbidity cryptosporidium parasite was only measured at a c d and f sampling points fig 1 cryptosporidium was analyzed using method 1623 1 u s epa 2012 the volumes of collected samples were 50 l for raw water samples 50 100 l for outlet of cf units and 1000 l for finished water samples the samples were directly passed through the idexx filtration cartridges the measurement procedure for the parasite involves washing the filter cartridge by phosphate buffered saline pbs and concentrating the elution using polysulphone membrane the produced concentrate was further concentrated by centrifugation and exposed to the immunomagnetic separation ims procedure using flat sided leighton tube containing buffers and cryptosporidium ims beads the sample was incubated and rocked using magnetic particle concentrators after the aspiration of supernatant the remaining liquid was acidified to dissociate bead oocyst complexes acidified suspension was then transferred to the wells of microscope slide after drying and fixing the sample fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc conjugated monoclonal antibodies mab were added to slide wells the slide was incubated and washed with pbs solution for any remaining fitc mab it then dried mounted and covered by applying coverslips subsequent examination was then performed under epifluorescence optics for further details of the procedure for pathogen detection in this study the reader is referred to the previous work of the authors hadi et al 2016 the epa method 1623 1 has been developed only to count the oo cysts of protozoan parasites and the species of the parasites cannot be determined by this method however the qmra technique in this study assumes that all of the oocysts probably present in the exposure are infectious to humans even though the laboratory method of detection employed did not identify species of the parasite the recovery efficiency of detection method was also determined by placing a known number of oocysts 100 2 1 from a suspension of oocysts provided by easy seed biotechnology frontiers australia in distilled water milliq millipore submitted to the same analytical procedure the paired dataset on the initial known number of oocysts and the number of oocysts recovered were used to model the recovery efficiency using beta distribution estimation of this distribution parameters by means of the paired beta model is explained in detail by teunis et al 1999 2009 the estimated average for recovery of parasite was 37 2 7 68 2 3 modeling the parasite density in source water in this study the source water dataset was included fifteen samples with a minimum and a maximum of 2 and 10 oocysts 50l respectively assuming that the distribution of parasite in each sample is random the numbers of parasite in a particular sample n with mean concentration μ and sample volume v is poisson distributed fisher et al 1922 1 f n μ v e μ v μ v n n if n samples with different sizes of v1 to vn are taken at different times of the year then μ itself may vary with time and assumed to be described by gamma distribution with parameters r and λ under this assumption the probability of finding n1 to nn organisms in samples can be described by negative binomial distribution el shaarawi et al 1981 2 g n λ r v γ r n n γ r λ r v n λ v r n 2 4 modeling the parasite removal fraction in treatment zones according to this idea that any single parasite has a certain probability of passing a treatment process some models based on binomial probability of passage has been reported by teunis et al 1999 if the probability of the parasite passage does not depend on its density the process as a binomial process can be described by assuming two types of paired and unpaired models for the samples with paired samples any pair of samples from inlet and outlet of each zone are taken simultaneously but for unpaired samples the samples are not taken simultaneously teunis et al 2009 in a real water treatment system the samples taken before and after a treatment zone are almost always unpaired i e they are not exactly the same water sampled because of a time delay in the treatment zone in this study therefore the unpaired model was used to estimate the removal fraction of the parasite in each zone of treatment in a given volume v of inlet water sample for each treatment zone the number of parasites can be described by negative binomial distribution as presented in eq 2 teunis et al 1999 in any unpaired sample from the outlet of the treatment zone with a volume of w the distribution of parasite is again poisson distributed with parameter πμw where π is the probability of the parasite passage leading to a mean density of πμ in outlet sample similarly assuming πμ is also follows a gamma distribution with parameters λ π and r the distribution of the number of parasite in an outlet sample will be teunis et al 1999 3 h k π λ r w γ r k k γ r λ r π w k λ π w r k if π itself varies between samples according to a beta distribution this leads to teunis et al 1999 4 h k λ r α β w w λ k r k k α β α k β f 1 2 k r α k α β k w λ where α β is the pochhammer symbol and 2f1 is a hypergeometric function a log likelihood function can be calculated by using two eqs 2 and 4 for the input and output samples and all parameters λ r α and β can be estimated by numerical optimization teunis et al 1999 2 5 modeling of parasite density in finished water when all of the analyzed samples are not detectable in the case of finished water samples for outlet of a zone schijven et al 2011 assumed that a gamma distribution with parameters r 0 01 and λ 1 vi 0 01 could provide an estimate of the parasite density in outlet where vi is the sum of all the samples taken from zone outlet this distribution can be regarded as a maximum estimate of the density in this study cryptosporidium density in all outlet samples of filtration zone were not detectable thus a maximum estimate of the parasite density was made based on schijven et al 2011 assumption moreover in this study all oocysts were assumed to be viable and infectious 2 6 modeling the inactivation of parasite the inactivation lrv for cryptosporidium was calculated according to usepa disinfection profiling and benchmarking guidance manual u s epa 1999 chlorine is used as a disinfectant in three different segments in jalaliyeh wtp 1 gas chlorination at bilaghan intake 2 hypochlorination at the inlet of the treatment plant and 3 gas chlorination after filtration units in order to maintain sufficient residual chlorine in distribution system to profile the disinfection process the ct residual disinfectant c mg l multiplied by the contact time t min and the inactivation rate of the parasite were calculated in order to model the inactivation rate available ct and required ct were calculated for each disinfection segment u s epa 2003 in this study the role of chlorine and other disinfectants including ozone clo2 and uv as alternatives for chlorine in the inactivation of cryptosporidium were examined incorporating the models illustrated in fig 2 into qmra simulation in a study by corona vasquez et al 2002 chlorine was used as a single disinfectant to inactivate cryptosporidium oocysts in a temperature range of 4 30 c the averaged ct values to provide 2 log of inactivation at 4 10 20 and 30 c were 23260 10366 5153 and 1500 mg min l respectively as presented in fig 2a an exponential model with r2 0 98 was used to estimate the required ct from temperature to meet 2 log of inactivation for the parasite using chlorine the average temperature values in the studied wtp measured to be 11 89 0 86 and 14 59 0 74 c for the inlet and outlet water samples respectively fig 2 b c and d represent the models used for clo2 ozone and uv respectively to estimate the required ct for the inactivation of parasite these models are based on the experimental data reported by epa which are available in nova scotia water treatment standard snook 2003 after the estimation of required ct ctreq the available ct ctavl and then the total log of inactivation tloginac were determined as follows 1 measuring temperature ph and concentration of residual chlorine before and after each disinfection segment at the peak of hourly flow 2 estimation of the theoretical detention time dt in all units of each segment the contact time in the water transfer line was estimated using open channel calculations by taking into account a height difference of 124 m between bilaghan intake and jalaliyeh wtp the manning coefficient of 0 01 for steel pipes with a length of 40 km and diameter of 1 m and the flow of 2 54 0 05 m3 s the r code for calculation is available as supplementary material 3 calculation the adjusted dt dtadj using baffling

inactivation ratio in different disinfection scenarios were estimated according to the procedure presented in table 1 as presented for each disinfection scenario the amount of inactivation lrv lrvinact was determined by estimating the amount of ctavl in different segments of disinfection then the total inactivation lrv provided by each disinfectant was estimated as follows clo2 using the equation presented in fig 2b the required ct to provide 3 log of inactivation was calculated based on the actual temperature of each water sample then for assumed residual clo2 of 0 1 0 12 0 15 0 2 0

ozone uv for different assumed uv doses of 1 5 2 1 3 0 5 2 7 7 and 11 mj cm2 the inactivation lrv logseg2 uv was estimated using the equation presented in fig 2d the logseg2 uv then was summed with the inactivation lrvs for other segments to obtain the total inactivation lrv for uv scenario tloginact uv the treatment lrv lrvtreat was the same for all scenarios because no changes were made for the treatment units performance in the system lrvtreat or rlog was determined by summing up the estimated lrvs in different zones of treatment the total parasite removal ratio prr then calculated by multiplying the decimals by minus power of lrvs for disinfection segments and treatment zones 2 7 exposure estimation and risk characterization the magnitude of exposure was estimated by incorporating

tloginact and water ingestion rate ir l day the cold tap drinking water per capita consumption for different age categories less than 2 2 to 6 6 to 16 and older than 16 years old was estimated based on data in karyab et al 2013 the ir variable was incorporated in the qmra model using lognormal distribution with the parameters summarized in table 2 the dose of pathogen ingestion by a consumer was calculated by incorporation of ir csource recovery rec and prr in the following equation 11 d o s e i r c s o u r c e 1 re c 10 t l o g i n a c t i 1 n 10 r l o g i the daily infection risk was determined using a 1f1 hypergeometric dose response model based on dose response data of cryptosporidum parvum teunis et al 2002 and cryptosporidium hominis chappell et al 2006 as follows 12 p inf p e r s o n d a y 1 f 1 1 α α β d o s e where 1f1 is the confluent hypergeometric function the risks of infection and illness per year for an individual were estimated as follows 13 p inf p e r s o n y e

human challenge study conducted by okhuysen et al 1999 to examine the infectivity of three cryptosporidium parvum isolates for healthy adults i as illness attack rate for these isolates was reported to be between 52 and 86 assuming a most likely value of 70 in our study a pert distribution for i with parameters values of imin 0 52 imax 0 86 and imode 0 70 was assumed to model the uncertainty around i the proportion of the population susceptible to cryptosporidiosis infection s was assumed to be unity as a deterministic value health canada 2012 the health burden hb for gastroenteritis from infection with cryptosporidium in drinking water in terms of daly per case was calculated as follows 15 hb daly case lyl yld where lyl is the life years lost lyl due to premature mortality and yld is years lost due to disability yld for people living with the health condition or its consequences lyl and yld were calculated as follows 16 y l d i 1 n o f d i s w 17 l y l i 1 n o f l e a d s w where of is outcome fraction 0 1 di is duration of illness years sw is severity weight of outcome 0 1 n is the number of outcomes le is life expectancy years and ad is age at death years the health outcomes of cryptosporidium vary in severity from mild to severe diarrhea and potentially death in this study the lyl and yld for cryptosporidiosis were calculated based on the mortality and morbidity outcome fractions of 0 00001 and 0 99999 respectively havelaar and melse 2003 the severity of morbidity and mortality due to cryptosporidiosis were considered to be 0 067 and 1 respectively howard et al 2006 the mean duration of illness was considered to be 0 01918 year 7 2 days havelaar and melse 2003 thus the estimated yld for gastroenteritis resulting from the mild diarrhea was 1 286 dalys 1000 cases 1

respectively fig 3 shows the consequent steps used for the estimation of infection risk and burden of disease the risk assessment modeling was implemented using qmraspot schijven et al 2011 r version 3 3 1 r core team 2015 was also used for the calculation of hydraulic contact time see section 2 6 fitting the lognormal distribution to water consumption data table 2 and producing descriptive statistics tables 3 and 4 and plots fig 7 2 8 variability and uncertainty in qmra model typically uncertainties in a qmra are due to natural variation aleatory uncertainty and lack of knowledge epistemic uncertainty the quantity of each component of the exposure assessment may vary both spatially and temporally leading to variability in the estimated risk who 2016 the variables including the pathogen concentration in source and in finished drinking waters the estimated lrvs for parasite in treatment zones the rate of water intake or exposure volume and dose response model parameters are some sources of variability in the qmra model in this study this kind of inherent variability or aleatory uncertainty in the variables was described by statistical distributions the parameters of these statistical distributions themselves can be hierarchically represented by other distributions for example in the qmraspot schijven et al 2011 tool which was used in this study the exact beta poisson dose response model is applied using pairs of different α and β parameters to reflect the variability and uncertainty of infectivity for cryptosporidium pathogen these parameters are included in the code of qmraspot as monte carlo samples of the dose response parameters schijven et al 2011 briefly a joint distribution of dose response models for cryptosporidum parvum teunis et al 2002 and cryptosporidium hominis chappell et al 2006 was used to estimate the parameters α β then the exact beta poisson dose response model using the hypergeometric function 1f1 was applied with pairs of different α and β values in this study to incorporate the variability of each variable and the uncertainty of the parameters the stochastic simulation was conducted using qmraspot schijven et al 2011 2 9 qmra scenarios analysis since cryptosporidium oocysts are resistant to chlorine disinfectant who 2011 in this study three additional disinfectants uv clo2 and ozone were also assumed be used to reduce the probable excess risk of the parasite in the system current status of existing treatment system and the system status for alternative scenarios to control the excess risk of parasite are presented in fig 4 in the first scenario fig 4b the gas chlorine disinfection process at intake pre chlorination step was assumed to be replaced by a clo2 disinfection process to provide a sufficient residual clo2 at the inlet of plant in the second scenario fig 4c an ozonation process was assumed to be used as pre treatment step followed by gas chlorination but by half the rate of current gas chlorine injection dose in the third scenario fig 4d an ultraviolet irradiation uv process was assumed to be used after the filtration system and the gas chlorine injection was reduced by half at the intake point 3 results 3 1 parasite density variation in the number of cryptosporidium oocysts from river to tap water is shown in table 3 the maximum and mean densities of oocysts in source water samples were 0 216 and 0 064 oocysts l respectively as summarized in table 3 density of parasite has been decreased from 0 064 oocysts l in source water to 0 010 oocysts l in the inlet of wtp after passing water through the pre treatment process and experiencing a 40 km transmission line during the pre treatment and transmission of water around 0 73 log reduction for the parasite was provided which may be due to pre sedimentation or oocysts entrapment in pipe wall biofilms dumètre et al 2012 during the treatment process in cf units coagulation flocculation and sedimentation the density of parasite was decreased by one eighteenth 0 0036 oocysts l of the source density and around 0 38 log reduction was provided by cf units the density of cryptosporidium in finished water was decreased to 0 00018 oocysts l 1 2 log reduction 3 2 inactivation of parasite table 4 represents the descriptive statistics of the estimated parameters in disinfection segments the estimated contact time for chlorine in water transmission line was 2 30 0 01 h and the corresponding ctavl for the first segment of disinfection was estimated to be 93 15 15 59 min mg l the retention time in the second segment of disinfection which included cf and filtration units was 0 91 0 02 h in this segment the estimated values for ctavl and ctreq to provide 2 log of inactivation were 45 77 2 62 and 8404 534 5 min mg l respectively in the third segment gas chlorine is added to water before entering into the clearwell a 3000 m3 pool as the last stop of water before distribution the retention time of water in pool was estimated to be 0 23 0 005 h the available and required cts to provide 2 log of inactivation for cryptosporidium in third segment were 12 63 0 75 and 7635 601 min mg l respectively as presented in table 4 comparison of ctavl and ctreq for 2 log inactivation of cryptosporidium confirms the inadequacy of the residual chlorine for the inactivation of the parasite in the first segment of disinfection only around one percent rinac 0 01 0 002 of ctreq is provided by residual chlorine in this segment thus chlorine alone could not inactivate the parasite sufficiently and therefore a greater level of inactivation is required to be provided in subsequent disinfection segments or treatment zones similarly the second segment of disinfection was only able to provide a low level of inactivation ratio 0 55 of ctreq the third segment of disinfection also provided only 0 16 rinac 0 0016 0 020 of ctreq according to table 4 as presented in table 4 the disinfection process using chlorine only provided a total lrvinact of 0 034 0 006 for the parasite 3 3 infection risk and burden of disease the estimated infection risk and burden of disease attributed to cryptosporidium in finished water for different age groups under current wtp practices fig 4a are summarized in table 5 as presented the estimated number of infection cases and dalys for 2 2 6 6 16 and 16 years age groups were 60 44 140 and 200 cases per 10 000 people per year and 6 4 10 6 4 7 10 6 1 5 10 5 and 2 1 10 5 dalys per person per year respectively the estimated mean and percentiles 97 5th and 2 5th for the infection risk and burden of disease using other different scenarios of disinfection clo2 ozone and uv are also illustrated in fig 7 3 4 disinfection scenarios for risk control in this study the performance of clo2 ozone and uv as alternative disinfectants to control the excess risk of parasite were examined in different qmra based scenarios as presented in fig 4 in addition to assess the performance of current status of existing treatment system with pre chlorination rate of c mg l fig 4a three other alternative disinfectants including clo2 without pre chlorination fig 4b ozone with pre chlorination rate of c 2 mg l fig 4c and uv with pre chlorination rate of c 2 mg l fig 4d were also examined assuming a same lrvtreat for all qmra based scenarios the relationships for the infection risk versus residual clo2 concentration doses of ozone and uv were illustrated in fig 5 using these relationships the required concentration of residual clo2 and required doses for ozone and uv to reduce the excess risk to the target were estimated the estimated values of available lrvs for different qmra based scenarios were compared with the required one as presented in fig 6 as shown when chlorine is used as the only disinfectant in the system it provides only 0 03 log of reduction considering a lrvtreat of 2 31 for physical treatment units a total lrv of 2 34 lower than the required one 3 log for the current status of existing treatment system was provided see fig 4a providing a value of 0 7 additional lrv clo2 increased the total lrv by 3 01 just equal to the required one ozone and uv with lrvinact of 2 75 and 2 62 increased the total lrv to 5 06 and 4 93 log respectively which are 1 68 and 1 64 fold higher than the amount of required lrv 4 discussion 4 1 infection risk and burden of disease as presented in table 5 the mean of estimated infection risk 111 cases per 104 people per year and the burden of disease 11 7 dalys per 106 people per year both exceeded the targets based on fig 7 cl comparison the mean for the estimated infection risk 2 03 log10 95 ci 2 91 1 48 with the target i e one infection case per 10 000 people or 4 in log10 scale suggests the target is exceeded for all age groups based on means of 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles by 12 to 327 fold similarly the estimated burden of disease log10 95 ci 5 93 4 42 for all age groups was greater by 1 15 37 75 fold relative to who proposed target of 10 6 daly per person per year which is still a less strict value since all oocysts detected or estimated in this study were assumed to be viable and infectious for the human the infection risk and burden of disease both were estimated for a worse case condition for water supply system using qmra moreover it was assumed all age groups ingest only cold tap water thus the effect of water boiling before usage was not considered which could maximize the estimated risk based on an epidemiological study kolahi et al 2008 the incidence of acute diarrhea among 6 12 13 24 25 36 37 48 and 49 60 years age groups in tehran were estimated to be 20 4 15 4 8 8 6 5 and 4 1 respectively according to these estimations a greater incidence for acute diarrhea is expected to be observed for lower categories of age groups for example in a study by al shamiri et al 2010 the rate of diarrheal infection by cryptosporidium spp found to be highest among the preschool age group of 2 6 years in yemen sato et al 2013 also indicated children are more susceptible to protozoal infections approximately 3 to 4 fold higher than that for the total population as presented in table 5 see fig 7 estimated infection risk and the burden of disease for age groups 2 and 2 6 years were lower than those for 6 16 and 16 years age groups while the rate of diarrheic diseases among children is expected to be epidemiologically more than that for adults this inconsistency in findings in comparison to the epidemiological studies may be due to several reasons first drinking water ingestion is not the only route of exposure to the parasite moreover applying a same dose response model same severity and probability factors for health outcomes same illness to infection ratio iill inf parameter and also a same susceptibility fraction factor s for all categories of age while the rate of water intake is lower for children than that for adults observing a lower level of risk for children may be inevitable in another word in this study the only individual based factor which affected the infection risk is the water intake rate ir thus applying age specific values for iill inf s severity and probability for health outcomes for different categories of age may provide more consistent results moreover hand to mouth transfer of oocysts after touching contaminated materials soils surfaces waters foods and even human or animal faces which may be experienced with more probability by children in public parks dado et al 2012 primary schools lee and greig 2010 and day care centers enserink et al 2015 is another important route of exposure among children mattioli et al 2015 show children ingest a significantly greater amount of microbial contaminants each day from hand to mouth transmission pathway than from drinking water this may be another reason why the drinking water pathway estimated in this study has a lower risk for children as opposed to adults although the estimated risk values for age groups in this study are not consistent with epidemiological expectations the averaged risk values for age groups is nearly consistent with the approximated prevalence of cryptosporidium diarrheal infection in tehran keshavarz et al 2008 reported that the prevalence of confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis infection among 12 years children with diarrhea symptom is 2 4 in tehran considering 20 4 kolahi et al 2008 for diarrhea prevalence in children using rule of thumb out of 10 000 healthy children 50 children are expected to be infected with cryptosporidium in tehran according to table 5 and fig 7 cl the averaged value of pill person year for 2 16 years age group is 0 0056 per person per year this means out of 10 000 healthy children 56 95 ci 6 179 children are expected to be ill by consumption of the produced drinking water of the studied wtp this value is 1 12 fold 95 ci 0 12 3 58 higher than aforementioned 50 cases of illness based on the epidemiological studies however this 50 cases of illness may not all be infected through the ingestion of drinking water and certainly the parasite may be transmitted through other routs of exposure therefore since in this study the oocysts density in finished water was estimated using statistical assumptions and moreover the oocysts were all assumed to be viable and infectious for the human and also it was assumed all age groups ingest only cold tap water these estimated 56 cases of illness per year seems to be overestimated due to the uncertainties of our assumptions in addition to variables such as the probability of exposure to pathogens which seems to be grater among children the inclusion of immunity information in the risk assessment model may also be effective to reduce the uncertainties in the estimations research by teunis et al 2002 indicated that a protective effect against infection can be resulted from prior infection with cryptosporidium parvum however the duration of this protective effect is short lived less than one year and to develop a protective immunity repeated exposures to the parasite is needed therefore incorporation of information including the proportion of population with prior infection in risk assessment analysis may improves the risk model certainty however in this study to control the excess risk of cryptosporidium in drinking water three theoretical qmra based scenarios for the disinfection system were examined which will be discussed in following section 4 2 disinfection scenarios for the excess risk control based on lt2eswtr u s epa 1998 a wtp must be able to provide at least a lrv of 3 log 99 9 for cryptosporidium pathogen accordingly the canadian standard health canada 2012 also requires a minimum of 3 lrv for cryptosporidium in drinking water treatment systems whether or not filtration technology is in place the required amount of parasite lrv in a water treatment system is dependent on the magnitude of parasite density in influent of system for example in netherlands the density of cryptosporidium in the country s raw water resources is considerable between 1 2 and 128 oocysts per liter smeets et al 2009 and the required lrv for this parasite supposed to be around 5 log however as presented in table 3 for jalaliyah wtp in tehran cryptosporidium density in raw water source is only between 0 05 and 0 21 oocysts per liter thus it seems providing 3 log of reduction which is a minimum based on lt2eswtr u s epa 1998 may be sufficient to meet the expected health based target as presented in fig 6 physicochemical treatment can provide 2 31 log of the required lrv and the remaining 0 69 log should be provided by disinfection process the chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant in water treatment plants in iran and many other countries it is reported to be the primary disinfectant in 72 and as the secondary disinfectant in 22 of drinking water treatment facilities moghadam and dore 2012 however chlorine as an oxidant can produce some of potentially harmful by products such as trihalomethanes thms the requirements to control the formation of thms in drinking water have forced most of water utilities to seek for alternatives for chlorine moreover despite widespread use of chlorine as a disinfectant in water treatment systems cryptosporidium is resistant to chlorine u s epa 2001 as presented in table 4 disinfection segments in jalaliyeh wtp did not play a significant role in the inactivation of cryptosporidium using chlorine the total inactivation lrv by disinfection using chlorine was only 0 034 0 006 log this low level of efficacy confirms the resistance of cryptosporidium to chlorine in the studied water supply system moreover much commonly used bleach solutions have little effect on this parasite at the concentration levels normally used in water treatment u s epa 2001 therefore it is necessary in a conventional water treatment system to examine the performance of alternative disinfectants including ozone uv or clo2 in relation to inactivation of this parasite in following sections the qmra model will quantify directly the effect of change in alternative disinfectants dose on the treatment performance in terms of health effects 4 2 1 disinfection with clo2 clo2 has very high water solubility and can be applied in a wide range of ph between 5 and 10 au 2004 however inorganic compounds including chlorite clo2 and chlorate clo3 are the by products of clo2 korn et al 2002 according to fig 5a if clo2 is injected at intake point of jalaliyeh wtp see fig 4b in such a way that the residual clo2 is 4 5 mg l in transfer line the parasite s lrv is expected to be increased from 2 3 to 3 log see fig 6 then the logarithm of attributed infection risk will be decreased from 2 03 to a level of 2 76 95 ci 3 71 2 21 still greater than the allowed target 4 see fig 7 clo2 generally around 70 of clo2 injected into water is prone to be converted into clo2 and the maximum permissible level of clo2 in drinking water is recommended to be 1 mg l in order to meet this level in the treated water the injection dose for clo2 should not exceed 1 4 mg l hua and reckhow 2007 thus in our system clo2 can not only decrease the risk by the target but also it is impossible to maintain its residual concentration between 4 and 5 mg l in the transfer line practically this level for the residual clo2 may results in the formation of dbps which are the potential health threatening by products of clo2 therefore the use of clo2 instead of chlorine gas in the case of this treatment system may not be recommended moreover as presented in fig 5a the intercept of the qmra based risk decay exponential function which is expected to be close to the maximum of estimated risk 0 020 person year is 0 012 person year this inconsistency may be as another reason for the undesirability of clo2 scenario in other worlds the relationship presented in fig 2b to model the inactivation of cryptosporidium with clo2 could not provide a realistic information for the parasite inactivation therefore other relationships rather than the exponential model presented in fig 2b may be needed to model the effect of clo2 on the cryptosporidium inactivation in qmra 4 2 2 disinfection with ozone in moderate climatic conditions the ozonation process could provide around 99 inactivation for protozoan parasites at a relatively low dosage between 0 3 mg l to 1 and a short exposure contact time betancourt and rose 2004b ozone can be used as the primary or sole disinfectant and also as an oxidant for the control of odor color and to reduce the iron and manganese content of drinking water gottschalk et al 2009 pre ozonation is used to remove natural organic matters from surface water to control the formation of disinfection by products chiang et al 2009 as a strong oxidant ozone can be used as a substitute for chlorine at the beginning and middle of the treatment process in comparison with chlorine and clo2 ozone appears to form much smaller amounts of dbps chowdhury et al 2009 however ozone also has some limitations to be used as a substitute for chlorine it is unstable in water and by reaction with natural organic matters noms can produce biodegradable oxygenated by products and enhance the rate of biological regrowth in transfer line or distribution system to prevent the regrowth of biological agents algae and bacteria following the ozonation process a secondary disinfection process such as gas chlorination need to be applied to provide sufficient residual chlorine in the system glaze 1987 this is especially important in the case of jalaliyeh water supply system where water is transferring to wtp using a long distance 40 km transfer line which may provide enough time to regrowth of bacteria and algae if ozone is injected at the intake point enough residual chlorine must be provided to prevent bacteria and algae regrowth in water transmission line although the use of ozone followed by chlorine on its own may lead to the formation of bromate thms haloacetic acids haas and many other unregulated byproducts krasner et al 2006 the amount of dbps formation due to the combinations of ozone and chlorine still is lower than that for the case of chlorine usage alone chowdhury et al 2009 according to fig 5b the ozonation process with a dose of 0 75 mg l contact time of 30 min ct 22 5 followed by gas chlorination with a residual chlorine of 0 35 mg l at the inlet of wtp can provide an additional lrv of 2 75 for cryptosporidium see fig 6 considering 2 31 log of lrvtreat the total lrv for ozonation scenario will be 5 1 log in this scenario in logarithm scale the mean of infection risk for all age categories will be 4 74 95 ci 5 67 4 27 significantly lower i e 20 cases of infection per 1000 000 people per year than health based target of 4 the estimated mean of burden of disease 7 72 95 ci 8 69 7 21 was also significantly lower than the target of 6 as presented in fig 7 ozone fig 5b shows the exponential relationship between ozone dose and the estimated infection risk as presented the intercept of risk decay exponential function is 0 020 person year consistently equal to the maximum of the estimated risk 0 020 person year for the system thus because this base level of risk for ozone scenario is consistent with the estimated maximum excess risk for the system the results of this scenario seems to be about the real situation of the treatment system and suggest the implementation of ozonation as a practical alternative disinfection process for this water treatment system 4 2 3 disinfection with uv uv is a physical process with no dependency to the use of chemical additions this process has been proven to be highly effective in the inactivation of protozoan parasites with a relatively short contact times moreover no disinfection by products have been identified for uv process wolfe 1990 low doses of uv 1 9 mj cm2 have been proven to inactivate about 2 3 log of cryptosporidium oocysts craik et al 2001 despite the advantages of uv system some disadvantages are also realized including design and scale up issues the difficulty in measuring the dose of uv in practice interference of turbidity on uv absorbance and no lasting residual disinfection effect wolfe 1990 in this study uv process was assumed to be located after filtration units thus there will not be a concern about the effects of turbidity theoretically in our study based on figs 5c and 4d the application of a uv system with a low dose around 10 mj cm2 could provide 2 6 log of inactivation for cryptosporidium oocysts fig 6 then as presented in fig 7 uv the mean of infection risk will be 4 61 95 ci 5 60 4 03 i e 28 cases of infection per 1000 000 people per year significantly lower than the target of 10 4 person year the burden of disease was also estimated to be significantly lower than the target in this scenario of disinfection in this study the employment of a uv system with a dose of 10 mj cm2 can reduce the excess risk by the target of 10 4 person year but as presented in fig 5c the base level of risk in uv scenario 0 007 person year is about 2 85 fold lower than the maximum for the mean of estimated risk 0 020 person year for water supply system in other words the base level of risk in uv scenario is not consistent with the estimated maximum observed excess risk for the system therefore although the uv scenario can decrease the excess risk to a level lower than target but more consistent results may be obtained if applying a locally derived relationship instead of the equation in fig 2d in the qmra model 4 3 recommendations not only for current studied wtp but also for other conventional wtps where there is a concern regarding the presence of cryptosporidium in the finished water the excess risk attributed to this parasite can be quantified using the qmra approach presented in this study as presented in this study for the studied wtp the health based target was exceeded for water consumers by 60 to 200 fold therefore applying some control measures in order to minimize the excess risk is necessary although chlorine is the last treatment line of defense against microbial contaminants in most of conventional wtps especially in iran it is a weak disinfectant against cryptosporidium therefore even though the concern about the presence of this parasite is serious in the studied wtp but chlorine does not provide sufficient protection and the employment of ozone or uv as alternative disinfectants for the effective inactivation is recommended moreover application of these alternatives could be a remedy against the formation of different health threatening disinfection by products as another drawback for chlorine monitoring of waterborne protozoan parasites especially cryptosporidium in inlet and outlet water for the studied treatment system is recommended to be conducted routinely at least once per month this routine nature of monitoring will decrease the uncertainties in the results for the parasite measurement moreover by routine monitoring the unexpected extreme events such as heavy rains or floods and also equipment failures in treatment system which may dominate the average risk can be included in the qmra model some sources of uncertainty in the estimation of burden of disease for protozoan parasites are related to parameters including illness to infection ratio iill inf susceptibility fraction factor s severity weight of outcomes sw number of outcomes n and age at death ad some of these parameters may be obtained by referring to epidemiological recorded information for different age groups thus incorporating these age specific parameters in a qmra model may bring the qmra findings closer to the epidemiological observations and may reduce uncertainties in the estimation in the case of current studied system theoretically both ozonation and uv processes can be effective alternatives to reduce the excess risk of cryptosporidium however to select the best process the advantages and limitations of each process should be considered and its actual performance for the parasite inactivation and the reduction of excess risk should be determined moreover employment of an efficient detection method for protozoan parasites to differentiate infective parasite viable oocytes from non infective forms can increase the reliability of risk assessment results epa 1623 1 method is a standard method for quantification of protozoan parasites but as a limitation in the measurement of parasite when this method applies for finished water it requires to pass a high volume 1000 l of water through a filter cartridge this such use not only will increase the duration of sampling time but also can decrease the decompression and then washing capabilities of the foams inside the sampling filter cartridges significantly this may reduce the recovery of method moreover in this study the density of cryptosporidium in finished water was estimated based on statistical assumptions which could increase the uncertainty in results from a policy perspective expressing the adversely health effects of drinking water pathogens in terms of daly s will allow to compare the disease burden attributed to microbial hazards in drinking water to the burdens from other routes of exposure therefore similar qmra studies need to be conducted for other waterborne pathogens then the estimated overall burden of disease attributed to microbial contaminants in drinking water will help the policy maker to implement promotion strategies for drinking water supply system however the qmra tool may not stand alone and to be implemented effectively this tool requires more institutional supports 5 conclusions to ensure that a conventional water treatment system works properly different parameters including ph temperature residual chlorine and cryptosporidium density as a reference pathogen were monitored and the system performance was examined the estimated lrvs for the parasite found to be 2 31 and 0 034 log provided by physico chemical treatment and disinfection processes respectively the applied qmra approach demonstrated that the health based target of 10 4 for the infection risk of cryptosporidium in produced drinking water would be exceeded since chlorine did not meet the 3 log lrv qmra emphasized an urgent need for employment of additional treatments to control this excess risk modification of disinfection system using the employment of alternative disinfectants including clo2 uv and ozone may be needed to control the excess risk of cryptosporidium parasite however to model the inactivation effect of these disinfectants in a qmra scenario the relationships which describe their inactivation performance must be selected cautiously in this study such relationships were presented for ozone clo2 and uv the relationship for ozone provided more consistent results in comparison with the results obtained for clo2 and uv to improve the performance of a conventional water treatment system and to provide a safe water for the public to drink it can be highlighted that a new approach is needed instead of being strongly dependent on chlorine or its derivatives qmra as a risk based approach is such new approach can provide a better understanding of the whole conventional wtp declaration of interests the authors declare that they
